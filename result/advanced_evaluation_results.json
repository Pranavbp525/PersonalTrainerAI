          "response": "Based on the retrieved information, the recommended daily protein intake for muscle growth ranges from .7 to 1 gram per pound of body weight. This means that for an average individual weighing 165-180 lbs, the protein intake should be around 120-180 grams per day to maximize muscle growth. It is important to note that consuming more protein than this range may not provide additional benefits in terms of muscle gains.\n\nHowever, it is also mentioned that consuming slightly more protein, especially when restricting calories, can be beneficial as protein is satiating and can help prevent muscle loss. Therefore, it may be beneficial to aim for the higher end of the recommended range if you are in a caloric deficit or want to be extra cautious.\n\nIn summary, aim to consume around .7 to 1 gram of protein per pound of body weight per day for muscle growth, with a slight increase if you are restricting calories. If you are unsure about your specific protein needs, it is always best to consult with a fitness trainer or nutritionist for personalized advice.",
          "ground_truth": "For muscle growth, consume 1.6-2.2g of protein per kg of bodyweight daily. Athletes and those in intense training may need up to 2.2g/kg. Spread protein intake throughout the day, with 20-40g per meal. Good sources include lean meats, dairy, eggs, and plant-based options like legumes and tofu. Timing protein around workouts (within 2 hours) can enhance muscle protein synthesis.",
