    "transcript": "welcome to the house of hypertrophy is there an optimal Progressive overload method to maximize muscle growth many think Progressive overload is training harder than last time I actually believe this is slightly misleading and I'll describe why a little later nevertheless two common ways to Progressive overload are to either increase the load lifted or increase the number of repetitions performed there's been a brand new study comparing these let us dissect this paper and fit it into the overall scientific research we'll also discuss other potential training strategies you might use to elevate your physique and if increasing sets or training frequency should be considered as Progressive [Music] overload this new paper recruited 39 previously untrained individuals for those disappointed about them being untrained don't worry we'll mention data on trained individuals soon the subjects trained four sets on a unilateral leg extension 2 to three three times per week for 10 weeks with one leg subjects adjusted loads to continuously reach failure in the 9 to 12 rep range every set thus this leg progressively overloaded by increasing load with their other leg they also performed reps to failure each set but they stuck with the same load from the first session so they simply progressively overloaded by increasing reps they progressed from an average of N9 reps per set to 15 reps by the end note the number of dominant legs was equally divided between the conditions and subjects alternated which leg was trained first to every session the fact subjects trained each leg with one of the conditions is great as this means the same subjects were in both conditions therefore differences in genetics nutrition and outside lifestyle are less likely to confound the study strength gains on the leg extension were similar between both conditions we'll talk more about Progressive overloading for strength a little later muscle hypertrophy indicated by vastest lateralis growth was also similar between both conditions suggesting progressively overloading by increasing reps was as effective for muscle growth as increasing load the subjects were previously untrained but we have this 2022 study previously seen at the house of hypy that was conducted on 38 trained individuals subjects perform these lower body exercises using these variables a load group attempted to increase load across sessions while staying in the 8 to 12 rep range a rep group stuck with the same load from the first session and just aimed to perform more reps across the sessions growth of these quadriceps and cve muscle regions was measured and overall growth was similar between both groups so solid data indicates increasing load or reps can be similar for building muscle in both untrained and trained people I'd say there some underappreciated reasoning behind this and this reasoning also links to the multiple different training strategies that are available for you to maximize muscle growth it also links to whether we should consider increasing sets or training frequency as Progressive overload achieving a high level of muscle fiber Recruitment and tension are key for stimulating muscle hypertrophy how is this achieved simply by taking your repetitions to or very close to failure stopping a few reps short of failure can be fine in many cases as seen in our last video by training close to failure we're going to stimulate adaptations these adaptations mean we can do more than we could before we can lift a heavier load for the same number of reps or we can perform more repetitions with the same load in both of these cases we're effectively maintaining being close to failure and by extension we maintain High muscle mus fiber Recruitment and tension so in essence increasing load or reps fundamentally accomplishes the same thing thinking of progressive overload as a cycle works well a hard training session stimulates adaptations these adaptations enable us to increase load or reps and doing this maintains a hard training session considering this Progressive overload isn't really training harder than last time rather Progressive overload Keeps Us training as hard as usual to continually stimulate growth moreover Progressive overload isn't a result of you digging to progressively deeper and deeper depths of effort instead successful Progressive overload is proof gains are happening now there is an important detail we must not neglect the current literature suggest reps between 6 to 35 provided they perform two or close to failure produce similar muscle hypertrophy reps low six probably involve too little time at high tension while reps above 35 probably involve excessive fatigue that impairs muscle fiber Recruitment and tension with this in mind there is only so much you can increase reps if you somehow get to the point of Performing more than 35 reps increasing the load is recommended and overall a combination of both increasing load and Reps over the long term is what's going to happen in most cases for instance exercises involving smaller amounts of muscle mass are harder to Progressive overload and constantly increasing load across your training sessions on these is far from always possible unless you have access to very light micr plates but as many don't adding a rep here or there on these exercises is far more typical with less frequent load increases the same logic applies as you become more trained as the magnitude of adaptations diminishes with more training experience ience adding a rep here or there may be far more common than increasing the load this part isn't related to Progressive overload across training sessions rather it's around the multiple different training strategies you could use in a training session we've mentioned that on average similar muscle hypertrophy can be seen in the 6 to 35 rep range provided you stay in this this opens up many different training paths the most common is to keep the same load across the sets and to train two or their failure in a certain rep range but one alternative as explored in this paper is to decrease the load across sets all subjects trained curls to voluntary failure with these variables on the first set of each exercise all subjects used a 10 rep max load that is a load that can be lifted for 10 maximum repetitions one group kept the same load on the remaining sets a second group actually decreased the load by 5% on the final two sets of each exercise and the third group decreased the load by 10% on the final two sets as subjects were training to failure they would have naturally added reps over time but on top of this 10 rep max strength was retested every 2 weeks to update the training loads all groups ended up seeing similar biceps hypertrophy interestingly the group that decreased the load by 10% despite also training to failure and seeing similar growth subjectively rated their training sessions as being slightly easier you could also increase load across sets resulting in fewer reps in fact this study compared doing just this to another group that trains a little more typically muscle growth was similar between both so the key here is there are many different Pathways to muscle hypertrophy as we defined it Progressive overload maintains training hard to keep stimulating adaptations increasing sets or training frequency doesn't necessarily do this for example say you perform this workout next workout all you do is just add a set nothing else the problem with this is assuming sufficient adaptations were stimulated from the first session those earlier sets are going to be easier and thus less effective the extra set you add predominantly just increases the overall work you're doing it doesn't maintain hard training on the other sets the same applies to increasing workout frequency say you perform this same workout if all you do is add another training session in a week assuming sufficient adaptations were stimulated from the first session all these sets are going to be easier so this extra session is just largely more overall work on top of this this there's only so much you can add sets or training sessions before running into recovery problems none of this is to say you should never ever increase sets or training frequency in fact in October last year we dissected this paper finding adding sets across weeks to extremely high numbers led to Greater muscle growth than performing the same number of sets every week although all groups progressively overloaded by increasing load on their sets and there were crucial details meaning this study isn't proof you have to add sets across weeks but as described in the previous video someone could experiment with this training style if it appeals to them all in all though it is absolutely fine and more common to perform the same number of sets and use the same training frequency every week with perhaps some changes over many months or years if you're searching for further guidance on programming to obtain your desired physique it can can be tricky and time consuming however

mention in the 2022 paper on trained individuals squat strength gains were similar between increasing load and Reps however two technical considerations that I've decided to detail in the pin comment to say in time tell us why these findings are likely a little misleading my current thinking is since strength is generally considered as the maximum load you can lift increasing load is likely going to be better furthermore largely training with heavy loads for fewer than six reps is great for building strength illustrating this these researchers had trained individuals trained these exercises one group adjusted loads to keep training to failure in the two to four rep range while a second group adjusted loads to keep training to failure in the 8 to 12 rep range bench press and back squat strength gains favor training with the two to four reps as they did in this study to keep training hard in lower rep ranges increasing load across training sessions is [Music] needed we mentioned how Progressive overload can be thought of as a cycle hard training produces adaptations these adaptations allow us to increase load or reps and doing this maintains hard training progressively overloading through increasing load or reps has been shown to produce similar muscle growth both in untrained and trained individuals however there are a few reasons that mean over the long term using a combination of both is probably most feasible increasing sets or training frequency predominantly increases the overall work you're performing which has its place but on the their own they do not fit our definition of progressive overload for maximizing strength gains increasing load is likely better than increasing reps thank you for watching feel free to check out the alpha progression app

    "title": "How Often Should You Train a Muscle? - This NEW Study Is Epic",
    "published_at": "2024-12-02T13:00:19Z",
    "transcript": "welcome to the house of hypertrophy should you train a muscle more often in a week to maximize muscle hypertrophy it's been said this allows more frequent elevations in muscle protein synthesis and more time spent in a muscle building state but is this true interestingly this 2013 analysis of 127 competitive bodybuilders reported the majority trained each muscle only once per week bro splits largely involve hitting each muscle once per week other splits like lower splits involve hitting each muscle twice a week and full body involves hitting each muscle three times per week of course there are different variations of these splits and there are other splits or hybrid splits but what does the scientific literature say on this topic a new metaanalysis including 35 studies with over 1,000 subjects has examined the effects of how often you train each muscle in a week on muscle growth this is the same metaanalysis that explored the relationship between volume hypertrophy we dissected in our last video but it had another analysis on frequency let's dive into what they found it's critical to know the researchers examine the impact of training a muscle a different number of times per week when the total number of sets performed for that muscle per week is equated as a simple example imagine we perform nine sets for the biceps in a week perhaps three sets on each the normal creature and incline curl a once per week frequency involves all those nine sets in one session while a three times per week frequency splits those nine sets across three sessions keeping the total weekly sets equated is important since we're trying to isolate the effects of frequency another critical thing is most studies had all subjects perform their sets to or very close to failure within a rep range loads are usually adjusted within and across training sessions to keep reaching within that rep range this is important with our example of Performing nine sets for the biceps all in one session you can imagine fatigue will notably build up such that those later sets are going to likely be using much lighter loads to reach failure in say the 8 to 12 rep range conversely splitting those nine sets across three sessions involves fresher sets we want to see if this leads to higher frequency producing better results the final thing we must not before revealing the results is the researchers examined if there was a superior method for counting training frequency this sounds confusing if you watched our previous volume video this is similar to what they did here but let's see how it applies the training frequency first we need to know the difference between a direct and indirect set a direct set for muscle is a set on an exercise where that muscle is the primary force generator think of the biceps and any biceps curl the tricep in any triceps extension and the chest in most bench pressing exercises an indirect set for a muscle however is a set on an exercise where although that muscle is still fairly trained it's not the primary force generator this could be the biceps in any rowing exercise and the triceps in a wider grip bench press not everyone will agree on what should be a direct and indirect set for each muscle but here's a table showing what the authors considered as direct and indirect sets for each muscle muscle these are the exercises and muscles involved in the data that's why not every muscle and exercise is shown the first method the total method considers both direct and indirect sets equally for example if we train a row on Monday and a biceps curl on Thursday this is a frequency of two times per week for the biceps the second method the fractional method considers indirect sets as half the frequency of direct sets with examp example of rows on Monday and Coes on Thursday this is a frequency of 1.5 times for the biceps the final method the direct method doesn't even consider indirect sets so with our example it would just be a once per week frequency for the biceps the researchers ultimately found that the fractional method performed the best in explaining the data with the evidence being strongly or very strongly in favor of this method this is logical indirect sets answers effective as direct sets for stimulating a muscle which might be why it was better than a total method but indirect sets still provide some degree of stimulus and should therefore still contribute to a muscle frequency which may be why it was better than the direct only method from here remember the frequency numbers you see are calculated with the fractional method with all that out the way here's the relationship between training frequency and muscle hypertrophy found there's no con istant or large effect of frequency there's an increase going from zero to a frequency of once per week which isn't that shocking as zero times per week isn't training at all there was a slight increase when going from Once to twice per week but the credible intervals indicate it's compatible with negligible effects and there's no Crystal Clear benefit of training a muscle even more times per week thus when the total number of weekly sets are equated how often you choose to train a muscle in a week doesn't seem to matter all that much this is consistent with a meta analysis earlier this year suggesting similar hypertrophy between split routines and full body programs the current data also fails to suggest a meaningful difference between trained and previously untrained individuals is there an interaction with set numbers some have fascinatingly suggested the research used too many sets meaning the higher frequency groups were not recovering they say if recoverable volumes were used higher frequencies would be better well the researcher split the studies into those using recoverable and unrecoverable volumes to be recoverable subjects training a muscle three times per week had to be performing no more than three sets for that muscle per session subjects training a muscle twice per week had to be performing no more than five sets for that muscle per session and subjects training a muscle once per week had to be performing no more than 12 sets for that muscle in the session the analyses still fail to demonstrate a clear and large benefit of higher frequencies with either recoverable or unrecoverable volumes in the spirit of scientific accuracy these particular analyses aren't as rigorous as the main model but it just seems like based on the current literature it's challenging to argue that higher frequencies are better when going below a certain number of sets it is also challenging to argue higher frequencies are better when going above a certain number of sets since the unrecoverable studies generally involve higher weekly sets this is notable because others have suggested and I believe extremely logically that training a muscle more times per week is beneficial when we're performing a lot of sets for that muscle for instance if we're performing 15 weekly sets for the biceps you would think performing all of that in one session would be excessively fatiguing such that dividing it across a couple of days leads the higher quality set and thus better growth this is something that I would think to be true and I am genuinely surprised it's not clearly supported by the literature to be clear going from Once to twice a week for a muscle did numerically result in more growth but scientifically speaking we can't say if it's a genuine clear and large effect at least not currently I'll put forth some further ideas in a second but before that I must Circle back to the recoverable values I think the researchers used since these are the values floating around social media however when considering the overall literature and not just a few papers it's within the realm of possibility to recover from doing more than these values suggest this paper had trained individuals perform this program daily for 4 days four sets for the chest and quads were performed per session subjects managed to maintain their bench press and squat performance throughout with actually a slight increase in squat performance on the final day suggesting the capacity to recover in 24 hours from four sets this paper found after trained individuals performed seven sets per muscle the majority recovered 72 hours after this third paper found after trained individuals performed 12 sets for the chest subjects were able to replicate the training session work 72 hours after on average we can even look at long-term studies like this paper which involved untrained individuals performing six sets for the quads three times per week they successfully progressed training loads across the study indicating no serious recovery problems from performing six sets 48 hours apart this paper from last year had well-trained individuals performing 11 sets for the quads twice per week and the data demonstrates they were able to progress loads across the weeks of course there most likely will be differences in recovery capabilities between people I'll return to this point shortly [Music] as seen in previous videos getting to or close to failure and performing a sufficient number of sets are more reliably related to muscle growth in the current literature now frequency has to matter to some degree if you're performing 70 sets for your triceps in one month performing that all in one session per month won't be optimal but when zooming into the 7 Days of a week as we've just seen growth across the different Trading frequencies tends to be similar at least on average this brings me to my next point maybe training frequency is highly individualized if we return to the recovery data we see some people recover faster than others summoning the spirit of scientific accuracy once again this data is technically not designed sufficiently to identify individual differences if you're interested in why I'll link this excellent paper in the description nevertheless I do think it is is the case not everyone has the same recovery abilities due to a variety of different factors this may also include recovery within a training session some might better handle and dissipate fatigue within a training session While others experience a severe drop in performance on later sets these factors could mean some people benefit from training a muscle more often While others might not thus when piling the average results from a range of studies we fail to find clear effects of training frequency now I'm not saying this is definitely true but I consider it a possibility for now but this is what I'd suggest frequency doesn't appear to be the make or break of a training program so it's best to choose a frequency that aligns with your preferences schedule and Recovery capabilities if you're training or experimenting with higher volumes for a muscle it may be practical for most to divide that volume into more days per week recall we did see a numerical although still uncertain increase from Once to twice per week but at worst training a muscle more frequently has a neutral average effect which isn't bad of course throughout your training career you can always experiment with different training frequencies and splits to see if you prefer one over another if you're searching for further guidance on programming to obtain your desired physique it can be tricky and time consuming however our highquality partner the alpha progression app can help help you

    "published_at": "2024-11-18T14:00:00Z",
    "transcript": "welcome to the house of hypertrophy what would you say is the most important training variable for maximizing muscle growth there's a case to be made that volume is up there I'm excited to say we have a brand new meta analysis including 35 studies with over 1,000 subjects that has examined the relationship between volume and muscle hypertrophy it's our best look at it to date before diving into the paper the best way to think about volume for building muscle is simply how many sets you perform and and this is what's meant by volume in the latest meta analysis so what is the relationship between sets and gains do you maximize growth with just a few sets with no further growth with more sets or maybe more sets result in more growth or as a lot of people have hypothesized maybe it's an inverted U shape where more sets result in more growth up to a point Beyond which eventually results in less growth or perhaps it's something else entirely let's Dive In we need to understand what exactly a set is and how the researchers measured it the researchers actually did something never done before in the literature when considering how to count sets and it may change the way you think about counting sets for muscle growth a set refers to a bout of repetitions we're not counting light warm-up sets here rather we're counting what we call a working set which typically has you getting two or very close to failure to make the set as stimulating as possible here were the variables used in the studies behind the newest analysis most studies involved around 10 reps per set also most of these sets were likely perform to failure but the definitions of failure do vary between studies and my assumption is most involved getting to True momentary failure or stopping at most two reps from this failure point which we know from previous videos is likely the Zone we want to be in to maximize the stimulus of a set the researchers analyze the relationship between muscle growth and the total number of sets performed for each muscle group per week what on Earth does this mean and how do you calculate it there are different ways you could do this and the great thing is the researchers aim to determine if a certain method was best to understand the different methods we must know the difference between a direct and indirect set a direct set for a muscle is a set on an exercise where that muscle is the primary force generator think of the biceps and any biceps curl the triceps in any triceps extension and even the chest in most bench pressing exercises an indirect set for muscle however is a set on an exercise where although that muscle is still fairly trained it's not the primary force generator this could be the biceps in any rowing exercise and the triceps in a wider grip bench press make no mistake not everyone is going to agree as to what should be a direct and indirect set for each muscle but here's a table showing what the authors of the latest analysis considered as a direct and indirect set for each muscle these are the exercises and muscles that were involved in the data that's why not every muscle and exercise is shown here the simplest approach used in most previous research is to count both direct and indirect sets as equally contributing to a muscle's total weekly sets this is called the total method for example if we perform three sets of rows on Monday and three sets of standing barbell curs on Thursday both of them equally contribute to a total of six weekly sets for the biceps a more refined approach is to count indir sets as half of direct sets this is the fractional method without three sets of rows and three sets of curls example this would total 4.5 weekly sets for the biceps this isn't necessarily completely objective because you might argue that an indirect set should be less than or more than 0.5 sets in certain scenarios but the author stuck with simply counting all indirect sets as half a set the final more extreme approach doesn't count indirect sets this is the direct only method using our example we just consider there to be three weekly sets for the biceps the researchers ultimately found that the fractional method performed the best in explaining the data with the evidence being strongly or very strongly in favor of this method I'd say this makes sense indirect sets aren't as effective as direct sets for stimulating a muscle which might be why it was better than a total method but indirect set still provide some degree of stimulus and should therefore still contribute to a muscle weekly set count which may be why it was better than the direct only method from here please remember all the total weekly set counts for a muscle you see are calculated with the fractional method that brings us to the results and here was the relationship between weekly sets and muscle growth found the best best fit model was called the square root model which indicates that more volume resulted in more hypertrophy but there were diminishing returns these results are seriously interesting and perhaps surprising to many this is the most extensive analysis on volume for building muscle to date and it failed to find a plateau or even an inverted u based on the current literature growth continually increased up to 43 weekly sets per muscle Group which is an insane amount of volume here's an example of one way to achieve 40 weekly sets for just your biceps this is an incredible amount of training again just for the biceps so do these results mean you can take your gains to the next level by increasing your volume it's not a guarantee there are absolutely some crucial things we need to keep in mind so you know what these results May mean for you firstly we shouldn't ignore the diminishing returns that is in the same way that continually squeezing an orange produces less and less juice but forming more and more sets produces less extra growth in fact here's a graph depicting the diminishing returns we can see those initial sets you perform give you a great return and although there's still additional growth with more sets it becom substantially diminished the authors's approximate the later sets are onethird as stimulative as the initial sets we can see the credible intervals demonstrate greater uncertainty once we get above 25 weekly sets per muscle indeed as the authors say there aren't as many studies that have explored more than 25 weekly sets per muscle group moreover I'm actually aware of two studies not officially published yet failing to find more growth with super high volumes for these reasons I believe we would be making a big mistake if we thought this model was the final word on volume and hypertrophy especially when considering the relationship above 25 weekly sets we may eventually find a plateau somewhere this brings us to a topic that is fiercely debated across the internet swelling some argue the extra growth seen with very high volumes is not actually real muscle growth rather its muscle swelling muscles can temporarily increase in size due to fluid buildup that could be related to damage most studies behind this data measured muscle growth 48 to 72 hours after the final training session but the thing is we do have evidence that after a training session with a decent amount of volume muscle swelling May persist at least up to 72 hours so does this mean swelling clouds the data not necessarily the research that finds swelling can last for days do so after a single training session that the subjects have never performed before there's evidence that as you continue training with the same program your body produces adaptations that reduce damage and swelling this is called the repeated bout effect effect some say the repeated bout effect isn't that powerful but the strongest study to date would suggest otherwise it had previously untrained individuals perform five sets of 15 maximal eccentric only leg extensions once per week for 10 weeks maximal eccentric only training is no joke the data shows this as measures of damage and fatigue remained for at least 5 days after the first training session swelling was unfortunately not measured nonetheless across 10 weeks of training the measures of damage and fatigue became less and less subjects were recovered around a day or two after the session in the final week thus the repeated bout effect May substantially reduce the likelihood that researchers are measuring swelling after a training program moreover we currently don't have any studies comparing swelling between different volumes and it's possible higher volumes do not cause greater swelling than moderate volumes in the first place for these Reasons I'm not currently convinced swelling certainly confounds this data there are actually some studies coming soon that may further shed light onto this we'll update you at the house of hypoy if anything changes we've discussed previously at the house of hypertrophy how rest intervals possibly impact the relationship between sets and hypertrophy let me explain rest intervals are the time you take to rest between sets during training sessions it may come as a surprise to some but a few suggest longer rest between sets could be better for building muscle when set numbers are equated for example this study found when performing three sets on the leg press per session quad hypertrophy was greater when resting for 3 minutes between sets compared to 1 minute however performing approximately five sets on the leg press per session with one minute of rest between sets ultimately produce similar quad gains to the three sets with 3 minutes of Rest In other words more sets with shorter rest intervals could produce similar hypertrophy to fewer sets with longer rest intervals accordingly it's possible that higher volumes are more beneficial when using shorter rest between sets and not as beneficial when using longer rest between sets the latest analysis actually had a moderat analysis that indeed found M growth plateaued earlier with fewer sets when 3 minutes of rest between sets was used compared to 1 minute at first glance this seems like clear proof that higher volumes are only beneficial when using short rests however as the the authors describe the moderator analysis should be viewed with caution as there's not much strong data behind it they view it as exploratory further more if we accept these results we would also have to accept that very high sets with one minute rest intervals ultimately lead to the best hypertrophy which is a conclusion hard to currently justify it is also worth mentioning that the data suggesting longer rest between sets could be superior for building muscle largely used compound exercises with smaller isolation exercises some data suggest shorter rest between sets may be no less effective ultimately we need more studies to examine how the relationship between set and hypertrophy differs depending on rest intervals we'll have some recommendations in a second but before that there are a few other moderator analyses that some may find interesting the relationship between weekly sets and hypertophy was fairly similar between trained and untrained individuals as well as between 21 and 35y old individuals and the positive relationship between volume and hypertrophy remained when looking at shorter and longer duration studies but once again view these moderator analyses with caution here's what I'd recommend based on this data know that hypertrophy can be achieved with lower volumes so if you dislike or cannot train with more sets for practical reasons know that it's still possible to achieve a respectable chunk of gains if you're happy to train more in attempt to maximize muscle growth people who take the latest data at face value would say to get as close to 40 weekly sets per muscle group as you can but given the crucial considerations we've overviewed I wouldn't go that far we also mustn't forget these are averages you need to consider your individual situation and lifestyle but this is what I'd suggest I'd first ensure you're maximizing your training quality this means selecting exercises that are ideal for growing among muscle training hard enough and optimizing your rest between sets we have videos at the house viery that can help you understand what the literature says on these topics and we are working on free ultimate guides on the exercises that are possibly the most favorable for training each muscle group with your training quality optimized I would then suggest performing as much volume as you can personally and practically handle consistently if I had to guess I think this will probably be around 10 to 20 weekly sets per month musle group for most people of course you can always experiment around if you're making minimal progress and feeling burnt out try doing less alternatively if you feel your body is ready you can experiment with performing closer to or more than 20 weekly sets per muscle group also remember that you don't necessarily have to perform identical set numbers for every muscle group it may be most feasible to experiment with super high volumes with only a few or even one muscle group this is called muscle group specialization in fact one Study last year that found a benefit to super high volumes even when using longer rest between sets did so when only training the quads with this volume I also recommend gradually progressing to super high volumes I suspect this more effectively prepares your body for handling this High quantity of training before moving on to the summary some may be wondering about training frequency as well as if there's a limit to the number of sets you can perform per session and glad to say we'll have updated videos on these topics as there's new research on them coming [Music] soon in summary the most extensive analysis on volume 4 hypertrophy today has some pretty intriguing findings firstly using the fractional method to count volume outperform the total or direct only method if you skip to the summary and are confused as to what this means head back to this time Point secondly the analysis suggests more sets result in more growth but there are diminishing returns those initial sets provide a great return so it's possible to see respectable gains without high volumes in the spirit of scientific accuracy these results are based on the current literature but the current literature isn't Flawless there are just a few studies exploring more than 25 weekly sets per muscle and there are questions remaining about the influence of other things such as rest interval durations this all leads me to be extremely be cautious in definitively concluding that super high volumes are superior better quality data is needed and I know some are on the way currently my recommendation is to maximize your training quality and then perform as much volume as you can personally and practically handle then make adjustments as you see fit if you're constantly feeling burnt out with minimal progress experiment with lower volumes or if you're feeling as though you could do more feel free to experiment with higher volumes before in up navigating all the fitness advice out there can be challenging

    "transcript": "welcome to the house of hypertrophy how should you train your side dels for maximum growth I'm glad to say we have the first ever study measuring sidel hypertrophy and its findings are pretty interesting it compared dumbbell to cable lateral raises in previous videos due to the emerging research on training muscles at longer lengths we've speculated that cables could be better due to applying higher tension when the side dels are at a longer length but is this true 24 trained individuals with an average of 7.1 years of experience were recruited each subject had one arm randomly assigned to train dumbbell lateral raises and the other arm assigned to train cable lateral raises interestingly the researchers had subjects use cuffs to minimize grip fatigue this design of all subjects training both exercises is great as differences in genetics nutrition and outside lifestyle factors are less likely to conf found the findings I've said it before but it's not like your right arm eats more protein or sleeps more than your left arm with both the dumbbell and cable subjects moved from 0 to 90\u00b0 of shoulder abduction straight out to the sides in what's known as The frontal plane some subjects did have pain so instead both exercises were raised in between the frontal and scap planes the cable was positioned so that the arm and cable formed a roughly 90\u00b0 angle at the start this results in the exercise being hardest at this position where the side dels are at a longer length with the dumbbells we know they provide the greatest challenge when the arms are straight out where the side dels are at a relatively shorter length they train two times per week for 8 weeks each exercise was trained with five sets per session with repetitions to momentary muscular failure in the 12 to 16 rep range with Progressive overload applied to stay in this rep range across sessions sidel thickness was measured at a proximal and distal region it was ultimately found that growth in both regions was similar between both excises therefore as the authors note the findings suggest both dumbbells and cables present similarly effective options for eliciting hypertrophy of the side dels in trained individuals before describing how this study may fit into the overall literature on training muscles at long length in the spirit of scientific accuracy we need to keep some things in mind mind firstly a single study is never definitive proof let's say we have a coin with a 50% chance of landing on heads although unlikely it's still possible to flip heads five times in a row which may lead you to think this coin is biased towards heads but as we flip it more times things will eventually reflect the truth in the same way a single study can find things that don't reflect reality due to chance so additional studies are necessary to know we're on the right track nevertheless L this study is certainly a data point suggesting no meaningful difference between a dumbbell and cable lateral Rays secondly the amount of hypertrophy seen by both conditions was fairly small and not far off measurement error this isn't too surprising as we're dealing with an 8we study on already well-trained individuals so we can't rule out the possibility this study was underpowered to detect potentially small growth differences between the exercises thirdly remember range of motion was the the same between the dumbbells and cables but you can actually bring your arm across your body with cables to lengthen the side delts even more it remains possible doing this does yield greater growth we don't know at least not yet fourth and finally participants aim to maintain a similar rep Tempo but both conditions increased acceleration out the bottom as they approached failure with the dumbbells this will increase the tension at longer side out lengths whether this influenced the end ings is up to debate when considering the literature on training muscles at long versus short lengths I think we should split the data into three categories resistance challenge range of motion and biarticular muscles with resistance challenge with all else equal we're comparing exercises that are harder at longer versus shorter lengths and the new lateral raise data belongs to this category the only only other study in this category was conducted on untrained subjects in 2020 comparing barbell preacher Co which are harder near the start of the curl where the biceps are at a longer length to Cable preacher curs which are harder later in the curl where the biceps are relatively shorter similar to the sidel data this study failed to find any difference as biceps growth measured around the mid region was comparable between both exercises as for the range of motion category with any given exercise you can train with a full range motion which moves the joints through the largest capacity possible a shorten partial which moves through the halfway the muscle is at a shorter length or a lengthen partial which moves through the halfway the muscle is at a longer length it was once thought a full range motion was best but this was predominantly based on comparisons with short and partials three studies all un untrained individuals fascinatingly found length and partials built over R more muscle than a full range of motion however two studies in 2024 on trained individuals including a paper on just under 300 subjects that I detailed in our 2024 summary largely found length and partials to be similar to a four range motion this isn't case closed due to some nuances but it does seem clear that length and partials are not unequivocally Superior and both of full range motion and length and partial are options on the table with biarticular muscles these are muscles that cross over two joints with these muscles we can change the position of one of the joints to lengthen the muscle more for example the rectus morus is the only head of the quads that crosses both the knee and hip the rest of the Quad heads just cross the knee leaning back on the leg extension which puts the hip joint in a more extended position lengthens the rectus humorous part of the quads this grew the rectus humorus more the normal leg extensions in one study while growth of the vastest lateralis which is trained at the same length between both was similar many probably don't think about it in this way but it also applies to the gastrous heads of the calves which cross both the ankle and knee compared to Bent legal raises straight legal raises have our knees extended which lengthens the gastroc nmia heads and two papers found better gastrous growth with a straight leg while Solus growth which is trained at the same length between both was similar similar Concepts May apply to the biceps triceps and hamstrings however nearly all of these Studies have been done on untrained individuals does it apply to trained individuals the spirit of scientific accuracy would haunt me if I said I was certain so I'm not certain but my suspicion is this is the category where trained individuals will see better growth from long longer muscle lengths indeed one of the papers finding straight leg Cal raises built the gnus more involved trained individuals moreover this study on competitive bodybuilders found they experienced greater overall rectus moris activity with leaning and lying back leg extensions versus normal leg extensions the measure of activity used in this paper has been found to relate to muscle growth in a few studies so right now it tentatively seems except for the B Artic and muscle category making the exercise harder at longer muscle lengths as well as using a length and partial May largely not be superior in trained individuals but they crucially do not appear to be any worse either so you have the freedom to choose what works best for you all of this is very much a developing area of research the quantity of quality research we're getting is increasing in 2024 we had seven studies relating to training at different muscle lengths with for being the first ever set of studies on trained individuals directly measuring hypertrophy in this area I'm excited to see how our knowledge progresses in this area and other areas of muscle growth it can be frustrating because we desperately want to know everything now but we do know a lot more than 20 years ago and if the literature has shown anything so far it is that there are many different parts to Growing muscle for example if we provisionally accept the findings of the latest study if you've been training with dumbbell collateral raises you haven't been missing out whereas if you've been training with cables you still haven't been missing out all in all it's pretty hard to do something tragically wrong so don't be afraid to experiment around with things in your own training training hard with enough volume and consistency are the most important things for building muscle considering the conflicting information across the web things can get pretty confusing about how you may want to train I hope the video is at the house of per Fe go some way

    "title": "Cheat Reps vs Strict Reps (NEW Study)",
    "published_at": "2025-01-21T13:00:00Z",
    "transcript": "welcome to the house of hypertrophy after Decades of research on lifting weights we finally have the first ever study on [Music] this cheat Reps versus strick Reps for muscle hypertrophy proponents of strict technique may hypothesize cheating via external momentum disperses tension to other muscle groups and possibly lowers activation of the main muscles we're trying to Target but is this true [Music] 25 previously untrained individuals were recruited they trained unilateral dumbbell curls and push Downs two times per week for 8 weeks one arm was randomly assigned to cheat on all repetitions while the other arm used strict technique on all repetitions to cheat with the curl participants were instructed to swing the weight up and use external momentum to lift the weight as many times as possible until they reached failure with the push down they used external momentum and were permitted to flare the elbows and use leg drive until they could no longer perform more repetitions as for the strict reps the curl was performed with a stationary body position without any swinging they simply flexed the elbow until they could no longer complete another strict rep the same applies to the push down an upright torso with movement just occurring at the elbow until they could no longer extend their elbow down with strict technique the study supplementary material provides instructional videos that the subject saw every session four sets of 8 to 12 reps were performed and as we mentioned those reps were taken to failure for both conditions loads were adjusted across time to stay in this rep range regular viewers will know this research design of having every subject train both conditions is becoming more common in the literature there are always a few critiques of this design I see pop up so I'll quickly address them people can have one arm stronger than the other but remember we're not looking at the results of one person we're looking at the average results of two conditions which typically have a similar number of dominant arms some people think that training one arm can directly cause growth in the opposite arm but this isn't quite true what is true is that training one arm can cause strength gains in the opposite arm so this study design is not appropriate for measuring strength but it is acceptable for measuring hypertrophy there are also key advantages to this study design having 25 subjects each train both conditions is like having 50 subjects assigned to train either one of the conditions in fact it's even better since by having the same subjects in both conditions differences in genetics nutrition and outside lifestyle factors are less likely to confound the findings muscle thickness of the elbow flexors consisting of the biceps and brachialis and triceps were measured at 55% and 65% regions it was found that increases in all regions were similar between both conditions thus as the authors describe the use of external momentum neither helped nor hindered hypertrophy of the target muscles these findings are truly fascinating and may surprise a number of you so is that the death of strick Reps for hyper y since they provided no growth advantage over cheating not necessarily many suggest there are other concerns with cheating safety and tracking progression before critically analyzing these two points in the spirit of scientific accuracy we must not let a few key considerations slip our minds the authors mention it was tricky to standardize form with the cheat reps so not all subjects cheated identically it is not implausible that certain cheating styles are worse than others but this will be tricky to establish remember this study wasn't designed to examine cheat reps as an intensity technique what I mean is you can perform strict reps but then start to cheat as you approach failure to perform more total reps than you could otherwise whether this has any worthwhile Advantage remains to be tested note cheat reps are the only way to push past typical failure as the quality and quantity of research we're getting nowadays is increasing I am optimistic we'll see valuable research on these methods besides that science is ultimately a cumulative process relying on multiple studies to build a comprehensive understanding of a given topic and get us closer to the truth the single study at hand just involved untrained individuals training only their biceps and triceps for 8 weeks things could be different with any one of these variables altered some may be tempted to completely ignore this study since on untrained individuals since they claim untrained individuals grow equally from anything under the sun while it is undeniably true we cannot be certain findings on untrained individuals will extend to trained individuals it is not true untrained individuals grow equally from everything the literature is abundant with examples of untrained individuals growing more with one thing over another a few of our videos illustrate this so studies on untrained individuals are certainly not useless and at the end of the day it is an informative data point suggesting similar effects between cheat and strict reps I should also reveal that none other than Jeff nippard has stated he'll be involved with a cheat rep study on trained individuals so what about safety and tracking progression 30 individuals were originally recruited but five dropped out however none of these five dropped out due to injury as the authors describe we don't have strong direct evidence that using external momentum increases injury risk but absence of evidence is not necessarily evidence of absence whether things would change with a longer time frame or more subjects is a question left unanswered for now as for Progress the cheat condition unsurprisingly trained with heavier weights but both conditions progress throughout the intervention that said the complication when cheating is as difficult to UNT Le how much of your progression is driven by you just cheating more when maintaining strict technique you have more confidence lifting heavier for the same number of reps is due to you getting stronger which is Assurance you're making gains cheat rep proponents may say they're uninterested in untangling what's causing them to lift heavier loads if they're fundamentally seeing no less growth ultimately visual changes over the longterm and the general notion that they'll eventually be lifting a load that would have been impossible for them to cheat with back in the day is all that's needed I think that is a fair perspective but I know there are many who prefer consistent Assurance of progress provided with strict technique some individuals thinking outside the box may consider this as a paper on training at long muscle lengths in Disguise take the normal biceps curl when cheating and Swinging the way up you likely increase the tension seen earlier in the curl where the biceps are at a longer length compared to using a stricter technique with a standard Tempo since growth was similar between both you may suggest increasing the demands at longer muscle lengths isn't advantageous however since we do have other variables in the mix and it's difficult to know precisely how much tension differed at longer lengths I wouldn't consider it an ideal study for answering if challenging muscles at longer lengths benefits hypertrophy I'll also add that as described in our previous video I believe we should divide the muscle length literature into different categories and as this may tell us when and where training muscles at longer lengths can be beneficial in this case changing where the muscle is challenged the most in the motion belongs to the resistance challenge category we don't have a lot of studies in this category but the ones we do have fail to show any real benefit of making the exercise harder at longer muscle lengths anyway feel free to check out the video for more details so can we say cheat reps are as good as strick reps more evidence in wider context and perhaps some kind of Investigation of its safety is necessary before we can be sure I still think it makes sense for stricter technique to be the default but depending on how you feel this study could loosen the strictness you may have towards your reps it's likely not the end of the world if some degree of deviation and momentum creeps into your set if you're searching for further guidance on programming to obtain your desired physique it it

    "published_at": "2024-08-26T13:00:07Z",
    "transcript": "welcome to the house of hypertrophy are your exercises enough to optimize growth across regions of a muscle can a muscle even grow unevenly across its regions many say it can't but it can multiple scientific studies demonstrate muscles do not always grow evenly across its regions and there are potentially two key takeaways many are probably unaware of this fascinating data today we'll dissect this to understand what this may and may not mean for developing an overall a itic physique we'll also mention some interesting new research on the biceps later on let's dive in what comes to your mind when I say Regional muscle hypertrophy classically people think about the shape of a muscle such as how some people have biceps with a high peak and others with longer biceps if you have one or the other could you train to change this unfortunately no compelling evidence suggest this precisely is possible however it does appear that the proximal middle and distal regions of a muscle do not always grow uniformly for those unaware proximal refers to the region of a muscle closer to its origin while the distal is the part further away from the origin the middle region is of course in between now unequal growth across these regions does technically cause a change in the shape of the muscle but we'll address later if this is enough to be visually meaningful let's start with the Intriguing range of motion literature there are generally three range of motions a full range of motion moves the joints in the exercise to the fullest potential such as fully extending and bending the elbow during a curl a partial at short length partially moves through the range where the muscle is at a shorter length such as the top part of a curl a partial at long length partially moves through the part where the muscle is at a longer length such as the bottom part of a curl we have a couple of studies comparing and growth across the regions of a muscle between different range of motions and there seems to be a consistent pattern this paper compar full range of motion to partial at Short lengths on the leg extension growth of the vastest lateralis at the proximal portion lean towards the full range of motion growth at the middle region was fairly similar and growth at the distal region was considerably better with the full range motion this idea that full range of motion may be considerably better for the distal regions was also found with a squat in this paper one group squatted to 120\u00b0 of knee flexion while a second squatted to 60\u00b0 the partial at short length only grew the proximal regions of the thigh and actually lost size at the distal regions the 120\u00b0 squats grew all regions fairly similarly and so the biggest difference between the two was again at the distal regions you may be questioning how it's possible for the partial to slightly lose some size I'll likely expand on this in a future video but there's evidence that certain muscle parts can decrease in size even when training anyhow what about partials at long lengths this study compared partials at long to short lengths on the leg extension growth across all three regions of the vastest lateralis favored the long length partials but it was only statistically significant and considerably different at the distal region so similar to a fullrange motion partials at long lengths also seem to produce considerably better distal region growth when compared to partials at Short lengths we've seen this with the biceps to this study compared partials at long to short lengths on the preacher curl growth at the middle region of the biceps was actually similar between both while growth at the distal region was better with the partials at long lengths are there any differences between a partial at long length and full range of motion we've mentioned previously at the house of hper that three Studies have compared them and all of them fascinatingly find overall more hypertrophy with partials at long lengths but only one examined growth across different muscle regions this paper involved training the leg extension with either a for range motion partial at long length and partial at short length and growth was measured across four regions of the vastus lateralis and rectus florus with the vastest lateralis consistent with the research we've seen the partial at Short lengths produced produce notably lower growth at the 60 and 70% regions but were fairly decent at growing the 40 and 50% regions when focusing on the comparison between the partial at long length to full range motion the biggest difference was the partial at long length tended to produce better growth at the 60 and especially 70% regions with the rectus forus again consistent with the research we've seen the partials at sh lengths produce notably lower growth at the 60 and 70% regions but were fairly decent at growing the 40 and 50% regions when focusing on the comparison between the partial at long length to full range motion we can actually see that in all regions the growth favored the long length partials with the biggest difference at the 50 and 70% regions there's not strong enough evidence to say if partials at long lengths always beat out a full range of motion yet all three Studies have been done on previously untrained subjects and there are many exercises that haven't been explored yet but as this early evidence is promising you could experiment with long length partials if you like anyhow the main point is the range of motion research clearly shows muscles do not always grow evenly across their regions and there's a pattern short length partials decently grow the proximal and middle regions of a muscle and we've seen sometimes it produces similar growth of these regions to a full range of motion or partial at long length however partials at Short lengths fail to optimize growth at the distal regions and sometimes result in essentially no growth at these regions many might not have been expecting this and may have been hoping for a precise method to optimize growth at each region we are about to detail how different excises impact growth across regions but here's the Practical takeaway for this section if your goal is to maximally grow all regions of course a full range of motion or even partial at long length is recommended but you could say that if for whatever reason you wanted to keep down growth at the distal part of a muscle a partial at short length may do this successfully remember this research was done on the quads or biceps but my best guess is it probably applies to other muscles for example the PEX distal region is near the arm while the proximal region is near the sternum and clavicle perhaps partials at Short lengths do well at developing the proximal and middle regions but are not as effective as a full range of motion or partial at long length for the distal regions likewise the lat distal region is near the arm while the proximal region is closer to the spine perhaps partials at Short lengths do well at developing the proximal and middle regions but are not as effective as a full range of motion or partial at long length for the distal regions this is speculation as there's no direct research on this yet hopefully this changes soon also all of these studies lasted a few months so it's difficult to say what happens after years for example if with a leg extension one person trained with short length partials and another with long length partials for years my best guess is you may visually see the differences with a partial at long length resulting in comparatively more pronounced development especially at the distal regions yet as there's no long-term studies I would be lying if I said I was certain [Music] another area of the research showing muscles do not always grow equally across its regions is the exercise comparison literature much of this has been done on biarticular muscles which are muscles that cross over two joints these are the main biarticular muscles for example the biceps cross the shoulder and elbow joints as alluded to in the introduction there's actually some exciting new research on the biceps that I'll reveal in a second but let's start with the quads we recently covered this study comparing leaning back to normal leg extensions all four quad heads cross the knee joint but the rectus florus is by articular as it also crosses the hip joints leaning back places the rectus foror specifically at a longer length that is it stretch more and this resulted in more proximal and distal region hypy compared to the normal leg extensions but notice that the biggest difference between the two exercises was at the proximal region further demonstrating how muscle growth can be unevenly distributed similar logic applies to the hamstrings three of the four hamstring muscles are by articular as they cross the knee and hip they are at a longer length with CA leg holes compared to lying leg holes the researchers only looked at proximal and distal region growth of two of the biarticular hamstring muscles both experienced better proximal and distal region hypertrophy with the c leol but again the biggest difference between the two exercises tended to be at the proximal regions as for the biceps data I hinted at this abstract has been revealed it's not published yet but it compared incline CO's to preacher CO's incline CO's plac the biceps at a starting longer length than preacher CO's the abstract tells us that overfall biceps hypertrophy was greater with the incline curl with the authors mentioning the biggest difference was at the proximal regions regular viewers who've seen our previous videos on the biceps may have a ton of questions but once this study is officially published I'll share all my thoughts but for now I do think incline curls are up there as one of the best biceps exercises so in total it seems that compared to training a biarticular muscle at a shorter length training at a longer length builds more muscle with larger differences at the proximal regions this could possibly apply to the triceps and gastrus too but it's not super clear based on the data we have this requires a bit of explaining so if you're interested check out the pin comment where I fully detail the research and my thoughts on Regional hypertrophy with these muscles summoning the spirit of scientific accuracy this idea of larger differences at the proximal region between training by articular muscles at long versus short lengths is based on three studies so I don't want to pretend this is an established fact yet Perhaps there's other unknown details for example example could some sort of threshold exist for instance leaning back leg extensions produced more overall growth than normal leg extensions but lying down leg extensions lengthen the rectus foror even more than leaning back but does it produce more growth it might not as this study found although lying leg extension successfully resulted in more activation especially at the proximal and middle regions compared to normal leg extensions it wasn't any more effective than leaning back if anything its activation was actually slightly lower with lying down we are working on guides to developing each muscle with a few already published these will flesh out more details about exercise recommendations so feel free to check these out and stay tuned for more updated content I'll also add that if you have any questions or confusions I'll do my best to respond in the comments similar to the discussion on range of motion these results might not have been what you wanted perhaps some of you want a certain exercise exercise to grow one region and another exercise to grow a different region but this doesn't seem to be the case rather the simple takeway is ensuring you have exercises that trained by articular muscles at longer lengths is probably a solid idea however you could alternatively say if for whatever reason the extra proximal region growth is not desired training by articular muscles at Short lengths could be useful though we've seen they are also sometimes less effective for distal growth too as some final words if you're a regular viewer of the House of hopy the information here may not have necessarily changed your training but I nonetheless hope it helps understand your own training or just your general knowledge on muscle hypertrophy in some way plus I still think this research is pretty underrated as many still believe muscles grow evenly across all regions it can be tricky and very challenging to construct your own muscle building program but the AL progression app which is essentially your personal clever muscle building assistant in the palm of your hand can easily help you with hundreds of thousands of downloads thousands of reviews speak to its unmatched quality

    "published_at": "2024-12-23T13:00:04Z",
    "transcript": "welcome to the house of hypertrophy what are the most important training variables for maximizing hypertrophy as 2024 comes to a close I thought it would be nice to review some excellent research this year on key topics like training to failure optimal range of motion and ideal set volume if you're a new viewer welcome this will be a great summary of the year if you're a regular viewer this will help refresh your knowledge B also introduced new research not discussed previously including a fresh paper on training to failure and a study on lengthened partials on just under 300 subjects for your ease the timestamps note where fresh new data is detailed let's dive straight [Music] in training close to failure is crucial for maximizing muscle fiber Recruitment and tension but do we need to always train to failure this year we saw the best design study on this topic to date involving trained individuals with the highest average experience in the failure research participants trained unilateral leg extensions and leg presses one leg trained to momentary muscular failure while the other leg stopped one rep from failure on the leg extension and two reps from failure on the leg press pre-study tests indicated subjects fairly accurately estimated their proximity to failure and here's footage of a subject going to failure and leaving two reps in reserve on the leg press ultimately quad gains were similar between both suggesting stopping one to two rep short of failure may be sufficient for hypertrophy a conclusion supported by other well-designed studies however as detailed in our full breakdown of this study the influence of set numbers is worth considering in the just detailed study participants maintain their pre-study quad volume with a 20% increase Midway this resulted in subjects performing between 10 to 17 weekly sets for the quads some hypothesis Iz though that training to failure might be more beneficial when performing fewer sets I'm glad to say a brand new study explored this 42 trained individuals perform this program two times a week with just one set on each exercise thereby totaling these low weekly sets for each muscle one group took each set to momentary muscular failure while another group aimed to stop with two reps in reserve analyses indicated subjects reasonably estimated how far from failure they were accuracy was high on the bench press versus Squat and they improve their accuracy across time on the bench press ultimately while the differences were not statistically conclusive the raw numbers lean towards training to failure for most measurements except the biceps which could be due to chance another study a few years back found with one set per exercise failure tended to produce better growth outcomes than stopping shy of failure so in total though this is by no means case closed the early evidence May IND deed suggest with low volumes training to failure provides some growth Advantage whereas when training with a higher number of sets stopping just short of failure May largely be [Music] similar what is the optimal range of motion for building muscle a brand new study adds to this literature firstly a full range of motion moves the joints through the largest capacity possible a short and partial move through the halfway the muscle is at a shorter length while lengthened partial moves through the half where the muscle is at a longer length it was long believed a 4in motion was superior but this was based on comparisons with shorten partials some data in the last few years found lengthen partials build overall more muscle than a full range motion however these studies were done on untrained individuals just training either the car raate leg extension or a hip extension exercise what about trained individuals and other exercises that brings us to the bra new study on just under 300 subjects with at least 6 months of experience this was a randomized traal done across 15 different locations subjects trained this two-day a week program for 12 weeks performing just one set to momentary failure per exercise one condition trained with a full range of motion on everything while another condition trained the highlighted exercises with a lengthened partial but a full range motion on the non-h highlighted exercises increases in arm and thigh muscle area were fundamentally not different between both suggesting lengthen partials may just be similarly effective to a full range motion the strength of this study was the incredibly large number of subjects however arm and thigh area were estimated from circumference and skinfold measurements which have limitations although the authors took steps to reduce this as much as possible the subjects were also not necessarily highly trained the length and partials weren't deployed on all exercises and the overall volume of training was low nevertheless we did have another study a few months ago funded by none other than Jeff nippard 25 individuals with an average of 4.9 years of experience performed this program one side of their body trained with a full-range motion on everything while the other side of their body trained with length and partials on everything increases in elbow flexor and triceps growth were similar reinforcing the idea lengthen parti may just be similar to a full range Motion in trained individuals summoning the spirit of scientific accuracy consideration still exist one hypothesis suggest lengthened partials may only be beneficial with exercises typically most challenging at Short muscle lengths including C raises rows lateral raises leg hoses and leg extensions indeed recall two of the studies on untrained individuals finding greater horty with length and partials use car phrases and leg extensions but the latest study on trained individuals did involve leg extensions and did not support the superiority of lengthen partials although another hypothesis is that lengthened partials only specifically benefit the distal regions of a muscle in both of these studies on trained individuals growth was just measured around the middle regions of a muscle meaning we cannot be certain how distal region growth compared more research is needed to clarify these nuances I'll also brief ly add that some shorten partials are completely ineffective yet they still build muscle and in some studies not all shorten partials actually grow specific regions of a muscle similarly to a full range of motion and lengthen partial a deeper dive into range of motion and the potential utility of shorts and partials is on my to-do list all in all its clear range of motion is not the most important variable for growing you can grow with all types of range of motions but my current take is if you're trying to maximize overall hypertrophy both a full range of motion and length and partial are viable options so pick your preference a mixture of both in your overall program is not impossible [Music] either how many sets should you perform this year we saw the largest analysis on this to date generally suggesting higher set numbers build more muscle but fascinatingly strength strength gains were maximized with much lower set numbers why did I bring up this strength data it is just interesting to know the results but I've also seen it argued since muscle growth is an increase in contractile units more muscle should result in Greater strength but as we see a plateau in strength much earlier surely the growth with higher set numbers is just muscle swelling not real growth in the original video I dissected whether we have enough evidence to say swelling is certainly confounding the data we don't in fact there's evidence muscle swelling post training can decrease notably as you continue with a program so what's going on with the strength data I would like to credit a fantastic article by Greg Knuckles from Stronger by science simply put using strength data to infer hypertrophy is not a great idea feel free to pause and read why the key is that under the conditions being studied it absolutely should not be surprising for strength and hypertrophy results to differ one excellent example is that any deficits appear to reduce lean mass gains but not necessarily strength gains so should you aim for very high set numbers to build muscle well remember there were diminishing returns those initial sets give you a great return while those later sets yield progressively smaller benefits so it is certainly possible to grow respectably without a turn of sets plus the credible intervals indicate more uncertainty Beyond 25 weekly sets per Master group indeed there are a limited number of of studies exploring these kinds of volumes so a true Plateau could emerge with future research in fact an individual study published just this month found no additional growth with higher set numbers I intend to dissect this soon and have a more comprehensive video on set numbers exploring other ideas such as whether things change as you become more advanced for now my general recommendation is to maximize your training quality ensure you're training hard enough and selecting exercises that are ideal for growing among muscle then perform as much as you can personally and practically handle I would guess this Force around 12 to 20 weekly sets per muscle group for most people but experimenting with more or fewer sets based on your judgment can be [Music] worthwhile before wrapping up let's briefly touch on some interesting muscle physiology research this year some researchers have begun exploring if muscles compete with each other for growth name mely does your bicep see the best growth if the only thing you did was train the biceps when training your full body perhaps some of that biceps growth is instead diverted to support the growth of all your other muscles a fascinating study this year though limited found that some muscles that weren't trained actually decrease in size possibly to support the growth of the trained muscles this was more pronounced when calorie and protein intake were lower if true dedicating periods to specialize in certain and muscles while reducing emphasis on others could accelerate their growth This research is still in its infancy so while nothing is certain yet I'm excited to see how it evolves another paper published this year provides insight into muscle hyperplasia while muscle hypertrophy is established which is an increase in the size of individual muscle fibers whether hyperplasia which is an increase in the number of fibers occurs is debated studying this in humans is challenging humans have upwards of hundreds of thousands of fibers in each muscle and there's no simple way to precisely measure this but this study used an indirect equation for muscle fiber number estimates they compared a group of trained individuals to a matched group of untrained individuals it found that the trained individuals had 70% larger muscles which involved both larger individual fiber sizes but also a greater number of muscle fibers suggesting both hypertrophy and hyperplasia contribute to the greater overall muscle size though this is just a cross-sectional study with estimations for fiber numbers I'm hopeful that as technology improves we'll see research that can causally determine if lifting weights really increases fiber numbers over time there's even more excellent research this year that's too much to fit all in this video from Progressive overload to quad

    "transcript": "[Music] welcome to the house of hypertrophy how many reps do you perform should you train with lower moderate or higher reps to maximize muscle hypertrophy I've seen some increasingly common suggestions that there is actually an ideal rep zone for building muscle While others say this is a myth fascinatingly a survey of 127 competitive bodybuilders found the majority tended to train with 7 to 12 reps of course this doesn't necessarily mean 7 to 12 reps is optimal what does the overall scientific literature say on this topic in this video I'll summarize the entire literature on rep Rangers for building muscle we'll answer as many questions as possible I've had previous videos on this topic but I wanted to have a video that summarizes and combines everything so you're aware of all aspects of the rep range research let's dive in in the last few years five meta analyses have compared High vers low low training for muscle hypertrophy in case you're unaware meta analyses combine the results of numerous studies and are generally some of the strongest form of evidence these meta analyses fundamentally find the same thing similar growth across a wide range of loads for example this meta analysis by Lopez compared High moderate and low loads with similar hypertrophy across the comparisons this holds even when looking at different types of muscle growth measurements as this meta analysis finds that higher and low loads produced similar increases in lean mass whole muscle size and muscle fiber size I must point out that the studies have subjects get to or at least very close to failure with a given load for a higher load this will result in fewer reps while for a lighter load this will result in a higher number of reps the exact rep numbers vary from study to study and even from set to set in a couple of papers but after going through each paper I'd say most are in the 6 to 35 rep range others do say 5 to 30 but I think 6 to 35 might represent the underlying data a little better shortly we'll examine what happens if you creep below five or six reps as well as if you go above 35 I must also point out that most studies use a pretty normal speed on each rep around a 1 to 2 second lifting and 1 to 2 second lowering duration rep speeds will naturally slow down as you near failure but the key is this 6 to35 rep Zone will likely not be applicable if you're using deliberately very slow speeds on every rep for example this study fascinatingly found that 6 to 10 reps were inferior for building muscle when each rep involved a seriously slow 10-second lifting and 4 second lowering duration so we've seen that five meta analyses including multiple different types of muscle growth measurements suggest similar growth across a wide number of reps when training two or very close to failure that seems like pretty strong evidence but some might point out that a chunk of this data was done on untrained individuals only training a few exercises they suggest the results could be different in trained individuals performing a full program is this true well we luckily have two studies which were done on trained individuals performing a full program both studies involve three sets per exercise with one group training 8 to 12 reps to failure per set and another Group Training 20 to 35 reps to failure per set measures of growth increased similarly between both meaning we have reason to believe hypertrophy is similar across a wide number of reps even in this context at this point some might be thinking sure 6 to 35 reps produce similar growth but the type of growth they produce is not the same namely higher reps better grow slow twitch fibers while lower reps better grow fast twitch fibers is this true some earlier studies out of Russia suggested this could be true but these papers crucially have a range of limitations fortunately one of the meta analyses shown earlier aimed to explore this more with better design studies ultimately fast twitch fiber growth was similar between higher and lower loads and slow twitch fiber growth was also similar between higher and lower loads thus it seems that growth of both slow and fast switch fibers is similar across a wide range of rips another paper not included in this analysis had an interesting design it explored how growth of the Solus a muscle composed of predominantly slow twitch fibers compared between training car phasers with either 20 to 30 reps to failure or 6 to 10 reps to failure it was found the solely screw similarly between both thereby again failing to support the idea higher reps are better for slow twitch fibers these results might make sense as this excellent paper on trained individuals found that when performing four sets on the leg extension with either higher or lower loads to failure activation of fast and slow twitch fibers was similar between both indeed higher loads can readily recruit both fast and slow twitch fibers with low loads initially only slow twitch fibers might be recruited but as you perform more reps and get closer to failure recruitment of those faster switch fibers can occur can you still build muscle effectively with fewer than five or six reps an interesting place to St is to see if one rep that is your one rep max can build muscle I'm aware of four studies that had one condition trained with three to four sets of 8 to 12 reps while another condition had at most five attempts to reach their one rep max each session all four of the papers find greater growth with the 8 to 12 reps and they all fascinatingly find the one rep max produce very little to no growth whatsoever so one rep doesn't seem to do much for building muscle but what about two to four reps this paper on trained individuals helps us out subjects trained these exercises for three sets each with these other variables a heavy group adjusted loads each set to hit two to four reps to failure while a moderate group adjusted loads each set to hit 8 to 12 reps to failure overall growth tended to be better with the 8 to 12 reps however another paper on untrained individuals had slightly different findings subjects train the back squat for four sets with either 3 to 5 reps 13 to 15 reps or 23 to 25 reps growth was ultimately not significantly different between all three rep ranges there are differences between these two studies but it just doesn't seem Crystal Clear if very low reps produce optimal gains now there are five other papers actually finding two to four reps to be similarly effective to higher Reps for building muscle but my big concern is these papers had the two to four rep conditions perform more sets per exercise and or rest longer between sets I view this as a PO potential problem since we have data suggesting more sets can build more muscle and resting longer between sets in certain cases could build more muscle therefore if these five studies equated set numbers and rest between sets perhaps they would find two to four reps to not be as effective there's also some other indirect data this paper compared leg extensions with reps the failure with either a 30% or 90% one rep max load on average five reps were performed with a 90% load but muscle protein synthesis was overall greater with the 30% load one limitation though is that muscle damage can Cloud our interpretation of muscle protein synthesis data and as we'll soon see higher reps and lower reps do not cause the same amount of damage there's also this paper which found that gains in lean mass somewhat stalled when subjects transition to performing three sets of three reps on their core exercises this stall did not occur for other groups training with slightly higher rep numbers one limitation is that lean mass isn't the most precise measure of growth overall though it's apparent unlike one rep two to four reps has resulted in detectable hypertrophy in some studies however since its Effectiveness on a per set basis is questionable I would generally recommend not training entirely with reps below five or six for building muscle however if some of your sets involve very low reps that might actually be fine and nothing major to worry about about for example this study had subjects train dumbbell curs with either a low 30% one rep max load or a high 80% one rep max load looking at the rep numbers across sets you can see the 80% condition involved three reps on the final set on average but growth was still ultimately similar between both conditions as another example this study by shanfeld yet again had trained subjects train these exercises for three sets three times per week a varied group trained two to four reps the failure on Monday 8 to 12 reps to failure on Wednesday and 20 to 30 reps to failure on Friday a constant group trained with 8 to 12 reps to failure in all training sessions muscle growth was ultimately similar between both some of the percentages favored the variation but this was partly driven by outliers so having some sets with very low rep numbers might not ruin your gains You could argue if this study instead had five to six reps on Monday this would have certainly resulted in varying rep r producing better results however this is currently challenging to suggest with confidence as we have two other studies that explored the effectiveness of training with a variety of reps where none of the sets went below six reps both found similar growth between training with these different rep Rangers and another group that largely trained with eight reps to failure every session so training with a variety of different rep ranges does not enhance growth but it's not any worse either so it's something you could certainly try out if you desire and of course it is also possible to train with higher reps on some exercises but lower reps on other exercises having said all that most of the studies last 12 weeks or less in a much older video I presented this study finding that after 9 months of training comparing a group training only with the 8 to 10 rep range training across a variety of rep ranges produced greater increases in fat-free Mass but I do not put a turn of stock into this as it's just one study and fat mess measured by skinfold calipers is not an ideal measure for mle growth I would like to see more long-term data in this area though how high can you go what if you go above 35 reps this is more of a theoretical question as I'm sure most people have no desire to train with very high repetitions but let's briefly examine what the literature suggests this study involved comparing dumbbell CO's performed for three sets with either a 30% or 80% one rep max load fascinatingly we can see the 30% condition involved an astonishing average of 100 reps on the first set yet they still ultimately experience similar hypertrophy to the 80% condition part of the reason the rep numbers are so high is they did not adjust the training load until the middle of the study so subjects were essentially progressively overloading by performing more and more reps till failure thereby increasing the average number of reps performed a number of other studies using light loads have subjects adjust the load every session such that they stay roughly around the 25 to 35 rep range anyhow what does other research say about Super High Reps the best design paper is probably this one untrained subjects train the dumbbell curl and leg press with roughly 3 to five sets subjects either used a 20% 40% 60% or 80% One R Max load to failure each set these were the average reps overall the 40 to 80% loads produced similar hypertrophy which is is expected as these conditions were within the 6035 rep range whereas the 20% condition which performed an average of more than 60 reps still produced growth but just not as much as the other conditions there are two other studies which compare training to valal failure with either a 15% or 70% one R Max load one of them finds similar growth while the other suggest the very light load was inferior however two considerations are these studies had the 15% condition use shorter rest time between sets and they actually stopped any set with a 15% condition when any subject hit 90 reps even if that wasn't volitional failure so in total it's clear the 35 reps is not a hard cut off it's possible more than 35 reps can still produce similar hypertrophy but based on the varying data I currently would not recommend training with super high repetitions but again I'm sure not many would be willing to train with super high repetitions even if it was as effective just out of curiosity I think think it would be interesting to see future studies on trained individuals exploring more than 35 reps I'm sure the subjects would have a fun [Music] time this might surprise some but there's evidence that higher repetitions cause more damage and take longer to recover from versus lower repetitions for example this study hand subjects train one of their legs with either a lighter 40% or heavier 80% load on the leg extensions separated by a week reps were taken into failure recovery was slower after training with a 40% load fascinatingly a decrease in strength of the opposite leg was seen immediately and up to 24 hours after training with a 40% load suggesting CNS fatigue since CNS fatigue May reduce the force of muscles not directly trained evidently the fatigue from higher reps does not seem to be severe enough to render it inferior in the literature we've seen that higher reps can still be effective in the context of an overall program and there are also three studies demonstrating higher reps were still as effective as lower reps when training with 18 or more weekly sets for a muscle group your body can also reduce damage and fatigue over time a prime example is this paper that initially found untrained subjects took more than 5 days to recover from five sets of 15 maximal eccentric reps maximal eccentric training is no joke and much more damaging than normal training yet after 8 weeks of training subjects were recovering a day or two after the session yet I wouldn't be surprised if a handful of people just simply cannot adequately handle training entirely with High Reps especially when they're performing higher volumes and overall if you're trying to create as little fatigue as possible reps on the lowest side of the spectrum May more effectively help you do that this notion has led some to suggest although hypertrophy is similar across a wide number of reps the 6 to 12 rep range Still Remains a more practical hypertrophy training Zone that is certain not a bad take however I still think it's fine for you to explore and experiment around with higher reps if you like even if that's just on some of your sets as again recoil training with a variety of rep ranges is not inferior and perhaps some of you may prefer higher reps on certain [Music] exercises we've seen in previous videos that leaving a few reps in a reserve May produce similar hypertrophy to training to failure but some have suggested this only applies to reps on the lower side of the spectrum with higher reps we must reach failure to maximize hypertrophy is this true a meta regression last year indeed suggested the effect of getting closer to failure was less pronounced with heavier loads however this isn't definitive proof as there isn't a number of strong direct comparisons behind the data set when directly looking at the comparisons I am not so sure we have some studies that unsurprisingly find with lighter loads training very from failure fails to produce as much growth as training to failure anyhow we have some indications that stopping just a few reps short of failure with lighter loads can be as effective as failure this paper involved subjects training the leg extension with a 30% one R Max load one condition involved getting to True momentary failure while another non-f failure condition stopped at voluntary discomfort the numbers provided would suggest a non-failure condition was stopping a few rep short of failure but hypertrophy was similar between both we also have Blood Flow Restriction studies which involve higher repetitions finding similar hypertrophy between training to failure and stopping a few rep short to failure we also have this paper conducted on trained individuals comparing High load lower body training with around one to three reps in reserve to high rep Blood Flow Restriction Training with around one to four reps in reserve both ultimately produced similar hypertrophy including hypertrophy of slow and fast twitch fibers you could say as these studies involved Blood Flow Restriction their finding cannot be applied to normal high rep training that might be true but the mechanisms behind Blood Flow Restriction Training could be similar to normal training I might expand on this in a future video finally in some not all of the studies that compare different rep ranges they instruct subjects to reach volitional failure which might not always be true momentary failure given it's easier to train to failure with reps on the lower side of the spectrum I wouldn't be surprised if the higher rep groups were stopping slightly further from fail compared to the lower reps yet hypertophy still ends up being similar between both which may further suggest reaching momentary failure is not essential to optimize hypertrophy from higher reps this isn't case closed but my current thinking is that stopping shy of failure may still be highly effective with High Reps however some practical considerations are in order the data indicates is more likely to underestimate how close to failure you are with lighter loads probably because higher reps are more painful which Mak May mask your true proximity to failure for this reason if you're training with higher reps it may be reasonable to just train to failure to ensure you're not under trining or at least have some sets which are to failure to remind you of that failure feeling with higher reps which may improve your accuracy if you choose to stop a few rep shorts of failure on other sets before wrapping up I must touch on individual differences as we described in some videos last year two papers suggest that some people grow better withow reps while other people grow better with higher reps but in the last year there has been an excellent paper explaining why these studies are technically not designed sufficiently to truly identify individual differences I'll leave a link to this in the description if you're interested in learning more about this nevertheless it is still possible that some grow better with one rep range over another but since we don't have sufficient enough data to know to what extent this is true and if there are any simple ways you could determine if you respond better to one rep range over another I would recommend just considering the overall results of the literature which was done in this video although you could say if you're struggling to make progress with your current training and all other factors are dialed in then you could try training with a different rep range to see if that could help considering the conflicting information

    "transcript": "[Music] welcome to the house of hypertrophy how many sets should you perform for your muscles what types of exercises should you train with and how can you build muscle with quicker training sessions three new studies add to our knowledge of these areas we'll briefly review these new studies understand how they fit into the overall scientific literature and then explain what this may mean for your training to maximize muscle hypertrophy let's Dive In much research on set numbers has been done on the quads triceps and biceps this new study is exciting as it's explored another muscle group the calves a muscle many report struggling to grow as with all studies it's not Flawless but its findings nonetheless nudges along the path to fully understanding the relationship between set and muscle hypertrophy 61 untrained women trained this straight leg C race exercise three times per week for six weeks one group performed two sets per session thereby totaling six sets for the Cs in a week a second group performed three sets per session thereby totaling nine weekly sets for the CVS a third group performed four sets per session thereby totaling 12 weekly sets for the Cs all groups trained with 15 to 20 reps to momentary failure each set with 2 minutes of rest between sets weights were increased as subjects got stronger to stay in the 15 to 20 rep range medial gastrus lateral gastrus Solus and the sum of all these was measured before and after the study for all measurements growth tended to be best for the 12 weekly set group followed by the N9 weekly set group and then the six weekly set group with the sum of all measures the 12 weekly set group saw 73.9% greater growth than a six weekly set group and 17.6% greater growth than a 9 weekly set group some differences weren't statistically significant but I've previously discussed how statistical significance is not everything now it's still worth pointing out the six weekly set groups saw respectable gains plus the jump in muscle growth was larger from 6 to 9 weekly sets compared to 9 to 12 weekly sets suggesting diminishing returns so how does this fit into the rest of the research this meta analysis combined the results of multiple other studies examining sets and gains it indeed founds performing nine or more weekly sets for a muscle produced greater growth and fewer than nine weekly sets so the new study perfectly aligns with these results just in case you're confused don't forget we're talking about the total number of sets you perform for each muscle per week for example nine weekly sets for a muscle group such as the quads may include you performing three sets on each the squats leg press and leg extension in a week returning to the meta analysis is it's still worth pointing out that again fewer than nine weekly sets still built muscle so lower set numbers are not useless it's just that you do tend to see better games with more sets summoning the spirit of scientific accuracy we must not forget this new study was done on previously untrained women and did not exceed 12 weekly sets in fact much of the data Behind The Meta analysis was likewise conducted on untrained individuals and did not exceed more than 12 weekly sets per muscle group so what about data in trained individuals and more than 12 weekly sets we've dissected this data in a previous video feel free to check that out but the gist is this trained individuals can likely still grow from fewer than 9 weekly sets but muscle growth does seem to be notably better and potentially even optimized with 12 to 20 weekly sets per muscle group it's not clear if going Beyond 20 weekly sets produces even more growth some studies do not find this but as seen in another one of our videos some research finds in certain cases it can provide additional gains so in general a solid recommendation is to perform at least 9 to 12 weekly sets for each muscle group it is perfectly fine to train with fewer than this if you're not looking to maximize the growth of the muscle or muscles in question also if you're happy to train more in the hope of maximizing your gains pushing nearer to 20 weekly sets or perhaps even beyond for at least some of your master groups could be a worthwhile experiment to see how you respond there are Endless Options of exercises you could select to be in your training program but one factor the length at which a muscle is trained appears to be quite important let us review this new study and then we'll explain this further 42 previously untrained men were recruited to understand the design of this study I need to explain a fact about muscles and a certain training style your muscles are a lot stronger when lowering a weight approximately 40% stronger in general you have probably felt this in any curl the lifting is much harder than the lowering part this fact relates to a certain training style lowering overload training here we'll Define lowering overload training as lowering a weight that would be too heavy or difficult for you to lift how on Earth can you do this well in this new study one group trained of Nordic coals this is a bodyweight hamstring exercise many people aren't strong enough to lift themselves up so the subjects in the study just performed controlled lowering only repetitions subjects progress through a weighted vest a second group performed this bending over seated leg hole how was lowering overload training done with this firstly just remember that the lifting phase of a seated leg hole is where we Bend our knees and the lowering is when we're straightening our knees to make this lowering overlow training subjects perform the lifting of the weight with two legs and then switch to one leg on the lowering face to achieve overloaded lowering for that leg once they finished the reps with this one leg they switched over to train the other leg sets and Reps were equal between both groups it was found that overall hamstrings hypertrophy was 63.6% greater for the seated leg holes muscle length is perhaps the strongest explanation for these findings let me briefly explain L the hamstrings consist of four muscles all cross over the knee joint so bend the knee but three of them also cross the hip joint and this design means they can be stretched more that is at a longer length when the hip is flexed seated leg Coes involve our hips flexed while Nordic Coes involve virtually no hip flexion accordingly these three hamstring muscles are trained at longer muscle lengths with CA leg holes and all three of the heads grew better with this EX exercise as for the muscle the biceps for more short head which is trained at a similar muscle length between both exercises it fascinatingly grew better with a Nordic coal the researchers suggest since Nordic coals may not stimulate the other three hamstring muscles as much the biceps for more short head increases its involvement alternatively it's still possible muscle length plays a roll more precisely as the biceps for moreal short head just crosses the knee it's at a longer length when the knee is straight but at a shorter length when the knee is bent seated leg holes are more challenging when the knee is bent while Nordic HS are most challenging when the knee is straighter the point where the biceps for more short head is at a longer length finally the sorus and gillus muscles also grew better with the Nordic curl you may be unfamiliar with these muscles but they assist the hamstrings in knee Bend but due to their precise Anatomy they are actually trains at a longer length with the Nordic curl so this is a strong explanation for the results so what does this study tell us before addressing what I feel to be the key takeaway some might be curious is lowering overload training any better than normal training the popular mik Menor once suggested it could be but as I've thoroughly examined in a previous video they largely seem to be similar for overall growth with that out the way the key is this study is yet another suggesting training muscles at longer lengths builds more muscle if you've been following the house of hypoy for a while you'll know there's growing research suggesting this we're gradually creating fre ultimate guides to developing each muscle group where we describe the current scientific literature on each muscle and hypothesize what might be the best exercises for them summoning the spirit of scientific accuracy This research is still emerging and developing so it's not definitive proof training muscles at longer lengths produces more growth in all circumstances rather just consider training muscles at longer lengths as a potentially promising strategy that you may wish to try out in your training also all of the studies have currently been done on untrained individuals fortunately though there's upcoming research on trained individuals and we will be updating you with the findings how can you shorten your training sessions your rate while not hurting muscle growth supersets are one proposed way they involve performing two exercises with minimal rest and then resting before performing however many more sets you desire antagonist super sets are quite popular these involve super setting two exercises that train opposing muscle groups such as a biceps and triceps exercise previous research suggests antagonist suets do not hurt your training performance that is you can perform approximately a similar number of total repetitions on your exercises to normal sets even though the work is in a smaller amount of time we also have two studies suggesting antagonist supersets produced similar hypertrophy two normal sets however these two studies just involved two exercises and the subjects were untrained luckily this brand new study examined antagonist supersets with multiple exercises in trained subjects 43 trained individuals were recruited to train these exercises twice per week for 8 weeks four sets of 8 to 12 reps to momentary failure were performed for each exercise every session a normal group performed all sets on one exercise before moving on to the next exercise they rested 2 minutes between sets a superet group suers seted the lap pull down with a Smith machine bench press the leg curl with the leg extension and the biceps curl with the push down it took them around 20 seconds to transition between the supersetted exercises and they rested to minutes between sets this resulted in the training session being approximately 36% shorter training performance was not meaningfully different between both sessions although subjects rated the suets as being harder thus the suets did not reduce the number of reps they could complete to failure even though it felt harder overall for the subjects it was ultimately found muscle growth was similar between both groups strength and endurance gains were also similar between both groups it's worth mentioning the superset group did report more nausea than the normal group but this did reduce over time as a result the researchers suggest slowly introducing supet into your routine for example you may train further from failure on your sup seted exercises or perform fewer total sets and then you progress over time thus if it interests you feel free to experiment with antagonist superet in your program where you feel it can be suitable lastly although there's currently no no direct research on this I would guess non-related superset should also be fine this is where you supet exercises that train non-related muscle groups such as a biceps exercise with a calf exercise considering the conflicting information across the web things can get pretty confusing about how you may

    "transcript": "welcome to the house of hypertrophy can you build more muscle by implementing lengthened supersets with some of your exercises a new study is the first ever to explore this firstly what even is a lengthened superset during exercises your muscles move from longer to relatively shorter muscle lengths and some exercises are most challenging at relatively shorter muscle lengths calf Rises tend to be hardest in the plantar Flex position where you feel a squeeze of the Cals actually shorter lengths rows pull downs and pull-ups tend to be hardest when your arms are more bent and your hands are closer to your body which is where the back and biceps are at relatively shorter lengths dumbbell lateral and bent over raises are hardest when the arms are out to the sides where the shoulder muscles are at relatively shorter lengths and as a final example Leos also tend to be challenging when the knees are relatively more flexed and the hamstrings are at a shorter position if you train to failure on these exercises you tend to fail around that shorter muscle length position but at this point you can still squeeze out some more partial repetitions that have the muscles at relatively longer lengths this is what we'll call a lengthened superset where after you get to or close to failure with your normal range of motion on exercises that are hardest at shorter muscle lengths you then straight away perform as many partial reps at the lengthen position as you can now that we know this let's dive into the new study 23 untrained men were recruited they trained car phrases on a Smith machine with a foot on a step subjects moved from their most dorsy flexed position to their most planta flexed position to complete a normal full range of motion repetition with one leg all subjects train to momentary failure with their normal full range of motion momentary failure is defined as reaching the point where despite your maximal attempt to do so you you can't perform the full range of motion as we know calf raises are most challenging at the most plantar Flex position so this leg would have failed in this position where the calvs are at a relatively shorter muscle length with their other leg subjects also train to momentary failure with a normal range of motion but once they hit this point they did not stop they straight away performed as many partial repetitions as they could with the aim of failing in the more dorsy Flex position where the calves are at a relative longer muscle length the researchers plans for all subjects to get to the exact point where despite 100% maximal effort subjects could not even raise themselves up from the most dorsy Flex position however some subjects were unable to do this so the researchers had to settle with these subjects reaching what we may call valal failure around the more dorsy Flex position I think this is not a bad thing as it makes the study more ecologically valid for anyone that's ever done lengthen suets on car phrases you'll know it can get pretty excruciating here were the training variables used for both conditions when subjects were able to perform more than 20 full range of motion repetitions on the first set in either condition the barber load was increased before and after the study medial gastr nmia growth was measured the lengthen supersets ended up growing the muscle more than the normal training in raw units the growth was 0.62 mm more while in relative terms the growth was 43.3% greater some of you may be thinking 0.62 mm more that doesn't sound like much but bear in mind that both groups saw under a 2 mm average increase in thickness of the medial gastrocnemius multiple studies looking at Cal growth also tend to find between a 1 to 2 mm increase in gastrous thickness after 6 to 10 weeks of training and this isn't too surprising muscle growth can be a slow process so we're not going to see astonishing increases in sze in a few months considering this an extra 0.62 mm increase in this time frame which again was 43.3% more growth for the subjects is probably not meaningless but it may depend on your point of view fascinatingly the authors reported that around half of the subjects in the study felt this extra growth was worth a discomfort of lengthen supersets before describing how this paper fits into the rest of the literature and what the potential takeaways could be in the spirit of scientific accuracy we need to keep some things in mind firstly the subjects were previously untrained it's difficult to certainly know if this applies to trained individuals secondly just car phrases were trained so it's also difficult to certainly know if this extends to other exercises thirdly volume load the product of sets times reps times load was much greater with the lengthen super sets which is of course due to them performing extra partial reps volume load doesn't always have a strong relationship to hypertrophy but it is difficult to tease apart the contribution of volume or lengthen supersets to the results lastly some of you may be tempted to conclude this study proves that training to failure and Beyond is better for building muscle in all scenarios I don't think this is the best conclusion we've seen previously at the house of hyper that stopping one to two reps from failure can produce similar hypertrophy to training to failure and there other techniques that go beyond failure such as drop sets tend to produce similar hypertrophy to normal sets considering this I would merely interpret this study as telling us with a specific exercise car phrases which are most challenging at shorter muscle lengths going Beyond failure with a specific technique length and supersets has the potential to cause greater growth this is the first ever study to explore lengthen supersets and its results were promising in a unique way I say it adds to the growing evidence we've previously seen at the house of Hy pery demonstrating that training muscles at longer lengths is great for growth when we consider this overall research I think it first and foremost suggests selecting exercises that already place and Will challenge our muscles at longer lengths is a good idea last video we saw that leaning back leg extensions which lengthen the rectora more than normal leg extensions grew this muscle better we've also previously seen that cated leg Coes which lengthened the hamstrings more than Lang leg Coes produced greater hypertrophy triceps overhead extensions which lengthens the long head more than triceps pushdowns grew this muscle more we've also speculated that cable lateral raises and cable reverse flies due to them challenging the muscles well at long longer muscle lengths may be up there as the best exercises for the side and rear delts respectively but as we might not enjoy or even have access to exercises that adequately challenge all of our muscles at relatively longer lengths lengthened supersets May effectively help us build more muscle with exercises that are typically most challenging at shorter muscle lengths once again just car phrases were used in the newest study so we need to be cautious in extending the results to other exercises but lowering our scientific Shield we may hypothesize lengthened supersets may be effective with rows pull Downs pull-ups leg calls dumbbell lateral raises dumbbell bent over raises and any other exercises you may have that are most challenging in shorten muscle positions so feel free to experiment with this strategy in your own training if you desire there is another potential option on the table which is just a purely performed partial repetitions at long lengths instead of any full range em motion reps how effective could purely length and partial training be this paper from 2022 recruited untrained women to train a cough exercise one group used a full range of motion a second group used purely a partial at long muscle lengths and the third group used purely partials at Short muscle lengths medial and lateral gastrous growth was best with the partials at long lengths in fact medial gastrous growth was 126. n% greater for the length and partials compared to the full range of motion recall in the newest study medial gas nous growth was 43.3% greater with length and supersets considering this just length and partials maybe more effective than length and supersets but as the two studies had differences direct comparisons between purely length and partial training and lengthen superset is needed in future studies when considering other research specifically on length and partials two other studies on leg extensions and a hip extension machine further finds a partial range of motion at long muscle lengths built more muscle than a full range of motion but we do need other data on other demographics and exercises fortunately I know there is at least one study coming soon comparing full range of motion to length and partials in trained individuals we'll update you with a results when it's published for now feel free to try out the option you prefer before wrapping up let us put our scientific Shields back up and recognize with the research on Long muscle length training we are currently not talking about hundreds of studies with multiple replications across all training levels rather we're talking about an emerging and developing body of literature that has been conducted on previously untrained individuals with upcoming research in trained individuals so don't consider these things as 100% verified by science for being Superior all the time rather consider them as being promising training tips that you may wish to experiment with in your own training if you have any hesitancy you could explore them on just some of your sets for example if you're performing three sets on a row in a session the first two sets may be with a normal full range of motion while the final set may involve a lengthened super set or just purely lengthened partial reps integrated partials is yet another option this involves you alternating back and forth between between a normal full range emotional rep and a partial rep at long muscle lengths finally if you don't want to experiment with any of these training strategies that's absolutely okay you still grow with exercises that challenge short muscle lengths also methods that have staining at longer muscle lengths can be more fatiguing and depending on your individual circumstances some people may struggle to recover from training at longer muscle lengths yet the subjects in the current literature evidently were able to handle and Thrive from training at longer muscle lengths and we've discussed previously at the house of hypertrophy how your body can adapt and reduce the fatigue you experience so my current belief is in many cases we shouldn't worry about the fatigue from training at longer muscle links anyhow as you gain training experience you will hopefully gain a greater understanding of your recovery capabilities it can be tricky and very challenging to construct your own muscle building program but the alpha progression app which is

    "title": "The Protein Limit For a Meal (They Were WRONG)",
    "published_at": "2024-04-01T11:00:00Z",
    "transcript": "[Music] are you wasting protein by having too much all at once what do I mean it suggests that there's a limit to the amount of protein that can be used for building muscle per meal with any extra protein being oxidized on top of this it's thought you have to wait some hours before consuming protein again to be able to re-trigger the muscle building process if true this suggests to maximize muscle hypertrophy it's best to divide your daily protein intake across a few meals separated by a few hours but what if it actually exists is the limit of the protein amount you can use per meal in this video we're going to dissect the most upto-date scientific literature behind just this so that by the end you'll have a clearer picture of how you may distribute your protein for muscle hypertrophy welcome to the house of hypertrophy turning back the clock to 2013 one of the most influential papers on protein distribution was published let's see what it was about 24 trained men trained the leg extension and then in the following 12 hours they consumed 80 g of whey protein one group did this by consuming 10 g eight times every 1.5 hours a second by consuming 20 G four times every 3 hours and a third by consuming 40 G twice separated by 6 hours the result muscle protein synthesis which is essentially the process by which your body builds the proteins that can result in a larger muscle was best when consuming 20 G four times every 3 hours some other papers also find 20 G maximizes the protein synthesis response such as this one that had trained subjects train their lower body muscle protein synthesis was more or less optimized after consuming 20 G of whe protein with 40 G providing very little extra benefits so is that the end 20 g of protein is all you should have in one go anymore and that extra amount is quote unquote wasted the answer is no there are considerations multiple of them in fact one of them is that they just involve training with one or two exercises for a muscle group but most people's training sessions tend to involve training much more exercises and targeting multiple muscle groups this could change things indeed this 2016 paper had subjects train their full body with this session and this time around consuming 40 g of wheight protein successfully increased muscle protein synthesis more than 20 G another consideration is in the first study we mentioned remember subjects just consumed 80 g of weight protein over 12 hours as alluded to in our last video on how much protein you might want to consume in a day most people are going to consume more than 80 g Furthermore with the other studies we mentioned they just measured muscle protein synthesis up to 5 hours after exercise but what about Beyond this this is where an excellent recent study comes into play and it's ignited quite the buzz online this new study was seriously comprehensive but I'll relay the most crucial details for our purposes active men trained their full body with this session and thereafter consumed either zero 25 G or 100 G of milk protein muscle protein synthesis was greater and longer lasting after the 100 g of protein relative oxidation rates were also pretty small which goes against the notion that any protein in excess of 20 to 25 G is entirely just oxidized however one consideration is milk protein was used around 20% of this is whey protein which is fast digesting while around 80% is casine protein which digests slower you might suggest these results would be quite different if a proportionately faster digesting protein was served yet the authors provide some reasons as to why they think the responses in this study may not just be exclusive to predominantly slower digesting proteins anyhow what does all this mean well protein distribution may not be as important as once thought since a single single 100 G serving of protein was capable of producing larger and longer lasting growth signaling it's likely fewer larger meals can still lead to Great muscle growth additionally it demonstrates something that is also quite clear from other areas of the research how much protein you consume in the whole day is by far the most important thing about protein with other factors being far less important having said this it is worthwhile stepping back and realizing although this is a fantastic paper we are still just talking about muscle protein synthesis we know muscle protein synthesis is essentially the process by which your body builds the proteins that can result in a larger muscle however as perfectly described in this review there are established cases where muscle protein synthesis data fails to correlate with actual muscle hypertrophy the paper does a great job at outlining when and why this is also remember all the muscle protein synthesis data largely looked at the responses in the hours after training but people of course can consume protein in the hours before training everyone eats protein on the days they don't train and people tend to also consume their protein sources with other Foods thus it is ideal to look at studies that have compared different protein distributions in the context of an overall diet for actual muscle growth over many weeks of training let's do just [Music] that in 2020 This research paper was published untrained individuals trained three times per week for 12 weeks one group fundamentally had close to even distribution of protein across three meals while the second group had a distribution that meant only two of the meals could be considered as sufficient protein servings so in essence the study compared three to two sufficient protein servings a day the result strength and total leans soft tissue increases were better for the three protein servings but the differences were certainly far from large as a result this study suggests three servings of protein a day may be a little better than two this study isn't Flawless both groups consumed around 1.3 to 1.45 G per kilog of total body weight a day which as seen in our last video is definitely not terrible but you could could suggest if protein intake was higher the results would be different anyhow what about data on more than three protein servings this paper published a year later recruited male rowers who were training and bulking for 8 weeks consuming 3 to six protein servings a day was compared with total protein intake and calories equated the result all measurements including gains in fat-free mess were comparable between both thus this stud suggest although it's not detrimental consuming more than three protein servings a day fails to provide an advantage this data does come from merely 10 rowers but another paper on 24 Elite rugby players supports this notion subjects continue to train for 6 weeks and had to consume three protein shakes each day one condition consumed the shakes with every meal which resulted in four sufficiently sized protein servings a day while the other condition involved consuming the shakes between meals which resulted in six sufficiently sized protein servings a day gains in lean mass were similar between both conditions so in total the current evidence suggests three protein servings may be a little better than two with no further benefits of more than three servings bear in mind this isn't plentiful or super strong data so it's possible future research could improve our Insight if this happens we of course provide an update at the house of hypertrophy if for whatever reason you cannot or do not want to consume three protein servings don't stress about it too much once again the acute paper on 100 g of protein may ease your mind and remember the bigger picture daily protein intake is far more important and even more important than daily protein intake as depicted in our last video is training you just can't eat yourself to a great physique well constructed and executed training provides the key foundational stimulus for growth speaking about well-designed training amidst all the noise online it can definitely be frustrating and timec consuming to craft an effective program that gets

exceptional with a thousand of reviews speaking to this [Music] in the quest to maximize muscle hypertrophy it has been thought how you distribute your protein intake across the day could modify the gains you see there have been papers suggesting 20 g of protein in one go maximizes the muscle building signal with no benefit to consuming more but there are multiple limitations and considerations to this data indeed in a well-designed study that overcame some of the limitations consuming 100 g of protein 6 sucessfully increased the muscle protein synthesis more than 25 g of protein in my eyes this demonstrates how protein distribution is likely not as big of a factor as once thought and you most likely can see great gains with fewer larger meals yet this data still is just measuring muscle protein synthesis in the hours after one training session ideally we want to look at research that has measured muscle growth in some way after weeks of training when we do this we see that there is evidence that three protein servings a day is a little better than two but there's no extra benefit not a downside either to consuming More Than This finally don't forget that well- constructed and executed training provides the key foundational stimulus for growth thank you for watching feel free to check out the alpha progression app or our recent deep dive into building the lats"

    "title": "How HARD Should You Workout? - This NEW Study is Epic",
    "published_at": "2024-03-04T11:59:59Z",
    "transcript": "[Music] welcome to the house of hypertrophy what would you say is the most important training variable I'd say how close to failure you train with your repetitions is arguably the most important simply because getting close to failure ensures High muscle fiber Recruitment and tension which are critical for stimulating muscle hypertrophy but how close to failure are we talking about do you actually need to train to failure the point where you physically cannot perform another full repetition some believe reaching this is NE necessary for various reasons one is that training to failure ensures we squeeze out as many so-called effective reps as possible on the other hand others say it's sufficient to stop a few reps short of failure perhaps three to one reps from failure some say this better balances stimulus and fatigue a brand new study which I'd say is the best designed one to date has compared training to failure to stopping short of failure let us dissect this paper fit it into the rest of the research and then provide some recommendations to help you more effectively put on muscle at least five things make this study truly welld designed we'll reveal these as we describe the protocol and results of the study the researchers recruited 18 trained individuals with an average of 7.7 years of training experience this is the first great thing as this is the highest level of experience to date in studies exploring training into failure half of them had competed in powerlifting or bodybuilding the subjects performed the unilateral leg press and unilateral leg extension twice per week for 8 weeks with one leg they performed all sets to complete momentary muscular failure there is actually footage of one of the researchers supervising a subject going to failure and this assures us we can be confident failure was indeed reached brutality with their other leg all leg press sets were performed with two repetitions in reserve that is they stopped at the point they felt two more reps could be completed all leg extension sets were performed with one repetition in reserve you may be thinking how do I know if subjects accurately judge their had one or two reps in reserve well the researchers tested their accuracy before the study and it was found they were highly accurate they were off by less than one repetition in both a one rep in reserve and three reps in reserve test so I believe we can be fairly confident the subjects were more or less hitting the targets here is also footage of a leg press set performed with two repetitions in reserve so this is the second great thing we have reason to be confident subjects train sufficiently hard the third great thing is the simple fact each subject trained both conditions one leg trained to failure and the other not to failure in other words the same people were in the failure and non-f failure conditions which means that factors that differ between subjects like genetics nutritional intake and outside lifestyle are less likely to confound our results moreover this design also means we have more subjects in each condition compare this to if we just assigned 18 subjects into either a failure and non-f failure group we just have nine subjects in each condition it is valuable to know the number of dominant legs was equally split in each condition and every session alternated which leg was trained first how many sets did the subjects perform the researchers recorded how many sets for the quads each subject performed in their regular training before the study and each subject continue training with this number throughout the study for example say a subject was performing 12 weekly sets for the quads before the study in this study they performed 12 weekly sets equally divided between the exercises and the training sessions halfway through the study set numbers were increased by 20% so with our 12 we set example you'd now be performing 14 weekly sets this is the fourth great thing some studies just have all subjects perform identical set numbers but the problem with doing this is some subjects may be performing way more or way fewer sets than they're usually accustomed to which possibly confounds the study as an additional note during the training sessions subjects rested 4 minutes between leg press sets and 2 minutes between leg extension sets loads were increased whenever necessary to keep subjects reaching the desired proximity to failure within the specified rep ranges the fifth and final great thing was the researchers had subjects track their nutrition with an app that gave them individualized protein carob fat and overall calorie targets to attain a monthly weight gain of 1% here are the average nutritional intake and body weight changes across the 8 weeks there is a very interesting finding surrounding Regional hypertrophy that will uncover in a second but first overall quadriceps growth which was the average of the rectus florus and vastus lateralis in this case was similar between both conditions in other words leaving one to two reps in reserve was able to produce similar growth to training to failure this is in line with what other scientific papers have found now there was a meta agression last year that seemingly suggested Ed training to failure is superior but as I detailed in the previous video I believe this meta aggression is evidence of how getting close to failure is required but as the authors of that paper mentioned there were key considerations that meant it absolutely does not prove training to failure is superior besides that we have other metaanalyses which combine the results of numerous individual studies finding muscle growth is similar between training to failure and not training to failure and here are the summaries of three other papers that I think are welld designed finding not training to failure was similar to training to failure for hypertrophy the numbers in the papers imply the subjects not training to failure were probably stopping three or fewer reps from failure with a majority of training likely leaving one to two reps in reserve I alluded to an interesting finding about Regional hypertrophy what was I told talking about remember the quadriceps growth in this study was averaged from the rectus femoris and vasus lateralis however when looking at just the vastest lateralis the growth slightly favored the leg that trained to failure but when looking at the rectus florus the growth slightly favored the leg that did not train to failure the researchers provide a fascinating speculation the leg press was always trained before the leg extension in the training sessions there's evidence as will be covered in future videos at the house of hypertrophy that the leg press better grows the vastest lateralis while the leg extension better grows the rectus femoris with the leg that trained to failure failure might have maximized the stimulus on the leg press and thus explains the better vastest lateralis growth but the fatigue from this may have subsequently impaired the stimulus on the leg extension thus explaining the slightly worse rectus foror growth if true this suggests an intriguing interaction between between failure and exercise order although there is evidence against this specifically this paper was briefly presented earlier it had trained individuals also perform the leg press before the leg extension with one leg going to complete failure and the other leg likely stopping one to two reps from failure these researchers only measured vastest lateralis hypertrophy and if the logic stated moments ago is true we'd expect the failure leg to see slightly better V lateralis hypertrophy but this didn't happen the gains were actually nonsignificantly better for the non-failure leg so in total I don't think we can definitely say what explains these slight hypertrophy differences before providing some key takeaways it is worth touching on fatigue the researchers took indirect neuromuscular fatigue measurements during the training sessions and they partially suggest as the week's went by training to failure somewhat improved fatigue resistance on the leg press for those interested in the details behind this I describ this in the pinned comment anyhow the researchers didn't measure fatigue and Recovery in the days after the training sessions but we can generally be confident recovery is always going to be quicker when not training to failure for example this paper had trained individuals perform six sets on the barbell bench press training to failure on all sets led to slower recovery and more soreness compared to leaving one and three reps in reserve considering this if you're someone trying to limit fatigue for a variety of potential reasons this is best done by not training to failure yet this absolutely does not mean the fatigue from training to failure is always concerning and unmanageable we've clearly seen it doesn't harm growth in many cases moreover as described previously at the house of hypertrophy I think it's likely as you accustom yourself to training to failure your body produces a range of adaptations that partly reduce the fatigue damage and soreness you experience it can be tricky and very challenging to construct your own muscle building program but the alpha

by 20% I truly believe the app is exceptional and I hope you'll enjoy it [Music] too stopping a few rep short to failur seems to be able to produce similar muscle growth to training to failure however there are three final things you may consider remember that in the new study subjects were performing the same number of sets they were accustomed to with a 20% increase Midway through the study the authors noted this resulted in subjects largely performing 10 to 17 weekly sets for the quads throughout the study much of the other well-designed literature on training to failure used 6 to 19 weekly sets per muscle group thus the results are specific to this broad set number range some people may like to train with a very low number of weekly sets per muscle group we know this is likely not optimal for hypertrophy on average but we've described previously how this can be a time efficient way to see some Fair growth in this context it's possible training to failure is better in fact this study had subjects largely performed two weekly sets per muscle group one group went to complete failure while another stopped just shy of failure muscle mass increases were better with training to failure although the muscle mass measures in this paper were not the most precise so more studies are needed to validate this but if you are someone who trains with a very low number of weekly sets per muscle group it is generally more manageable to train to failure the second consideration is it's entirely possible to combine both failure and non-failure training into a program there could be benefits to this and it would be neat to have future studies exploring combining both in any case one benefit is that regularly having some failure in your program can keep you accustomed to how failure feels which could help your accuracy when you choose to leave reps in reserve the third consideration is the type of exercise currently the majority of the highest quality literature on training to failure has trained the quads a muscle group that is tough to train to failure but with isolation exercises that train smaller muscles it is relatively easier and less demanding to train to failure in fact some might suggest with these kinds of exercises training to failure is superior but the current limited evidence isn't Crystal clear one study seems to suggest with a barbell biceps curl training to failure was Superior to leaving around three or four reps in reserve but another suggests with the same exercise leaving one or two reps in reserve was similar to failure anyhow If You're Happy and capable of doing so you may choose to push the failure on the majority of your upper body isolation work thank you for watching feel free to check out the alpha progression

    "published_at": "2024-04-22T12:59:58Z",
    "transcript": "welcome to the house of hypertrophy how should you train to maximize triceps hypertrophy the triceps are roughly 2.5 times larger than the biceps so undeniably play a crucial role in enhancing arm size in this video we'll be deconstructing the latest scientific research examining how different compound exercises and isolation exercises may impact triceps hypertrophy so that by the end you'll have a clear riew of how you may train for complete triceps growth the triceps can be trained with compounds and isolation exercises compound exercises involve movement at two or more joints while isolation exercises primarily involve movement at one joint an excellent study from 2020 gives us a fascinating insight into how compound and isolation exercise is compared for triceps growth 43 men either train the barbell bench press only the barbell skull crusher only the bench press and then the skull crusher user or the skull crusher and then the bench press these were the training variables used in the sessions unsurprisingly the groups that trained the bench press saw the best PC major growth but it is highly interesting that training skull crushes before the bench press led to slightly less Peet growth in performing the reverse of this presumably Skull Crushers fatigued the triceps to where it subsequently became more of a limiting factor in the bench press thus compromising the PEC stimulus as for the triceps just training the bench press produced lower gains than the other groups that involved Skull Crushers interestingly the order in which the bench press and skull crusher was performed didn't have a major impact on triceps growth looking at these results you may say although the bench press grows the triceps we get much better results from the skull crusher so there's nothing special about the bench press however this isn't necessarily the correct conclusion why well the researchers examined growth across each of the three triceps heads for the long head Skull Crushers grew this very well something the bench press failed to do for the medial head both exercises grew this muscle but the percentages imply its growth what's better from Skull Crushers but for the lateral head the bench press actually grew this head very well something which the skull crusher failed to do accordingly the special thing about the bench press is when compared to a skull crusher at least although it doesn't develop the long and medial heads as well it does a better job growing the lateral head now this data just involved the barbell bench press with a two-time shoulder width grip what about closer grips and even other compound exercises with closer grips it's possible they enhance overall triceps growth there's no research comparing wider to closer grip bench pressing for actual triceps hypertrophy all we have is EMG research that inconsistently observes higher triceps activity with closer grips either way could closer grips change the pattern of growth across the three triceps heads a 2013 paper delivers potential Insight subjects perform the neutral grip dumbbell bench press this exercise is performed in the same plane as close grip barbell benching no not that plane I'm talking about plane of movement both of them occur in what we call the sagittal plane using T2 weighted Imaging to infer muscle activity which has been documented to have some associations with actual muscle hypertrophy it was found the size displayed High lateral and medial head activity this aligns with the data on wide grip barbell bench pressing that finds similar lateral and medial head hypertrophy as for the long head activity was much lower and indeed the researchers found after training this exercise for 12 weeks L head thickness did not increase thus just like the wide grip bench press closer grips likely fail to meaningfully grow the L head there's likely a sound reason for this all three heads of the triceps cross the elbow joint so can all contribute to Elbow extension but the L head additionally crosses over the shoulder joint so can partially contribute to shoulder extension and adduction during the bench press we need to lift the bar and this involves flexing the shoulder since the L head is partially involved in shoulder extension a strong contraction of it would fight against us trying to lift and flex the shoulder so it makes sense the nervous system wouldn't highly activate this muscle this logic extends to all other horizontal pressing compound exercises machine chest press variations and push-up variations it even applies the incline presses decline presses and dips so all of these exercises probably won't train the L head much rather the lateral and medial heads are likely trained in comparable ways to the bench press what about vertical presses like overhead presses since overhead presses require us to flex and autod duct the shoulder to lift the load a strong lad contraction may still fight against this and pull the arm down so perhaps this also not trains much here yet the shoulder angles traversed with vertical presses are different from horizontal presses and without direct research I'm unsure if this Alters things as for the lateral and medial heads I'm unaware of any reason to believe they wouldn't be trained at least fairly decently with vertical presses but how this compares to horizontal presses remains to be determined by Future research nevertheless summarizing this section compound exercises will absolutely contribute to developing your triceps and we saw direct evidence horizontal presses are likely great for the lateral head however it does seem likely we need isolation triceps exercises to maximize triceps hypertrophy we saw barbell Skull Crushers have been documented to grow the long and medial heads quite well and something we've yet to mention is data suggesting this likely extends to the dumbbell skull crusher very quickly this 2012 paper found the dumbbell variation produced the low activity of the lateral head which aligns with the results of the barbell skull crusher producing minimal lateral head hypertrophy as for the long and medial heads the dumbbell skull crusher produced High activity of both which aligns with the results of Baro skull crushes producing great hypertrophy of both of them but what about other triceps isolation exercises fortunately we have some great research here a 2022 paper out of Japan recruited 21 men with one arm they trained overhead extensions with their other arm they trained push Downs a supern hand grip was used and both exercises move the elbow from 90 to 0\u00b0 here were the training variables used subjects progressively overloaded whenever they could to keep training hard with the Reps subjects were able to lift heavier absolute loads on the push down through out the study despite this LGH head hypertrophy was better for the overhead extensions I think it's not a stretch to suggest the strongest explanation for this is stretch as the researchers implied in the paper and as seen in previous House of hypertrophy videos growing evidence suggests training at long muscle lengths can build more muscle remember although all three heads cross the elbow joint the long head additionally crosses the shoulder joint this actually means elevating the arm to an overhead position lengthens the L head such that overhead extensions train the L head at a relatively more stretched position compared to push Downs as for the lateral and medial heads the researchers had to combine both heads into one measurement due to problems with differentiating between them it was found this combined lateral and medial head growth was also better with the overhead extensions this was an unexpected finding and it's currently not Crystal Clear what could explain this after all the lateral and medial heads just crossed the elbow so shoulder position isn't really going to influence how much they are stretched it is also unfortunate that the researchers couldn't differentiate between the lateral and medial heads as remember Skull Crushers fail to grow the lateral head much so it would have been interesting to see how lateral head growth looked with these two exercises anyhow this study nonetheless indicates overhead extensions may be an excellent exercise for the triceps this study measured muscle volume which is a three-dimensional measure that considers all muscle regions but an interesting question is although overhead extension seem to produce overall more growth could there be some differences in the precise regions grown between the two movements this is where a 2018 Greek paper can assist us nine individuals were recruited and like the last study one arm trained overhead extensions while the other arm trained push downs but unlike the last study the elbow angles traversed by both exercises were different here were the training variables used and Progressive overload occurred the researchers only took measurements from the L head lad thickness at 50% and 60% of approximately the upper arm length lean towards the overhead extensions L head cross-sectional area at the lower portion also favored the overhead extensions but quite fascinatingly cross-sectional area at the upper portion was actually better with the pushdowns therefore these results suggest the two exercises May grow different parts of the L head it's important to mention this study has its differences from the previous one but one similarity is that both papers had each arm trained with one of the exercises this is actually a great thing to do since it means the same subjects performed both exercises this means that all non-training factors that influence muscle growth such as genetics nutrition and outside lifestyle factors were equal between both conditions after all your right arm doesn't sleep more or even more protein than your left arm but this Greek paper was merely conducted on nine subjects while the other paper included 21 subjects the Greek paper was also just 6 weeks while the other paper was double this duration finally besides the range of motion differences between the studies the Japanese paper had subjects Alternate which exercise was trained first every session which is the perfect thing to do contrastingly the Greek paper had subjects perform the push that Downs before the overhead extensions every session this is a potential problem since the general fatigue from performing the push Downs first could have slightly impaired the overhead extension stimulus therefore if this study had subjects alternate back and forth which arm was trained first each session better hypertrophy might have potentially been seen for the overhead extensions considering all this it's quite clear we want to put more stock into the paper from Japan however I'm currently not going to write off the regional lad growth differences between the two movements earlier we saw this graph established from Skull Crushers suggesting it may indeed be true that some regions of a tricep head could display greater activity than other parts furthermore the notion that overhead extensions better develop the lower parts of the L head might make sense remember that overhead extensions place the L head at a more stretched position and we have evidence that training muscles at stretched positions better develop the the lower portions of the muscle for example this paper compared preacher curls with a range of motion that train the muscle at a shortened position to a range of motion that achieved a relatively more lengthened position growth of the biceps at the 50% region was similar between both but growth at the 70% region was better with a lengthened position if you only wanted to train with one isolation triceps exercise I think it's reasonable to recommend overhead extensions based on the data we've overviewed the scientific papers dissected used cables but freeway overhead extensions are a possibility there are no direct comparisons between the two but based on one small study of five participants dumbbell overhead extensions resulted in appreciable triceps hypertrophy lad penti angle also increased appreciably and this measure is believed to represent the addition of contractile units in parallel which is what a large part of muscle growth is now some of you might be wondering what about Skull Crushers Skull Crushers achieve a better stretch of the long head compared to push downs but overhead extensions achieve a better stretch than both so in the absence of other research I suspect overhead extensions may still be better as for the lateral and medial heads it's difficult to say how their growth May compare between the two movements hopefully future research fills this Gap if you don't like overhead extensions rest assured you're still going to grow your triceps respectably with skull crushes or push Downs so feel free to alternatively train with either if you're someone who's happy to perform more than one isolation triceps exercise this could be worthwhile due to the possibility of it resulting in more uniform triceps growth although we know it had notable limitations the Greek paper hints at the combination of overhead extensions with push Downs possibly enabling the complete development of the upper and lower lad regions besides this the combination of overhead extensions with Skull Crushers may not be bad either as something we haven't mentioned about the data on Skull Crushers is it displayed High lad activity at the uppermost portion it is of course not impossible to have all three in a well constructed program something we also can't rule out is potential regional growth differences in the lateral and medial heads between these exercises making the combination of them possibly ideal for this speculative reason too there are also other triceps exercises in existence we've largely focused on these three since they're currently the most studied but you could experiment with any alternatives you think might work one final study potentially further supports the effectiveness of training the triceps with a few different exercises 22 individuals were assigned into either a nonv varied or Vari group both groups trained three times per week for 8 weeks the nonv varied group involved just training the triceps push down while the varied group involved training the push Downs on Monday cable seated extensions on Wednesday and cable Kickbacks on Friday overall triceps thickness was measured across three regions and the varied group tended to see better results the more favorable gains for the varied group could be entirely just a result of the inclusion of the cable SE extension which trains the L head at a more stretched position rather than the variation itself causing this even still it's still nonetheless demonstrates how this combination of isolation movements tended to produce more favorable gains than merely training the push Downs I should point out that bench press variations were also trained by both groups and we can be confident this contributed to some of the growth but I'm assuming the differences between groups were predominantly driven by the triceps isolation exercises if you're searching for further guidance on

    "transcript": "[Music] to maximize muscle hypertrophy what is the exact amount of protein you need across the web there's split views some say it's a lot While others provide a specific amount also how important is protein intake relative to your training in this video we're going to answer these questions by dissecting the most up-to-date scientific literature on protein and muscle hypertrophy welcome to the house of hypertrophy in the scientific world metaanalyses are generally considered some of the best evidence as they combine the results of numerous individual studies on the same topic in the last 6 years there have been three metaanalyses examining how daily protein intake relates to muscle growth here are the relationships established in each firstly it is unsurprising that all show a relationship between protein and gains secondly they all allude to more and more protein not necess necessarily being required the 2018 one found a plateau at 1.6 G per kilog of total body weight a day the 2021 found a plateau with this model at around 1.5 G per kg of total body weight a day the 2022 one owing to their different approach to modeling the data may lead you to believe that more and more protein does lead to more growth but the confidence intervals get wider with higher protein intakes which suggests there's more uncertain certainty about these higher intakes a few studies that have used methods such as nitrogen balance or the indicat amino acid oxidation technique demonstrate this too with the predicted benefits of daily protein intake on muscle growth stopping at around 1.5 to 2 G per kilog of total body weight a day so how much protein should you consume well before providing an answer I think it is worth revealing something that is quite underappreciated credit goes to Eric T formerly of the stronger by science podcast who made a few of the following observations it is worthwhile to visually see the data points that go behind these lines and the 2018 paper is excellent for this we know this analysis found a plateau at 1.6 GS but if we more clearly see the data points that contributed to this line but remove the actual line what do you see I see there appears to be an association between protein intake and growth but it's truly difficult to say you're absolutely better off with a certain intake of course there's a reason statistics are used to derive the line of best fit but the point is it's quite clear 1.6 G isn't an ultra precise cut off point as some may believe on top of this if we only look at protein intakes at or above 1.25 G per kilogram of total body weight per day things are even more open to debate in fact the r s value is 0.0 111 which means that in this range protein intake only explains 1% of the variance in the gains in fat-free Mass the same applies to the 2022 analysis we can visually see that above a certain protein intake it's hard to say for certain you're better off with higher intakes so back to our question how much protein should you consume I believe providing definitive and absolute statements isn't warranted based on the current scientific lature rather I believe presenting a spectrum is more sensible 1.2 to 1.59 G per kg of total body weight a day is possibly enough for maximizing gains based on some of the data we've seen 1.6 to 2 G per kg of total body weight a day is almost certainly enough for maximizing gains and more than 2 G per kog of total body weight a day is very likely more than enough and although it's compatible with maximizing gains it's likely Sim L not essential for many at the end of the day it depends on how you think you could aim for the higher end if you absolutely want to leave nothing on the table as some scientific researchers have suggested but others may be perfectly fine with consuming at least 1.6 G but if for a variety of reasons you can't hit this amount rest assured this is not the end of the world and you may indeed be leaving very little to nothing on the table with somewhat lower intakes other factors like protein quality and your age could factor in in some cases diets that contain a higher proportion of lower protein quality and or if you're older protein intakes ner to the higher end may be a good idea however there is still Nuance here that will likely describe in future videos at the house of hypertrophy besides these there are three other factors that many say impact protein intake but do they actually some hypothesize the harder you train and the more experienced you are the more protein you need what does the research say this classic paper had novice bodybuilders train intensely for 1.5 hours 6 days a week for 4 weeks strength and muscle gains were similar between consuming 1.35 and 2.62 G per kog of total body weight per day their nitrogen balance data suggested 1.6 to 1.7 G per kilogram of total body weight a day may be ideal this paper recruited eight bodybuilders considered to be near their maximum muscular potential using the indicator amino acid oxidation technique protein intake requirements were estimated to be 1.7 G per kilogram of total body weight per day this third classic paper also recruited Elite bodybuilders and estimated protein intakes were only 1.2 G per kilogram of total body weight a day finally as for Recovery of the muscle tissue this intriguing paper had subjects perform this training session and measurements of Muscle Recovery were similar between consuming 1.8 to 2.9 G per kilogram of total body weight a day thus the available data does not consistently suggest harder training or more experience increases protein intake requirements again it depends on your thought process some may prefer higher intakes to have a comfortable safety margin in much of the data comprising the associations between protein intake and muscle growth the subjects were consuming the same or more calories than needed to maintain body weights but what about if you're trying to reduce your weight by consuming fewer calories than normal in this scenario some say to protect your muscle mass more protein is needed there are three areas of the scientific literature that might support this this first paper found in trained men that reduced their calories by 40% while still training for 2 weeks maintenance of lean body mass was better when consuming 2.3 versus 1 G per kg of total body weight a day the second paper found in untrained men that reduced their calories by 40% while training for 4 weeks fat loss and lean mass increases were greater when consuming 2.4 versus 1.2 G per kilog of total body weight a day the third area is a review in 2014 that based on the data they collected suggested that higher protein intakes May May better protect against muscle mass loss in trained people having detailed this data there are some key considerations two of the papers involved a 40% reduction in calories and the lowest protein intakes were 1 to 1.2 G but what if the reduction in calories was less severe and or if the lowest protein intakes were instead around the 1.6 G area plus we have some evidence also with some limitations that indeed find higher protein intakes on always better during calorie restriction overall better quality research is needed for now although this is definitely hypothetical the lower your body fat percentage and or the more aggressive reduction in calories the higher the protein intake You may wish to consume to stay on the safe side what if you're trying to gain weight through consuming more calories than normal we already mentioned how in much of the data subjects consume the same or more calories than needed to maintain weight yet in the literature some data has led various people to suggest higher protein intakes on a bulk can minimize the fat gain we see however there are some key limitations to This research that I'll uncover in a future video on bulking at the house of hypertrophy for now just know I don't think higher than recommended protein intakes are needed on a bulk I think it's worthwhile to frame protein intake in the bigger picture as established and described in the 2018 meta analysis resistance training is the much more potent stimulus accounting at least according to this meta analysis for a substantially greater portion of the variance in muscle and strength furthermore this 2021 analysis found that during 3 days of immobilizing one of their legs higher protein intakes fail to do a better job at maintaining strength and muscle than lower protein intakes this is not to say protein intake is unimportant of course we've seen sufficient protein intake allows us to realize the best gains we can see from our training but at the end of the day you can't force your way to muscle growth by just eating tons of protein well-designed and hard training provides the foundational stimulus speaking about well-designed training amidst all the noise online it can definitely be frustrating and timec consuming to craft an effective program that gets you closer to your desired physique but our highquality partner the alpha

if you like it and choose to go beyond the link cuts the price of a subscription by 20% I truly believe the app is exceptional with a thousand of reviews speaking to this before summarizing things there are two final things worth dissecting firstly we know the literature we mentioned considered protein intake in relation to your total body weights but if you have significant more body fat this tends to overestimate your protein needs considering protein intake in relation to your fat-free mess can be more accurate here although most don't know their precise fat-free Mass so you may just estimate what you'd approximately weigh at lower body fat levels and then use these numbers secondly some have health concerns about higher protein intakes but as described in this position stand this stems from data on renal failure patients and educational Dogma that hasn't been Rewritten despite contrary evidence in otherwise healthy individuals there is no indication of harm even in investigations involving well above 2.2 G per kilogram of total body weight a day in summary optimizing your protein intake can help you realize your maximum growth potential but just don't forget that well constructed and executed training is the foundational stimulus I don't believe providing a definitive value for protein intake is currently sensible rather we presented this spectrum on the likelihood of maximizing gains across different protein intakes ultimately it's your choice some may aim for the higher end to have no doubts While others may be perfectly comfortable on the Lower Side knowing that at the very worst they're getting the line share of their gains thank you for watching feel free to check out the alpha progression app or our recent deep dive into building the LS"

    "title": "Bigger Quads: This NEW Study is Epic",
    "published_at": "2024-05-20T13:00:05Z",
    "transcript": "welcome to the house of hypertrophy what are the most effective and efficient exercises to maximize quadriceps hypertrophy the findings of a brand new study have some potentially important details it has compared two different leg extension variations some of you may be thinking why leg extensions aren't squats and leg press variations the best way to grow the quads as we'll see later these exercises absolutely can grow the quads well but they aren't enough because they fail to meaningfully grow a certain head of the Quad leg extensions on the other hand have been documented to grow all four heads of the quads well especially the region that squats and leg presses minimally grow we'll also mention some underappreciated alternative two leg extensions if you can't train [Music] them 22 untrained men were recruited with one leg subjects trained the typical leg extension the hips were flexed at 90\u00b0 and they moved the knee joint from one 110 to 0\u00b0 with the other leg they train the leg extension with a Hip Flex to 40\u00b0 with a knee joint also moving from 110 to 0\u00b0 so the only difference was this variation has us leaning back the subjects trained both exercises with these variables whenever subjects reach 20 reps on the first set load was increased to keep them in the 15 to 20 rep range the fact each subject trained with both exercises was great since this means the same subjects were in both conditions therefore differences in genetics nutrition and outside lifestyle factors likely won't confound the study the quadriceps consist of four heads and the researchers measured both rectus femoris and vastus lateralis growth each at an upper and lower region the result rectus fous growth at both regions was 1.4 to 2.7 times greater with a 40\u00b0 Hip Flex leg extension how on Earth is this possible the rectus femoris is what we call two-joint muscle it crosses both the hip and knee joints so besides contributing to knee extension it also contributes to hip flexion consequently with a leg extension leaning back allows us to lengthen the rectus femoris more that is it's in a relatively more stretched position this is important as mentioned previously at the house of hypertrophy training muscles at longer length seems to build more muscle and this new study adds to this body of literature with a rectus growing better with a leg extension variation that positions it at a longer length the other three quad heads are one joint since they just cross the knee so all contribute to just knee extension so provided we're moving the knee joint through the same range of motion which was done in this study we'd expect these muscles to grow similarly between both variations as they're moving through the same muscle lengths indeed vastest lateralis growth at both regions was fairly similar between the two leg extension variations there are at least three questions you might have the subjects were previously untrained what about trained people what about laying down to 0 de of hip flexion and what about alternatives to leaning back leg extensions a paper from Japan published last year potentially answers the first two questions nine bodybuilders were recruited they performed the leg extension with 0 40 and 80\u00b0 of hip flexion during each muscle activation was indirectly measured with MRI both the zero and 40\u00b0 hip flexion leg extensions produced higher upper and middle rectosis activity than the 80\u00b0 variation lower rectos morus activity did not statistically differ between them but we still see the values tended to be higher with a z and 40 degree variations therefore this study suggests trained individuals might also benefit from leaning back leg extensions but there doesn't seem to be a greater benefit for 0\u00b0 compared to 40\u00b0 of hip flexion if anything the raw numbers favor the 40\u00b0 variation however I will note that although this muscle activation measurement has been associated with actual muscle growth in previous analyses the context of these papers are important none of these papers verified that this muscle activation measurement successfully predicted muscle growth when comparing exercises at different muscle lengths and I think it's possible this measurement fails to fully account for Passive forces that occur when a muscle is at longer lengths I say this to say it's possible these results underestimate the muscle growth potential of 0 degree hip flexion leg extensions thus hopefully we get research comparing the 0 to 40\u00b0 variations for now we can at least say it's likely both zero and 40\u00b0 hip flexion leg extensions are better than a traditional variation for overall rectus sorous development but what if you can't perform leaning back leg extensions the reverse Nordic curl and squat are both potentially great Alternatives both are performed with virtually no hip flexion just like the0 degree hip flexion leg extension but unlike the Z degree hip flexion leg extension both of the exercises allow us to bend our knees to an even greater degree of flexion so in addition to lengthening the rectus furus even more all other three quad heads are going to be trained at even longer muscle lengths than what we achieve with leg extensions does this mean these two exercises can grow these three quad head even more than any leg extension variation maybe but it is also possible that there's a threshold to the amount of muscle lengthening that's beneficial for growth such that these two exercises don't build the three quad heads more than any leg extension variation there are also some other subtle differences between these exercises hopefully future research Compares them to tease out any potential differences in growth for now at least I believe we can hypothesize both of these are going to be excellent alternatives for growing the quads particularly the rectus femoris depending on your current level these two exercises may be too hard or easy to perform but I've mentioned some training and progression tips in the pinned comment if you're interested this discussion so far has been centered around maximizing muscle hypertrophy but I will say if you just rather train with normal leg extensions that is perfectly fine at the end of the day although it may not be the biggest bang for your buck it still will build mus [Music] musle the exercises mentioned so far largely involved to isolated knee extension but the quads are commonly trained with combined knee and hip extension exercises we have multiple studies suggesting all of these exercises likely minimally grow the rectus phorus but develop the other vastest muscles well the lack of rectos moros growth from these exercises can likely be explained by the simple fact that rectos morus is a joint muscle during the bottom position of any combined knee and hip extension exercise we need to produce both knee extension and hip extension but since the rectus sorus is involved in hip flexion the opposite of hip extension a strong contraction would fight against us trying to get up the other vastus muscles are just involved in the extension so are free to highly contribute to the extension in these exercises so it makes sense these grow well from these exercises some of you may be Be Wondering the leg extension also still grows the vastest muscles how does this growth compare to that achieved from combined knee and hip extension exercises most of the electromyographic analyses I found comparing leg extensions to squats lunges or leg presses showed that the latter exercises elicited higher activity of the various vastus muscles now as mentioned at the house of hypertree previously electromyographic Studies have limitations but as described by researcher Brad shanfeld there seems to be an upcoming study finding When comparing leg extensions to leg presses leg presses grew the vastest lateralis better and that the leg extension Target direct as for moris which is the mid mid quad muscle MUSC that goes down the center of the quad and the vast lateralis one of those three vast muscles ler on the lateral aspect of the Quad was targeted to a greater extent with the leg press some degree of upper to lower Regional differences could exist this study compared Smith machine squat to leg extension training in trained subjects unsurprisingly the leg extensions grew the rectus foror as more especially at the lower region as a note based on the data we've seen we can hypothesize if leaning back leg extensions were performed much better upper and middle rectus morus growth would have been seen vastest lateral growth at the upper and middle portions tended to be better with the Smith machine squats while growth at the lower portion fascinatingly favored the leg extensions I should note there were a couple of limitations with this study so I would like to see another study like this but in total the available evidence leans towards the idea that growth of the vestus muscles at least in certain regions can be better with combined knee and hip extension exercises so to maximize overall quad growth having both an isolated knee extension and combined knee and hip extension exercise is probably a great idea we'll have future videos at the house of H pery exploring and comparing different squat leg press and lunge variations so stay tuned for that considering the conflicting information across the web things can get pretty confusing about how you may want to train I hope the

    "transcript": "welcome to the house of hypertrophy what key facts do you need to know about the exercises required to optimize muscle hypertrophy yet another great study has been released that helps us out it has put the leg press up against the leg extension and the straight leg car phas against the bent leg car phase will also reveal how the findings of this study potentially relate to other muscles like the triceps and biceps let's Dive In 28 trained individuals were recruited one leg was assigned to train the leg press while the other trained the leg extension one leg also trained straight leg C phases and the other bent leg car phases this study design is powerful as all 28 subjects trained all four exercises as the same subjects were in all conditions differences in genetics nutrition and outside lifestyle factors were controlled after all your left leg hopefully doesn't sleep more or eat more protein than your right leg in each session these were the variables used weights were adjusted within and across sessions to keep subjects reaching failure in the 8 to 12 rep range the researchers measured the growth of two of the quadriceps heads the rectus femoris and vastus lateralis summed across three regions it was found the rectus foror grew better with the leg extension while the vastest lateralis grew better with the leg press as for the calves growth of the lateral gastrus medial gastrus and Solus was measured each at one region medial gastrus growth was clearly greater for the straight leg Rays lateral gastrus growth also favored the straight leg although not quite as clearly contrastingly Solus growth favored the bent leg but the benefit was not super compelling and some may just regard this as similar hypertrophy there are two key principles that help us to understand the findings of this study and these principles likely apply to other muscles such as the hamstrings triceps and potentially even biceps the first principle is that biarticular muscles experience suboptimal hypertrophy when one of their functions opposes what happens in a compound exercise the second principle actually tells us how we might be able to maximize the growth of B articular muscles it suggests positioning one of the two joints it crosses to place it at a longer length seems to produce more hypertrophy your head may be spinning in complete confusion but it's simpler than it sounds let's break it down principle one likely explains why the rectus moror suboptimally Grew From the leg press and required the leg extension forget about the details of principle one for now and understand that all four quadricep heads cross over the knee in a way that means they all contribute to knee extension however the rectus morus also crosses over the hip in a way that means it contributes the hip flexion since the rectus sorus crosses Two Joints we say it's B articular the other three quadriceps heads can be described as mono articular since they only cross the knee joints now during any compound exercise that trains the quads well such as a leg press and squat we need to extend our knees and extend our hips to lift the weight but although the rectus for moris is involved in the extension we just saw it's also involved in hip flexion the opposite of hip extension so a strong contraction of it would partly pull us down making it logical that the nervous system would minimize rectus thorus involvement thus all of these compound exercises likely suboptimally grow the rectum amorus this is principle one a biarticular muscle such as the Reus sorus experiences suboptimal hypertrophy when one of its functions opposes what happens in a compound exercise such as the hip flexion from the rectus phorus opposing the hip extension from these compound exercises as a result isolated knee extension training is more effective for rectus fous growth principle one likely extends to the other main key biarticulate muscles in the human body I'll briefly detail how this applies to the triceps and biceps but feel free to check out the pinned comment for details on the hamstrings and gastr nemus the triceps consist of three heads all cross over the elbow joint in a way that means they extend the elbow but the long triceps Head is by articular because it also crosses the shoulder joint in a way that means it's involved in shoulder extension and shoulder adduction during any compound pushing exercise such as the bench press and overhead press we extend the elbow but these movements also involve shoulder flexion and or shoulder abduction which are the opposing shoulder motions the L head contributes to if you're struggling to see how shoulder flexion or abduction happens in these movements just focus on the upper arm anyhow a strong long head contraction would partly fight against us lifting the weight so it makes sense it's not highly involved indeed we have direct data demonstrating that pushing exercises such as the bench press suboptimally grows the long head of the triceps but does a better job at growing the lateral and medial heads isolated elbow extension excises have been documented to be very effective for growing the L head although certain compound exercises such as this pullover extension hybrid likely trains the lad effectively since this involves combined l elbow extension and shoulder extension which both are L head functions but right now we don't have direct data on how effective these are and I'm skeptical they are superior to isolation elbow extension as for the biceps this one is quite controversial and you'll see why the biceps consist of the long and short head both cross the elbow joint and everyone knows they are involved in elbow flexion but both also cross the shoulder joint in a way that means they can contract during shoulder flexion and shoulder Abduction the biceps can also perform what we call superation at the forearm and there's also evidence that biceps activity is higher when we're elbow flexing with a supinated grip anyhow during any compound pulling exercise such as rows pull-ups and chinups elbow flexion occurs but shoulder extension and or shoulder adduction also occur which are the opposite movements the biceps have at the shoulder once again if you can't see how shoulder extension or adduction happens in these movements focus on the upper arm indeed we have direct evidence dumbbell Rose even with a sulated grip produced much lower elbow Flex ey pery than dumbell Co the reason I said this is controversial is that many people suggest chinups are one of the best biceps exercises the popular mik men even suggested this and it just so happens to be true audience the close grip Palms up pull down is the best bicep exercise in the world how could this be possible well those who believe the biceps are trained effectively with compound pulling exercises would say what we've detailed is wrong for at least three reasons firstly they may say although the biceps do cross the shoulder joint there's research suggesting their involvement in shoulder the motion is minimal meaning your nervous system can effectively activate the biceps during these exercises secondly they might also reference this study that fascinatingly found pronated grip laap pull Downs produced similar elbow Flex of growth to barbell Coes finally some electromyographic research also finds High biceps activity during pull-ups and chinups and so many people feel their biceps are highly involved I actually believe these three arguments are pretty good but there are some solid counter points firstly although the biceps involvement in shoulder motion is indeed little it's still partially shortening in these movements which may mean it nonetheless fails to optimally contribute to pulling exercises secondly as for the study finding similar growth between pull downs and curs this was elbow flexor growth which in this case consists of of both the biceps and brachialis the brachialis is a muscle under the biceps it's just a monoarticular muscle involved in elbow flexion due to this muscle being in the measurement we can't be certain biceps growth was truly similar between both exercises moreover to be completely transparent the author of this particular study has been involved in multiple studies with statistical anomalies so some might question the study's validity finally the electrom myographic data is interesting but as detailed at the house of hypertrophy previously there are cases where electrom myographic data can probably be useful and other cases where it's not here it might not be useful for example we've seen the triceps lad minimally grows from compounds pushing exercises but some electromyographic research finds High triceps lad activity during the bench press so this is misleading in this circumstance as for people people reporting they feel their biceps highly with some pulling compound exercises someone might say you're actually feeling the brachialis not the biceps so who's right it would be interesting to hear what you think on this matter so feel free to drop a comment below to truly get an answer I would love to see a study directly comparing chin-ups to a normal biceps curl until then I'm on the fence as to whether principle one applies to the biceps I know I know it's for strating that I remain on the fence but if it's any consolation my hypothesis would be that all compound pulling exercises are not optimal for biceps hypertrophy if it's not for principle one I think it would be because the back musculature is typically the limiting factor in pulling exercises so your biceps may fail to reach maximal activation and tension so I think it comes as no surprised that to maximize biceps hypertrophy direct isolation biceps training is recommended Ed let us now move forward to principle 2 which tells us how we could maximize the growth of biarticular muscles principle 2 suggests positioning one of the two joints a b articular muscle crosses to place it at a longer length appears to produce greater muscle hypertrophy we'll understand what this exactly mean soon but this principle likely explains why the gastr nemus grew better with straight leg C raises versus bentle C raises actually we have another study published in December 2023 which had untrained individuals train bent leg Cal raises with one leg and standing straight leg Cal raises with their other leg using these variables both lateral and medial gastonia's volume increases were better with the straight leg C raises while Solus growth was fairly similar between both exercises so comparable to the new study it generally shows better gastrous growth with straight leg raises and uncompelling evidence the Solus grows much better with bent leg raises okay all three calf muscles the lateral gastrus medial gastrus and Solus cross over the ankle in a way that means they perform calf raising however the lateral and medial heads are B Artic as they also cross the knee joints this means they can shorten and contribute to knee flexion as the knees are flexed in a bent like C phase both gastr nmia heads are already shortened which likely compromises their Force generation this connects to the idea of active insufficiency which refers to when a biarticular muscle is shortened at both of the joints it crosses which limits Force strictly speaking some mono articular muscles could experience meaningfully impaired Force at Short lengths but this is a discussion for another day and we'll stick to this notion of active insufficiency see today with the bentle calf raise all the calf muscles are shortened at the top of the calf raise but since we started with the knees already bent the gastr nemas are excessively shortened extending our knees will lengthen the gastrus so straight leg C raises train the gastrus at longer lengths which avoids active insufficiency this is principle two positioning one of the two joints a biotic muscle cross es to place it at a longer length such as how positioning the knee in a straight position lengthens the gash nemus seems to result in more muscle hypertrophy if you've been following the house of hypertrophy for a while you'll know growing evidence suggests training muscles at longer lengths builds more muscle we've seen it with research suggesting that shortened range of motions fail to grow as much muscle at some regions to a range of motion that reaches longer lengths and we're also seeing it with selecting exercises that have biarticular muscles at longer lengths which is what we're focusing on here across the web opinions conflict about the mechanisms behind training muscles at longer lengths but in my view avoiding active insufficiency is one potential mechanism behind wi trting muscles at longer length can be beneficial in some cases but other mechanisms are almost certainly in play too regardless of the mechanisms we've seen principle 2 with the hamstrings in the same way that straightening the knee can lengthen the gasto nemus the hamstrings can be lengthened by hip flexion seated leg Coes involve the hips flexed while lying leg Coes do not indeed overall hamstrings hypertrophy was found to be superior with seated leg Coes in another paper so I would certainly recommend seated leg Coes overlying leg Coes we've seen it with a rectus sorus the new study analyzed in this video used normal leg extension but leaning back on the leg extension will lengthen the rectus sorus more and we saw in a recent video this produced greater rectos sorus hypertrophy than normal leg extensions feel free to check out that video for the full details of the study and possible alternatives to leaning back leg extensions we've seen it with the triceps the triceps L head can be lengthened with shoulder flexion overhead extensions involve the shoulders flexed while push Downs do not L head hypertrophy has been documented mented to be superior with overhead extensions in another paper interestingly combined medial and lateral head hypertrophy was also greater with the overhead extensions an unexpected finding now many people do like pushdowns so I wouldn't completely ditch it if you don't want to but I would at least recommend a triceps exercise with the shoulders at a more flexed position to cover your bases as for the biceps I know there are a few studies currently in the works on them I'm excited to see what they end up finding and we'll of course update you whenever they're [Music] released we've seen that principle one likely explains why the rectus florus grow suboptimally from the leg press and principle 2 likely explains why the gastr nemia's heads tended to grow better with the straight legar razes but why was vastest lateralis growth better with the leg press and why was Solus growth not drastically different between between straight and bent leg Rises with the Solus some might speculate as Gast nemus involvement is reduced with bent leg raises the solier should increase its involvement and thus grow more this certainly sounds logical but according to the results we've seen it just doesn't seem to happen at least not significantly therefore straight leg cough raises might be all you need although bent leg raises could be useful for isolating the Solus if you'd like to do that as for the vastest lateralis you might speculate since the rectus moris is suboptimally involved in all compound exercises the other quad heads like the vastest lateralis must increase their involvement and thus grow more but this is similar to the solest argument we just proposed which doesn't appear to significantly occur though of course things could differ between muscle groups although another possible explanation is most compound exercises like leg presses tend to involve more knee flexion than normal leg extensions this will effectively train and stimulate the vastest muscles at longer lengths which could explain the greater growth nevertheless to maximize overall quadriceps hypertrophy it seems a solid recommendation is to have both an isolated knee extension exercise for optimal rectus femoris growth and a quad focused compound exercise for optimal vastus growth I intend to have future videos with more research on the quad s so stay tuned for that if you're searching for

    "transcript": "[Music] welcome to the house of hypertrophy what would you say is the most effective way to perform your exercises for maximum muscle growth many people train with a full range of motion where with any given exercise they move through the largest distance they can but is this actually optimal or essential it is possible to use a partial at Short muscle lengths where you move through the half where the muscle is at a shorter length or a partial at long lengths where you move through the half where the muscle is at a longer length are these any better well the scientific literature tends to find that partials at Short lengths aren't as effective as a full range of motion or partials at long lengths and when comparing a four range motion to partials at long lengths we fascinatingly have three studies suggesting partials at long lengths built more overall muscle however these studies were done on untrained individuals I'm thrilled to say we finally have the first study in trained individuals comparing a full range of motion to partials at long lengths let's dive straight in 25 trained individuals with an average of 4.9 years of experience were recruited here are some real life photos of some of the subjects they trained these exercises twice per week for 8 weeks one side of their body trained with a full range of motion on all exercises while the other side of their body trained with a partial at long lengths on all exercises I've mentioned this in previous videos but the design design of having one side of the body trained in one way and the other side of the body trained in another way is fantastic as it means the same subjects were in both conditions thus differences in genetics nutrition and outside lifestyle factors are much less likely to confound the results after all the left side of your body hopefully doesn't sleep more or eat more protein than the other side both sides train to momentary failure with the defined range of motion muscle thickness of both the elbow flexes and triceps was measured at 40 5 and 55% of the humoral bone length it was ultimately found growth at all regions was similar between both types of training thus partials at long lengths weren't any better than a full range motion but it wasn't any worse which I believe is still a very impressive finding it was once thought that using a full range of motion to achieve both the stretch and Peak contraction was essential but these findings demonstrate partials at long lengths might be an appropriate alternative it seems that the peak squeeze achieved by a full range emotion may not deliver additional gains having said this there are some crucial things we need to keep in mind but before detailing that I feel something is worth mentioning as the authors allude to these results are great as you have the flexibility to train according to your preference if you follow the house of hypertrophy for a while you'll know that there are many different training Styles and Roads to a great physique is pretty hard to do something that will seriously hurt your gains these results yet again remind us that we shouldn't forget about the basics training hard enough with enough volume and consistency are foundational as mentioned there are still some crucial things to keep in mind firstly science is an ongoing process as the spirit of scientific accuracy will tell you the results are specific to all the variables used such as the exercises and the techniques used one study isn't enough to definitively prove anything so this isn't the final word on long length partial secondly Remember That Elbow flexor and triceps thickness was measured at 45 and 55% regions but what about other muscles like the chest and lats we also know muscles do not necessarily grow identically across their regions and if you've seen our previous video you may be aware that partials at long lengths can be highly effective for growing the distal regions of a muscle that is the region of a muscle further away from its origin for example this paper in untrained individuals compared preacher Coes with a partial at Short to Long lengths growth at the 50% region was actually similar between both while growth at the 70% region was much better with the partials at long lengths similarly this paper on untrained individuals involves comparing leg extensions with a partial at long lengths to a full range of motion vastest lateralis growth tended to be similar at the 40 to 50% regions but fairly better for the partials at long lengths at the 70% region growth of the rectus sorus tended to be better for the partials at long lengths across all regions but the differences were large at the 70% region accordingly we can't be certain distal region growth of the elbow flexors and triceps was identical between both hopefully future studies Can Shed more light onto this thirdly the latest study used multiple exercises but we can't rule out the possibility that long length partials work better with some exercises and not others one possibility is that lengthened partials are most effective with exercises that are hardest at the shortest more contracted position for example both carf raisers and leg extensions tend to be hardest at the top shorten position two studies on these exercises although conducted on untrained individuals found that long length partials produced more overall growth than a full range of motion a few exercises in this latest study on trained individuals are hardest around the mid position which might mean long length partials aren't any better than a full range of motion hopefully future studies examine this idea [Music] more remember these results are specific to a range of motion with an exercise I don't believe we can extrapolate these results to comparing different exercises for example we've seen that changing joint positions to train certain muscles at longer lengths builds more muscle such as how in untrained individuals seated leg holes build more muscle than L leg holes overhead extensions built more muscle muscle than push Downs leaning back leg extensions buil more muscle than normal leg extensions and incline curls built more muscle than preos some might be tempted to take the results of this latest study and say that training at longer muscle lengths in all cases isn't going to build more muscle in experienced lifters however remember in this latest study both ranges of motions reach the same maximum muscle length the only difference was the long length partials didn't attain shorter lengths conversely with these exercise comparisons we're comparing reaching longer muscle lengths to Shorter lengths which is different and may still be better for building muscle in trained individuals indeed although this isn't direct muscle hypertrophy we've seen that in bodybuilders leaning back on the leg extension resulted in greater overall rexus Morse activity than normal leg extensions however there may be a threshold of the length needed to maximize hypertrophy that is even longer isn't always better I say this as lying down on the leg extension which stretches the rectus forus even more although still producing better activity than normal leg extensions wasn't any more effective than the leaning back leg extensions also there's a study coming soon that seems to have found when tension was highest at the start of the curl cable curls with the shoulder neutral were similarly effective to having the shoulder extended we'll be sure to update you at the house of hypertrophy with any new studies that may shape and refine our thoughts but here are our current recommendations don't forget the basics training hard with enough volume and consistency are indispensable it's still recommended to select exercises that train muscles at longer lengths over shorter lengths and we have and are working on guides that go into detail on how you may do this with each muscle as for range of motion the latest data suggest you have flexibility with both long length partials and full range of motion as options on the table feel free to experiment around in a

    "transcript": "a well-developed chest makes a powerful difference in the appearance of your physique but what range of exercises do you need to maximally develop the chest today we'll be cutting through the noise and confusion that's forever present on the web through dissecting the latest science behind chest hypertrophy regular viewers will know we've had a previous video on chest hypertrophy you don't need to watch that video as the key points will be mentioned here but crucially this video Builds on that and will dive deep into how you can develop all regions of the pecs we'll be mentioning virtually every chest exercise ever from pressing motions at different inclines with different modalities with different grip widths and hand positions and isolation PEC exercises welcome to the house of [Music] hypertrophy technically speaking a few muscles belong to the chest but we're focusing on the largest and most important one for Aesthetics the PS major anatomical analyses commonly consider the PS major to have a clavicular and sternal costal head although quite fascinatingly the sternal costal head has been divided up to as much as seven segments based on one analysis the clavicular head makes up 19% of the Pet's major volume with the remaining 81% attributable to the sternal costal head some Well Control told electromyographic research which actually considered six regions finds they can be functionally separable what this means is it's theoretically possible to preferentially Target different PEC regions this is not Bro Science for Simplicity we'll just consider there to be three regions and I'll refer to them as the upper middle and lower PEC let us now dive into our analysis starting with the middle pcks [Music] as shown in this classic 1997 paper the middle PCS have tremendous leverage for shoulder horizontal flexion with the front dealt behind in this case leverage specifically refers to the muscle's moment arm which is the perpendicular distance between the line of force of the muscle and the center of the joint it moves promising data suggests Leverage is perhaps the most important factor behind how the central nervous system chooses which muscles to activate in an exercise considering this it's unsurprising that well-controlled electromyographic research finds that a significant chunk of the pecs including the middle region is active in shoulder horizontal flexion now we will be mentioning electromyographic research throughout this video it's where researchers use electrodes to record the electrical activity of a muscle regular house of hypertrophy viewers will know it's not Flawless but I believe well-controlled and specific electromyographic studies possess the potential to give us valuable insights the pinned comment and description contains more details about this if you're interested anyhow we also know the middle PCS are stretched the well at the initial position of shoulder horizontal flexion thus shoulder horizontal flexion motions can attain a nice stretch plus High Contracting forces from the middle pecs two things that make exercise excellent for hypertrophy your first thought may be that all fly exercise variations do this indeed this is true however these are isolation exercises they will be dissected later in this video right now we'll focus on horizontal pressing exercises which involve all bench pressing variations including with the barbell dumbbell Smith machine and machine also pushup and seated machine chest presses fit into this category all of these are compound exercises when you're pressing with a moderate to wider grip they tend to involve shoulder horizontal flexion ignoring the lower arm reveals this therefore it's unsurprising that this paper found just flat barbell bench pressing three times a week across 6 months grew the middle PEC by an impressive 37% does this mean the flat barbell bench press is superior no because as detailed in our previous video we have a range of scientific papers that actually suggest all these variations can probably be quite similar to the barbell bench press machine variations have been documented to produce similar pet growth and activity to barbells dumbbells tend to evoke similar PEC activity to barbells and push-ups have even produced similar pet growth to barbell benching now some of you may be wondering about Di Lips This doesn't actually involve shoulder horizontal flexion at least not predominantly but we'll discuss this more in the lower pet section anyway the fact all these exercises are likely similar for pet growth may come as a surprise to some but remember that at the end of the day although subtle differences exist they all fundamentally involve shoulder horizontal flexion provided we're training them hard and getting two or n to failure we're going to be exposing the peex to high tension it is also fascinating to know that scientific literature implies there's a strong strength carryover between all these exercises training with a machine chest press has been shown to significantly increase barbell bench press strength the inverse of this is also true training the Smith machine bench press has also been shown to significantly increased barbell bench mesh strength the inverse of this is also true there's Fair fairly strong correlations between push-up performance and bench press performance as well as dumbbell and barbell benching so you're free to select whichever exercise you prefer although there are actually five considerations you may factor into helping you choose the first consideration relates to push-ups since push-ups replicate a plank position they likely Engage The rectus abdominis more than all the other variations since push-ups also enable scaper protraction they likely engage the seratus anterior better than all the other variations depending on your goals this may make the push-up a better or worse option although progressively overloading the push-up in the long term can be difficult yet despite the popular belief that 8 to 15 reps or some other narrow rep range is ideal for hypertrophy we've mentioned countless times at the house of hypertrophy that reps between 6 to 35 are similarly effective for building muscle provided these reps are performed too or close to failure thus progressing to higher rep push-ups is viable indeed we've had a great paper that found increasing the number of reps you perform with the same load across training sessions produced overall similar muscle hypertrophy to another group that increased load within the same rep range across sessions now there is only so much you can add reps going well beyond 3 five reps may be inferior yet provided you're not super Advanced weighted push-ups are a great option that enables load increases the second consideration relates to dumbbell bench pressing when analyzing them the triceps are likely trained slightly less compared to all other variations the likely reason for this is you can't apply much lateral forces during a dumbbell bench press doing so would just result in the dumbbells falling either side of you this matters as the triceps are in involved in generating lateral forces with all the other variations lateral forces naturally occur whether you know it or not indeed electromyographic data finds reduced triceps activity with a dumbbell compared to a barbell bench press depending on your goals this may make it a better or worse option the third consideration relates to failure and fatigue with the barbell with failure we've seen previously at the house of horty that getting to or close to failure is need to maximize muscle fiber Recruitment and tension two things crucial for maximal growth in fact we have research on the pecs illustrating this this paper had trained individuals trained the Smith machine barbell bench press with a maximal lifting velocity there were four groups one group literally performed one rep per set a second group performed their reps until their rep velocity slowed down by 15% another by 30% and a final Group by 50% petor major hypertrophy what's best with the group that trains closest to failure that is the group whose reps slow down by 50% extrapolating from other research a 50% velocity loss equates to performing 70 to 80% of the maximum number of reps possible on average this study didn't have a condition training to actual failure but as we've seen previously at the house of hypertrophy getting 3 to1 reps from failure seems to produce similar growth to failure so this is the general recommendation here's the thing with a freeweight barbell bench press you're putting yourself in the safest position by having a spotter and or a safety setup that saves you if you fail a repetition if you don't have these the other options may be a safer bet the second Point stems from this fascinating fatigue paper it had trains men either perform the Smith machine dumbbell or barbell bench press chest fatigue swelling and soreness were quite comparable between all these three exercises across 96 hours after training as a side note this is further indirect evidence all these variations impose a similar PE stimulus the triceps fatigue was not too different between groups except the dumbbell group saw lower fatigue and soreness which makes sense as we've just detailed how triceps activity is likely reduced with the dumbbells nonetheless the main point is despite the fact all these fatigue measures were largely similar between the three exercises subject subject recovery what's worse across the 96 hours after training with the barbell versus the Smith machine and dumbbell thus these findings might suggest your own perception of recovery may be a bit worse with the barbell yet I don't believe this is super crucial information fatigue isn't necessarily bad plus your body does produce adaptations across time that reduces the fatigue you experience so it's entirely likely that any fatigue from the barbell variation is in consequential in the majority of circumstances the fourth consideration surrounds machines we've briefly alluded to how there's data comparing machine to barbell pressing and similar PEC hypertrophy was found this might surprise some because there's been speculations that extra stability with machines better enables muscle fiber recruitment however I think stability is critical under extreme ends for example bench pressing on a Swiss ball is probably going to suck for build muscle but the extra stability with machines compared to barbells and dumbbells doesn't seem to transfer to Greater growth plus we have meta analyses which combine the results of numerous studies finding that overall machine exercises largely produce similar growth to barbells and dumbbells now not all machines in the world are identical but provided the machine provid solid resistance at the bottom where the pecs are stretched it should be good some machines can can converge to get a better shortened and contracted position and perhaps provide a solid challenge here dumbbells also involve convergence this is extra shoulder horizontal flexion near that shortened position and this convergence and squeeze can feel nice despite this it probably doesn't enhance growth since the available data suggests tension at that shortened position may not provide extra benefits specifically we have three studies remark ably finding that a partial range of motion at the lengthen position produces overall better hypertrophy than a full range of motion this seems to tell us that that shortened position which is reached with a full range of motion doesn't stimulate extra growth instead we're seeing better growth with more time spent at that lengthened position we also have researched finding isometric training at longer muscle positions produces more growth and shorter muscle positions now more data with other exercises and demographics are certainly needed to validate this General concept and the effectiveness of partials at long lengths but in the absence of other data it seems high tension around the lengthened position is what's more important linked to this is our fifth and final consideration of the section stretch let me first describe some fascinating research and then we fit this into how you might enhance your pet growth besides this data demonstrating that time accumul ated at the lengthened position seems to be more anabolic we have data demonstrating selecting exercises that reach a better stretch could build more muscle for example seated leg holes better stretch out the hamstrings than lying leg holes and have been documented to cause 1.5 times more hamstrings hypertrophy moreover it is seriously intriguing to know that a recent study established performing this intense Peet stretch produced notable pet growth in fact the growth was similar to that obtained to another group of subjects that train the machine chest fly with these variables of course achieving a stretch during weightlifting is far from identical to holding an intense stretch for a prolonged duration and I don't anticipate many people actually want to start holding intense prolonged stretches regardless I think this is further illustration of stretching stimi having positive influence on growth so what could this information mean for PEC training floor presses are variation I've yet to touch on this limits the extent to which you lower and thus lengthen the pecs so are likely sub optimal for growth this doesn't mean no one should ever do them they could have application if your goal is maximum strength or if you're dealing with some kind of injury or discomfort that means you can't train the pecs at a more stretched position anyhow the key point of this stretch talk is we have variations that can help us reach a deeper PEC stretch dumbbells technically permit you to reach a deeper stretch of the pecs thus although we've alluded to electromyographic data showing similar PEC activity between dumbbells and barbells one Pitfall of electromyography is it doesn't measure stretch based forces so it is actually possible out of all the variations we mentioned dumbbells truly could be slightly better although larger dumbbells can make this challenging to achieve and this brings us to two other variations the cambered bar bench press and deficit push-up both of these similarly enable a greater stretch of the PCS thus although we don't have direct research on them currently it's possible these variations could be slightly better for building the pcks to be as scientifically accurate as possible we must not neglect that virtually all the studies on the benefits of training muscles with more stretch has been conducted on previously untrained individuals and last no more than 12 weeks I mentioned this as there have been speculations that the extra growth from training muscles and more stretch positions is a special type of growth that plateaus quickly if true this suggests training at more stretched positions will just produce similar gains to training at more shortened positions after the extra growth plateaus however this is based on limited and indirect data moreover there is some data that suggests there still could be long-term growth benefits to training muscles at more stretched positions but this too is from limited and indirect data for those who are interested in the weeds of this I thoroughly dissect the current science and deliver my thoughts on this topic at this link regardless I still think training muscles at stretched positions in practice is worthwhile even if those extra gains Plateau we still want them moreover the best case scenario is there still long-term gains to be seen from them this doesn't mean no one should ever have training focused at shorter lengths we've seen that although the overall growth is less training at shorter muscle length still stimulates growth so know that you can still certainly grow from it additionally a technical consideration is that with all else equal training at shter muscle positions generates less fatigue than training at longer muscle lengths for example with all else equal floor presses likely generate less fatigue than regular bench pressing in theory this means you can probably train more with exercises at shorter muscle lengths and this extra volume although not time efficient might go some way to closing the muscle growth gap between shorter and longer length training summarizing this section we've seen that a range of horizontal presses are likely all similarly effective for growing the peegs in including the middle pegs thus you have the freedom to select whatever you prefer here are five considerations that may factor into your choice of course it is also not outside the realm of possibility to construct a sensibly varied program that involves more than one of these horizontal pressing variations remember that we'll be dissecting isolation exercises later on but let us now transition to the upper pck well-developed upper pecs can take your physique to the next level we've already described the plethora of horizontal pressing exercises at your disposal for developing the middle pecs but how effective are these for the upper pecs earlier we noted this paper that found flat barbell bench pressing grew the middle PC by 37% what I didn't mention was the researchers also found that upper PEX grew by a very similar 36% another Australian paper found flat bar bench pressing grew the middle PEC by 10% and the upper PEC by not too far off 7.4% Note the percentages are lower in this paper as the subjects were already trained the study was shorter in duration and a slightly different size measurement was taken nevertheless these papers clearly show horizontal pressing will contribute to Growing your upper PEC but does this mean we don't need any dedicated upper Peck work the answer is no let let me explain why in both these papers instead of looking at the growth in percentages if we look at actual centimeter increases the upper PEC actually grew fairly less than the middle PEC how on Earth could this be it's because the upper pecs were smaller in size to begin with a smaller number to begin with but sees the same or similar percentage increase to a larger number still means a smaller total increase in size resultantly it is technically accurate to say flat barbell bench pressing grows the upper PEC less than the middle PEC now this data is from the flat barbell bench press but we know there's reason to believe this applies to all the horizontal pressing exercises on the table indeed machine and even weighted push-up variations have been documented to elicit similar upper Peck activity to the flat barbell bench press consequently to maximize upper pet growth we likely need an exercise to preferentially train the upper pecs how can this be done well-controlled electromyographic research finds that the ratio of upper PEC to Middle Peck activity is better when the force is directed obliquely upward instead of purely horizontally incline bench pressing replicates this at least in so far as pushing in an upward Direction indeed out of the seven studies that have explored this incline bench pressing produced greater upper Peck activity compared to the flat barble bench bench press in five of them it is also notable that the majority finds middle and lower PEC activity is reduced with the incline and front Del activity is higher with the incline there's occasionally debates on the optimal incline angle for targeting the upper PEX what does the current literature say one paper found a 30\u00b0 incline was ideal another found it was a 44\u00b0 incline while we even have data finding similar upper PEC activity between a 30 and 45\u00b0 incline besides the possibility of the limitations with electromyography measures individual differences could be in play people don't have identical muscle architecture or leverages nor do people have an identical bench press setup so the ideal incline angle May differ between people so if you would like to incline bench press and your bench is adjustable feel free to experiment around it's worth noting incline bench pressing can also be done with a Smith machine dumbbells and a cambered bar and we've alluded to how the extra stretch with a lat to might confer some extra growth moreover feet elevated push-ups and certain machine chest presses where you push upwards likely effectively hit the upper PEC although one caveat with feet elevated push-ups is your head tends to limit how much you can lower yourself resulting in a reduced PEC stretch using some boxes or handles to increase depth can go some way to alleviate the shortcoming though so all of these options likely preferentially Target the upper pecs but there are actually some more perhaps under appreciated ways the upper pecs could be targeted out of all the PEC regions the upper pecs have the best leverage for performing shoulder flexion and well-controlled electromag graphic analyses find the upper pecs contribute more to shoulder flexion than the other regions during horizontal presses using a closer grip gets you closer to predominantly performing shoulder flexion this is best achieved when keeping the arms near to the side and not flared out also using a reverse grip on a barbell also forces you into performing shoulder flection regardless of the grip used we might speculate these preferentially Target the upper pecs yet the data is somewhat split since out of the eight papers comparing close to moderate and wider grip bench pressing four of them find upper peack activity is better with a closer grip out of the two papers comparing reverse grip bench pressing to normal grip bench pressing only one finds enhanced upper Peck activity as an additional note the majority of data finds closer grips better recruit the triceps When comparing these variations to an incline bench press with a wider grip we just have this paper that found upper PEC activity was not stat statistically different between a closer grip bench press and an incline with a wider grip although the raw numbers lean toward the closer grip regardless this might be tentative evidence closer grips could be as good for the upper PEX as a standard incline we shouldn't forget that closer grips and reverse grips can even be used with the Smith machine dumbbells and even push-ups so there is a fair number of potential upper Peck options we'll provide some recommendations in a second I say this because we're not quite done it's possible for us to use a closer or reverse grip on an inclined angle could this be the best the only analysis from the literature is this paper that found compared to an incline bench press with a wider grip an incline with a closer and reverse grip produce non-statistically different upper PEC activity although the raw numbers lean towards using closer and reverse grips on the incline however it's worth mentioning this paper was the same one that found flat closer grip bench pressing produced upper Peck activity levels that were not statistically different from the incline with a wider grip anyhow We'll add closer and reverse grips with an incline to our already extensive list the landmine press and L's fend press are two final exercises worth mentioning the landmine press involves pushing in an upward direction that we no likely preferentially targets the upper pecs however the very close hand spacing reduces the overall stretch of the pecs thus I suspect it's not going to be as good as all the other options mentioned but it's certainly not a bad exercise and it will still build muscle so if someone really likes it that can be enough of a reason to train with it as for the Li's fend press it's essentially a Clos grip press with an intense chest squeeze against the plat the size of the plate means the stretch is restricted and since that's only so heavy of a plate you can lift it's going to be difficult to progress this exercise in the long term dumbbells can be used but this still suffers from a restricted stretch the only scenario where I think someone may want to perform this is simply if they find it a fun and enjoyable addition to their training so we know there's a ton of upper Peck options what's the recommendation we've seen there is essentially evidence for all of these variations better targeting the upper PEC and in The Limited data that has compared some of these there are non-significant differences thus for now I'd simply recommend selecting whatever option you like although it is possible what works best could differ between people for example Greg Knuckles from Stronger by science not his upper pecs get outrageously sore from Flat reverse benching whereas this never happens from his incline experience thus you could experiment with any of the variations and evaluate how they subjectively score for you do you perceive more upper Peck with them is the pump and perhaps the next day soreness in the upper PEC greater than usual now it's critical to understand subjective Sensations are not yet validated proxies for actual muscle activation and we also know despite popular belief the intracellular events associated with a pump and soreness do not appear to be strong drivers of hyper y but having said this I believe it's still plausible when controlling as much factors subjective Sensations like the pump and soreness could be indirect insights to the actual tension seen by a muscle region so in the absence of anything else I think it's not the end of the world for you to try and use your subjective perception to help determine what you may train [Music] with earlier we Des described evidence that the different regions of the pecs can function somewhat independently and that includes the lower PEC regions for instance when the arms are nearly overhead performing a shoulder extension contraction preferentially recruits the lower pecs but is dedicated training for the lower pecs essential recall we've seen data demonstrating that flat barbell bench PR highly developed the middle peek region but the upper PEC region in absolute terms grows less as for the lower pecs both both these papers found it grew pretty similarly to the middle peek region both in percentages and centim therefore it appears flat barbell bench pressing is highly effective for the lower pcks I'm presuming this extends to all the other horizontal pressing exercises so dedicated lower PEC training may not be essential whatever horizontal presses you have could cover you of course this does not mean no one should ever perform specific movements for the lower pcks but perhaps you're constructing a program with sensible variation that means an exercise that biases the lower PEX can fit into your program or alternatively if you somehow find your lower PCS are underdeveloped despite training with your choice of horizontal presses then dedicated training for your lower PEX may be called for so how might the lower PEX be preferentially trained the lower PEC fibers run in this direction and it's possible movements that align with this and press downwards could preferentially train the lower PEC area above the other regions such as decline bench pressing machine decline pressing hands elevated push-ups dips and isolation exercises that will cover in the isolation section quite fascinatingly two electrom myographic studies that have compared a 15\u00b0 decline to a flat barbell bench press found lower PEC activity was similar between them in addition to these two papers there there have been a few other electrom myographic papers exploring activity of the other PEC regions between a decline and flat barbell bench press the findings are a little mixed but some of them suggest that upper and middle pecs as well as the front delts display lower activity with the decline therefore although actual lower Peck activity may not be that different between a decline and flat angle since middle and lower pecs display lower activity in some analyses a decline May fundamentally still be considered a valid way to selectively train the lower PEX over the other regions as for the dip it has the capacity to attain a great stretch unfortunately there's no officially published research comparing dips to other common chest exercises I know this paper compared PEC activity between different dips with the ring and normal dips producing decent upper PEC activity not much comparative conclusions can be made from this and they didn't assess the middle or lower pecks besides this all we have is this unofficial electromyographic analysis that found during a weit to dip raw lower activity what better than the upper and middle regions at the end of the day feel free to try out any of these movements your subjective perception May guide your [Music] choice we can say as an overall muscle shoulder horizontal flexion is the motion that best trains it isolate ated shoulder horizontal flexion occurs with flies including cable machine and dumbbell flies before comparing them could these PEC isolation exercises grow the pecs better than the compound exercises we've talked about when comparing isolation to the compound movements there's no movement at their elbow meaning we're taking the triceps out of the equation you might guess this means our central nervous system can better activate our PEX with the isolation exercises and there thereby produce greater PEC hypertrophy versus compound exercises despite being logical the available data does not support this we know that dumbbell flies are most challenging at the lower part and during this phase two papers find peeg activity was comparable to that of the flat barbell bench press although one of the analyses found if we look at average activity across the whole exercise the bench press actually evoked higher peeg activity this was largely because the activity at the top portions was better with the bench press I don't believe this means bench pressing is a superior PEC Builder because we've already detailed how it currently seems extra activity and more shortened and contracted positions doesn't cause extra growth another analysis found both front Del and pec activity was similar between a barbell bench press and machine chest fly as the authors concluded the results clash with the idea that isolation exercises promote greater activ ity of the Prime movers due to isolation due to this I'd say isolation exercises are likely not essential for substantially growing the pecs over the long term compound exercises such as your choice of horizontal pressing and an upper chest biased compound movement is likely going to be sufficient for seeing substantial PEC hypertrophy in the long term does this mean no one should ever perform isolated PEC training not at all it is absolutely possible to constru a sensibly varied program that includes compound and isolation exercises for the pecs as a simple illustration you may have a flat bench press incline bench press and cable fly not entirely disconnected from this perhaps you deem you have sufficient amounts of triceps training in your program but you want to train the PC more without additional triceps stimuli in this case isolated PEC training is the perfect solution finally I also don't want to rule out the possibility of individual differences averages have been detailed throughout this video including the finding that PEC activity is not so different between compound and isolation movements yet it's within the realm of possibility for some people much of the compound exercises detailed in this video regardless of how they perform it just predominantly taxes their triceps and much less dep picks in fact some research albeit having a few notable limitations point to this thus isolated PEC training might be needed for these people to truly stimulate their pecs better with these reasons out the way how can we most effectively isolate the pecs when looking at cable flies starting with the cables in line with the arms these will provide a greater challenge in their shorter muscle positions this isn't terrible muscle growth will still occur from shortened positions also remember with all else equal shorten training likely generates less fatigue accordingly if we want an isolation exercise that generates lower fatigue but will still provide a fair stimulus this variation is an ideal Contender but assuming your recovery is all good we know challenging muscles near a more lengthened position is likely a great idea having a setup with a cable somewhat behind your body better challenges that lengthened position they can also be performed laying down besides this dumbbell flies and machine fly successfully load the pets near that stretched position there are two variations of machine flies there are subtle differences between them but I don't anticipate they are meaningful enough to impact growth some people think this fly better stretches the pecs because the arms are straighter but remember since the pecs attached to the upper arms not the lower arm the degree of armb Bend doesn't really influence the PEC stretch and assuming we're roughly extending the upper arm compr between the two movements the stretch is not going to be too dissimilar so I believe we can be confident all of these variations can be highly effective you might contend since cables and machines additionally provide solid tension near the contracted position that makes them better than the dumbbell variation but as you know we've mentioned a few times here the present literature implies extra tension at the shortened position may not deliver extra growth others might T due to the inherent Freedom with cables and dumbbells an even greater stretch is available for those who can comfortably get there assuming this deeper stretch is beneficial for growth this could indeed give them an Ever slight Edge now there is widespread controversy around the Deep stretch in flies and with wider grip benching being injurious here's my two Sense on this much of these ideas stem from hypotheses and anecdotal observations which suffer from multiple potential Founders the scientific literature at present has low quality and minimal insight into injury risks from various chest movements of course absence of evidence is an Evidence of absence so it would be misleading for me to make any definitive conclusions until we have higher Quality Investigations for now I'd simply recommend performing your exercises in a manner your comfortable with a handy feature with cables is its height adjustability low cable flies involve flying in upwards Direction the direction we know likely preferentially targets the upper PEC resultantly this is yet another option available to better train this region if you're not feeling it with all the previously mentioned compound movements and or you just want to take the triceps out of the equation low cable flies are a solid solution there are also incline machine flies and I believe we can presume they should be highly effective incline dumbbell flies can also be done but an important point is since gravity pulls the dumbbells down and you're at an incline your shoulders are likely going to be working over time to keep the dumbbells out to the side for this reason I suspect these aren't going to be as potent for the upper pecks regarding the lower pecks High cable flies as well as decline dumbbell flies better align the flying Direction with that of the lower PEC fibers so both of these might potentially preferentially hit this region the final isolation exercise we'll discuss are the controversial freeway pullovers specifically there are Fierce debates about if this exercise is a better chest or lat Builder what does the current scientific literature suggest pullovers involve shoulder extension and freee pullovers are virtually exclusively challenging at the top position at this top position The Lads have much lower Leverage compared to lower elevation angles while the middle and lower pecs likely have some leverage for shoulder extension at these higher elevation angles indeed well-controlled electromyographic papers find during isometric shoulder extension contractions at different elevation angles the lats display their lowest activity at the highest elevation angle while the pecs display fairly good activity at this region moreover recordings directly from a barbell pullover find the particularly the middle and lower regions display higher activity than the lats however I'm not completely sold this means the lats are minimally stimulated I detailed why in our Ultimate Guide to lat hypertrophy but I'll mention the key points here although the pecs are stretched in the overhead position the lats are also stretched quite well we have research finding even if a muscle has lower leverage and displays reduced activity the muscle can still will grow well provided it's at a longer length for example the gluteus maximus is lengthened more with deeper squats but they have lower leverage and activity in this position yet we have research comparing 90\u00b0 to 140\u00b0 knee flexion squats and the 140\u00b0 deeper squats grew the gluteus maximus quite a bit more so in total I'd say there's evidence that both the lats and pecs may be trained fairly well with free pullovers now some people report feeling it more in their lats instead of the chest while others report the inverse ultimately what we need and what I'm looking forward to is research directly measuring lat and pet growth after free pullovers I guess it's not implausible that it could differ between people but for now since we have some data suggesting the pecs display Fair activity you could try this exercise out if it appeals to you and examine your perception so we detailed a ton of information and I understand it can be tricky and very challenging to construct your own muscle

it too to ensure this video details every single relevant study relating to PEC hypertrophy there is one final study that needs to be mentioned 47 previously untrained men trained either the incline bench press only flat bench press only or a combination of both with these variables after training once per week for 8 weeks the incline bench press group tended to see the best upper middle and lower PCT less major growth compared to the other groups in other words just training an incline bench press led to the best results with flat bench pressing or even a combination of both leading to inferior results you may be thinking what on Earth doesn't this go against much of what was described in the rest of this video this is indeed true you may also be thinking since this paper Direct measured pet growth we should consider it as high quality evidence this is typically true but upon scrutinizing this paper further there's reason to be skeptical the pet growth seen in this paper was simply outrageous the incline group increased their PEC thickness by 54 to 62% and the other group still saw more than 40% growth for some regions in fact if we scale to average gains per workout we find that PC side has increased by 4.6% each workout imagine that your pecs increasing nearly 5% after each training session and remember this is the average in the study we're not talking about an outlier subject if we compare the average growth in this study to the rest of the research that has measured PEC hypertrophy we can see just how striking the difference is also remember this study just involved eight training sessions while the rest of the research involved an average average of 33 training sessions this only further makes things more perplexing so what gives although this is speculative I believe the strongest explanation is the hypertrophy measurements might just have been faulty 47 subjects completed the study the text implies the researcher should have measured the gains of all 47 subjects but just 30 subjects actually made up the hyper measurements so 17 measurements were missing the researchers did not explain why but it's entirely possible errors were made with these 17 measurements perhaps suggesting the researchers poorly conducted the hyper measurements with the ultrasound Machinery if this is all true there could still be something dubious with a 30 measurements perhaps explaining these abnormally astonishing amounts of hypertrophy in addition to these confusing gains we can't ignore the fact these results conflict with multiple other papers the study did find upper pet growth was better with the incline which is what we'd expect but the fact that incline group grew the middle and lowc more conflicts with the findings of reduced middle and lower activity with an incline we know this is EMG data but there are multiple of them and well-controlled electromyographic data also finds the middle PEX display lower activity when force is directed obliquely upwards compared to horizontally finally we also have this paper that found that the incline bench press produced a lower midp pump to the flat bench press again the intracellular events associated with the pump do not seem to strongly promote hypertrophy but when potential confounders are controlled the pump may be an indirect insight into the tension seen by a muscle region although this paper also found the upper Peck pump was similar between the flat and incline bench press which I'd say is somewhat of an odd finding as well nevertheless for all these reasons I don't believe we can derive recommendations from this [Music] study before summarizing things what about targeting the inner and outer pecs at the time of constructing this video there's no research comparing inner and outer region growth between different PEC exercises so this is why we don't have a section on this however I don't anticipate this is a major problem based on the advice in this video the peex will probably grow well across its length in fact one study alludes to this trained individuals perform the flat and inclined barbell bench press and we've alluded to how this is a perfectly fine and simple combination for pet growth one group actually held a stretch between sets while another rested passively the stretch between sets didn't enhance gains as both groups saw similar growth but the key Point here is the magnitude of growth at the middle and outer portions was pretty much identical the researchers didn't measure the innermost region but I'd be surprised if it didn't grow at least fairly I will say if any future research does come along about the inner and outer regions I'll be sure to update you all until then it's not worth worrying about on to the summary there is no Musto or best PEC exercise rather there's evidence a ton of exercises can be highly effective there's also so no one programming style that's unanimously the best instead there are multiple paths you could take specifically we've seen it likely substantial PEC hypertrophy can be attained purely through training with compound exercises but we know there are reasons for adding isolation PEC exercises when exploring compound exercises horizontal presses are excellent for the pecs and we have research suggesting all these variations can probably be similarly effective although there are five reasons you might consider and one of them is that the deeper PEC stretch from dumbbells a cambered bar and deficit push-ups might make them slightly better the current literature seems to imply these horizontal presses likely grow the middle and lower pecs very well but the upper PEX somewhat less to train the upper PEX more all of these are potentially great options in the limited data comparing some of these there are nonsignificant differences in Upper Peck activity and as for the lower PCS although dedicated training for this region is probably not essential here are potential options available to you if you would like to train this region more finally here are isolation PEC options on the table and we described how all of these are potentially largely similarly effective if you're after isolation options to better Target the upper PEC these are some great potential options and if you're after isolation options to better Target the lower PEX these are some great potential options thank you for watching feel free to check out the alpha progression app or our recent deep dive into building the LS"

    "transcript": "[Music] welcome to the house of hypertrophy what if we convinced someone their training program was perfectly optimized for them but didn't reveal that it was a lie could their belief alone lead to better results what if we gave someone a placebo pill telling them it was an anabolic steroid or caffeine would they feel more energetic lift heavier and see better gains and what about other underappreciated questions relating to the power of the mind could positive selft talk or even just imagining your training lead to more progress in this video we'll explore the fascinating research Behind these questions some of the findings might surprise you let's dive in this study had 40 athletes trained for 10 weeks one group was told their training program was individualized for them based on their force velocity profile don't worry about what this means it's not essential but you can check out the pin comment if you're curious the other group was told they were doing a generic non-optimal training program in reality both groups followed the same training program the results showed that the group who believed the training was individualized experienced greater gains in back Squatch strength and muscle thickness of the rectus humorus so even though the training was identical the belief that it was personalized led to better results summoning the spirit of scientific accuracy this study is not flawless and is considered just a pilot study the training focused on strength and power and Sprint and jump performance did not differ between the two groups also the muscle thickness increases were fairly small with measurement error and other potential confounders possibly in play regardless this study relates to the placebo effect which is a beneficial outcome that happens because you believe you were given a beneficial treatment the mechanisms behind the placebo effect are unclear perhaps being told your training is individualized makes you put more effort and intensity into your training and Recovery other currently unknown factors could contribute too this isn't the only study on the power of the placebo effect with lifting weights there are even more surprising studies if you followed the house of horty for a while you might remember these two studies but let me briefly revisit them as they still blow my mind the first paper was published back in 197 three 15 trained Varsity athletes trained normally for 7 weeks then for the next 4 weeks six of them were chosen and given a daily 10 mg pill of Dianabol an anabolic steroid unknown to them it was just a placebo after the initial 7 weeks without the pill these were the average strength gains they saw on four exercises after the four weeks where they took the pill these were the strength gains they saw the subjects experienced two to 10 times more strength gains in just over half the time simply by being tricked into thinking they were taking anabolic steroids the second paper was published in 2000 and the author was actually a powerlifting coach who noted that some of his athletes who were 11 nationally ranked powerlifters asked about the effectiveness of steroids which inspired the author to run this study here were the subjects Baseline one red max strength on the bench press back squat and deadlift they were pretty damn strong in the first test before testing strength on these three exercises again the subjects were given two tablets and told they were immediate acting anabolic steroids but they were just Placebo pills this resulted in all the subjects hitting personal bests lifting an average 9.5 kg more on the bench press 12.2 Kg on the squat and 10.9 Kg on the deadlift the authors noted that these Gams were significant enough to elevate the athletes from National to International rankings subjects were given two more tablets to take for the upcoming week of training and all reported increased Vigor lifting heavier or performing more reps than ever before in the next testing session some of the subjects were told the pills were just placebos these subject strength dropped down to their Baseline levels while those who weren't told this roughly maintained their impressive gains tricking people into thinking they've consumed caffeine or even an amino acid supplement has also been shown to improve training performance the effects aren't as large as being deceived into thinking you've taken anabolic steroids but the effects tend to result in squeezing out a couple more reps there's actually a pretty respectable effect from preconditioning which makes sense once you understand it imagine someone does as many reps as they can with 100 kg on the bench press after a few days of rest we give them a pill telling them it's a special caffeine supplement and then test their Max reps again this time without them knowing we reduce the weight down to 90 kg while making it look like 100 kg perhaps we use fake weights because the weight is lighter they'll do more reps than expected thereby preconditioning and convincing them that the supplement is highly effective a few days later we give them the same pill and test their Max reps with a real 100 kg their performance will typically be much better than it would have been with without the preconditioning for a detailed description of a preconditioning study and how it controls for confounders check out the pinned comment summoning the spirit of scientific accuracy once again not every study has found the placebo effect in the weightlifting world but most have and again the effects appear to be larger when people believe they're taking something with a bigger impact the opposite of the placebo effect also exists the nobo effect where a negative outcome happens because you believe you received a negative treatment for example this paper found that electrical stimulation of the quads which the subjects were told would increase their fatigue but was just a sham led to reduced performance on the leg extension so what could we do with this Placebo and nobo literature while it's tough to trick yourself into believing you're taking the ultimate muscle building pill this highlights the potential benefits of being optimistic and confident as well as the potential dangers of negative thinking if you constantly tell yourself you have terrible genetics or you can't surpass a certain limit these thoughts might be holding you back more than you realize while making this video I was reminded of a section in Arnold's book titled the mind the most powerful tool he shares a pretty cool story involving Franco Columbo that I'd thought I'd share here Franco and I were squatting in the Old Gold Gym Franco got under \u00a3500 squatted down and couldn't get back up \u00a3500 for even one rep was apparently just too heavy for him that day just then four or five Italian American kids from New York came in there's Franco hey Franco they were great fans and were looking forward to watching him work out I took Franco aside and told him Franco these guys think you're the king you can't get under \u00a3500 again and fail all of a sudden his face changed he went out onto the street and spent a while psyching himself up he stalked back into the gym grabbed the bar and instead of the six reps he was supposed to do with \u00a3500 he did eight obviously Franco's muscles didn't get any stronger in that few minutes between sets what did change was his mind his drive and motivation his desire for the goal this is a perfect segue into our next topic Franco went out to the street to psych himself up there are different ways you could psych yourself up such as talking to yourself with motivating words and even imagining your self-lifting what does the scientific literature say about the effectiveness of psyching up before moving on to this I actually have a potential way to create the placebo effect for

are three main types of psyching up I'll mention here prepatory arousal is something you do to pump yourself up it could be screaming or pacing back and forth quickly motivational selft talk is talking to yourself with motivating words such as I can lift this weight and you may consider what Ronnie used to do as motivational selft talk wa wait imagery involves you imagining yourself performing an exercise with as much detail as you can must up visualizing yourself performing an exercise from your own eyes in first person is likely more effective than a third person Vision the review found that most studies on these techniques found they successfully increased maximal Force production there currently isn't enough evidence to say if one is better than another and it could vary based on people's preference anyhow let me briefly overview two studies from the review so you have a better idea of all this this 1993 paper had trained varsity football players used prepatory arousal through watching aggressive football videos before bench pressing this resulted in greater bench press one R max strength so watching motivational videos before lifting could be beneficial now this study examined the instant effect they psych up and then we test their strength nearly all of the studies in the review just explored the instant effect but how are gains impacted by using psyching up techniques week after week that is in the long term fortunately we have the second study that recruited 44 trained combat practitioners they trained physically three times per week with these exercises and variables the imagery Group after this session spent around 30 minutes imagining themselves performing the same exercises and variables from A firstperson View these were the instructions given a combined imagery and selft talk group also spent 30 minutes Imagining the exercises but added positive and motivational selft talk during both physical and imagery sessions the researchers recommended identifying and rewriting negative selft talk into positive statements for example changing I can't lift this to I can lift this a control group just performed the physical training sessions with no imagery or selft talk but they did a 30-minute neutral cognitive task after so time was equated between all groups it was found that bench press and half squat strength tended to be best for the combined imagery and selft talk group followed by the imagery group and then the control group selfefficacy and motivation scores followed the same pattern this is just one study so it's certainly not definitive proof pying up enhances long-term gains yet and there's no research yet on its effects on muscle hypertrophy 30 minutes of mental imagery is also a big time investment but positive selft talk is something more practical however shorter mental imagery sessions could still provide some benefits there's a lot of research on mental imagery and this is a whole other video itself let me know if you'd like to see that for now at least we have solid evidence these psyching up strategies can instantly benefit your strength so feel free to try any of them individually or in combination even if it's just a placebo effect well we know that's not a bad thing thank you for making it to the end of the video here's the Key summary points feel free to check

    "transcript": "14 billion years ago the universe began a few minor events have happened along the way but the most important thing is you are here lifting weights you're consciously just aware of lifting the weights but your body is doing something remarkable countless electrical signals are rapidly sent to your muscle tissue enabling the recruitment of hundreds of thousands of muscle fibers in which a Cascade of events including calcium release ATP breakdown the power stroke and thus Force generation occur energy systems are getting depleted metabolites and fluid have accumulated but then you stop and rest before performing another set time may be an illusion but we're stuck with it so how long should you rest until your next set I'm glad to say we finally have our first ever meta analysis on the impact of different rest time between sets on muscle hypertrophy for those who don't know metaanalyses combine the results of numerous studies on the same topic and are generally considered some of the best evidence this doesn't mean they are always Flawless but they can be highly insightful for us to fully comprehend the scope of the first rest interval metaanalysis in human history such that by the end you'll have a clearer understanding of how long you may choose to rest between sets we need to go back to the 1990s on the 1st of October 1990 a month before Home Alone was released and a time period in which supermarkets look like this this research paper was published lifting weights can temporarily increase anabolic hormone levels and the paper found in a group of men training with shorter rest between sets resulted in greater temporary increases in growth hormone other studies similarly find this and since these hormones are related to muscle growth surely this is proof short rest between sets maximize muscle hypertrophy well multiple researchers thought it could be the training practices of actual bodybuilders probably intensified this since as detailed in this classic 1987 paper the majority of bodybuilders recruited rested 10 to 90 seconds between sets imagine that just 10 seconds between sets the legendary Arnold in his book recommended a minute or less of rest between sets but moving forwards to 2009 to 2011 some studies Mark the beginning of a paradigm shift shift instead of merely observing the hormonal responses two different rest time between sets researchers actually decided to measure muscle growth a 2009 paper found in a group of previously untrained men training this program resting 2.5 minutes between sets tended to produce greater arm and thigh growth than one minute of rest between sets this was despite the fact that temporary increases in testosterone and growth hormone at least in the initial weeks were larger with a 1 minute condition ition a 2010 paper had a slightly unconventional approach they had trained subjects perform this program one group rested 2 minutes between sets but another group over the weeks gradually decreased their rest time between sets down to 30 seconds if short rest were definitely better for growth we'd guess this group would grow more but arm and thigh growth was similar between both the 2011 paper had virtually an identical design and found the same thing so one of the papers found longer rest were better while two find similar gains between decreasing rest time and resting for 2 minutes we'll mention these two papers again a little later but as remarked in this 2014 review no study had demonstrated greater hypy with shorter rests except a study published in the very same year it found in older men resting for 1 minute between sets led to Greater hypo Fe than resting for 4 minutes between sets now before you go and crash your head against the wall in confusion and curse science the devil is in the details both groups perform the same number of reps with the same load this is a problem because doing this with shorter rest between sets means you get closer to failure than if you use longer rests which is potentially a sound explanation as to why they saw better gains the fact is regardless of the rest time between sets we use we want to train two or close to failure and this is what the other papers did you know what what else did this probably the most popular research paper ever on rest time between sets published in 2016 trained subjects performed these exercises with these variables after training three times per week for 8 weeks muscle growth was overall better when resting for 3 minutes between sets compared to 1 minute fast forwarding yet another year forward a 2017 systematic review summarized the landscape well novel findings in trained subjects suggest a possible Advantage for longer rests they even mentioned a study that found after trained individuals performed a leg extension and leg press with reps to failure muscle protein synthesis was overall better when resting for 5 minutes between sets compared to 1 minute this was despite the fact temporary increases in testosterone were larger with a 1 minute condition at this present moment we now have evidence to believe temporary increases in anabolic hormones likely play virtually no role in muscle hypertrophy the scientific literature essentially remains here no longer did it seem justified to say short rests are undeniably superior for muscle growth rather if anything we're seeing better gains with longer rests I guess you could say the supremacy of short rest was shortlived and it didn't take long for long rest to be speculated as better anyhow you would have noticed in all the studies mentioned so far we just compare two different rest times but one what about comparing multiple different rest times of course a single study could do this but we don't have that at least not yet regardless this is where the new meta analysis comes into play the researchers used an approach that enabled the comparison between multiple different rest [Music] times the researchers combin the results of multiple studies including much of the papers we mentioned Plus some others we've not yet fully touched on firstly when simply comparing shorter rest defined a 60 seconds or less between sets to longer rest defined as more than 60 seconds between sets muscle hypertrophy tended to be better with a longer rest for both the arms and thighs when the researchers divided rest time into four categories we can actually see the intermediate rest time tended to see the greatest effect so does that mean intermediate rest times are unquestionably long enough it does not the 95 % credible interval what's widest for this rest time 95% credible intervals tell us there's a 95% probability that the true effect lies within the interval given the observed data also the credible intervals of all rest time show substantial overlap and importantly the results of a network meta analysis conducted by the researcher simply revealed uncertainty about the benefits of resting more than intermediate durations so what can we even infer from this data viewing these results from a different angle we can visually see all rest times led to pretty great hypertrophy this underscores how rest time is definitely not the most important factor for building muscle something we shouldn't forget yet we still see better gains with longer versus shorter rests but as for how long is long enough the analysis emphasizes the possibility somewhere around 90 seconds could be enough but don't make the error thinking this is a strong conclusion further pointing to this the studies behind this meta analysis were quite different they included the 2009 paper and the 2016 one but they also included the 2010 and 2011 papers that compare 2 minutes of rest to another group that reduced their rest time down to 30 seconds in the analysis this latter group was considered to rest 80 Seconds between sets the average time they rested but you could say resting 80 Seconds between sets every session is very different to decreasing rest times across the weeks the 2014 one conducted an older men that was confounded by the group's likely training at different proximities from failure was involved and finally this 2007 study conducted on untrained women comparing 20 to 80 Seconds of rest was also included considering all this although the nature of the analysis enabled us to make comparisons between different rest times it's still true we want more quality studies that compare all the combination you may still want to consider that the most relevant and well-designed paper found in trained people resting 3 minutes produced larger gains than 1 minute so what should you do when we consider more pieces of the puzzle I feel there are some solid suggestions we can [Music] make based on all the evidence currently available on Earth we can generally say that longer rests tend to be better than shorter rests but it's difficult to truly say how long is enough but knowing full well that rest time isn't the most critical Factor you could just rest however long you feel you need and many people do this with great success this may lead you to resting longer with compound exercises but shorter with isolation exercises the research isn't developed enough for us to know if the ideal rest time truly differs between compound and isolation exercises we know the 2009 paper finding 2.5 minutes was better than 1 minute used a solid combination of both compound and isolation exercises whereas the 2016 one finding 3 minutes was better than a minute predominantly used compound exercises but a 2017 paper we've not mentioned yet and also wasn't involved in the newest meta analysis had subjects predominantly trained with arm isolation exercises and fascinatingly found 30 seconds of rest between sets tended to produce greater arm growth than 3 minutes of rest between sets although though the group resting 30 seconds did use a lighter load while the group resting 3 minutes used a heavier load this is actually why this study wasn't included in the new meta analysis but we've seen many times at the house of hypertrophy that provided your training too or close to failure reps between 6 and 35 can produce similar hypertrophy so perhaps it's not truly a confounder either way I would still like to see this study replicated before we confidently assert anything r regardless this is the recommendation that may be most practical for most if longer rest between sets are a problem as you can't work out for that long using something called antagonistic super sets can help you save time while still technically resting longer between sets we've dissected this in an older video at the house of hypertrophy considering the conflicting information across the web things can get pretty confusing about how you may want to train I hope the videos at the house of H pery go some way to clearing up this confusion but our

gives you 20% off a [Music] subscription let's say you wanted to train with shorter rests but still want to get as much growth as humanly possible I think there are two things you may find interesting firstly performing more sets with shorter rest could be highly effective this 2020 paper demonstrates this they found in untrained subjects performing the leg press for three sets per session resting for 3 minutes between sets produced greater quad gains than resting for 1 minute but performing four to five sets per session with one minute of rest managed to produce similar gains to the three sets with 3 minutes of rest secondly remember that pretty much every study we've seen lasted 8 to 12 weeks but maybe you just adapt to short rest over the long term so perhaps extra sets aren't necessarily even needed let me briefly detail three areas that potentially indirectly allude to this in the AFF mentioned 1987 paper bodybuilders commonly rested 10 to 90 seconds between sets while powerlifters rested longer when the researchers got all the subjects to train with a workout just involving 10 seconds of rest between sets the bodybuilders were better able to maintain intensity across the sets than the powerlifters potentially due to various endurance adaptations that made them more fatigue resistant recall the 2010 and 2011 papers found that gradually decreasing rest time across weeks was able to produce similar hypertrophy to resting 2 minutes between sets so perhaps this also points to how gradually decreasing rest time enables your body to accustom itself to short arrests finally this 2021 study caught my eye trained subjects trained their lower body three times per week a normal group trains with sets of eight reps with 2 minutes of rest between sets but a Blood Flow Restriction group used Blood Flow Restriction bands and trained with lighter loads higher reps and just rested 45 seconds between sets after 9 weeks of training quad growth as well as slow and fast switch fiber growth was simp simar between both groups in other words this study technically found that a program involving 45 seconds of rest between sets was able to produce similar gains to another involving 2 minutes of rest between sets in trained subjects although very much speculative and possibly wrong perhaps The Blood Flow Restriction further promoted various endurance likee adaptations that contributed to the body becoming accustomed to Shorter rests if you're someone who's currently using longer rest but wants the experiment with transitioning to shter rest and you're not a fan of Performing extra sets the pins comment details how I recommend you do this if none of this interests you rest assured that taking longer rest between sets is perfectly fine after all we've seen multiple studies demonstrating this and this notion of you adapting to Shorter rest is currently very much hypothetical thank you for making it to the end end of the video here's the summary points

    "transcript": "[Music] welcome to the house of hypertrophy well-developed upper pecs can take your physique to the next level we likely need an exercise to preferentially train the upper PEC how can this be done there are actually a number of options on the table including some options you rarely hear about let's start with what the data suggests about the most popular exercise well-controlled electromyographic research finds that the ratio of upper p to Middle peek activity is better when the force is directed obliquely upward instead of purely horizontally incline bench pressing replicates this at least in so far as pushing in an upward Direction indeed out of the seven studies that have explored this incline bench pressing produced greater upper Peck activity compared to the flat barble bench press in five of them it is also notable that the majority finds middle and lower PEC activity is reduced with the incline and front Del activity is higher with the incline there's occasionally debates on the optimal incline angle for targeting the upper peeg what does the current literature say one paper found a 30\u00b0 incline was ideal another found it was a 44\u00b0 incline while we even have data finding similar upper PEC activity between a 30 and 45\u00b0 incline besides the possibility of the limitations with electromyography measures individual differences could be in play people don't have identical muscle architecture or leverages nor do people have an identical bench press setup so the ideal incline angle May differ between people so if you would like to incline bench press and your bench is adjustable feel free to experiment around it's worth noting inclin bench pressing can also be done with a Smith machine dumbbells and a cambered bar moreover feet elevated push-ups and certain machine chest presses where you push upwards likely effectively hit the upper Peck although one caveat with feet elevated push-ups is your head tends to limit how much you can lower yourself resulting in a reduced PEC stretch using some boxes or handles to increase depth can go some way to alleviate the shortcoming though so all of these options likely preferentially Target the upper pecs but there are actually some more perhaps under appreciated ways the upper PEX could be targeted out out of all the PEC regions the upper pecs have the best leverage for performing shoulder flexion and well-controlled electromag graphic analyses find the upper pecs contribute more to shoulder flexion than the other regions during horizontal presses using a closer grip gets you closer to predominantly performing shoulder flexion this is best achieved when keeping the armor near to the side and not fled out also using a reverse grip on a barbell or also forces you into performing shoulder flexion regardless of the grip used we might speculate these preferentially Target the upper PEX yet the data is somewhat split since out of the eight papers comparing close to moderate and wider grip bench pressing four of them find upper Peck activity is better with a closer grip out of the two papers comparing reverse grip bench pressing to normal grip bench pressing only one finds enhanced upper Peck activity as an additional note the majority of data finds closer grips better recruit the triceps When comparing these variations to an incline bench press with a wider grip we just have this paper that found upper PEC activity was not statistically different between a closer grip bench press and an incline with a wider grip although the raw numbers lean toward the closer grip regardless this might be tentative evidence closer grips could be as good for the upper peex as a standard incline we shouldn't forget that closer grips and reverse grips can even be used with the Smith machine dumbbells and even pushups so there is a fair number of potential upper Peck options we'll provide some recommendations in a second I say this because we're not quite done it's possible for us to use a closer or reverse grip on an inclined ankle could this be the best the only analysis from the literature is this paper that found compared to an incline bench press with a wider grip an incline with a closer and reverse grip produce non-statistically different upper PEC activity although the raw numbers lean towards using closer and reverse grips on the incline however it's worth mentioning this paper was the same one that found flat closer grip bench pressing produced upper Peck activity levels that were not statistically different from the incline with a wider grip anyhow We'll add closer and reverse grips with an incline to our already extensive list the landmine press and Li's fend press are two final exercises worth mentioning the landmine press involves pushing in an upward direction that we know likely preferentially targets the upper PEC however the very close hand spacing reduces the overall stretch of the pecs thus I suspect it's not going to be as good as all the other options mentioned but it's certainly not a bad exercise and it will still build muscle so if someone really likes it that can be enough of a reason to train with it as for the Li's fend press it's essentially a close grip press with an intense chest squeeze against a plate the size of the plate means the stretch is restricted and since there's only so heavy of a plate you can lift it's going to be difficult to progress this exercise in the long term dumbbells can be used but this still suffers from a restricted stretch the only scenario where I think someone may want to perform this is simp simply if they find it a fun and enjoyable addition to their training so we know there's a ton of upper Peck options what's the recommendation we've seen there is essentially evidence for all of these variations better targeting the upper peex and in the limited data that has compared some of these there are non-significant differences thus for now I'd simply recommend selecting whatever option you like although it is possible what works best could differ between people for example Greg Knuckles from Stronger by science noticed upper pecs get outrageously sore from Flat reverse benching whereas this never happens from his incline experience thus you could experiment with any of the variations and evaluate how they subjectively score for you do you perceive more upper Peck with them is the pump and perhaps the next day sess in the upper PEC greater than usual now it's critical to understand objective Sensations are not yet validated proxies for actual muscle activation and we also know despite popular belief the intracellular events associated with a pump and saus do not appear to be strong drivers of hypertrophy but having said this I believe it's still plausible when controlling as much factors subjective Sensations like the pump and soreness could be indirect insights to the actual tension seen by a muscle region so in the absence of anything else I think it's not the end of the world for you to try and use your subjective perception to help determine what you may train with some of you may

    "title": "Build Your Forearms FASTER: The Most Detailed Guide on the Web",
    "published_at": "2024-07-01T13:00:01Z",
    "transcript": "welcome to the house of hypertrophy how can we train to most effectively and efficiently maximize forearm hypertrophy with the help of the scientific literature we'll be going into great detail on this we'll mention virtually every exercise wrist curs wrist extensions isometric grip training pronation superation training radial nner deviation training and last but not least curling training let's Dive In the forearms consist of muscles on the anterior compartment and posterior compartment here's a list of all 20 muscles the brachio radialis is one many of you may instantly recognize it extends from part of the upper arm across the forearm we'll discuss how you may maximize its growth later the anconeus is a muscle you may have never heard of It's a small muscle that is actually involved in elbow extension so will actually be trained in any triceps exercise both the pronator terries and pronator cordatus are involved in pronating the forearm while the superator is involved in suating the forearm with the anterior compartment muscles that have flexer in their name tell us they are involved in flexing the joints they cross with all the flex and muscles here they all cross the wrist joints so Flex the wrist which is where where the angle between the palm and forearm decreases it is worth noting the palmaris longus also flexes the wrist as a fun fact not everyone has the palmaris longest muscle according to this text it can be absent in up to 26% of people various tests involving flexing the fingers and or wrist aim to see if you have a visible palmaris longest tendon or not for example this test involve you bunching your fingers and then flexing at the wrist to see if the palmaris longest tendon becomes visible it is also interesting to know some people may have the muscle in one of their forearms but not their opposite forearm anyhow the names of many of these forearm muscles may sound complex and intimidating but let us quickly break down the meaning of the terms so we can enhance our understanding of the forearms it's not essential for you to memorize the names since I'll remind you of the functions of the various muscles as we detail what exercises May optimize their hypertrophy when a muscle has pocis in its name it tells us it can move the thumb so the flex of pocis longus in addition to flexing the wrist can Flex the thumb when a muscle has digitorum in its name it tells us it can move the fingers or toes if we're talking about the foot so both the muscles with flexor digitorum in their name tell us besides flexing the wrist they can Flex the fingers superficialis is Latin for near the surface while profundus is Latin for deep so the flexa digitorum superficialis is on top of the flexa digitorum profundus finally for the anterior compartment what about radialis and naris the lower arm has two bones the radius and olna radialis refers to the radius the flexor Cary radialis besides wrist flection can perform radial deviation which is movement of the hand towards the radial side when you're standing like this radial deviation looks like this naris refers to the Nar the flexor carpy naris besides wrist flexion can perform nner deviation which is movement of the hand towards the Ula side when you're standing like this ol deviation will look like this note carpy just refers to the wrist with the posterior compartment muscles that have extend in the name can extend the wrist which is where the angle between the palm and the forearm increases and you can probably guess the functions of many of these muscles based on what we've already described remember we're talking about extension with a posterior compartments so for example the extensor digitorum can also extend the four fingers there are only four things that will very quickly expand on digy minimi translates to little finger so the extend sensor digity minime besides extending the wrist also specifically extends the little finger indices translates to index finger so the extender indices besides extending the wrist also specifically extends the index finger longus is Latin for long and brevis is Latin for short so the muscles with longus are longer than their counterparts with brevis in the name such as the extensor pocis longus being longer than the extents of pocis brevis now some of you may be thinking I see the abductor pocis longus but where's the abductor pocis brevis the abductor policis brevis belongs to the hand so it's not a for a muscle and thus isn't on the list anyhow speaking of the abductor policis longus this is our fourth and final Point as it's a little confusing and worth clarifying abductor policis tells us it can ab D duct the thumb but it actually can also extend the thumb and contribute to radial deviation here's a table that some may find useful that details the functions of all the for our muscles once again you don't need to memorize this but feel free to replay this section if you do wish to memorize any of these [Music] details nearly all of the exercises most people perform in their training program since they involve gripping onto the load already involves some forearm stimulation vertical pulls horizontal pulls and deadlift variations involve a fair degree of static finger flexion strength to not lose grip and remember of all the fora muscles it's the flexor digitorum superficialis and profundus that Flex the fingers so these two muscles are stimulated with the static finger flexion involved in these exercises in fact it's not super uncommon for people to get sufficiently strong on these movements to the point where these forearm muscles become the limiting factor in this scenario assuming your goal is to most effectively stimulate the muscles these movements typically intend to using something like straps can eliminate grip as the limiting factor during many curling exercises with our base Knuckles face down if you were to shut down the forarm muscles the weight would pull us into wrist extension so your forearm muscles specifically the muscles that perform wrist flexion are work to combat this from happening during lateral raises our base Knuckles are faced upwards if you shut down the forarm muscles the weight pulls us into wrist flexion so your forarm muscles the ones that perform wrist extension are working to combat this from happening depending on your goals training experience and genetics you might actually be happy with the forearm gains you see from your regular training however we can be pretty certain if your goal is to accelerate and maximize forearm development direct forearm training is required the reason for this is pretty straightforward based on the current scientific literature we know to maximize growth of a muscle we want to attain High muscle fiber recruitment levels and tension this is simply achieved by training two or close to failure during most exercises your forarms are typically not the limiting factor so are far from theoretical failure but during direct Forum work they are always the limiting factor the anterior compartment of the forearms is generally larger than the posterior compartment when dissecting the anterior compartment except for the pronator terries and quadratus which are not super large we know the rest of the muscles all contribute to wrist flexion some of them have additional functions but the fact is all of them have been established have great leverage for Pure wrist flexion for those unaware leverage in this case refers to a muscle's moment arm the biceps can simply illustrate this to know a muscle's moment arm we need to know its line of force and the center of the joint it moves then we simply draw a perpendicular line between these two things to get the muscle moment arm here we see the biceps has a fairly long moment arm which tells us it has great leverage and potential to perform its function of elbow flexion and generally the longer the moment arm the better leverage and potential a muscle has to perform movement since all these muscles have great leverage for wrist flexion wrist curling exercises which involves wrist flexion will be very effective for training all these muscles if you could only perform one forarm exercise some wrist Cur would be it simply because this trains the greatest amount of forarm muscle tissue currently there's no research directly comparing different rist Co variations for muscle hypertrophy despite this we can hypothesize what the best risk of variation might be based on the available literature on other muscle groups growing evidence suggests training muscles at relatively longer lengths produces greater hypertrophy than shorter lengths what on Earth does this mean when we move our muscles change lengths for example the biceps is at a longer length when the elbow is straight but at a shorter length when the elbow is bent two areas of the scientific literature demonstrate the benefits of training muscles at longer lengths the exercise comparison research and the range of motion research with the first one example is this 2021 paper from Japan comparing seated to Lang Leos for hamstrings hypertrophy the hamstrings consist of four muscle heads all of them cross the knee joint so are involved in bending the knee called knee flexion however three of them also cross the hip joint this design means these three hamstring muscles are going to be stretched more and thus at a longer length when we bend them the hip which is done on seated leg hes lying leg H Coes involve no Bend at the hip it was found seated leg hes grew these three hamstring muscles more than lying leg holes while growth of the biceps for more a short head which is the one that just crosses the knee and thus is trained at the same muscle length between both exercises was similar between the two exercises in past House of I perch for videos we've seen selecting exercises that train the quads and triceps and long lengths can build more muscle as for the range of motion research this refers to the Joint ankles you move through so with a normal biceps curl moving the elbow from zero to around 130\u00b0 is a full range of motion but we can divide this into two parts moving from around 0 to 65\u00b0 is what we may call a partial at long muscle lengths while moving from 65 to 130\u00b0 is what we may call a partial at Short muscle lengths this 2022 study compared car phrases with a partial at longer muscle lengths partial at shorter muscle lengths and a full range of motion that moved across all angles gastr nmia hypertrophy was greatest with the partial at long lengths being even better than the full range of motion in the spirit of scientific accuracy we need to recognize this literature on Long muscle length training is emerging and developing and more studies are needed to answer specific questions for example is a partial at long length always better than a full range of motion is there a threshold of the long length needed to maximize muscle growth Beyond which further lengthening provides no further benefit finally all of the research on Long muscle lengths for hypertrophy has been done on untrained individuals across the web some suggest there are mechanisms that mean trained individuals would not see greater benefits from training at long muscle lengths but as I've thoroughly described in this article I think there are problems with this argument and we simply need studies on trained individuals luckily there's at least two studies in the works exploring if trained individuals benefit from longer muscle lengths when they're published I intend to update you with the results at the house of hypertrophy nevertheless allow us to use this available data to at least speculate on what may be the best forearm exercises focusing on the forearm flexing muscles we know they Flex the wrist so are going to be shortened when the wrist is flexed but at a more lengthened position when the wrist is extended withstanding wrist curve variations we don't get into an extended wrist position rather we're largely moving the wrist from neutral to a flexed position conversely with wrist hes that have our forearm resting across a surface with a base Knuckles down our wrist successfully reaches an extended position therefore we may hypothesize this variation may be better for hypertrophy thanks to it attaining longer lengths this movement can also be performed with your lower arm across a bench or on your thigh but that's not all we might be able to make this exercise even better recall that the flexor digitorum superficialis and profundus besides flexing the wrist also Flex the fingers as a result these two muscles are going to be at a relatively shorter length when the fingers are flexed but at a longer length when the fingers are extended consequently if we allow the fingers to extend during the wrist curl we will be able to lengthen the flexor digitorum super falis and profundus even more here we're predominantly extending our fingers at something called the metto caroal joint while the load rolls down our fingers we still have some Bend in the distal and proximal interanal joint so the load does not fall out then we Flex the fingers while simultaneously flexing the wrist to lift the load we'll call this a finger flexion wrist curl here's an example of what this exercise looks like in real life some of you might be thinking what if I just performed wrist Co with fat grips for those unaware fat grips are attachments that increase the diameter of the bar you need to grip thus compared to using a normal grip using fat grips automatically places your fingers into a more extended position therefore when compared to normal rist Holes without fat grips using fat grips will train the flexa digitorum superficialis and profundus at comparatively longer lengths but when comparing them to finger flexion risk holes they generally don't attain as much finger extension so finger flexion wrist holes generally still achieves longer lengths for the flexor digitorum superficialis and profundus making the speculative assumption this extra lengthening is beneficial for growing them more this could be quite an important thing because the flexor digitorum superficialis and profundus are actually the two largest forearm muscles so play a large role in your overall forearm size you may be wondering by introducing this finger flexion into our wrist curl although this may enhance the stimulus to the flexor digitorum superficialis and profundus through placing them at longer muscle lengths does this not compromise the stimulus to the other forearm flexor muscles my best guess is probably not although this is not an identical comparison recall we saw of this study comparing cated to lying leg holes seated leg Coes lengthen three hamstring muscles more and grew them more but it was no less effective for growing the biceps for more a short head which is trained at the same length between the two exercises in the same way perhaps finger flexion wrist CES effectively grow the flexor digitorum superficialis and profundus more while not being any less effective for growing the other Forum flexor muscles now you're not going to be lifting as heavy as you can compared to other rist Co exercises but this likely does not matter we don't want to make the mistake of thinking that heavier weights means a greater stimulus a great example of this comes from this 2022 paper from Japan that compared overhead extensions to push Downs due to the precise anatomy of the long triceps head it is actually trained at a longer length with overhead extensions and it indeed grew better with this movement even though subjects lifted heavier loads on the push Downs throughout the study so this is how I'd rank the different rist Co variations remember this ranking is based on inferences from the scientific literature on other muscles so it would be wrong for me to to say this is 100% correct also if you dislike or cannot train with any of the best ranked movements throughout this video and you find it more enjoyable or practical to train with lower ranked movements that is absolutely okay provided you train these movements to or close to faila you are absolutely still going to experience hypertrophy the data still shows meaningful hypertrophy in exercises training muscles at shorter positions I'll also note with standing wrist hes you can also introduce finger flexion which play reles the flexor digitorum superficialis and profundus at relatively longer lengths of course since the wrist remains neutral during this it doesn't reach as long of a length as this variation a time efficient way to implement any form of risk hes into your training is to superset them supersets involve you performing two exercises back to back and then rest before performing this for however many more sets you desire based on the current literature we at least have evidence implying suers setting exercises that that train different muscles is perfectly fine for muscle growth generally Su setting rist holes with an exercise that doesn't involve a grip component is probably a sound idea such as super setting leg extensions with them or any of these other [Music] options recoil the anterior compartment is larger in size so training them is the main priority but the posterior compartment isn't terribly small and likely still worth training to truly maximize forearm size much of the extensive muscles of the forearm have great leverage for wrist extension so it's no surprise wrist extension training is an excellent way to train them the extensive muscles of the forearm are at a shorter length when the wrist is extended and at a longer length when the wrist is flexed standing wrist extensions don't attain a flexed position rather we're moving the wrist from neutral too extended conversely wrist curs with a forearm across a surface and the knuckles facing up successfully reaches the flex position so we may hypothesize this variation may be better for hypertrophy the fingers are already flexed thanks to gripping the load and in this scenario this is perfectly fine some of the extensive muscles have attachments on various fingers and are at a longer length when the fingers are flexed a convenient way to add wrist extensions into your program is simply to supet them with another exercise or even a wrist curl variation [Music] another popular way to train the forearms is through isometric grip training isometric refers to our muscles working but not moving I'll straight away mention that grip training is probably not essential for forearm hypertrophy simply because grip training trains finger flexion and thus just trains the flexor digitorum superficialis and profundus various intrinsic hand muscles are involved too but they are not our Focus today if your thumb is in contact holding the mod then we will also additionally recruit the flexa pocis longus but all these forign muscles are already going to be trained extremely well with the risk hold variations we've dissected but since grip training is popular and since some of you may enjoy training variety let us dissect it in general there are two common categories of grip training the first is normal grip training which involves you holding on to a standard dumbbell barbell or pull-up bar to or near failure far walks involve simultaneously walking all normal grip training trains the muscles at moderately short lengths why remember the flexor digitorum superficialis and profundus are placed at the longest length when both the wrist and fingers are extended the flex of pois longus will also be at its longest length when the wrist and thumb are extended but during normal grip training our wrist is virtually neutral and our fingers and thumb are flexed this isn't a disaster research conducted on other muscle groups demonstrates that isometric training at Short muscle length still evokes hypertrophy but unsurprisingly growth is better with isometric training at relatively longer muscle lengths the second category of grip training grip training with the fingers extended gets us to comparatively longer lengths these involve grip training with fat grips added to dumbbells barbells or a pull-up bar and pinch training with plates or a dumbbell there are subtle differences between these but the main thing is all of them place our fingers and thumb into a more extended position thereby training the muscles at a longer length relative to normal grip training so this is the speculative ranking for isometric grip training some of you may be wondering how does isometric training compare to normal Dynamic training for hypertrophy there only seems to be two studies comparing them the first one was published all the way back in 1957 including the comparison of this biceps is symmetric exercise to dumbbell curling upper arm circumference gains ended up being better with the dumbbell curling yet upper arm circumference is far from a precise measure of muscle growth and we don't know if the results would have been different if isometric training at longer lengths would have been used the second study comes from 1986 and this paper compared isometric to concentric only and eccentric only leg extensions from the references my best guess is the isometric training was performed roughly around the long muscle length positions achievable with a leg extension quad hypoy was not significantly different between all three suggesting isometric training may be able to produce similar gains although I would have liked to have seen a normal Group performing both a concentric and eccentric motions also this is just one study so future studies are necessary to truly determine how effective isometric training is right now my best guess is isometric training particularly at longer lengths might be able to produce similar Hy pery to normal Dynamic training although if future research finds isometric training isn't quite as good as Dynamic training for hypertrophy I don't anticipate the differences would be that large anyhow as we at least know you can grow muscle from isometric training it's absolutely fine to include isometric grip training in your training program if you desire but let's say you wanted a dynamic alternative to isometric grip training in this scenario as isometric grip training involves static finger flexion we would be looking for a dynamic finger flexion exercise when dissecting wrist Coes we introduced finger flection risk holes which already involve finger flexion combined with risk hurling in fact one option on the table is to perform finger flexion wrist curs until you get to the point where you're struggling to curl the wrist up and then you squeeze out a couple of pure finger flexion repetitions with a wrist maintained in an extended position but if you're not a fan of this you can just perform pure finger flexion repetitions as a standalone exercise this is likely an excellent exercise since our wrist and fingers attain extended positions we're training the flexor digitorum superficialis and profundus at long lengths besides this hand grippers and standing finger curls also train finger flexion I anticipate these C be quite effective for growth but since the wrist is in neutral it's possible they are not quite as great as finger flexion with the wrist extended note these Dynamic finger flexion exercises tend to involve the thumb not in contact with the weight so the flexor pois longus isn't going to be trained so this is how we may rank Dynamic finger flexion training again it's not Crystal Clear how isometric compares to Dynamic training but I will say as finger flexion with the wrist extended reaches the longest length of all these it's possible this could be the best having said this if you prefer to train with any of the lower ranked exercises rest assured they're not going to decrease your muscle size as alluded to at the start of this section dedicated finger flexion training is likely not essential since the muscles involved are already going to be trained effectively in wrist Cur variations but since some of you may enjoy training variety this certainly can be part of an overall highly effective muscle building program if you wish moreover the flexed digitorum superficialis and profundus are after all two of the largest for our muscles so extra finger flexion training is not what I'd call a waste of time finally there are some convenient ways finger flexion training could fit into a training program besides just performing pure finger flexion reps after failing to perform wrist flexion let's say you're training pull-ups on your final set you could just hang on the bar for a while if you're training dumbbell or barbell standing curls on the final set assuming the load isn't too heavy you could perform a couple of pure finger curl repetitions with hand grippers these can be performed at any place and time so it can be a highly convenient and simple way to train your forearms [Music] more performing exercises that involve radial or inner deviation will effectively train these forearm muscles that have leverage for this movement but five of these seven muscles are already highly trained with risk holes and extensions the two exceptions are the abductor pocis longus and extensor polius brevis which are probably better trained with radial deviation these two muscles are pretty small so maximizing their growth is probably not high on anyone's priority list and growing them will probably have a trivial impact on your physique so I don't consider radial or in deviation essential but I understand that not everyone thinks the same or has identical goals so if you do wish to train radial or ol deviation here's some solid [Music] options direct pronation and superation training isn't involved in most programs some of your exercises may be performed with a supered or pronated grip but these are not resisted pronation or superation training direct pronation training will effectively train the pronator terries and quadratus while direct superation training will effectively train the superator and even biceps since they function as a superator too these three forign muscles aren't going to be trained with wrist Coes or extensions the pronator terries has some leverage to perform elbow flexion so will somewhat be involved in exercises that involve elbow flexion yet it likely experiences a better stimulus with direct pronation training so if we wanted to maximize the growth of these muscles direct pronation and superation training would be required but considering that these muscles are a small fraction of the forearm muscle mass they are far from the most important thing for overall forarm size and for the vast majority of people that simply care about building an overall developed physique direct pronation or superation training is not what I deem essential but again not everyone thinks the same or has identical goals so perhaps you do want to train them some of you might know that pronation training is common in the arm wrestling world and it's quite interesting to see that Devon larett one of the best armed wrestlers in the world has a highly developed pronator terries anyhow with your forearm across a bench or on your thigh and using an uneven dumbbell moving the hand in this way trains pronation while moving your hand in this way trained super Nation you can also perform both in one smooth [Music] motion as mentioned near the introduction many of you are probably familiar with the bracho radialis some data indicates when the forearm is pronated the bracho radialis helps return to neutral while when the forearm is supinated the bracho radialis again helps return to neutral yet as implied by this paper the primary function of the muscle may be elbow flexion as a result the Brau radialis is going to be trained well in any exercise that involves elbow flexion including horizontal pulling exercises vertical pulling exercises and of course curling exercises it is widely thought using a neutral or pronated hand grip during any elbow flexion is superior for growing the Brau radialis this belief partly stems from the idea that the biceps seem to have their best leverage to perform elbow flexion when the forearm is supernate and indeed a fair few electromyographic studies find the biceps display higher activity when elbow flexion is performed with the forearm in superation surely this then means the braal radialis has a smaller contribution to Elbow flexion with a supinated grip but a larger contribution with a neutral or pronated grip quite fascinatingly the overall electromyographic literature fails to support this although I did come across two studies finding the brao radialis displayed higher activity when elbow flexing with the forearm pronated three found no difference between different forearm positions and four actually found better Brach your radialis activity with the forearm in a supern position for example the most recent paper had 10 competitive bodybuilders perform cable curls with a supern pronated or neutral grip and both biceps and bracho radialis activity tended to be higher with the supered grip as discussed many times at the house of hypy before electromyographic data has limitations so it's possible this explains the surprising results however my current belief is that electromyographic data May potentially be more accurate when we're comparing exercises that only have slight variations such as curling with different grips my reasoning for this comes from research on other muscles some electromyographic research on the coughs finds that cough raises with slight variations between them successfully predicted muscle growth outcomes while other electromyographic research that compares very different exercises doesn't always translate into muscle growth outcomes thus I think it is worth considering the surprising idea that a supered grip trains both the biceps and break your radialis extremely well in fact we at least have one study demonstrating that supernate curl training can be superb for braak your radialis hypertrophy the study recruited previously untrained individuals to train dumbbell and machine preacher cods with these variables both of these exercises are typically performed with a supinated grip this training was not compared to anything else as the aim of the study was simply to explore the relationship between muscle hypertrophy and strength gains it was ultimately found that the B BPS brachialis and bracho radialis all significantly and similarly grew as this study didn't directly compare supern to neutral or pronated grip training it doesn't prove a supernat grip is sufficient for maximizing brachy radialis hypertrophy but it at least demonstrates how significant growth of all these muscles can occur with a supern grip for those interested the study did find somewhat of a relationship between muscle hypertrophy and strength gains but the relationship ship was far from super strong we might have future videos at the house of hyper view that explore the overall literature on the relationship between hyper Fe and strength anyhow if we assume for a second that supinated grip is sufficient for the braak your radialis I think it's possible that some people who report feeling their break your radialis more with pronated curs are getting confused with the wrist extensor muscles during pronated curs the weight is trying to flex your wrist so your wrist extensors are working to prevent this from happening some of the muscles involved in this are around the bracho radialis so you may be deceived into thinking it's working more than usual when you're actually feeling these extensive muscles now this is a controversial take I'm completely open to being utterly wrong here if future research finds Brach your radialis hypertrophy is better after training with pronated or neutral grips but right now my current interpretation of the available evidence is that neutral or pronated grips may not be essential to Max break your radialis hypertrophy thus if your current program includes some form of vertical and or horizontal PS Plus at least one curling exercise I expect this will absolutely contribute to substantial braak your radialis development and might indeed be enough but let's say you have been doing this but you are not happy with its development well assuming other aspects of your training and lifestyle cannot explain your lack of break your radialis growth then you could try to increase the volume of your curve or even though the present evidence doesn't support it you could experiment with neutral or pronated coals as you don't have much to lose before we wrap up some have suggested regardless of forearm position certain curling exercises could be better for the Brau radialis there are two different lines of thoughts the first one is that some analyses find the difference in elbow flexion leverage between the Brau radialis and the other elbow flexors tends to be largest as the elbow becomes increasing L flexed which is at the top portions of a curl due to this some say curling exercises that are harder at higher elbow flexion angles May elicit Superior Breaky radialis growth many regular free curls are already quite challenging at the middle to top parts of the curl and adding a resistance band on top will make the top part of the curl even harder thus perhaps this effectively increases the stimulus to the break your radialis the second line of thought opposes this it suggests since the breaku radialis leverage isn't that bad in lower elbow flexion angles and since we've seen that training muscles at longer length seems to be better for building muscle exercises that are harder in the bottom part of the curl when the muscles are at longer lengths could be best cable curl variations and free weight preacher curls do this that is they are relatively more challenging in the bottom part of the curl compared to regular free weighs and resistance banded curls I will note from the biceps perspective since it has attachments on the shoulder and can be lengthened during shoulder extension it will be at relatively longer lengths with the cable curl compared to preacher Coes whereas since the Breaky radialis doesn't have attachments at the shoulder its length is similar between both exercises so which of these two lines of thoughts is correct there is currently no published research that can help answer this but fortunately I'm aware of at least one study that's in the works that may help answer this once it's published we will update you at the house of hypotrophy until then I wouldn't overthink this too much and I would just select the curling exercise or exercises you prefer if you're searching for further guidance on programming to obtain your desired physique it can be tricky and timec consuming however our highquality partner the alpha progression app can help

a lot of information feel free to replay the video or use the timestamps in the description and pined comment to jump to specific sections but based on everything detailed we can see there are probably a quadrillion ways you could go about training your forearms as some examples if you only wanted to train with one forearm exercise some form of risk hold variation will help you train the most amount of forearm Mass we specifically saw how finger flexion wrisk curls due to them training all the flexor for our muscles at longer lengths might be best for hypertrophy if you're happy to perform more than one exercise adding in a wrist extension exercise likely helps you enhance growth of many muscles belonging to the posterior compartment of the forearm if you're someone who prefers even more variation besides these two exercises you could add in some form of grip training Dynamic finger flexion training or other specific exercises that generally Target the smaller muscles of the forearm finally we know the break your radial is part of the forearm to and this muscle is highly involved in elbow flexion a motion that occurs in exercises that are already present in many training programs such as vertical pools horizontal pools and any curling exercises thank you for making it to the end of the video feel free to check out the alpha progression app or our recent dive into

    "transcript": "welcome to the house of hypertrophy in your quest to unlock the next level of your physique you'll come across certain popular ideas from the bodybuilding realm some have been dismantled by the scientific literature do you still believe them it's possible as they are repeated again and again believing them has the potential to not only hold back your results but even your training enjoyments by the end we will have separated facts from fiction in five key areas and you'll have some knowledge to help you along your muscle building Journey the pump is a temporary increase in muscle size achieved from lifting some think of it as a preview of upcoming solidified gains during intense muscular contractions a flow of events involving increased blood volume and fluid explains the pump some find immense pleasure in the pump a satisfying to me as com is some say maxing the pump maximizes gains in fact popular bodybuilding coach hany Rambo devised the fs7 program including components of higher sets and shorter rest to maximize the pump the belief being this stretches out the fascia to make room for growth multiple highlevel bodybuilders have trained with this method luckily this 2023 paper had trained individuals perform an FST inspired program for the B BPS and triceps the volume was super high and the rest between set short one group actually stretched between some of the sets while another rested passively the result overall arm hypertrophy in both groups was minimal with multiple non-statistically significant gains some even slightly lost size possibly as the higher volumes led to excessive damage that oriented the protein synthesis response to repair rather than growth now as detailed in some other videos at the house of hypertrophy higher volumes can produce respectable hypertrophy but there's good reason to believe the pump's relation to hypertrophy is not strong when researchers have phological induced reactive hyperemia protein synthesis isn't improved multiple training strategies also enhance the pump but not your gains higher reps evoke a greater pump but tend to be similar to lower reps although Super High Reps can produce a tremendous pump but inferior gains drop sets involve performing multiple bouts of reps def failure with progressively lighter loads they will produce an incredible pump but seem to largely be similar to normal sets a constant tension technique avoids locking out the joints and elicits a great pump but the majority of the research finds them to be similarly effective to a normal technique so so what does this mean for you don't worry about maxing the pump think of it as a byproduct of your training not the goal this is not to say you can't chase the pump many of the techniques that produce a greater pump do not compromise gains so feel free to enjoy that pump if you [Music] like time under tension refers to the duration of one of your sets a longer time under tension or reaching a desired Target is often recommended in this case we find that the time under tension that's best for building muscle is around 40 to 60 seconds long take those 15 reps a lot slower than normal to increase the time under tension the popular Mike Mena even recommended a slow 4sec lifting and 4-second lowering Tempo tension has been identified as likely the primary initiator of muscle hypertrophy so you may logically deduce time under tension is important but what does the scientific literature say a recent recent review finds that provided your training hard and getting two or near failure slower tempos which involve higher time under tension largely produce similar muscle Hy pery to comparatively faster tempos on top of this we've already noted how provided you training hard and getting two on their failure the research finds a wide range of rep numbers are similarly effective for stimulating gains most of these studies use a 1 to two second lifting and lowering tempo although reps naturally slow down as you near failure either way time under tension is widely different across this range but gains are similar so what's going on time under tension shouldn't be mistaken for mechanical tension the tension we care about is optimized by training hard getting to or close to failure forces the body to recruit all the fibers we can and expose them to tension this kicks off events in all these fibers that conclude in growth and yes this means both lower and higher reps can similarly involve high tension when people PR long time under tension a lot of that initial time is very far from failure accordingly what we may call time under high tension which is what matters ends up being similar what all this means for you is it's absolutely not essential to prolong or reach a specific time under tension threshold you can do it if you like since it's not inherently detrimental but don't let it stray you away from the main aim achieving time under high tension which is largely no more complicated than getting two or n failure in that 6 to 35 rep range this part somewhat links to the pump a shorter rest time between sets invariably enhances the pump additionally it's been known since the '90s that shter rest between sets transient ly enhances the elevation of anabolic hormones like growth hormone bodybuilders notoriously use shorter rest between sets this 1987 paper established a subset of bodybuilders rested 10 to 90 seconds between sets and this more recent 2013 analysis found after surveying 127 competitive bodybuilders the majority rested one to 2 minutes between sets despite this we have well-designed papers finding that resting 2 5 to 3 minutes between sets actually produces greater hypertrophy than resting for less time what's going on well transient anabolic hormonal elevations do not appear to be strongly related to the hyper process in general it's possible that longer rest more effectively dissipates fatigue that would otherwise limit your ability to expose your fibers to tension having said all this there are not worthy considerations the majority of the mentioned research to use programs heavily including compound exercises with isolation exercises it's possible shorter rests are fine moreover if you are using shorter rests performing extra sets could compensate for example this paper found each session with a leg press around four to five sets with a minute of rest between sets ultimately produced similar gains to three sets with 3 minutes of rest between sets anyhow the key takeaway is despite the common practice of bodybuilders shorter rest between sets are not Superior so if you need to take your time between sets particularly between compound exercise sets rest assured you're likely helping not hurting your gains lifting weight causes micro tears in your muscles your body then repairs the damage and enlarges the tissue this is probably the sing single most frequent explanation for how muscle growth happens muscle size increases as a result of the damaged protein fibers the resulting cycle of damage and repair eventually makes muscles bigger and stronger causing micro tears in the muscle fibers the body naturally repairs this damage by Ming the torn fibers the result is a muscle that's larger and stronger than before a consequence of this is many may feel muscle soreness is essential and a valid proxy to know gains will occur although it's interesting to know there are multiple potential causes of s damage might not just be the only thing going on nonetheless what does the literature say about damage and hypertrophy there are a few cases in the literature where researchers find that a program with greater average damage just ends up producing similar muscle hypertrophy to a program with lower average damage furthermore your body adapts and reduces the damage you see from training over time but significant growth still happens finally although there are speculated pathways through which damage causes growth there are strong counterarguments to them none of this is to say damage plays no role in hypertrophy although it's possible researchers end up discovering it has no role regardless what we do know is it's not the primary stimulus for growth as of right now tension is the best categorized mechanism behind hypotrophy so the real thing that needs to be torn apart is the notion that micro tears are the prim initiator of [Music] hypertrophy the term muscle confusion is thrown about a bit Arnold seems to call this the shocking principle the idea is that your muscles can become stale and to combat this we need to surprise the muscle by introducing new workout variables or unusual exercises what does the current scientific research say this paper recruited trained subjects one condition performed the same program across 8 weeks while another condition switched in and out different training variables across every session of the 8 weeks the result hypy was similar between both groups this second paper had some trained subjects perform the same program across 8 weeks while other trained subjects let a phone app generate what exercises were to be trained for each muscle every session the result Hy pery was largely similar between both groups to be fair sensible training variation over the very long term could be beneficial but we don't know right now even so it's clear frequent training variation in the time frame studied fails to enhance gains for those who've long believed muscle confusion is fallacious you may be surprised it largely wasn't worse but perhaps it's not too surprising as I hope this video has portrayed one of the most crucial things is to train a muscle hard to expose it to tension there's more than one way to do this having said this I still believe there are benefits to not training in an unpredictable and excessively varied manner at the end of the day I think following a consistent well-designed program is a good idea for most people amidst all the noise it certainly can be frustrating and even timec consuming to craft an effective program that gets you closer to your dream physique but the alpha progression app which is essentially your personal muscle building assistant in the palm of your hand can help you unlike other apps that craft garbage

    "published_at": "2024-09-15T14:00:56Z",
    "transcript": "welcome to the house of hypertrophy what are the best and not so great ways to train your side delts today we'll be using the current scientific literature to rank the most common side Del exercises at the house of hypertrophy we have a previous video on the side delts but this is a more updated video that will contain more research and discussion on other exercise variations let's dive straight in there's current no studies directly comparing sidel hypertrophy between different exercises but there are multiple studies using what we may call indirect measurements that allow us to estimate the possible effect of various exercises these indirect measurements are quite controversial throughout detailing This research and ranking the various exercises we will be simplifying things and not entirely describing the nuances and limitations of the research used this will make the spirit of scientific accuracy sad but don't worry near the end of the video I'll clear up the shortcomings of the data let's start with classic dumbbell lateral raises there are many different ways they can be performed but let's first dissect normal lateral raises which involve us performing shoulder abduction straight out to our sides up to around 90\u00b0 with the shoulder neutrally rotated the side out's main function is shoulder abduction here's a graph depicting its leverage throughout shoulder abduction let me explain what Leverage is as it's something that will be mentioned a few times in this video leverage in this case refers to a muscle's moment arm to figure this out we draw the line of action of a muscle and a parallel line through the center of the joint it moves then we calculate the perpendicular distance between the two this is the muscle's moment arm simply put muscles with larger moment arms have greater mechanical advantage and potential to generate joint torque there's evidence that the muscles with the best leverage throughout a movement are highly recruited by the nervous system since the Sid outs have great leverage for shoulder abduction it's no surprise normal lateral raises are going to be great for growing them but does this mean we should put them into s tier possibly not dumbbell lateral razes are most challenging when the arm is parallel to the ground there are many factors that theoretically contribute to what the hardest point in an exercise is but we can generally say nearly all three-way exercises tend to be hardest when the external moment arm is the longest this concept is pretty interesting and worth understanding more as it relates to some different dumbbell lateral raay variations we mention soon to calculate the external moment arm is comparable to a muscle's moment arm but in this case we draw the line of weight and a parallel line through the Joint Center then we calculate the perpendicular distance between them if we do this throughout the range of motion of these exercises we can see where the hardest point will approximately be a simple trick is to see where the moving segment m is parallel to the ground as that will be the point when the external moment arm is the longest is it bad that normal lateral raises are hardest with the arms parallel to the ground I wouldn't say it's bad but it may be unideal at this position the side dels are at moderately short lengths you might be aware that emerging research suggest challenging muscles at longer lengths May build overall more muscle for this reason these lateral raises may fall short of s tier so we'll drop it into a tier some say instead of Performing normal lateral razes straight out to your sides in what's known as The frontal plane performing them slightly in front in what we call the scapular plane could be superior however I'm not convinced this is true the relative differences in leverages between muscles for shoulder abduction in the frontal and scaper plane isn't all that different if anything there may be a bit more front delts in scap plane abduction there's also this study finding that side Del activity was not that different between shoulder abduction in the frontal and scaper planes the numbers slightly favor the frontal plane but as the author's note this small difference may not be meaningful plus the study didn't involve typical lateral raises for now go with your preference another thing I'm unconvinced about is achieving greater stability some say that seated lateral raises or leaning against the bench leads to Greater muscle fiber Recruitment and tension thanks to improved stability there is indeed research suggesting greater stability can enhance fiber Recruitment and tension but this research is not necessarily generalizable to what we care about for example this study varied stability levels on a leg extension by strapping down the legs and torso when looking at research more relatable greater stability isn't always better for example freeway exercises such as back squats are more unstable than Hack squats yet muscle growth seems to be similar additionally there's this study comparing seed to standing overhead presses and deltoid activity wasn't any better when seated of course if you like extra stability that's absolutely fine some find it easier to maintain their desire technique with more stability but it is still absolutely possible to have excellent technique with standing [Music] exercises instead of lateral raising with a shoulder neutrally rotated what if we lateral raise with the shoulders internally rotated as if we're emptying a can of soda or even lateral raising with the shoulders externally rotated as if we're maintaining a full can of soda this paper compared all these variations it was found that both the neutral and internally rotated positions were fairly similar for cidel activity while the externally rotated position was slightly worse interestingly front Del activity was greater with external rotation which makes sense as there's evidence externally rotating can increase the front Del's leverage for shoulder abduction reil activity was greater with internal rotation which might also make sense since internal rotation could increase the reel's leverage for shoulder abduction upper trap activity was also slightly greater with internal rotation which the author suggest is due to internal rotation elevating the scapular more these results are pretty intriguing as they fundamentally suggest external rotation increases front delt recruitment while somewhat decreasing side Del involvement when whereas although internally rotating does increase rear Dell activity and upper trap activity it was still pretty similar to normal lateral raises for SEL activity it's worth mentioning there is another study that just compared internally to externally rotated lateral razes in the scapular plane and it found side out activity was actually much better with the internal rotation so although the magnitudes differ this study further supports the idea leral razors with internal rotation may be better for the side delt than external rotation due to this data I'm going to go ahead and place lateral Rises with internal rotation at the same level as normal lateral raises while externally rotated lateral raises go into B tier now some of you might be thinking aren't lateral razors with internal rotation a recipe for shoulder injury I'll discuss this more later when we dissect the controversial upright row lateral raises can be performed with the elbows bent and the paper we just mentioned that compared these three exercises also involved lateral raises with the elbows bent to 90\u00b0 this variation produced much Lower Side delt activity but fairly decent front delt rear delt and upper trap activity honestly I am quite surprised by the much lower SEL activity and better front activity the author suggested the placement of the forearm in front may be related to the greater front Del activity regardless I would like to see more data on this and we also need to keep in mind these results are specific to 90\u00b0 of elbow flexion I suspect a slight Bend in the elbows probably has minimal to no detrimental effects anyhow these results lead me to place 90\u00b0 elbow Flex lateral raises into CTI but this is with some caution as more data is needed all of the lateral Rises discussed so far involved abducting up to 90\u00b0 but you can go beyond to achieve what we may call a super range of motion lateral raise some refer to these as L raises named after the Chinese weightlifter who contributed to popularizing this exercise although bodybuilders have historically performed this movement here's old footage of Tom plat sort of executing super range of motion lateral raises there are at least three considerations with these lateral raises firstly as implied earlier the evidence suggests that trading muscles at longer not shorter lengths is benefit ficial for hypertrophy so the extra shortened muscle positions in this movement may not stimulate extra growth secondly many naturally have to externally rotate around the 50 to 80\u00b0 abduction Mark to move beyond their head we've seen that external rotation during abduction May enhance frontel involvement while maybe reducing SEL involvement thirdly frontel involvement May further be enhanced since there's evidence abducting the shoulder Beyond 90\u00b0 results in the front deltoid matching and potentially surpassing the side delt in leverage and activity considering these factors super range of motion lateral razes may not be any better than normal lateral Rises if anything the external rotation and relatively greater contribution from the front delts May reduce the side Del stimulus I will say I'm skeptical that the reduction in side Del stimulus is much we after all still get neutrally rotated abduction at the initial portion just like normal lateral raises I think Super Range motion lateral Rises may also be better than pure externally rotated lateral raises as well so I'm going to break the rules and add in a minus tier and place super range of motion lateral razors into them you may be thinking why not Place externally rotated lateral razors into C tier and Super Range motion lateral raises into BP it's a subjective call on my part as my hesitation is that saying externally rotated elri razes are C tier makes them sound pretty bad but we've seen the difference between an external rotated lateral rate and normal lateral raise isn't necessarily that big so I'll keep the a minus tier we mentioned how dumbbell lateral Rises are most challenging when the side delts are moderately shortened but through changing our body position we can challenge the muscle at longer lengths if you lean against the wall the external moment arm is longest below 90\u00b0 of abduction where the muscle is less shortened if you lean against the bench with a lower incline the exercise is challenging at even earlier abduction angles if we get horizontal on a flat bench the exercise is challenging when our arms are right by our sides at a longer side Del length if we're assuming reaching and challenging the longest muscle length attainable is best this variation might be the best however I know some of you might not find this as comfortable or feasible compared to the other options also we strictly don't have evidence that reach the longest possible lengths is always better rather we just have data demonstrating shorter muscle lengths aren't as good as comparatively longer lengths for overall growth so for now I'm just going to generally consider these leaning and lying Dumbo lateral raises as belonging to S tier cable lateral raises also belong in s tier but there are some key considerations to figure out the external moment arm with cables we draw a line through the direction of the cable a parallel line through the joint Center and then we measure the perpendicular distance between the Joint Center and the line of the cable to know the external moment arm you can see how it varies throughout the range of motion a simple trick is to look for when the cable and the segment moving form a 90\u00b0 angle as that will be when the external moment arm is the longest higher setups in their hand High bring the hardest part to a more lengthened position into s TI they go what about machine lateral raises not all machines are identical but there are machines that provide great challenge at longer side Del lengths when the arms are near the sides for instance this Prime Fitness machine actually has a smart cam that you can adjust to change where the exercise is hardest unlike dumbbells and cables machines do not enable you to move the arm across the body but again as it's unclear if reaching the longest lengths is always essential as still Place machine ler raises into s tier before moving on to ranking compound exercises such as overhead presses and upright rows there is something worth clearing up some of you might be questioning the idea of training the sight outs at longer lengths why you might have heard that during the initial angles of abduction it's the supraspinatus one of the rotator cuff muscles that initiates and carries out the movement therefore although the side dels are at a longer length in these early angles it's not activated and we're instead highly training the supraspinatus this idea is stated in textbooks however as described in this study this is misleading the supinatus does not appear to be activated any earlier than the side delts moreover though it is true the supress spinatus has great leverage and displays great activity in early Abduction the SS are still far from having no leverage or activity in these stages so it's very possible training the side outs at longer lengths is still beneficial I'm actually glad to say that there seems to be a future study that will compare standard dumbbell to cable lateral rises though my colleagues and I are working on the first ever study on the side dots comparing the dumbbell side raise to the cable side raise and measuring side Delta hyy we'll of course be updating you with its findings and any other data that may emerge let us enter the land of speculation and detail something you might find intriguing as explored in our last video training muscles at longer length can build more muscle overall but the extra growth is not necessarily equal across all muscle regions I'm wondering if this could apply to the side delts too allow me to briefly explain we've detailed how normal Dumbo lateral Rayes since they're most challenging at moderately shorter lengths might not be as good as lateral raises that challenge the side delts better at longer lengths however when considering the research on training muscles at longer lengths in this scenario I think it's possible when comparing these two growth at the proximal region of the side delts closer to the muscle's origin is only slightly better with challenging the side dels at longer lengths or even maybe similar between both whereas growth at the distal part of the side dels the region further away from the origin is notably better with training the side outs at longer lengths now this is extremely and heavily speculative because we don't currently have any data on SEL growth some people do report feeling the distal region of the dealt notably more with lengthened challenged lateral raises if you felt this or if you intend to try out lengthened lateral raises it will be interesting to hear your experience another intriguing thing is that although we consider there to be three deltoid heads the front side and rear deltoids we can actually consider there to be seven segments something that seems to have been known as far back as 1734 based on an intricate analysis from Australia these are the general functions of each segment for Simplicity we will just continue to refer to the front side and rear delts two compound exercises that will involve the side dels are overhead presses and upright rows how effective are they starting with overhead presses there are numerous ways to execute this exercise I could actually have a full video dissecting And discussing the various overhead presses and their utility for hypertrophy let me know if you'd like to see that but for our purposes here we can can think of two types of overhead presses abduction dominant and flexion dominant overhead presses abduction dominant overhead presses tell us that shoulder abduction is occurring at the shoulder this happens when using a wider grip on a barbell or moving the dumbbells in this way we know the side out's main function is shoulder abduction does this mean the exercise belongs in a or S tier potentially not the start position typically involves around 30 to 40\u00b0 of abduction so we don't don't really attain long lengths overhead presses also involve external rotation if you put your hands in an overhead press position and then straighten the elbow you'll see that your thumbs and biceps are both pointing up we've seen that external rotation has the potential to enhance front Del activity and maybe reduce sidel involvement overhead pesses are highly challenging at and above 90\u00b0 of shoulder abduction recall that at these higher angles the front Del May match and surpass SEL activity having described all of this some of you might be aware there was this study that fascinatingly found abduction dominant overhead presses elicited similar sidel activity to normal dumbbell lateral raises however there was another study that failed to find this and when considering the other data on external rotation and leverages above 90\u00b0 of abduction I'm not convinced overhead presses are equal to normal lateral raises I also don't think they're equal to Super range of motion lat raises either since unlike overhead presses super range of motion lateral raises can still involve a good chunk of abduction with a neutrally rotated shoulder thus I'll Place abduction dominant overhead presses into B tier some might be questioning it being placed alongside externally rotated lateral raises as you might be thinking the extra triceps involvement with overhead presses makes it worse but we have a few studies demonstrating that compound exercises that involve more muscle mass aren't always worse than more isolated exercises for a muscle for example squats highly stimulate the quads and adductor magnet but were found to be as good for growing the glute Max to hip thrusts in one study leg extensions are an isolated quad exercise but are not necessarily better than growing the vastest parts of the quads compared to squats or leg presses things could differ between exercises and muscles but for now I'm not sold on the idea that the extra triceps involvement with overhead presses reduces the deltoid stimulus as for flexion dominant overhead presses these involve shoulder flexion as the dominant motion this happens when using a narrower grip or moving the dumbbells in this way the side dels have leverage for shoulder flexion but it is likely the front delts have much better leverage and there's evidence SEL activity isn't as strong during shoulder flexion compared to shoulder abduction accordingly I'm actually going to go ahead and place Flex dominant overhead presses into deter finally the controversial upright row I'll address this controversy shortly but when analyzing them they actually have some great things going on besides the elbow flexion and scapular motion these involve shoulder abduction with internal rotation we've seen how shoulder abduction with internal rotation actually seems to be quite effective for the side dels being more effective than using external rotation and may be similarly effective to neutral rotation indeed there is also this one study finding higher cidel activity with upright rows compared to abduction dominant overhead presses for these reasons you might suggest upright row should be in a tier however there was this other study that found upright rows weren't quite as effective for sidel activity to normal dumbbell lateral raises but the subjects were women with chronic neck pain perhaps something about the upright row reduces the side out stimulus such as the involvement of the biceps or traps of course we did just detail how the involvement of extra muscle mass doesn't always reduce the stimulus to a muscle but things could be different with the upright row grip width could also play a role as well as this paper found wider grips to be more effective for cidal activity but the methodology of this paper had a slight problem so there's still some ambiguity I would love to see more analyses on the upright row but considering the uncertainty and that there's no other data I'm going to make the call ho and place them into a minus tier which I know a lot of you may find surprising as for its controversy it's believe that upright row due to combining shoulder abduction with internal rotation causes shoulder impingement however I believe the fear surrounding upright rows is not justified let's summarize why here's the upper right of the body with a humorous a chromian and structures in between such as the supress spinatus tendon impingement typically refers to compression of tissues in this space this is called a subacromial space it's believed that abducting your shoulder with internal rotation and narrows the subacromial space and compresses and damages the tissues there but we have multiple areas of the literature that seriously questions this I would like to give credit to E3 rehab who have two tremendous videos on the literature behind shoulder impingement I'll link to the videos in the description but here's the brief summary we'd expect the upper supraspinatus to display more damage from depression by the acromium but it does not we'd expect people with a hook shaped acromium to experience greater problems but they don't we'd expect in those with subacromial pain smaller subacromial distances would link to pain but it does not we'd expect increasing the subacromial space through surgery that shaves down certain structures would help but it does not outperform Placebo surgeries some say given tests that are used to test for impingement involve arm elevation with internal rot rotation then arm elevation with internal rotation must be dangerous but these tests have poor specificity and may have little diagnostic value furthermore there's evidence that internal rotation might actually increase or have no effect on a Chromo humoral distances it's sometimes suggested to perform upright rows to no higher than 90\u00b0 of abduction to make it safer yet we have some evidence suggesting the smallest of chromal humoral distances happen between 40 to 75\u00b0 not always above 90\u00b0 so if impingement was the enemy all lateral raises would be dangerous but they're not there are pushes to move away from using the term impingement and instead just use generic terms such as subacromial pain of course if you find upright rows or lateral razors with internal rotation uncomfortable and painful you don't have to perform them there are many other options on the table you may be tempted to think that experiencing pain proves these exercises are dangerous but the issue is pain is multifactorial there are likely cases out there of people reporting pain from every single exercise in existence but that doesn't mean they're all dangerous as with most anecdotes you can find the flip side with others reporting upright rows help their shoulders so here's the final rankings we put normal lat Rises into a tier but there are two options that might Elevate this exercise into or at least is close to S tier status here's the first option we know they're most challenging when your shoulders are abducted to 90\u00b0 but once you can no longer raise your arms to this level don't stop keep trying to abduct as much as you can this will gradually result in your range of motion being shorter and shorter but this will successfully mean you're highly challenging the side delt at relatively longer lengths research on the cares found this style of training resulted in better muscle growth we've explored that in an earlier video this technique can also be done with a super range of motion lateral raises the second option is instead of raising up to 90\u00b0 you just perform partial reps at the bottom with a heavier weight this will also result in you highly challenging the side delts at relatively longer lengths these are called lengthen partials we've explored the research on them in earlier videos but the preliminary evidence on them suggests they could be very effective for muscle growth feel free to try out either method we use the combination of research on other muscle groups leverage and activity to guide our rankings this isn't Flawless let's summon the spirit of scientific accuracy and make clear what's Limited we use the research on other muscle groups to suggest that challenging the side delts at longer lengths could be beneficial we're going to need direct research on the side delts to be sure we heavily relied on both the leverage and activity data to infer what muscles may experience the best hyper y from an exercise firstly activity is a bit vague but these studies use surface electromyography to record a muscle's electrical activity which is simply the electrical events that happen at a muscle when it receives a signal these electrical events are what precede and cause the muscle fiber to generate active forces there are various lines of evidence showing a relationship between electrical activity and muscle hypertrophy there are also examples where although there's no direct studies I feel pretty confident in how hypothesizing the electrical activity data will relate to muscle hypertrophy but on the flip side there are examples where the electrical activity data does not predict muscle growth when considering this data it seems that the electrical activity data May better relate to muscle growth when we're comparing exercises that are more similar and less reliable when we're comparing exercises that are quite different so the research we saw comparing lateral raises with different rotations may be fairly good whereas it's more questionable and remains to be determined if the electrical activity data we saw comparing overhead presses to upright rows or lateral raises is reliable as for the leverage data various lines of evidence find a relationship between leverage and electrical activity and similarly it might be that there are certain scenarios where it does relate to muscle hypertrophy and other scenarios where it does not I actually do feel fairly confident that most of the hypotheses made in this video from The Leverage data May truly relate to hypertrophy but we'll see a future research can verify or falsify this so don't consider these rankings as definitely true rather consider them as my best guess based on the available scientific literature it's entirely possible something is wrong and we'll of course update you if future research suggests

    "transcript": "[Music] welcome to the house of hypertrophy does this text from the early 2000s reveal the truth about forearm growth it says and quite controversially might I add the forearms are involved in all exercises where you must grasp a bar with the hands there is no need for direct forarm work it's been said that I have the best forarms in the business and I never did any direct forarm work who said this none other than Mike mener there's no doubt people before and after him share this opinion but would you say it's correct undeniably the forearms receive a stimulus from multiple exercises already in most programs and will grow from this but it's likely to truly maximize and accelerate your forearm gains direct forearm training is needed why the literature indicates achieving High muscle fiber Recruitment and tension is required to optimize growth this is done by ensuring the forearms are the limiting factor and we're training the exercise hard enough to get to or close to failure direct forarm training achieves this with other exercises your forearms aren't typically the limiting factor if they are you're likely compromising the stimulus to the muscles these exercises typically aimed to develop so feel free to use straps if needed so what are the best ways to train the forearms we've ranked what may be the best Forum exercises by extrapolating from the current scientific literature before diving in some might be questioning me disagreeing with Mena but remember Mena is just one person with aite genetic ICS and although he seemingly went without direct Forum training as Arnold mentions in his book other individuals with impressive forarms such as Dave Draper and Chuck cypes did a lot of forearm training let's dive in I very quickly need to mention that we have a previous video on the forearms but this will be a shorter video that condenses the key details with rankings I'll actually mention an exercise and details that I didn't before I've actually changed my mind on something so there are 20 muscles belonging to the forearm that can be divided into the anterior and posterior compartments of the forearm the anterior compartment is larger and rist Coes effectively train most of this compartment making them likely an essential movement to maximize forarm size there are many risk variations but starting with normal standing wrist Coes we can see the wrist moves from a neutral to flex position while fingers remain flexed on the bar is this good or bad well a decent chunk of evidence suggests that compared to training muscles at shorter muscle lengths training at longer muscle lengths builds more muscle some might be wondering wasn't there a recent study funded by Jeff nippard suggesting longer muscle length does not build more muscle in trained individuals we've dissected the study recently but the key is this study compared to half reps while the muscle is at a longer length to a 4in motion both still reach the same maximum long muscle lengths and when looking at other research it's still possible that compared to exercises that predominantly move through short muscle lengths moving through longer lengths still builds more muscle we'll be sure to update you with future research but for now it seems worthwhile to factor into our analysis okay all these flex and muscles are going to be at longer length when the wrist is in an extended position a position which normal standing rist HS do not reach additionally two of the flexor muscles the flexor digitorum superficialis and profundus can also Flex the fingers so for them we must factor in both wrist and finger positions to know their length they're going to be at longer lengths when the fingers are extended so since the fingers remain flexed on the load they're at fairly shorter lengths therefore normal standing wrist Coes train the flex and muscles at shorter lengths I don't want to make it seem like this is terrible because we still do see measurable hypertrophy with shorter length training it's just possibly not optimal we'll place them into C tier we can modify this exercise to potentially make it better by using fat grip attachments these increase the diameter of the bar and place our fingers into a relatively more extended position this will result in the flexor digitorum superficialis and profundus being at somewhat longer lengths but since our wrist remains traveling from neutral to flexed it likely won't affect the stimulus to the other flexed muscles anyhow this this partial Improvement means I'll place them into B tier alternatively instead of using fat grips you could just allow your fingers to extend during the lowering portion as the load rolls down and then Flex during the lifting of the weight this similarly results in the flex of Digit arm superficialis and profundus reaching longer lengths again with no real effect on the other Flex muscles there are some differences between the fat grips and finger motion variations such as how the finger motion variation attains great to finger extension but using fat grips allows the fingers to stay at that relatively more extended position throughout the full movement there are technical Arguments for either side but I currently believe it's unclear which could be superior based on the current literature so I've chosen to place both in the same tier Risco can be performed with a forearm horizontally across a surface this variation successfully reaches an extended wrist position and thereby lengthens all the flexing muscles well I'll place them in into a tier these can also be modified to possibly be even better using fat grips to place our fingers into a relatively more extended Position will further lengthen the flexor digitorum superficialis and profundus to near maximum alternatively you can extend your fingers during the lowering portion which likewise further lengthens the flexid digitorum superficialis and profundus to their maximum again there are differences between using fat grips and the finger motion variation but since it's not clear what could be superior I've chosen to place both into s tier with these wrist Coes that have your arm horizontal across the surface it's possible to use a slightly inclined surface how does this change things most dumbbell and barbell exercises are most challenging when the segment we're moving is parallel to the floor when wrist curling on a flat surface this happens when the wrist is approximately neutral while when wrist curling on an incline surface this happens at a relatively more extended position where some may hypothesize makes it better for hypertrophy yet I am skeptical that the difference if any exists would be that large and I would like to see future research on this for now I just consider these two inclined variations as belonging into s tier if you like you could think of these as possibly High tier and the others as possibly low tier but do so with [Music] caution the posterior compartment of the forearm is smaller but it's likely still worth training to truly maximize form size many of these muscles are highly involved during wrist extension the extensive muscles are going to be at longer lengths when the wrist is flexed normal standing wrist extensions move from neutral to Extended positions so train the muscles at moderate to Shorter lengths again this isn't terrible it will certainly build muscle but it may just not be the best I'll place it into a tier wrist extensions with the arm horizontally across a surface reach a flex position so we'll place these into s tier an inclin surface can be used which similar to the discussion with wrist Coes places Peak tension at a relatively more lengthened position but as I would like to see more data I'll place them alongside the other variation in s TI with all these wrist extensions in this case the fingers being flexed around the bar is perfectly fine some of the extensive muscles are at longer lengths with finger flexion if you apply fat grips you would partially shorten them which may not be [Music] favorable the bracher radialis is a fairly large for our muscle it's part of the posterior compartment but isn't involved in wrist extension rather it's highly involved in elbow flexion this happens in all horizontal pools vertical pools and coals this section will focus on coals it's widely thought in instead of a supered grip using a neutral or pronated grip on coals results in Greater Brach your radialis activation quite surprisingly however multiple studies fail to find this and instead find similar activation or even slightly better activation with a supered grip I would like to see a study directly assessing Brach your radialis growth after training with different grips but for now I can't conclude that a certain grip position is better as for whether a specific exercise could be Superior there's this fascinating abstract that was presented at a conference recently it compared incline to preacher Co and notes that Brach your radialis hypertrophy was better with the preacher curl that's not to say incline curls were bad the difference between the two exercises seem to have only been significantly different at the 60% region so clearly incline curls produced very measurable gains it's not clear why the preacher Cur was better and once this study is officially published in full text I'll likely have a video on it but it's plausible it's because preacher Coes are harder at earlier elbow flexion ankles where the break your radialis is at a longer length if true cable Co set up to provide Peak tension at earlier elbow flexion angles may also join preacher Coes in s tier while other curling exercises that are harder at later elbow flexion angles like normal curls may join incline curls in a tier for the break your radialis some of you may be wondering about other exercises such as wrist rollers and rice bucket training I've decided not to detail them here I've described why and my thoughts on them in the pinned Comon as for static holds farmer walks hangs and grippers these train finger flexion and will train the muscles that are involved in this however we know these muscles are already highly trained with wrist HS therefore I don't consider them essential but we have analyzed and ranked the different ways to train finger reflection in our more thorough free forearm guide video likewise pronation superation training and Radial nner deviation training are probably not essential since many muscles involved in these are highly trained with risk holes or extensions again more detailed discussion can be found in our forearm guide video finally in the spirit of scientific accuracy it is essential to make it clear that these rankings are based on extrapolating the research on training other muscles at longer lengths we don't have studies directly measuring forearm hypertrophy yet so please don't consider these rankings as 100% definitely true rather consider them as my best guess based on the current evidence we'll update you at the house of hypertrophy if research confirms or goes against anything said
