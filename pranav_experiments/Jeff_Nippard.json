    "transcript": "your triceps will never reach their full potential if you only do these exercises you see we used to think that press Downs close grip presses and traditional Skull Crushers were best for targeting the medial and lateral heads those two heads beef up the triceps from the front and the side and we used to think overhead extensions targeted the long head which beefs up the back of your arm and hangs down on a front double biceps pose but this new study found that the overhead extension caused the most growth across all three heads it caused 1.4 times more muscle growth than the Press down does that mean you should only do overhead extensions no including other exercises like the press down and the kickback is still a good idea for getting enough sets in plus exercise variety is important for proportional development an overhead Movement Like a cable extension dumbbell French press or modified skull crusher should still be your number one picks though and contrary to popular belief they're not just for the long head"

    "published_at": "2024-12-23T15:10:30Z",
    "transcript": "science-based lifting is when you base your workouts around what the science says is best for muscle growth it's a relatively new style of training the opposite of the more old school Shut Up and lift approach science based lifters do optimized exercises track their weights and instead of always pushing their muscles as hard as possible they push themselves in a more controlled way hard enough to maximize the muscle stimulus but not so hard that you create too much fatigue this is basically how I've trained for the last 10 years but this style of training is clearly under attack the big channels now are all about the science based I'm really tired of the whole science-based training movement I don't think science Bas lifting is good and I don't think it's a good idea I'll be honest I find these criticisms a little frustrating but not for the reasons that you might think you see when you search science-based workout on YouTube I'm the first result if you search optimal training on Tik Tok it's me again so you might think these critiques frustrate me because an attack on science-based lifting is basically an attack on me but that's not why the real reason that I find these critiques frustrating is is that they're not entirely wrong I actually agree with some of the critiques about science-based lifting so in this video I want to set the record straight I'm going to show you all the things everyone thinks are science-based that I actually disagree with and then I'm going to show you the few things that are truly science-based and that I do agree with and by the end of the video you'll know exactly which aspects of science-based lifting you need to pay attention to and which aspects you can ignore all right let's start with the most popular science-based lifting advice that slow negatives are better for muscle growth anytime I hear anyone talk about science-based lifting the first thing I hear is that you need to slow down the negative that part of the lift where you're lowering the weight back down but do slow negatives actually build more muscle well let's see this study had people train their biceps with preacher curls for 7 weeks one group did a normal 1second negative the other group did a slow 4C negative after 7 weeks both groups grew the same amount of muscle this study had people do squats with either a two second negative or a slow 4C negative both groups grew the same amount of muscle and this study had people do leg extensions one leg at a time one leg used a normal 1second negative the other leg used a slow 3se second negative both legs threw the same that's three studies showing that a normal 1 to2 second negative works just as well as a slower 3 to 4 second negative now some of you may object that Mike isrel preaches slow negatives and he's an expert slow slow slow slow and yes Mike is an expert and I value his opinion so I wanted to give him a call and ask him why so Mike uh based on the workouts we've had together I've gathered that you like to use slower negatives could you explain your rationale behind that yeah that's a great question there are a few layers of rationale it's a little bit nuanced and so sometimes I think I get understandably kind of interpreted by other people as like just cart blanch advocating slow negatives a lot of people will assume that I think there's a direct hypertrophy benefit to them and I don't think that but there are some good reasons to use a slower negative I can tell you like okay slowing down your negative doesn't directly cause any more muscle growth but it's substantially safer all of a sudden it's like okay so there's no downside really but there's an upside of safety like okay that sounds pretty cool that sounds like an interesting thing to really think about the other thing is a lot of people have trouble with a mind muscle connection they can't feel their pecs working their biceps working whatever their muscle the group they're doing it's a it's a situation and the mind muscle connection does not produce these crazy differences in hypertrophy but in some individuals it can produce substantial differences small but notable ones and that can help just out of curiosity like in your own training how long would you say each negative takes you on average 2 seconds maybe one to two seconds really okay that's not that slow though well yeah it's not it's just enough to control the load and enough for me to feel pretty safe okay perfect okay so we're actually there's not as much space between us as I as I thought on that um I think in our workouts you've probably instructed me to slow down because I'm I'm I am new to a lot of the techniques that you guys use so I think those are great reasons to use slower negatives and Mike and I are actually more alike on this than I realized even though slowing down the negative can help you lock in your Technique better for sure I think we both agree that controlling the negative is the most important thing it doesn't necessarily need to be super slow this year I was an author on a scientific review of optimal lifting technique and we found that as long as each rep lasts 2 to 8 seconds in total you're good so here's what you need to know if your negatives last less than 1 second they're too fast you should slow them down and control the weight better if your negatives last 1 to 7 seconds or so you're in The Sweet Spot in this Zone I think it's up to your personal preference how slow you go but if your negatives last 8 seconds or longer they're probably too slow and you'd be better off speeding them up a bit so I'm not quitting on slow negatives altogether but I am quitting the idea that you need to go really slow to maximize hypertrophy another very popular science-based Trend involves technique tips and tweaks the idea here is that you modify exercises in a specific science-based way and you'll build more muscle I use some of these little tips and tweaks myself like setting the seat back on leg extensions staying in the stretched half on calf raises and raising the cable height on lateral raises but it goes well beyond that you cannot open social media without being flooded with a new spin on a common exercise so the question is are these tips and tweaks actually science-based and how much of a difference do they actually make well I think it depends on the specific tip in question some of these tips do work and are based on some direct peer-reviewed evidence some of them might work but are based on more indirect evidence and some probably don't work at all or at least aren't based on any science so to make this as clear as possible I made this table I took every queue I could find on social social media and put them into one of three categories cues that work and are based on science cues that might work and are based on indirect science and cues that probably don't work or at least don't have any science behind them I included the scientific reference for cues that have one and I'll highlight all the cues that I actually do myself in blue so you can pause and screenshot if you want to read but the reality is all of these tips and tweaks every one of them even the science-based ones will have a relatively minor impact on your gains and none of these tips and tweaks are as important as simply pushing yourself hard and doing enough volume but that's just the tip of the iceberg because it's not just tips and tweaks that people associate with science-based lifting science-based lifting has become synonymous with perfect technique in general let me prove that to you which of these two techniques looks more science-based to you I'm doing perfect strict technique on the left and Sam is doing loose cheating technique on the right most people would say that my technique is more science-based but why as of now there's never been a study comparing strict technique to loose technique future science could show that loose cheat reps actually cause more growth than perfect strict reps we don't know and until that study comes out it'd be misleading to say that perfect strict form is more science-based luckily we won't have to wait very long for that study because I'm helping run it now at Leman College in New York now of course when you do any exercise there are a few basic technique guidelines that you should follow so you can do the exercise safely and effectively for example on a squat you don't want to fall backward or fall forward so you should try to keep the bar in line with the middle of your foot you should try to keep a relatively neutral spine although a little buttwink at the bottom isn't worth freaking out about and you should get as deep as you comfortably can because squatting deep does seem to cause more quad growth and glute growth but the exact angle you point your toes in the specific stance width you take and whether you put your thumb on top or bottom will in all likelihood have a very small impact on your gains these things can help you feel more comfortable with the lift but the reality is if you're in the gym squatting with a High effort each week your legs are going to grow the same goes for the lap pull down many science based lifters think that if they just take the perfect grip width and point their elbows in exactly the right direction they're going to unlock a whole new level of gence probably not grab the bar lock yourself into the seat pull the bar down to your chest control the weight on the way up and push the set hard if you do that your back is going to grow and technique refinements beyond that are ultimately just guesses I personally don't have a problem with people making those guesses especially if they're educated guesses there's nothing wrong with telling someone to take a closer grip to Target their lats from a different angle or to lean back a bit more to Target the midback but if we're being real pretty much all of training technique is so much more of an art than it is a science at least for now but coaching should be a blend of Science and experience so that's okay but there's an element of perfect technique that isn't okay and it's this unrealistic expectation that there should never be any change in your Technique from your first rep to your last rep let's say on rep one you get the bar all the way down to your chest by the time you get to rep 10 you can't quite get the bar all the way down it's about 1 in away that means rep 10 looks a little different from rep 1 so as a science-based lifter you end the set there but if you do that you're leaving quite a few reps in the tank in my opinion just because the range of motion was one in less doesn't mean you need to terminate the set that's why I love Sam solic style of lap pull Downs where he keeps going even after he can't complete a full rep when you're pushing really hard some of your reps might look a little ugly in my book that's totally fine but I do think you should still keep your form somewhat consistent from week to week for tracking progress if your Technique gets sloppier and sloppier over time you'll still make gains but you're probably not progressing the target muscle as much as you think now out of everything science-based lifting is most famous for optimal exercises optimal exercises claim to be better for muscle growth based on scientific studies but what are those studies exactly well let's see by comparing two very different back exercises the half kneeling one arm cable appp pull down and the over barbell row most people think of the one arm Cable app pull down as the more science-based exercise and the barbell row as the more hardcore exercise maybe that's understandable after all in my back tier list video I put the one arm half kneeling lap pull down in s tier and the barbell row in B tier and that led to reactions like this one that's s tier that's s tier on the movement that is not s tier that reaction kind of makes sense honestly because the way I ranked these exercises many people understandably thought that I think You' be build a bigger back with the one arm cable pull down than with the barbell row but I don't think that and I didn't think that when I made the tier list video if you were forced to do just one of these exercises for the rest of your life I would 100% pick the barbell row that's because it's a compound movement that'll activate all the muses in your back by contrast the one arm lat pull down will specifically isolate one muscle in your back your lats these are different tools for different jobs I'd pick the barbell row if I was training someone limited on time and who needed to get the most bang for their buck especially pick it if they were trying to get stronger but I'd pick the one arm lap pull down for someone who's already hit their basic compound lift and needed a little extra volume for their lagging lats that one arm lat pole will add more lat volume for basically no fatigue it's perfect for that the reason I put the barbell row in B tier is because I think there's a better tool for the same job the deficit penl row does the same job as the barbell row plus a bigger stretch and a more standardized range of motion and a chest supported machine row does the same job as the barbell row but with more stability and less fatigue in retrospect I just wasn't clear enough on what the tiers meant so a lot of people thought that the S tier exercises were the most science-based exercises at exercises were a little less science-based and BTR and Below were basically just Bro Science that's not true though there's honestly just not much science on exercise selection at all it may shock you to learn that there's never been a single study that has measured back muscle hypertrophy directly not one there's just biomechanics research and EMG studies and we don't even know if EMG predicts hypertrophy so my tier list rankings mainly came from indirect evidence and personal experience and now having done the series I think it'd be more accurate to think of the tier list as going from slightly more effective to slightly less effective but you need to realize that as long as you take any exercise to failure or close to failure that exercise will build muscle from there you can fine-tune Things based on stretch tension overload and what feels good but I do think the exact exercises you pick are less important than simply training hard and doing enough volume training hard and doing enough volume is what hypertrophy science is really all about I mean just look at all the hypertrophy studies on training volume alone and compare that to all the hypertrophy studies on the optimal bench angle for PEC growth so I'm going to go a little deeper on these two topics training hard and doing enough volume when it comes to training hard this is what the science shows the latest meta analysis took 15 studies pulled them together and compared the muscle growth from groups going to failure versus group not going to failure this graph shows their overall findings as you can see as you get closer and closer to failure you do get more muscle growth but there's a point where too much failure training can cause recovery issues I think as long as you're getting one to three reps shy of failure you're good but the problem is if you always leave three reps in the tank you might accidentally be leaving five or six reps in the tank without realizing it that under exertion will cost you gains so I like to play it a little safe and get a little closer to failure than I probably need to they usually leave one or two reps in the tank on most sets and then push my last set all the way to failure assuming it's an exercise I can fail safely on how hard you push is your training quality how many sets you do is your training quantity you need both quality and quantity for maximum gains so for maximum gains how many sets should you do well in the research this is called training volume and it's the number of hard sets you do per muscle per week for example if you do five sets for your chest per week you do low volum volume training if you do 10 sets for your chest per week you do moderate volume training and if you do 20 plus sets for your chest per week you do high volume training I'd call 30 plus sets per muscle per week ultra high volume training luckily we Now understand the relationship between volume and muscle growth so much better than ever before a brand new training volume meta analysis was just published a few weeks ago with a ton of super impressive data analysis across 35 studies they found that doing more volume did in fact cause more muscle growth and that was true all the way up to 42 sets per muscle per week that's an insanely high borderline in practically high level of volume and the gains are diminishing but it's nonetheless true that the more work you do the better gains you get at least in the short term and that's the crucial caveat with this research it's still unclear how these different volumes play out over the long term that's because most of these studies only last 6 to 10 weeks so for 6 to 10 weeks or so yeah doing high volume causes more gains but we don't know for sure if that's true over time for that reason I think the volume sweet spot is still in this range for most people 8 to 20 sets per muscle per week if you really want to bring up a lagging body part like your chest for example you could blast it with super high volume for a month or two going as high as 30 sets per week and as long as you reduce your volume for other body parts you should recover fine and make some sweet pet gains but remember if you don't have all day to train the research still shows that even just four sets per muscle per week can get the job done as long as you push those sets hard and if you take one message away from this video I hope is that your training doesn't need to be perfect to be effective I know some people in my audience get paralysis by analysis they want to figure out every little thing about training before getting to work I think it's cool to try to figure out every little thing I do that myself but the reality is the best program isn't always the most optimal one it's the one you'll actually stick to so it's totally fine if you drop your strict RP adherence and do some Feld based sets every now and then it's also totally fine if you do some workouts that are suboptimal on paper but just more fun in the gym it's cool if you do some sheet reps at the end of some sets because it helps you get in the zone none of these things are in conflict with smart training because smart training is mostly about training hard and being consistent I start my new book the muscle ladder with a chapter on sustainability and then there's a big chapter on mindset these two principles form the rails of the ladder and then all the other variables like technique exercise selection effort and volume make up the 10 rungs of the ladder it's a huge hard cover book with super high quality print full color images and diagrams plus 20 training programs so I'll link it in the description box down below I also want to quickly mention that my nutrition app macr factor is doing a massive $100,000 transformation contest starting January 1st to enter all you need to do is download macro factor and enter the contest through the link below the person with the best transformation will win $50,000 and then 100 other people will also win a $500 cash prize it's a huge opportunity to not only transform your Physique in the new year but also have a pretty good shot at winning some cash so I'll link that in the description box as well all right that's it for this one guys don't forget to leave me a thumbs up if you enjoyed the video subscribe if you haven't already and I'll see you all here in

    "transcript": "Sam solic is by far the biggest Fitness influencer in the world at the moment so I decided to analyze every single workout he's done this year so far he's done 460 sets 15% of those sets were for his chest 20% for his back and 16% for his biceps interestingly only 11% of Sam's total training was for his quads yet 25% went to his triceps one quarter of Sam's total training is triceps training yet Anatomy research tells is that the triceps are less than 4% of total body muscle while the quads are by far the biggest muscle in the body at almost 30% of total body muscle also Sam trains to failure 96% of the time but almost all of his sets not taken to failure were for his forearms so if we ignore the forearm work fully 98% of Sam's training was done all the way to muscular failure I also examined the range of motion he used on every set the most common rep range he used and using all this information in this video I'm going to to provide the most analytical science-based critique of Sam sik's training on the internet I'm going to do that by highlighting three good things that you should definitely apply to your own training and three bad things that I think are either a waste of time or will give you suboptimal results now I'm going to start with the bad stuff but keep in mind that I will be going over the good stuff as well and there's one thing in particular that I think Sam does better than any Fitness influencer that I'm aware of and I'll get to that later in the video first after watching days worth of Sam solic videos the first thing I noticed is that his technique could be better Sam is obviously a big proponent of what he calls ego lifting which is when you simply try to move the weight allowing yourself to swing and sway rather than being really strict with your form and Sam definitely does more than his fair share of cheat reps now I would say that I'm actually less of a technique junkie than most science-based coaches I think that you can still get solid gains with so-called bad form as long as you're pushing yourself hard but I still doubt those gains will be optimal in fact I recently published a study on optimal training technique for muscle growth and we discovered that there are two main things to focus on when it comes to lifting technique the main thing is that you need to use a range of motion that gets the muscle into a deep stretch on this point I'm giving Sam a B minus Sam doesn't always use a full range of motion for sure but that's okay as long as you're getting the muscle into a deep stretch and while Sam often does get the muscle fully stretched there are too many times when he doesn't to get an a rate for example on the incline press here he's stopping at least 3 or 4 Ines away from his chest which isn't the end of the world but it isn't ideal I'd rather see him strip the weight back and touch the bar to his chest so he can really feel that deep stretch in his pecs and here on preacher curls you can see that he's cutting out the bottom quarter of the range of motion where his biceps would be the most stretched and we now have two studies showing that on this exact exercise the bottom half of the curl is the most anabolic part of the range of motion so if you're cutting out the bottom part I would say that you're missing out on some potential gains in fact whenever I do preacher curls these days I just stay in the bottom half the entire time the other thing we found in our study is that it's important to control the negative rather than just letting the weight freef fall so when it comes to controlling the negative Sam gets a B+ he usually does control the negative pretty well even when he uses some momentum to get the weight moving but there are also just too many examples of him letting the weight free fall to get him an a grade ideally as he gets closer to failure he'd make a conscious effort to resist the weight on the negative always being in control especially on that final rep where muscle activation is the highest overall I'll give Sam a b-grade on training technique the next thing I quickly noticed is that Sam will more or less just completely Wing his workouts he doesn't have a structured training plan he hops in the car roughly Maps out a workout in his head on the way to the gym and then he'll even often improvise the workout in the moment based on how he's feeling the problem with basing your workouts around whatever you're feeling that day is that it's really hard to guarantee that you're actually progressing if you're just picking different exercises at random you'll quickly hit a plateau and start spinning your wheels in the gym in fact I would say that this is the number one thing that causes people to fall into that dreaded lifetime intermediate category after getting past the Newbie phase in order to keep making progress after your first year of lifting it's crucial that you use Progressive overload all Progressive overload means is that you add something to your workouts over time that's usually done by adding some weight or a rep to each exercise but if you're just randomly switching exercises in and out what'll happen is when it's time to hit that same exercise again you end up just doing the same weight and the same reps that you did last time this is truly a progress killer now elephant in the room Sam is clearly still making gains just fine and an intuitive approach to training can clearly work for some people especially if you have gr genetics or supplemental enhancement in fact the supplement aspect of this is pretty big with the right anabolic enhancement you can make gains even while training suboptimally in fact research shows that you can build muscle without even training at all as long as you're taking the right substances enhancing is kind of like getting a second newbie phase where really anything you do will work but even with enhancement once you eventually reach that plateau again you have two options get smarter and more structured with your training or increase the dose of anabolics obviously the safest solution is to get a plan put it on paper or put it in your phone and track the weight and the number of reps you do I personally do this for every exercise but even just doing it for your heavy compound lifts would make a huge difference so for example you can track your squats presses and heavy pulls and then kind of wing it for the lighter isolation stuff like curls lateral raises and chest flies now to Sam's credit you do want to give yourself the freedom to switch exercises in and out if you're feeling pain or if you're just really in the mood for something different for example Sam immediately switched his chest workout to a back workout after feeling his chest tighten up in this workout on January 8th I think that's a smart move but for the most part you do want to keep most of your exercises and most of your workouts the same for at least a month or two so you can make sure that you're adding some weight or some reps to those exercises also to be fair Sam could totally be tracking his workouts off camera but I didn't hear any mention of that from any of the videos that I watched and I definitely got the impression that most of the time he's just completely winging it overall I'm giving Sam a C+ on program structure third Sam uses a body part split or what many would call a bro split this is where you train only one muscle per workout so he'll do chest one day then back the next day then he'll do an arm day and then a leg day there's two main issues with this first as you can tell it ends up being very disproportionate in terms of how much volume each muscle gets so far this year Sam has done 113 sets for his triceps and only nine sets for his calves and just six sets for his glutes and his tricep volume is more than double his quad volume despite the quads being eight times bigger now Sam has said that he's trying to focus on his triceps right now but this is fairly normal for a bro split because you have at least three upper body days for every one leg day yet from an anatomical standpoint your legs have way more total musculature than your upper body and it's not even close so unless you already have great leg genetics your legs may start to lag behind on this split there's also an issue with junk volume in this workout from January 21st Sam did 13 sets for for his chest plus two drop sets but the best studies tell us that you tend to max out the amount of growth that you can get for a single muscle somewhere around six to eight sets per workout so after you've done six to eight sets for a single muscle in one workout any more sets that you do after that probably aren't doing much this is why some people call it junk volume so rather than wasting all that energy doing 13 sets in one workout for one muscle I'd suggest splitting that volume in half and putting six sets on one day and seven sets on another day day now it's possible that because Sam is just so big he can use more volume in a single workout than you or me and I guess it's worth mentioning that probably 90 plus% of ifpb Pros do follow the same split as Sam so it could be that if you get to that unnaturally high level of muscular development the rules change or that with enough enhancement the rules don't really matter anymore that said when I spoke with Dr Mike isrel about this someone who I'd consider an expert on both the natural and enhanced side of bodybuilding he said that enhanced guys would also also be better off following a more science-based training split that could be a push pull leg split or an upper lower split or even a full body split I think that those are all better options for the vast majority of people again because they allow for a more even distribution of your volume across your body and they're less likely to lead to so-called junk volume overall I'm going to give Sam a C+ on his training split okay let's dig into the good stuff first to his credit Sam trains very hard this is extremely important if your goal is to maximize muscle growth beyond the beginner stage and I do think that simply training hard is more important than any of the previous stuff I talked about you can optimize everything else on paper if you don't push your sets hard it doesn't really matter that said too much of a good thing can be bad and in this case I think it might be Sam goes to failure a little too much for my taste like I said Sam has done 460 sets so far this year and 440 of them were all out sets to failure I do think most people would run into recovery issues with that much failure training for me only about 30% of my training is taken to failure I usually do three sets per exercise and I'll take the last set all the way to failure on my first two sets I leave one or two reps in the tank keep in mind one or two reps in the tank is still very hard training I see people leaving 10 plus reps in the tank all the time at my gym even serious dedicated bodybuilders but yeah I think a combination of failure and non-failure training is smarter than just going to failure all the time that way you still regularly get to remind yourself what failure feels like but you're not doing it so much that it hurts your recovery but even though he does take it a too far in my opinion I'm still counting Sam's High effort as a good thing because he seems to genuinely enjoy failure training he does seem to be recovering from it for the most part and even though he has had a few injuries it's hard to say if that's due to failure training per se or the super high loads that he's using or something else so even though I'd personally tone back on it failure training is still far better than sandbagging your workouts and not putting any real effort in so given his preference for failure training and what seems to be adequate recovery I'm going to go ahead and give Sam an a grade on effort the second good thing is that Sam uses smart rep ranges when I analyzed the number of reps he did on every set this was how it broke down 11% of his sets were in the 0 to3 rep range 40% in the 4 to7 rep range another 40% in the 8 to 12 rep range and 9% was above 13 reps so clearly the majority of his training is coming from a moderate rep Zone from 4 to 12 reps and for hypertrophy I think this is great all rep ranges can in theory lead to similar muscle growth however doing too much High Reps can be very exhausting and doing too much Low Reps may give you unnecessary joint strain I think I do a little more High rep work than Sam does just because there are studies showing that using a variety of rep ranges is better than only doing one rep range but overall this is pretty bang on for someone whose main goal is muscle growth I'm going to give Sam a a grade on his rep ranges lastly and most importantly Sam clearly loves training probably more than any Fitness influencer that I'm aware of he's super consistent he does exercises that he enjoys and he has a good time in the gym obviously hard workouts require discipline and there will always be days when you don't feel like going to the gym but finding ways to make your workouts more enjoyable is always a good thing and Sam clearly has that mastered and he gets a a double Plus for sustainability and enjoyment and even though I was kind of tough on Sam in this video because I wanted to give him a rigorous science-based critique All Things Considered I think Sam deserves a b-grade for his training overall even though there are areas that could be more optimized I personally rank sustainability and enjoyment and effort so highly that his high score there does boost his overall grade from me and even though I didn't get a chance to talk about Sam's diet in this video comment below if you'd like me to do that in a future video and in the meantime you can download my nutrition app macroaxis like having me as your own personal nutrition coach but for a tiny fraction of the cost I use macr Factor myself for all of 2023 to cut 30 lbs of fat and now I'm using the app to guide my bulk for 202 4 and you can see from my habits dashboard I haven't missed a single day so far this year I think the main thing that separates 2 weeks for free or you can check out the first
