    "query": "How much protein should I consume daily for muscle growth?",
    "response": "Based on the retrieved information, the recommended amount of protein for maximizing muscle growth is between .7 to 1 gram per pound of body weight. For example, if you weigh 180 lbs, you should aim to consume around 130 to 180 grams of protein per day. This range is sufficient for most individuals to build muscle effectively.\n\nIt is important to note that consuming more protein than the recommended range may not provide any additional benefits in terms of muscle gains. However, if you are in a caloric deficit for fat loss or want to be extra cautious, consuming up to 1 gram of protein per pound of body weight may provide some extra insurance against muscle loss.\n\nOverall, aim to consume a sufficient amount of protein within the recommended range to support muscle growth and maintenance. Remember that individual protein needs may vary based on factors such as activity level, goals, and body composition. If you have specific dietary concerns or goals, it is always best to consult with a nutritionist or fitness professional for personalized advice.",
    "ground_truth": "For muscle growth, consume 1.6-2.2g of protein per kg of bodyweight daily. Athletes and those in intense training may need up to 2.2g/kg. Spread protein intake throughout the day, with 20-40g per meal. Good sources include lean meats, dairy, eggs, and plant-based options like legumes and tofu. Timing protein around workouts (within 2 hours) can enhance muscle protein synthesis.",

      ".73 G per pound of body weight per day fail to help build any additional muscle so for the average 180 lb individual this would come up to around 130 g of protein per day and remember this is to maximize growth even if youre below this youll definitely still be able to build muscle so dont get discouraged if that Target seems really high thats it in all the studies analyze subjects were eating at",
      ".73 grams of protein per pound of body weight is enough to maximize muscle growth and maintenance however I personally find that in taking a little more than this is beneficial when restricting calories since we know that protein is the most satiated macronutrient so it can better help keep you full throughout the day and it just acts as a buffer to help minimize any potential muscle loss now as",
      ".7 grams of protein per pound of body weight so if you weigh 175 pounds or 80 kilos 130 grams of protein per day will max out your gains and going beyond that as quote no further benefit on gains now if youre in a caloric deficit for fat loss or you want to be extra safe going as high as one gram per pound May provide some extra anabolic insurance but is probably Overkill and if youre overweight",
      ".7 to 1 gram per pound is a good Target for maximizing muscle gain for example if you weigh 165 lbs or 75 kilos youd want to be eating somewhere in the range of 120 to 165 g of protein per day for General muscle building now there may be some advantage in going a bit higher in certain Advanced situations but this is a sufficient range for most now if youre very high in body fat the grams per unit"

    "response": "Based on the retrieved information, the best exercises for core strength include a combination of weighted spinal flexion exercises such as crunches, anti-rotation exercises like the half kneeling pal off press, anti-extension exercises like the plank, static core endurance exercises like the traditional prone plank, and the RKC plank. These exercises target different aspects of core stability and endurance, which are essential for overall core strength development.\n\nAdditionally, incorporating exercises that target the anterior, posterior, lateral, and rotary core stability muscles can help in building a strong and stable core. It is important to focus on proper form and technique to ensure maximum engagement of the core muscles during these exercises.\n\nFurthermore, incorporating progressive overload by increasing weight or resistance over time, as you would with any other muscle group, can help stimulate growth and development of the core muscles. Rotational movements like high to low wood choppers can also be beneficial for targeting the obliques and adding variety to your core workout routine.\n\nOverall, a well-rounded core workout routine that includes a variety of exercises targeting different aspects of core strength and stability is key to developing a strong and functional core.

This can be achieved by incorporating a full body workout split two to three times per week. Within each workout, focus on using mainly compound exercises to hit every muscle group.\n\nAs a beginner, your primary goal should be to master the main movements in the gym, improve motor learning coordination, and build up a base level of strength and endurance. By incorporating compound exercises that work multiple muscle groups at once, you can efficiently target all major muscle groups and ensure they grow and strengthen proportionately over time.\n\nIt is important to follow a structured routine based on current scientific literature to ensure optimal results and minimize the risk of injury. By following a full body workout split and focusing on compound exercises, beginners can lay a solid foundation for their fitness journey.\n\nIf you have any specific goals or limitations, it is recommended to consult with a fitness trainer or healthcare professional to tailor a workout routine that suits your individual needs.",

Start with bodyweight or light weights, 2-3 sets of 10-15 reps. Include 20-30 minutes of moderate cardio 2-3 times weekly (walking, cycling). Add 5-10 minutes of dynamic stretching before workouts and 5-10 minutes of static stretching after. Rest at least one day between strength sessions.

    "query": "What's the optimal rest period between strength training sessions?",
    "response": "Based on the retrieved information, the optimal rest period between strength training sessions is around 48 to 72 hours. Waiting this duration before training the same muscle group again is essential for maximizing muscle and strength gains. Studies have shown that allowing for this rest period leads to better strength and muscle adaptations compared to training the same muscle group sooner.\n\nAdditionally, when it comes to rest periods between sets during a workout, the general recommendation is around 1 to 2 minutes for exercises with 6 to 15 reps, which are ideal for hypertrophy. For heavier compound movements, it is suggested to rest for 3 minutes or even longer to allow for proper recovery. \n\nFurthermore, research indicates that resting for 2.5 to 3 minutes between sets, especially with compound exercises, can lead to greater muscle growth compared to shorter rest durations. It is important to individualize your exercise selection and rest periods based on your goals and preferences.\n\nIn conclusion, the optimal rest period between strength training sessions is approximately 48 to 72 hours, while the rest period between sets during a workout can vary depending on the type of exercise and your fitness goals. It is essential to listen to your body, prioritize proper rest and recovery, and adjust your rest periods accordingly to maximize muscle growth and strength gains.",
    "ground_truth": "The optimal rest period between strength training sessions targeting the same muscle groups is typically 48-72 hours to allow for proper recovery and muscle growth. Beginners may need closer to 72 hours, while advanced lifters might recover in 48 hours. For full-body workouts, allow 48+ hours between sessions. With split routines (different muscle groups on different days), you can train daily while still providing adequate rest for each muscle group. Factors affecting recovery include training intensity, volume, nutrition, sleep quality, age, and fitness level. Signs of inadequate recovery include persistent soreness, decreased performance, and fatigue.",

      ".5 to 2 minutes of rest between sets for most of your exercises with three minutes of rest or even more being a good idea for heavy compound movements just be aware that this may turn your workouts from sweaty heart pumping sessions that feel satisfying into a totally different kind of workout that may not feel like it did much but in reality is far superior for building muscle trust the process",

As thoroughly examined in our rest interval ultimate guide video, with compound exercises, resting for 2 minutes or more seems better for hypertrophy than shorter durations. With isolation exercises, the current data is conflicting in the optimal rest interval duration",
