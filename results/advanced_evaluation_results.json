          "ground_truth": "A balanced beginner workout routine should include 2-3 full-body strength sessions weekly, focusing on compound exercises (squats, pushups, rows, lunges). Start with bodyweight or light weights, 2-3 sets of 10-15 reps. Include 20-30 minutes of moderate cardio 2-3 times weekly (walking, cycling). Add 5-10 minutes of dynamic stretching before workouts and 5-10 minutes of static stretching after. Rest at least one day between strength sessions. Progress gradually by adding weight or reps every 1-2 weeks. The routine should be sustainable and enjoyable to build consistency.",

          "ground_truth": "The optimal rest period between strength training sessions targeting the same muscle groups is typically 48-72 hours to allow for proper recovery and muscle growth. Beginners may need closer to 72 hours, while advanced lifters might recover in 48 hours. For full-body workouts, allow 48+ hours between sessions. With split routines (different muscle groups on different days), you can train daily while still providing adequate rest for each muscle group. Factors affecting recovery include training intensity, volume, nutrition, sleep quality, age, and fitness level. Signs of inadequate recovery include persistent soreness, decreased performance, and fatigue.",
