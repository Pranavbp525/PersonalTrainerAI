How much exercise should you get each day?
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), adults should get at least 150 minutes of
moderate-intensity activity

The CDC also recommends that two days a week, you work to strengthen your muscles. Whether that involves using bodyweight exercises, dumbbells, gym equipment, or
resistance bands
, these activities should work all the major muscle groups of your body—legs, hips, back, chest, abdomen, shoulders, and arms. What’s more, these muscle-strengthening activities should be done in addition to your physical activity.

Strength Training
Cardio Exercise
FIIT Principle
Strength Training
Strength training—which is sometimes referred to as resistance training or weight training—is a form of exercise intended to
increase muscular strength
and endurance. It involves exercising muscles using some form of weight or resistance such as your body weight, hand weights, machines, and more.
Strength training is designed to increase your strength and endurance, but it has a number of other benefits, too, like increasing bone density,
boosting metabolism
, building muscle, and even improving mental health.
What Is Strength?
Cardio Exercise
Cardio, also known as cardiovascular exercise, is generally any activity that increases your heart rate. Whether that is walking, running,
cycling
, dancing, or swimming, these rhythmic activities help to strengthen your heart and lungs. What’s more, cardio has a number of health benefits.
Aside from improving heart function and lowering blood pressure, consistently fitting cardio into your weekly routine can help you sleep better, improve cognitive function, and boost your overall sense of well-being. The Physical Guidelines for Americans recommend that you fit in about 150 minutes of moderate physical activity each week.
What Is Cardio?
FIIT Principle
The FIIT principle—which stands for frequency, intensity, time, and type of exercise—is a guideline you can use to revise and improve your workout plan. When evaluating and creating your workouts, you will need to consider these four elements. Doing so will help put you on the path to achieving your fitness goals.
Additionally, these principles can be used to evaluate your existing fitness program and determine where changes need to be made. Sometimes, you will need to
adjust your program
—especially if you have hit a plateau—by making sure the elements of your workout are still meeting your physical needs.

Frequently Asked Questions
What is fitness and why is it important?
Generally speaking, fitness involves not only defining your exercise goals and executing your plan, but it also refers to your level of fitness or the measure of your physical abilities like
endurance

Cardio Exercise
FIIT Principle
Strength Training
Strength training—which is sometimes referred to as resistance training or weight training—is a form of exercise intended to
increase muscular strength
and endurance. It involves exercising muscles using some form of weight or resistance such as your body weight, hand weights, machines, and more.
Strength training is designed to increase your strength and endurance, but it has a number of other benefits, too, like increasing bone density,
boosting metabolism
, building muscle, and even improving mental health.
What Is Strength?
Cardio Exercise
Cardio, also known as cardiovascular exercise, is generally any activity that increases your heart rate. Whether that is walking, running,
cycling
, dancing, or swimming, these rhythmic activities help to strengthen your heart and lungs. What’s more, cardio has a number of health benefits.
Aside from improving heart function and lowering blood pressure, consistently fitting cardio into your weekly routine can help you sleep better, improve cognitive function, and boost your overall sense of well-being. The Physical Guidelines for Americans recommend that you fit in about 150 minutes of moderate physical activity each week.
What Is Cardio?
FIIT Principle
The FIIT principle—which stands for frequency, intensity, time, and type of exercise—is a guideline you can use to revise and improve your workout plan. When evaluating and creating your workouts, you will need to consider these four elements. Doing so will help put you on the path to achieving your fitness goals.
Additionally, these principles can be used to evaluate your existing fitness program and determine where changes need to be made. Sometimes, you will need to
adjust your program
—especially if you have hit a plateau—by making sure the elements of your workout are still meeting your physical needs.

How do you do a plank?
The most important aspect of the plank pose for a beginner isn’t the frequency or duration but rather the form. For instance, as you get into the plank position, you want to ensure your elbows are directly under your shoulders and that your forearms are facing forward. Keep your head relaxed, look at the floor between your forearms, and
engage your core

Walking is a form of cardio or aerobic exercise. It’s an effective and low-impact exercise for overall health and weight management. The 2018 Physical Activity Guidelines Advisory Committee recommends 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity per week, and walking satisfies that recommendation.
Walking is a convenient form of exercise because it can be done almost anywhere and nearly everyone can do it. All you need to get started is a good pair of shoes. Get tips on shoes, apps, and more to hit your stride on the trail or treadmill.
Frequently Asked Questions
How long does it take to walk a mile?
The time it takes to walk a mile depends on your pace. For most people, you can expect to walk a mile in about 15 to 20 minutes. With practice, you can improve your speed when walking a mile.

How to Know How Fast You Are Walking
How many calories do you burn walking a mile?
The amount of calories you burn doing any physical activity depends on several factors, such as age, sex, weight, and distance. For example, someone who weighs 165 pounds can burn about 85 calories from walking one mile at a 3 to 4 mile per hour pace. A 120-pound person burns approximately 64 calories walking the same distance at the same pace.

Walking Workout Schedule for Weight Loss
How many miles or steps should you walk per day?
If you’re going to start incorporating regular walks into your weekly routine, try to meet the recommended 150 minutes per week.
This is about 30 minutes of walking per day. However, you’re likely to get more steps by also being active throughout the day. A higher step count is associated with lower mortality, so aim for 8,000 to 12,000 steps per day.

Steps
Brisk Walking
A relaxed, slower pace that you normally walk at throughout the day is called a stroll. When you’re walking briskly, you’re walking at a faster pace of around 3.5 to 4 miles per hour. Even though you're not running, you may feel your breathing and heart rate increase as it’s more challenging than regular walking or strolling.
How Fast Is a Brisk Walking Pace
Treadmill Walking
If you can’t walk outside due to the weather (or other circumstances), you can use a treadmill to get in your daily steps. This also reduces your sun exposure. Treadmills can be a convenient way to track your speed, distance, heart rate, and time spent walking.
All About Treadmill Walking
Stride
Your stride is the distance taken in one step. If you have long legs, you may have a long stride. This means it takes you fewer steps to walk the same distance as someone with shorter legs.
The Best Technique for a Powerful Walking Stride
Gait
Your walking pattern is called your gait. It involves balance and coordination. Some people may have an abnormal gait due to neurologic, muscular, or skeletal problems.
What Wear Patterns Mean for Walking Shoes
Heart Rate
Your heart is always beating and the number of beats per minute is your heart rate. At rest, your heart doesn’t beat as fast. It beats much faster during exercise than at rest. Wearing a heart rate monitor during exercise can help you monitor your heart rate.
How to Use a Heart Rate Monitor
Steps
You can track your walking in terms of minutes, miles, or steps. Since people have different strides and therefore take a different number of steps to walk the same distance, tracking your steps can be helpful. Some people aim for 10,000 steps per day. You can track your steps with a pedometer, smartphone, or activity tracker.

Running, the action of moving yourself forward rapidly on foot, is a popular form of physical activity that requires little equipment. It's an excellent way to boost cardiovascular fitness anywhere and at any time.
All you need is a good pair of shoes, weather-appropriate gear, and a safe route.
Whether you're running for the first time or training for your next race, read this information about proper form, the best shoes, training strategies, and more.
Frequently Asked Questions
How do you run faster?
There are a few strategies that can help you pick up the pace in your runs. Incorporating
short sprints
will help, but interval training, tempo runs, and hills will also help you get faster. A treadmill may be an excellent tool for improving overall performance and increasing speed. The treadmill allows you to add hills and easily perform speed work. Of course, working on your form, weekly mileage, and allowing proper rest and recovery will also aid in increasing overall speed. Consider working with a running coach or
using a running app
to create a personalized training program to increase your speed.

How To Run Faster and Improve Race Times
How do you start running?
To ensure comfort and prevent injury, first, get medical clearance to begin running. Second, invest in
properly-fitting running shoes
. Finally, decide
where and when you will run
. Do you have a safe area (trails, road, or a track) that will enable you to regularly run outside? Or will you utilize a treadmill? Deciding which option is most readily available can help plan a running program. When you’re ready to put one foot in front of the other, consider a walk/run strategy in the beginning: commit to a set period of time, and alternate walking and running. You can increase the running component progressively over time.

How to Start Running: The Absolute Beginners' Guide
How many calories do you burn running a mile?
As a very general and simplistic rule, a runner will burn about 100 calories per mile.
Individual calorie expenditure is dependent on weight, pace, and other factors, so individuals who want a slightly more accurate estimate might use a tracking device, such as a running watch. Note that calorie counters on cardio equipment and
fitness trackers tend to overestimate calorie burn
.
Using a heart rate monitor with your tracking device may provide a more accurate estimate.
Learn More:
How Many Calories Do You Burn While Running?
What should you eat before a run?
A good rule of thumb is to choose a
combination
of foods that are high in carbohydrates and lower in fat, fiber, and protein. Carbohydrates are the body’s preferred source of fuel. There are a variety of options that can work, such as a bagel with peanut butter or a bowl of oatmeal with berries. You will want to consume your meal or snack within 90 minutes to an hour before a run. Foods to avoid before a run include spicy foods, high-fiber foods such as legumes, lactose-heavy foods, and greasy or fried foods.

Aerobic exercise
Literally translating to “with oxygen,” aerobic exercise strengthens your cardiovascular and respiratory systems.
Running is a form of aerobic exercise as it uses oxygen as its primary source of energy.
Everything You Need to Know About Cardio
Jogging
Jogging is movement at a steady, gentle pace that is slower than running.  Similar to running, jogging is considered a high-impact exercise, as opposed to walking, which is low-impact.
The Difference Between Running and Jogging
Sprinting
Sprints are runs carried out at top speed for a short distance. You don’t have to be an Olympic athlete to reap the
benefits
of sprinting. Sprints can be performed in short bursts on the treadmill or outdoors as part of an overall running protocol to improve cardiovascular health and increase aerobic capacity.
How to Do Sprints
Trail running
Trail running is outdoor running that can be performed in a variety of settings, depending on your geographical location. Different trails may require different types of running shoes. Wherever you run outdoors, consider safety, and reap the physical and mental benefits of fresh air.

Strength training is a form of exercise that helps build muscle. It uses weight from your body mass or equipment to build muscle mass and increase overall strength.
Over time, lean muscle mass naturally decreases with age. Strength training helps maintain and build muscle mass, which is important for overall health. It’s beneficial for strengthening muscles and bones, maintaining a healthy weight, and improving your ability to perform everyday activities.
Frequently Asked Questions
Do runners need strength training?
A runner’s main form of exercise is likely cardio and aerobic training, but runners can also benefit from strength training. Cardio is necessary for heart health and weight management, but it doesn’t increase muscle mass like strength training. Runners should incorporate some strength training into their routines for balance.

Is strength training better than cardio?
Both strength training and cardio have their advantages. One is not outright better than the other. Cardio helps build stamina and endurance, and strength training works to increase strength and muscle mass.

What should I eat before strength training?
A high-carbohydrate meal with a moderate amount of protein and low amount of fat can fuel your strength training session. Complex carbohydrates provide energy. Follow the strength training session with a high-protein snack or meal.

How You Should Eat for Weight Training
Do I need equipment for strength training?
Equipment is not required for strength training, but it comes in handy. Beginners can start with exercises that only require body weight, such as push-ups and pull-ups. You can gradually increase the weight by using dumbbells, weighted barbells, and
various kettlebells

Key Terms
Functional Strength Training
Isometric Exercises
Muscle Endurance
Resistance Training
Functional Strength Training
There are different types of strength training, and functional strength training is one of them. This is when you target multiple muscles per exercise rather than isolate just one. Lunging is an example of this, since it works muscles across the legs, hips, knees, and ankles all at once.
How to Improve Your Functional Strength
Isometric Exercises
Isometric exercises are also known as static strength training. This is when your muscles are engaged, but they are not changing length. In some exercises, such as bicep curls, the muscle gets shorter and longer during the contraction. In isometric exercises, such as planks and wall sits, the muscle contraction doesn’t involve a change in length. Many isometric exercises require you to hold the exercise rather than repeat a movement.
Isometric Training Is Crucial for Building Strength
Muscle Endurance
This refers to the amount of time or repetitions you can perform an exercise before the muscle gets tired. Toward the end of your workout, you may notice your muscles feeling fatigued. They may burn towards the end of your set. Over time, your muscle endurance will improve and you can perform more repetitions.
How to Improve Muscular Strength and Definition
Resistance Training
Resistance training is a form of strength training. It uses resistance to strengthen the muscles. Resistance bands are a good example of this, but resistance is also used in pilates, cable workouts, and weighted exercises. Exercises like squats and lunges are examples of resistance training since your muscles are working against the weight of your dumbbells, body weight, or barbells.

Weight management is a multi-faceted strategy that involves nutrition, exercise, hormones, mental health, sleep, and other lifestyle interventions to keep body weight at a level that allows the individual to live a comfortable, active, and productive life.
While lifestyle factors such as diet and exercise can impact weight, it’s also important to note that there is a genetic component when it comes to weight.
Maintaining energy balance, or the ability of the body to expend the calories it takes in, can be the most challenging aspect of weight management.
Additionally, some medical conditions and medications can impact weight as well making it difficult to achieve weight management goals. Whether you are looking to maintain, lose, or gain weight, we have nutrition plans and tips to help you reach your goals.
Frequently Asked Questions
What role does leptin play in weight management?
Leptin is a hormone that regulates fat storage by telling your brain how much fat your body has stored. The mechanism by which it works also helps regulate appetite. While leptin is considered the “hallmark” of obesity, its exact mechanisms and pathways in the pathophysiology and potential treatment of obesity are not fully understood.
Learn More:
Hormones That Regulate Hunger and Digestion
Which pattern of eating is best for weight management?
There is not a one-size-fits-all pattern of eating when it comes to weight management. Dietary choices must be customized to an individual, taking into account health history, preferences, and access, among other considerations. That said, many experts recommend the
Mediterranean Diet
for weight management and optimal nutrition due to its emphasis on fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and
healthy fats
. This eating pattern is easily customized for an individual's goals, preferences, and health concerns.
Learn More:
What Is the Mediterranean Diet?
How do you manage insulin resistance?
Insulin resistance (IR) is when your body stops responding to insulin and therefore cannot use glucose for energy. You might be more likely to develop insulin resistance if you are overweight or obese, making weight management a smart strategy for preventing this condition that can also lead to diabetes.
Diet, exercise, and managing abdominal fat are the first line of defense in management of IR. Through the guidance of a registered dietitian, some individuals may adapt
a lower-carbohydrate diet
or begin counting carbs. Maintaining a healthy lifestyle, as opposed to gaining and losing weight on a regular basis, can help prevent IR.
Learn More:
Can You Prevent Diabetes With Diet and Exercise?
How do you manage weight with hypothyroidism?
Also known as underactive thyroid, hypothyroidism is a condition in which the thyroid gland doesn't produce enough thyroid hormone. This can result in fatigue and unplanned weight gain. Because some of this unintentional weight gain may be due to fluid retention, or edema,
a low-sodium diet
may be advised, along with a caloric deficit.
Learn More:
What Is Metabolism?
How you manage weight with PCOS?
While PCOS (polycystic ovary syndrome) is associated with weight gain, the benefits of caloric restriction for this condition remain unclear. The exact causes of PCOS remain unknown, but one theory is that excess insulin may play a role, and therefore exercise paired with a lower-carbohydrate diet may benefit some individuals.
Learn More:
Low Carb Diet Overview
How important is exercise in weight management?
The foods you eat and the quantity in which they are consumed will play the larger role in weight management. However, exercise can help expend energy, build and
maintain muscle mass
, and encourage a healthier overall lifestyle. Both are important in maintaining a healthy weight throughout the life cycle.
Learn More:
How Much Do You Need to Exercise to Lose Weight?
What role does nutrition play in weight management?
Nutrition is the most important component in successful long-term weight management.  Whatever dietary pattern is chosen, maintaining a caloric deficit and then balance will be most important.  A registered dietitian can help individuals assess their caloric, macronutrient, and micronutrient needs within a culturally appropriate framework to aid in weight management.

An Overview of Nutrition
Why is intuitive eating important?
Intuitive eating can be a powerful tool in long-term weight management as it can increase comfort levels around food, and thereby remove the fears and anxieties associated with them. Removing these fears and anxieties can help eliminate the binge and restrict cycle that is associated with weight gain. Moreover, intuitive eating is positively associated with positive body image, self-esteem, and wellbeing.
Learn More:
What Is Intuitive Eating?
Is feeling satiated important in weight management?
Feeling satiated is extremely important in weight management, which is why a focus on nutrient-dense foods should be made a priority.
Many nutrient-dense foods, such as fruits and vegetables, are also
high-volume
foods, which can promote satiety. Some common mistakes in weight management are skipping meals or “saving” calories for later meals, both of which can lead to overeating later.
Learn More:
Foods That Are Satiating and Filling
What health conditions impact weight management?
Many health conditions can impact weight management, many of which are related to hormonal changes.
Metabolic syndrome
, a cluster of conditions that includes high blood pressure, elevated blood glucose levels, excess waist adiposity, and abnormal cholesterol levels, can raise an individual’s need for weight management.

Nutrition
Proper nutrition is a key component for weight management. However, it is important to choose an overall eating pattern that is sustainable over the course of your life. A diet that is too restrictive may lead to a binge and restrict cycle, bringing on weight gain and possibly even disordered eating.
The Basics of Balanced, Healthy Diet
Intuitive Eating
Intuitive eating is a non-diet approach to eating that focuses on getting back in touch with internal body cues. With this approach, you are no longer under diet restrictions that make you feel bad about yourself. It also helps you break free from diets and get healthy by improving your relationship with food and exercise. While intuitive eating may aid in weight management, it is not the end goal.
What Is the Difference Between Mindful and Intuitive Eating
Nutrient Dense Foods
Nutrient dense foods are foods that offer a high amount of nutrients for a small amount of calories. Meanwhile,
energy-dense
foods have fewer nutrients and more calories for the volume of food.
Why Nutrient Density Is the Key to Healthy Eating
Vitamins and Minerals
Vitamins and minerals are also referred to as micronutrients. Not only are they crucial to overall health, but different micronutrients are found in different foods. It is best to consume the majority of necessary micronutrients
through food,
and eating a wide variety of different foods can help ensure adequate intake.
Where to Find the Major Minerals in Food
Protein
Protein is a
macronutrient
found in foods such as meat, fish, eggs, dairy, beans, and other foods in smaller amounts. The protein found in animal-derived foods such as beef, chicken, pork, fish, milk, and eggs is more bioavailable than those derived from plants. A diet adequate in protein is key to weight management, as protein promotes satiety and helps maintain muscle mass.
How to Calculate How Much Protein You Need
Diet Types
While there are many different types of diets and eating patterns, it is important to note that weight management is achieved primarily through energy balance, and a balanced diet. A balanced diet includes a range of foods to meet the macro and micronutrient needs according to their lifestyle, preferences, and cultural norms.
As of 2022, the top ranking diet for weight loss according to "U.S. News and World Reports" is the Flexitarian Diet, which promotes weight management via vegetarian forward meals with sometimes having meat.
What Is the Flexitarian Diet?
Diet Culture
Diet culture is the pervasive belief that appearance and body shape are more important than physical, psychological, and general well-being. It's the idea that controlling your body, particularly your diet—by limiting what and how much you eat—is normal.
According to the National Eating Disorders Association, diet culture also conflates body size with health, which may stigmatize and/or pathologize larger bodies. Diet culture also refers to the concept that some foods are good and others are inherently bad, rather that encouraging the acceptance of all foods.
What Is Diet Culture?
Exercise
Exercise is planned, structured physical activity, that may include flexibility, strength, cardio, plyometric activities, or organized sports. It is important to differentiate between exercise and NEAT (
non-exercise activity thermogenesis
), which is the energy expended during tasks and daily activities aside from eating, sleeping, and exercise. This would include housework, gardening, and other bodily movements.
If an individual has a weight loss goal, maintaining a caloric deficit will be more beneficial, but exercise does indeed play a role in supporting and building muscle mass and encouraging better lifestyle choices overall.

When it comes to nutrition facts and health benefits for specific foods and beverages, Verywell Fit has you covered. From fruits and vegetables to whole grains, understanding different nutritional values helps you make educated nutrition choices.
While the numbers and percentages may seem confusing at first, a nutrition facts panel can quickly become a user-friendly tool. Whether your goal is weight management, heart health, managing diabetes, or just gaining general awareness, understanding what is going into your body has the potential to make all the difference in your personal wellbeing.
Frequently Asked Questions
How do you read nutrition labels?
The nutrition facts panel tells you what a serving size looks like, how many calories are in a serving, and how many grams of carbohydrate, fat, and protein are in that serving. It also highlights cholesterol, sodium, potassium, iron, Vitamin D, and calcium content. Some of these quantities are also expressed as a percentage, meaning that one serving of the food in question provides a certain percentage of the DV (daily value) for that nutrient. These numbers are based on a 2,000 calorie per day diet.

How to Read Nutrition Labels
What does RDA mean in nutrition?
RDA stands for Recommended Dietary Allowance. It is the average daily level of intake sufficient to meet the nutrient requirements of nearly all (97-98%) of healthy people.

How Many Calories Should I Eat in a Day?
How do nutritional needs change over time?
Nutritional needs are highest during infancy,
adolescence,
and pregnancy.
With age, some nutrient needs decline, but the need for protein may increase to prevent sarcopenia.
Most importantly, nutrition is highly personalized at all stages of life and should be planned with the assistance of a registered dietitian.

Weight Management
Weight management is the process and habits adapted over time to maintain a certain weight range throughout the lifespan. Lifestyle, including sleep, along with caloric intake and activity level, are all components of weight management.
How to Fix a Weight Loss Plateau
Calorie Counter
A calorie counter is an app or equation used to help determine the proper energy intake range to meet your unique needs. Calorie counting apps can be a great tool not only for scanning food labels, managing meals out, and logging food, but also for planning ahead by pre-logging. There are many different calorie counting apps available, and you may experiment with free trials of each until you decide on the best one for your needs and lifestyle. Note that calorie counters may not be helpful for all populations and should be avoided if they trigger disorder eating behaviors or negative associations with certain foods.
Best Calorie Counter Apps
Micronutrients
A micronutrient is a chemical element or substance required in trace amounts by humans for normal growth, development, and maintenance. Most people can get the micronutrients they need from a balanced diet. The micronutrients listed on the nutrition facts panel below the solid black line are those most Americans do not get enough of or are deficient in: Vitamin D, Calcium, Iron, and Potassium.
9 Facts About Micronutrients
Macronutrients
Macronutrients are the nutritive components found in food—fat, protein, and carbohydrate—needed in larger amounts for energy and to maintain the body’s structure and systems. The nutrition facts panel lists the percentage of each of these macronutrients in a serving based on a 2000-calorie diet. A registered dietitian can help plan the appropriate split of protein, fat, and carbohydrates to meet your needs and help you achieve your health goals.
Macro Calculators and Trackers: What You Need to Know
Supplements
Supplements are products taken by mouth that contain some kind of dietary element, such as vitamins and minerals. Some supplements may contain a botanical or herbal (plant-derived) ingredient. It is important to note that “natural” does not necessarily mean harmless and that supplements may interfere with the efficacy of other drugs or result in adverse reactions.
Moreover, the FDA (Food and Drug Administration) does not review dietary supplements before they are available to the consumer.
A registered dietitian can help plan and execute a supplement protocol if deemed necessary.
Benefits and Risks of Dietary Supplements
Balanced Diet
A balanced diet indicates a meal pattern that includes adequate calories, fat, protein, and carbohydrate, as well as micronutrients, to support overall bodily function and well-being. As the nutrition facts panel alludes to, most adults need somewhere between 2000 and 2500 calories per day, but these needs vary greatly depending on age, weight, lifestyle, and physical activity. Utilizing the nutrition facts panel can help achieve a more balanced diet by creating awareness of which nutrients to increase and minimize.

Diet is a catch-all term that refers to a person’s pattern of eating. Example diets can include vegan, vegetarian, keto, paleo, gluten-free, low-calorie, low-FODMAP, and Mediterranean diets. Each diet has its own set of guidelines that describe what is and isn’t compliant. For example, vegan diets don’t include animal products of any kind and instead are made up of all plant-based foods.
There is not a one-size-fits-all when it comes to diets and nutrition plans. Learn more about specific eating patterns to find what is best for you. You can also adjust any type of diet to make it fit better with your lifestyle, goals, and needs.
Frequently Asked Questions
What is the keto diet?
Originally used for the treatment of epilepsy, the keto diet involves a meal plan that is very low in carbs and high in fat. It touts significant weight loss by putting the body into a state of ketosis (the state when the body doesn’t have enough carbohydrates to use for energy, so it burns fat instead).
It's important to note that there is no research to date to assess the safety of the keto diet long-term.

What is a Ketogenic Diet?
What is the Mediterranean diet?
The Mediterranean diet is a highly regarded way of eating that is inspired by the eating and lifestyle habits of people who live in the Mediterranean, such as Greek populations. The long-term, lifestyle approach promotes flavor, community, movement, and abundance or nutrients and food choices. Staples of the Mediterranean diet include whole grains; vegetables; lean protein sources like fish, legumes, and nuts; and healthy fats like olive oil. Research suggests that the Mediterranean diet may reduce the risk of heart disease, cancer, and diabetes.
It is often named the
best overall diet
by "U.S. News and World Report."

What Is the Mediterranean Diet?
What is an anti-inflammatory diet?
Those with chronic inflammation or inflammatory diseases may be interested in following an anti-inflammatory diet. It focuses on foods that reduce inflammation in the body, such as fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and more. It recommends against foods that increase inflammation, such as processed foods and alcohol.

What Is the Anti-Inflammatory Diet?
How many carbs are in a low-carb diet?
There is no universal definition of a low-carb diet. The number of carbohydrates permitted on a low-carb diet depends on the specific meal plan. The keto diet, for example, is a variation of a very low-carb diet that typically recommends 20 to 50 grams of carbohydrates per day.
Some evidence suggests that a low carbohydrate diet may be defined as less than 130 grams per day, or 26% of total energy intake.

Low-Carb Diet Overview
What is the BRAT diet?
The BRAT diet is a highly restrictive diet recommended for people with gastrointestinal issues or upset stomachs. BRAT stands for bananas, rice, applesauce, and toast. It’s not recommended as much anymore, but it used to be highly recommended by pediatricians for children with stomach problems.

Weight loss
Many diets claim to help with weight loss. Weight loss involves lowering your body weight to prevent health complications such as heart disease and diabetes. Healthy weight loss can be achieved with the help of a registered dietitian or qualified health care provider.
The Benefits of Losing Weight
Weight gain
Those who are underweight or want to increase their muscle mass may list weight gain as one of their goals. This can usually be achieved by increasing the number of calories and adjusting the balance of macronutrients in your diet. Depending on your individual needs, you will likely need to increase your intake of protein, healthy fat, and complex carbohydrates. To gain weight healthfully, consider speaking to a registered dietitian.
What Is a Weight Gaining Diet?
DASH diet
The DASH diet aims to prevent and control hypertension (aka high blood pressure).
It’s recommended by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute and involves avoiding foods high in sugar, fat, and salt. Instead, the DASH diet focuses on fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts, legumes, fish and poultry, and low-fat dairy products.
What Is the DASH Diet?
Intermittent fasting
Intermittent fasting is a form of fasting that restricts eating during certain times of the day. There are many different variations of intermittent fasting, such as 5:2, alternative-day fasting, and time-restricted eating. All forms share a common thread: those who practice intermittent fasting eat all of their meals during a specific time period.
What Is Intermittent Fasting?
Nutrition
Nutrition, or the process of meeting your nutritional needs through diet, is important for overall health.
Inadequate nutrition can be associated with poor health outcomes, including increased risk for certain diseases, and growth and development issues. Adequate nutrition means consuming enough macronutrients (carbohydrate, fat, and protein) and micronutrients (vitamins and minerals) through food to help you meet nutritional needs throughout your lifespan.
An Overview of Nutrition for a Better Diet
Obesity
Obesity is a medical condition that involves having excess fat on the body, which is associated with an increased risk of certain diseases.
It’s usually defined as having a body mass index (BMI) of 30 or greater. At Verywell Fit, we acknowledge the bias and limitations of BMI and recommend speaking with a health care provider to assess your risk of obesity.
Why BMI May Not Be the Best Metric
Calories
When you look at a nutrition facts label on a food item, you will see the number of calories. This refers to a unit of energy. It describes how much energy your body could gain by eating it. Some people track their intake of calories to help with their weight loss or weight gain goals.

Some evidence suggests that this way of eating promotes weight loss, however, experts warn that it is a highly restrictive dietary pattern and not appropriate for all.

Cooking and Meal Prep
Try Our Recipe Nutrition Calculator
Whip up a custom nutrition label and start making healthier choices! It's as simple as:
Editing Your Recipe
You can edit your recipe at any point.
Editing ingredients:
Hit the pencil icon next to the ingredient name if you'd like to edit or delete individual ingredients. To add new ingredients, hit "+Add Ingredient."
Servings:
Choose the number you'd like from the "Number of Servings" dropdown.
Starting over:
Choose "Analyze New Recipe" or "Start Over." Note that these options will delete the current information, so if you want to save your current analysis make sure to grab the embed code!
Saving and Embedding the Nutrition Label
You can easily save the nutrition label by saving the provided embed code. Once you've finalized your ingredients and servings click or tap "embed this label," located under the nutrition label, to generate a code that you can insert into your blog or save to reference later.
Making the Most of the Recipe Nutrition Analyzer
The nutrition facts label is useful if you're tracking calories or just want to be more informed about your diet, but this recipe calculator is also helpful for making smarter food decisions.
Here are a few tips for how to make the most of it.
Ingredient swaps:
Take a look at the calorie breakdown for individual ingredients if you'd like to adjust the calorie content of your recipe. Knowing where the calories are coming from can help you pinpoint specific ingredients to swap out or adjust quantities for.
Ingredient comparisons:
How much of a difference will using whole milk versus low-fat milk make? Analyze a recipe with one ingredient, then edit it to use the second and compare the nutrition facts.
Recipe comparisons:
Analyze multiple recipes and compare the nutrition labels to help you decide which is better for your diet and specific nutritional needs.
Troubleshooting Errors With the Recipe Analyzer
You might see an error message pop up once you analyze your recipe. Here are a few common ones and how to fix them:
Ingredient not recognized, please try editing:
click or tap the ingredient for a dropdown of options to choose from. When you choose the correct one, hit "update."
Measurement not recognized, please try editing:
click or tap the pencil icon next to the ingredient name. Choose a measurement from the dropdown, then hit "update." You can also easily convert the measurement with a unit converter if needed, to match the listings available.
Please make sure that you are using the most up-to-date version of your web browser in order to avoid potential errors. This recipe analyzer is not compatible with Internet Explorer.

What to Know About Nutrition
How to Address Weight Challenges
Wondering, "How many calories should I eat a day?" Eating a certain number of calories daily can help you achieve and maintain a healthy weight. Research further indicates that, when following a balanced diet, consuming the best number of calories for you can also help improve your health and boost longevity.
When determining how many calories you should eat per day, it helps to first understand the established recommended calorie intakes. From there, you can consider other factors to find the right calorie intake for you, given your body and health-related goals. Here is what you need to know about daily calorie consumption.
How Many Calories Should You Eat In a Day?
How many calories you should eat in a day will change as your body composition and size, activity level, and health change. Knowing the recommended calorie intake guidelines can provide a better idea of your calorie range. These vary based on whether you are an adult, a teen, or a child.
Adults
The recommended calorie intake for adult women ranges from
1,600 calories
per day to 2,400 calories per day, according to the 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans.
For men, the amount is slightly higher, ranging from 2,200 to 3,200 calories per day.
If you are somewhat sedentary or older, your calorie needs are likely toward the bottom of the range. You may be closer to the top if you are fairly physically active, pregnant, or breastfeeding.
7-Day 1,700-Calorie Meal Plan & Recipe Prep
Teens
Calorie intake recommendations for teens vary based on age, sex, and
activity level
. A 13-year-old girl's recommended intake ranges from 1,600 to 2,200 calories daily, with a 2,000 to 2,600 recommended intake for a 13-year-old boy.
These amounts increase slightly in the later teen years. The range for girls aged 14 to 18 is 1,800 calories per day to 2,400. The recommended calorie intake for boys in this same age range is somewhere between 2,000 and 3,200 calories.
Children
Children between the ages of 2 and 3 need between 1,000 and 1,400
calories daily
. Where they fall in this range depends on how active they are.
At 4 to 8 years of age, the range starts at 1,200 calories daily and increases to 1,800 calories for girls and 2,000 calories for boys. At 9 to 13 years, the calorie range is 1,400 to 2,200 calories per day for girls and 1,600 to 2,600 calories daily for boys.
Infants and young children are generally good at self-regulating their calorie intake, so it may be more helpful to ensure they have a balanced diet versus watching how many calories they consume.
7-Day, 1,300-Calorie Meal Plan & Shopping List
Factors That Affect How Many Calories You Should Eat
As the recommended calorie intake guidelines suggest, the
number of calories you need
per day can vary based on various factors. Among them are:
Sex
Height
Weight
Age
Activity level
Additional factors that can affect how many calories your body uses for energy, thus also impacting how many you should consume, include your hormones,
some medications (such as steroids and some diabetes medicines),
and your overall health.
The
Nutrition Facts label
on foods provides information based on a
2,000 calorie per day diet
.
But people can have different calorie needs. Determining your individual needs can help you maintain a healthy weight.
Using Weight Loss Calculators
Whether your goal is to lose weight, gain weight, or
maintain your current weight
, an online calculator (or
calorie counter app
) can help. The calculator uses your sex, weight, height, and age to determine the number of calories you need to fuel your body for daily activity.
Then it adds the calories needed to gain weight or subtracts the calories required to
help you lose weight
if you're using it as a weight loss calculator. It can figure out how many calories you should eat to maintain weight as well.
Inputting accurate information can help determine your daily caloric needs. If you're unsure how active you are during the day, keep an activity journal for a week or look at data from your fitness tracker to get a quick estimate.
Next, the calculator will ask you about your goals. It's important to be realistic during this step. Try to
set goals
that you believe are attainable. Once you reach your goal, you can always set a new one.
If you are trying to lose weight, a
healthy rate of weight loss
is 0.5 to 2 pounds per week.
If you are trying to gain weight
,
adding 1 to 2 pounds per week is a healthy goal.
Reaching Your Goal Weight
After entering your information into the calorie calculator, you'll receive a daily calorie goal. This is the number of calories you should eat daily to reach your desired weight in the set time frame.
To Lose Weight
If weight loss is your goal, a
calorie deficit
is factored into your recommended daily
caloric intake
. A calorie deficit is simply an energy shortfall—consuming fewer calories than you use—so your body burns stored fat (excess weight) for fuel.
You can create a calorie deficit by eating less than your body needs. You can also burn extra calories by increasing your physical activity. Combining the two (a balanced diet and exercise) is a healthy strategy for losing weight.
While it may be tempting to restrict your calorie intake dramatically, a
very low-calorie diet
(fewer than 800 to 1000 calories per day) can backfire. You should only do so with a healthcare provider's supervision to ensure that the diet meets your nutritional needs.
To Gain Weight
If you are trying to gain weight, your daily calorie goal will include a calorie surplus. The key to making this gain healthy involves following a few simple guidelines:
Eat high-quality high-calorie foods, such as high-protein meats, healthy fats, and
whole grains
.
Eat more often (this helps if you get full quickly).
Add extra calories to your meals by putting
nuts
on your morning oatmeal.
Drink nutrient-rich shakes.
Stay active to boost appetite and consider adding
strength training
into your exercise routine.
Dine with friends and family to make meals more enjoyable
We've tried, tested, and reviewed the
best protein shakes
. If you're in the market for an activity tracker, explore which option may be best for you.
To Maintain Weight
Several pieces of research have sought the best ways to maintain one's current weight, especially after successful weight loss. Many of these studies report that results are mixed as to what strategies may work best.
However, many of these studies did find that following a
higher-protein diet
might help with weight maintenance. A diet rich in omega-3 fatty acids and
polyphenols
was also suggested as an effective approach to sustaining a healthy weight.
What to Know About Nutrition
You can eat whatever you want and lose weight if you stay within your calorie range. That said, it might be hard to stay in this range if you don't eat nutritious foods.
Plus,
empty-calorie foods
don't provide your body with the nutrients you need to live an active life. And when you eat less nutritious foods, you're likely to get hungry more often and overeat. Conversely, nutritious foods help you to feel strong, energized, and satiated.
Additionally, all calories are not created equal. Calories from nutritious food sources will help you feel full longer, fuel your daily activity, and improve your well-being. Empty calories can leave you feeling hungry, increase your food cravings, and even increase fatigue. You'll find them in processed foods that contain
added sugars
, trans fat, excess fat, and calories. They may provide energy but not the
fiber
, vitamins, and minerals you need.
What to Eat
Nutrition experts recommend that you fill your plate with:
Colorful vegetables
like leafy salad greens, bright peppers, crunchy
carrots
, or
radishes
(experiment to find flavors that you enjoy)
Lean meats
like
chicken
and
fish
, eating red meat in moderation
Whole grains
that provide fiber, such as
oatmeal
or
whole-grain bread
, or
crackers
Whole fruits
rather than fruit juices or fruit-flavored snacks
Nuts, seeds
, and other sources of healthy fats, in small servings
Water
instead of sports drinks, sweetened tea, or soda
How to Address Weight Challenges
Evaluate your eating and exercise habits to see if there are
adjustments you can make
to reach your goal. There may also be medical reasons that you can't lose weight. So talk to a healthcare provider if you are concerned.
Your physician may be able to refer you to a registered dietitian for personalized nutrition advice. They also can evaluate your medical history and current fitness level to help you determine what type of exercise is right for you.
The Psychology of Weight Loss: How to Overcome Negative Self-Talk
A Word From Verywell
Determining your ideal caloric intake is a smart part of being mindful of your nutrition. Although being intentional about weight is one way to contribute to your overall health, being overly focused on calorie intake can be a worrying sign of
diet culture
or even disordered eating. Consult a healthcare provider if you need help navigating your ideal calorie intake.
Frequently Asked Questions
How many calories a day should I eat to lose weight?
This depends on a host of factors, including sex hormones, genetics, base metabolism rate, size, and more. Conventional wisdom has said to aim for a 500 calorie per day deficit to lose weight at a safe and sustainable weight. It's not usually quite that simple, and a healthcare professional can help you figure out a good plan for your circumstances.

What Is a Calorie?
How many calories a day should I eat to gain weight?
Like losing weight, gaining weight depends on multiple factors. There isn't a one-size-fits-all approach, but adding an extra 500 calories per day is a great way to start to gain weight. Choose nutrient- and calorie-dense foods. Adding nutritious and heart-healthy polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fats is a good start.

Tips for Gaining Weight
How can I boost my metabolism?
Metabolism has a heavy genetic component; however, there are ways to boost your metabolism. Strength training is one way to increase your basal metabolic rate, which means you'll burn more calories throughout the day, not just while you exercise.

What Does BMI Measure?
How It's Measured
Health Risks of High BMI
Health Risks of Low BMI
Benefits of a Normal BMI
Bias and Limitations
Other Measurement Methods
Body Mass Index (BMI) is a dated, biased measure that doesn’t account for several factors, such as body composition, ethnicity, race, gender, and age.
Despite being a
flawed measure
, BMI is widely used today in the medical community because it is an inexpensive and quick method for analyzing potential health status and outcomes.
Body mass index (BMI) is a calculation that is sometimes used in healthcare settings as an indirect method to determine a person's body weight category. This BMI calculator can help you learn what this measurement means and how it relates to your health and fitness.
What Does BMI Measure?
BMI is a measurement that takes into account your height, and weight to produce a calculation. This calculation is a measurement of your body size and can be used to determine how your body weight is related to your height. It is a method of determining whether you may be underweight, average weight, overweight, or obese, but it has flaws.
BMI is not a diagnostic tool nor is it a measurement of body fat percentage. A high BMI may or may not be an indicator of high body fat, but it doesn't necessarily mean that a person is overweight or obese and it alone is not a direct indicator of health.
In some populations, BMI has been found to be a fairly reliable indicator of body fat measures. But the calculation is less effective in other groups, such as bodybuilders and older adults. There are other methods that are more accurate in estimating body fat.
How BMI Is Measured
Your BMI is calculated using your height and weight. It can be a starting point for understanding the way your body fat may impact your overall health. You can use the number along with other health measurements to begin a conversation with your healthcare provider about ways to reduce your risk for disease and improve your overall wellness.
Imperial
Formula
: weight (lb) / [height (in)]
2
x 703
Example
: weight = 150 lbs, height = 5’5” (65")
BMI calculation
: [150 / (65)
2
] x 703 = 24.96
Metric
Formula
: weight (kg) / [height (m)]2
Example
: weight = 68 kg, height = 165 cm (1.65 m)
BMI calculation
: 68 / (1.65)2 = 24.98
Note that BMI is interpreted
differently in children
. Growth charts and percentiles are used. If children are at or above the 95th percentile of children their age, they are considered obese.
For adults, BMI results are interpreted as follows.
BMI Measurement
Weight Category
Below 18.5
Underweight
18.5 – 24.9
Normal weight
25.0 – 29.9
Overweight
30.0 and above
Obese
Health Risks Related to High BMI
The reason BMI is used for screening the health of the general population is due to the correlation between being overweight or obese and having certain health problems. People who are overweight or obese have an increased risk for:
Coronary heart disease
Hypertension
Osteoarthritis
Sleep apnea and respiratory problems
Some cancers
Stroke
Type 2 diabetes
Health Risks Related to Low BMI
While a high BMI may be an indicator for increased health risk, low BMI can also be indicative of health issues. People who are
underweight
according to the BMI scale can be predisposed to:
Cardiovascular disease
Depression
Difficulty conceiving (in women)
Dry skin
Hair loss
Irregular menstruation (in women)
Nutrient deficiencies
Osteoporosis
Poor immune system
Benefits of a Normal BMI
Maintaining a normal BMI (18.5 to 24.9) comes with many benefits, including limiting your risk to all of the above-listed health concerns. Not only are you less likely to have high blood pressure, heart disease, or diabetes, but maintaining a normal BMI can also help with better sleep, improved circulation, and even better energy throughout the day.
Bias and Limitations
The original index was developed to create statistics about population samples using European men as a baseline. It has since been used to assess people of all ages and races, perpetuating the creators' bias that the male, European body was the ideal body and measure of a person's fit-ness.
There are several known limitations of body mass index. First, the calculation does not take age or gender into account. Men tend to carry more muscle than women and this is not factored into the equation. BMI does not distinguish between muscle mass and fat mass in its calculation. Also ethnic and race variations are not considered.
While BMI can be a tool doctors use to understand your health status better, it is not a solitary diagnostic tool. When measuring your body fat composition, physicians also take into account your diet, lifestyle, level of physical activity, family history and genetics, as well as other health screenings.
Fitness, especially, is very important. Researchers have found that being fit negates the adverse effects of excess body fat, as well as other traditional cardiovascular risk factors, including obesity, metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and hypertension.
Body Composition, Body Fat, and BMI
Athletes who have higher levels of muscle mass need to be leery of the BMI calculation. Because the BMI number cannot distinguish the different components that make up total body weight, an athlete is better served by using a direct measurement of body composition and body fat.
The BMI calculation is used to screen the general population for health risks related to having too much body fat. This tool does not work well for most athletes who are curious about their body composition.
Body Fat Measurement Methods
BMI does not measure body fat. If you're interested in knowing your percentage of lean mass versus fat mass there are several methods of assessing a body's percentage of fat. These methods are referred to as
body composition analysis
. Some of the most common measurements include:
Bioelectrical impedance
: This common method of assessing body fat percentage determines total body weight, the percent and amount of body fat, muscle mass, water, and even bone mass. While readings can be affected by hydration level and other factors, they provide fairly accurate results over time. Some
smart scales
employ this method of measurement.
Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA)
: This is an x-ray scan that measures a person's bones (specifically their mineral density and bone loss) to calculate the possibility of developing osteoporosis. However, these DEXA machines have limitations and the technology that is widely used is unable to measure the bones in people who weigh 300 pounds or more or who are taller than 6 feet.
Skinfold thickness measurements
: Many experts use this simple method to determine body composition. Skinfold calipers are a common
device used to monitor body fat
.
Underwater weighing
: This procedure, also known as hydrodensitometry or hydrostatic weighing, is complex and complicated, so it is rarely used.
A Word From Verywell
While body mass index can be a useful tool for some people, it is just one number that should always be considered within the context of other data. Talk to your healthcare provider about the best way to understand your BMI as part of a comprehensive plan for good health and longevity.

Percentage Categories

Why Percentage Matters
Other Ways to Measure
How to Reduce Body Fat
There are different ways to calculate your body fat percentage. Some methods require special equipment or access to expert services. These methods are recognized as being the most accurate.
You can also estimate body fat percentage at home. A body fat calculator is the easiest method because it requires no special tools or lengthy appointments with a specialist.
This method will estimate your body fat percentage, which you may confirm with other methods. You'll need a basic tape measure and about five minutes to gather the data you need for an instant body fat measurement.
⁣How to Use the Body Fat Calculator
There are a few best practices to keep in mind when figuring out how body fat is calculated. Follow these guidelines for calculating the most accurate body fat percentage.
When to Take Body Fat Measurements
You'll want to take measurements first thing in the morning to get the most accurate result. Your
weight can fluctuate
throughout the day, so it's smart to get your numbers before you've had anything to eat or drink.
What to Use
Once you've weighed yourself, you'll need to take body measurements. Use a soft, flexible (cloth or fiberglass) tape measure to gather your numbers. Do not use an elastic tape measure. A measuring tape like what a tailor uses is optimal.
How to Take Your Body Fat Measurements
When you measure the circumference of each body part, the tape should feel firm enough against your skin so it stays in place. However, it should not be so tight that it causes an indentation. You can use either imperial or metric units.
The measurements that need to be taken are slightly different for men and women. Men only measure waist circumference, but women also measure other parts of the body, including the hips, wrist, and forearm.
Men
Current weight.
Use a digital scale if possible.
Waist circumference.
Measure the largest part of your belly, usually right at the level of your umbilicus (belly button). Make sure that the tape measure stays level with the floor. Don't hold your breath or suck in to get the measurement.
Women
Current weight.
Use a digital scale if possible.
Waist circumference.
Measure the largest part of your belly, usually right at the level of your umbilicus (belly button). Make sure that the tape measure stays level with the floor. Don't hold your breath or suck in to get the measurement.
Wrist circumference.
Measure around the smallest part of your wrist. You may need a partner to help with this measurement as it is hard to measure one-handed.
Hip circumference.
Measure around the largest part of your hips, usually at the posterior extension of the gluteals (where your butt extends back).
Forearm circumference.
Measure around the widest part of your arm below your elbow. It will be easiest to have a partner get this measurement. Keep your arm relaxed during the measurement and let it hang alongside your body (don't bend or flex the arm while measuring).
Once you've gathered your numbers, input the data to calculate your body fat percentage.
How to Improve Body Composition With Nutrition and Exercise
Body Fat Percentage Categories
Now that you've got your number, you probably want to know how your body fat percentage compares with other men or women in various categories. There are five ranges or body fat categories,
according to the American Council on Exercise (ACE). Keep in mind these categories are based on body fat norms and may not indicate your specific level of fitness or health.
ACE Body Fat Norms for Men and Women
Description
Women
Men

Links to Disease Risks
It is problematic to assign a strict cut-off for what body fat percentage puts someone at higher risk of health concerns like heart disease, diabetes, and stroke. Body fat percentage as a standalone figure does not account for gender, ethnicity, or age differences.
Other measurements may help you evaluate your risk for conditions like cardiovascular disease. If your body fat is too high according to the calculator, speak to a healthcare provider about different tools that you can use to measure your health risks.
One of the most popular assessment tools is body mass index (BMI). BMI is a number that is used to evaluate your body size. It is not a percentage of body fat but a general score that helps determine if your weight falls into a healthy range.
The number is calculated using your weight and height. If you carry too much weight for your height, the excess weight is assumed to be fat.
Body mass index is simply a tool that puts you into a category based on weight. It is not designed to be an accurate diagnostic tool for determining health.
Body Mass Index (BMI)
is a dated, biased measure that doesn’t account for several factors, such as body composition, ethnicity, race, gender, and age.
Despite being a flawed measure, BMI is widely used today in the medical community because it is an inexpensive and quick method for analyzing potential health status and outcomes.
Why Measure Body Fat Percentage?
Why does body fat percentage matter? If your
goal is weight loss
, you might be tempted to use a simple bodyweight scale for feedback on your progress, but your body fat percentage will tell you more than the scale.
When your goal is weight loss or to increase your fitness, fat loss should be your goal rather than simple weight loss. You want to keep the lean mass, or fat-free mass, that your body needs. Lean mass includes bone, blood, connective tissue, organs, and muscle.
Muscle loss can occur when you lose weight, but it's not the kind of weight loss you seek. You want to maintain muscle mass because it helps your body to function and perform more efficiently, boosts your metabolism, and can help improve glycemic control.
By measuring changes in body fat percentage, you can gauge how well your fitness or weight loss program is helping you to lose fat while maintaining fat-free mass.

How to Determine Your Body Fat Percentage
More Ways to Measure Body Fat Percentage
There are many
ways to measure body composition
(or the amount of fat and lean mass). Using a body fat calculator is just one.
One method for measuring body fat percentage won't be appropriate for everybody. For example, if you would be uncomfortable going underwater, you would not want to attempt
hydrostatic weighing
. Each method also has its pros and cons.
Body Fat Calculator
When you input body measurements into a body fat calculator like the one above, the tool uses a specific formula to estimate your body fat percentage. The formula is slightly different for men and women.
For women, the formula begins with a simple weight calculation:
(Total bodyweight x 0.732) + 8.987
The tool uses fractions of each body measurement to estimate your body fat percentage.
For men, the formula begins with a different weight calculation:
(Total bodyweight x 1.082) + 94.42
The tool uses a fraction of the weight measurement to estimate body fat percentage.
A body fat calculator is not the most accurate measurement of body fat percentage. However, it's the most accessible system to use. Therefore, you may be able to use it more often.
Measuring at the same time each day and using the same tools (tape measure and online calculator) allows you to track trends in your progress, which can be far more valuable in assessing your fitness gains than a standalone body fat percentage measurement.
Skin Caliper Measurements
Several body fat calculators use skinfold measurements instead of body circumference measurements to estimate your body fat percentage. Skinfold calipers can be purchased to use at home, or you can hire a professional who is skilled in using them in healthcare or gym settings. It's one of the more popular
devices to monitor body fat
.
Skin calipers pinch a portion of your body to estimate fat levels. The caliper method can be more accurate than a calculator for measuring body fat percentage, but the accuracy depends on the skill level of the person using them.
Bioelectrical Impedance (BIA)
Home scales
, gym-quality scales, and devices in your healthcare provider's office may use bioelectrical impedance to estimate body fat. Simply put, the device sends a harmless, completely pain-free electrical signal through your body to measure fat.
You get a quick and instantaneous body fat percentage result. While this method is convenient, certain factors such as hydration level can influence the accuracy of the result.
DeXA Scanning
Whole-body scanning is quickly becoming the gold standard for measuring body fat percentage. However, the main reason the test is so accurate is that it is generally performed in a medical setting by highly skilled technicians. The DeXA test is often costly and may not be available where you live.
Hydrostatic Weighing
This submersion method has long been recognized as the most accurate measurement of body fat percentage. However, it requires a person to be fully immersed in a tank of water while holding their breath.
For many, the endurance required for hydrostatic weighing can be a challenge. It can also be difficult to find a location that performs the test.
How to Reduce Body Fat
Because thinness has so much value in many cultures, many people want to lose weight at some point. However, reducing body fat should not be a goal for everyone. Speak with a healthcare professional before starting a
weight-loss program
. It's also important to know that these numbers don't apply to pregnant women—you should not try to lose weight during pregnancy.
You'll also want to talk to a healthcare provider if you are trying to lose weight while on medications or during cancer treatment to ensure that it is safe. If your doctor determines that reducing your body fat percentage is a safe and beneficial health goal, here are some areas for you to consider making changes.
Your Diet
How much you eat and what you eat are significant factors in losing or gaining body fat. You might be tempted to try a popular diet, but
fad diets
generally don't work. What does work is making small lifestyle changes, such as:
Reducing your portion sizes.
Eating smaller meals more frequently throughout the day and avoiding the urge to skip breakfast.
Ensuring your diet contains lots of fruits and vegetables to fill you up and give you the necessary nutrients.
Adding more fiber to your diet to keep you full.
Avoid sugary drinks and junk food.
Limit how much alcohol you drink.
Your Cardiovascular Fitness Program
Cardiovascular exercise is an important part of any fat loss program, but you want to ensure it's the right cardio. Make sure you include
high-intensity interval training
in your program up to two to three times per week. In addition to cardio, you should also incorporate
moderate
and
easy workouts
.
Your Strength Training Program
People often focus on cardio to lose weight, but adding more muscle will help you burn more fat. Muscle is more metabolically active than fat, so the more you have, the more calories you burn all day.
Strength training
a couple of times a week is all you need to add lean muscle tissue and burn more fat.
Lifestyle Factors
Watching your stress levels and getting enough sleep are the keys to keeping your weight in check since stress hormones can contribute to weight gain. Taking care of yourself will make it easier to maintain the energy needed to complete key workouts and help you stay motivated to shop for and prepare nutritious foods.
A Word From Verywell
There are other methods of measuring body fat not listed here. Whichever way you choose, remember that if you plan to measure your body fat regularly, you need to use the same method each time to get the most accurate data.
If you want to change your body fat composition, a balance of nutritious eating and being sure to avoid fad diets, coupled with exercise, is the best bet. Consult a healthcare provider to assess your health risks and make a plan for staying healthy.

Calculator for Calories Burned
Other Options
Accuracy of Calorie Burn Calculators
The number of calories you burn during exercise will depend on age, gender, weight, and current activity level. A simple calorie burn calculator is useful when understanding how your activity level affects the number of calories you burn during exercise.
Calories Burned By Activity Calculator
Use this simple calorie burn calculator by choosing your activity, enter how long you performed the exercise, and add your weight. Though you're burning calories normally throughout your day, exercise can help boost your metabolism. The amount of calories depends on the type of exercise and duration.
It is important to note that calculators have an activity
MET (metabolic equivalent for task)
built-in. This number estimates how much energy the body uses during a specific activity. It varies based on activity and is standardized so that it can be used by anyone for a variety of activities.
For example, low-impact aerobic dancing (5 METs) burns fewer calories per minute compared with high-impact aerobic dancing (7 METs).
Slow-paced walking (3 METs) burns fewer calories than speed walking. If you do not have a calorie burn calculator, you can use the formula to determine how many calories your activities burn.
Calories Burned Formula
Total calories burned = Duration (in minutes)*(MET*3.5*weight in kg)/200
﻿
﻿
Other Options to Calculate Calories Burned
Other options for calculating calories burned include using a wearable activity tracker
or data from machines at the gym. In addition, you can calculate your
total energy expenditure (TEE)
by knowing your basal metabolic rate (BMR), the
thermic effect of food
(TEF) you eat, and your general activity level.
We've tried, tested, and reviewed the
best fitness trackers
. If you're in the market for an activity tracker, explore which option may be best for you.
Accuracy of Calorie Burn Calculators
Keep in mind that a calorie burn calculator provides an estimate and will not be exact. The only way to get a truly accurate number is at a lab with machines that measure everything from your
VO2 max
(maximum oxygen uptake) to your maximum heart rate.
Wearing a heart rate monitor consistently will allow you to note long-term trends.
Use your estimate of calories burned as a base point to track your workouts.
While numbers from calorie burn calculators and activity trackers are not 100% accurate, you will see which activities tend to
burn more calories
. You can tweak your workouts to ensure you are meeting your fitness goals.
Other Calorie Burn Factors to Consider
A calorie burn calculator doesn't take into account all factors that influence exercise intensity such as:
Age
: The older you are the more challenging it becomes to hit high-intensity activity levels.
Body Composition
: A person with
more muscle burns more calories
at rest than a person with high body fat.
Temperature
: The warmer the environment you're working out in, the more calories you will burn.
Heat raises your core body temperature so you do not have to warm up as much, and more energy can be directed toward calorie burn. You can also exercise longer but be cautious not to overdo it to the point of heat exhaustion.
Fitness Level
: An experienced exerciser will burn fewer calories because their body has become more efficient at exercise.
Diet
:
Your metabolism is the rate at which your body burns calories, and is directly affected by diet. Your metabolism will dip and negatively affect calorie burn without proper food as fuel.​
Sleep
:
Not getting adequate sleep can cause you to burn fewer calories. Not only will you feel more fatigued and possibly exercise less, but a lack of sleep can also reduce your metabolism.
Oxygen Intake
: Oxygen gives your body the energy to keep going. People who breathe heavily during their workout tend to burn more calories. It indicates that you're working harder and for every liter of oxygen you take in, you're burning 5 calories.
A Word From Verywell
When first understanding how to calculate calories burned during exercise, there's no need to overwhelm yourself with numbers. Try to focus on the goals of staying active.
If you add something new, run it through the formula to determine whether it will allow you to meet your health and fitness goals.

Daily Calorie Burn
Track Energy Expenditure
Strategies for Weight Loss
Your body is always burning calories. Up to 75% of your daily calorie burn is just for basic body functions like breathing, circulating blood and building cells. This means that even if you are just sitting around all day, you'll still burn at least 1,300 calories—and likely more. As you move your body through daily activities and exercise, you can add hundreds more calories to your total energy expenditure.
If you are curious how many calories you are burning in a day, you can
calculate your energy balance
to get a general estimate. Once you know your number, you can get a general estimate of how much to eat and exercise each day to maintain your weight. If your goal is to lose weight, you may need to reach a
reach a negative energy balance
; and if your goal is to gain weight you will need a surplus. To do that, though, you need to know how many calories you burn.

Daily Calorie Burn
When researchers evaluate the total number of calories you burn, they refer to the number as your total energy expenditure (TEE) or total daily energy expenditure (TDEE).
TEE (or TDEE) is a combination of these different factors: These include resting metabolic rate (RMR), non-exercise activity thermogenesis (NEAT), thermic effect of food (TEF), and calories burned during exercise.
Mira Norian / Verywell
Here is a closer look at each of the factors used to measure your daily calorie burn.
Resting Metabolic Rate (RMR
): Your
RMR
is the amount of energy your body needs to maintain basic functions like breathing, circulating blood and building cells. Things like age, body size and gender affect your resting metabolic rate.
Your RMR accounts for 60% to 75% of the total number of calories you burn each day.
Non-Exercise Activity Thermogenesis (NEAT)
: This is the amount of energy that your body uses to do daily activities like washing dishes, typing on your computer, or walking around your office. The number of calories you burn from
NEAT
varies greatly based on your activity level.
Thermic Effect of Food (TEF)
: Your body burns calories to chew, digest, and store food. Each type of food (macronutrient) has a different TEF.
Eating protein
burns the most calories by a small margin.
TEF
accounts for about 10% of the total number of calories you burn each day.
Calories Burned During Exercise
: The actual number of calories you burn during your workouts will depend on the
intensity
and
duration
of each session. Calories burned through exercise and non-exercise physical activity account for roughly 15% to 30% of your TEE.
How to Track Total Energy Expenditure
There are three common methods to estimate the number of calories burned each day. There are pros and cons to using each method. You can use more than one method and compare results to get the best estimate.
Metabolic Testing
The equipment required to perform
metabolic testing
is fairly expensive and used to be available only in hospital or lab settings. However, many health clubs now offer metabolic testing at affordable prices.
For some people, the test results help them schedule workouts and diet plans more effectively. But some critics feel the tests are not very accurate and therefore not worth the cost.
If you choose metabolic testing in a health club, make sure your trainer or technician is qualified to perform the test.
When you get re-tested to measure progress, it is usually smart to have the same technician re-do the tests and to use the same equipment. And since your body weight can vary by several pounds from morning to evening, it's also best to do your re-test at the same of day as the previous test(s).
Activity Monitors
Devices by brands like Polar, Garmin, and FitBit and are widely available online and in sporting goods stores. The gadgets monitor your daily movements to determine an estimated number of calories burned each day.
Some independent tests have shown that the devices are not completely accurate at providing an accurate number of calories burned.
But the devices are easy to use and can provide a very general estimate of variations in your day to day calorie expenditure.​
We've tried, tested, and reviewed
the best pedometers
. If you're in the market for an activity tracker, explore which option may be best for you.
Online Calculators
Calculators and
calorie-counting apps
can estimate your daily energy expenditure. Of course, the number is simply a guideline, but it's a good place to start if you want to maintain your weight. If you want to gain or lose weight, use a
weight loss calorie goal calculator
to calculate your daily caloric needs by adjusting your daily calorie count goal down (or up).
Strategies for Weight Loss
It's important to make shifts gradually if your goal is weight loss. For example, if you cut calories drastically to lose weight quickly, your body can fight back by increasing hunger and sparing energy to encourage you to put the weight back on over time.
A more sustainable approach may be to focus on the quality of your diet and your activity levels along with slight reductions in calories and increases in activity levels in order to consume less than you burn each day.
Of course, there are some components of your TEE that are hard to change.
Increasing your resting metabolic rate, for example, is fairly difficult. And increasing the number of calories you burn when you eat food isn't an effective way to reach your negative energy balance, either. But you can change your daily physical habits.
The most effective way to increase your TEE is with exercise and NEAT. Learn how to plan consistent workouts that are vigorous enough to
burn fat
but also allow your body
enough time to recover
, rebuild, and stay healthy.
Between workouts, stay active. If you are able, take the stairs instead of the elevator, walk to the store instead of taking the car and stay active at home to burn calories. You'll boost your calorie-burning potential and you may be able to
increase lean muscle mass
on your body, which can boost your resting metabolic rate.
A Word From Verywell
Remember that all calorie counts are estimates. Even the calorie counts on food packages are estimates. So, if you're trying to lose weight, expect that you will need to take some time for trial and error before you find the numbers that are right for you.
Use several different methods to find out how many calories you burn each day. Then experiment with food intake to find the right balance to meet your goals.

How to Improve Your Walking Pace
Frequently Asked Questions
A running speed calculator is a tool that can provide helpful information to runners of any level. It can help determine your pace per mile for a given distance using known variables: distance or time. Use our pace calculator to learn your running pace.
Why Use a Running Speed Calculator?
A pace calculator can help you determine how long
walking or running
a certain distance will take. Tracking your speed and how it changes over time can help you gauge your performance and see if your fitness efforts are paying off.
You may need to know your pace when registering for an event or race such as a
5K
,
10K
,
half marathon
, or
marathon
. You can use our running speed calculator or do the math yourself.
Running Pace Calculator
Your pace is expressed in
minutes per mile or minutes per kilometer
. This is the time it would take you to walk or run 1 mile or 1 kilometer. Race organizers use your pace to assign you to a
start corral
with others racing at a similar pace. Note that many running races have a time limit equal to a 16-minute mile pace.
To calculate your running pace, you will need to know the distance you have walked or run, and the time it took you to do so.
Pace = Time / Distance
Your running pace may not be a round number of minutes, so you will need to convert fractions of a minute to seconds. Multiply the fraction of a minute by 60. For example, 0.5 minutes = 30 seconds.
Running Speed Calculator
Speed is the flip side of pace. It is the calculation of distance over time, expressed in miles per hour or kilometers per hour. To calculate your running speed, you will need to know the distance you walked or ran and the time it took you to do so.
Speed = Distance / Time
Or, if you have your pace, you can convert it to speed. Simply divide 60 by your pace.
Speed = 60 / Pace
When you aren't using whole hours in the calculation, convert the number to minutes, then multiply the result by 60 minutes per hour to get miles per hour or kilometers per hour. Below are some sample running speed calculations:
Running 6 miles in 1 hour: 6 / 1 = 6 miles per hour (mph)
Walking 6 miles in 2 hours: 6 / 2 = 3 mph
Running a half marathon (13.1 miles) in 1.5 hours (90 minutes): 13.1 / 90 = .1455 x 60 = 8.73 mph
Run Pace for Common Distances
This running pace chart for standard distances displays how long it would take to finish a given distance race depending on your pace, measured in pace (minutes per mile) and speed (miles per hour).
For instance, running a 10-minute mile pace through an entire 5-kilometer race would take 31 minutes to complete. At the same pace, you could complete a marathon in 4 hours and 22 minutes (close to the global average time to complete a marathon).

Use Pace to Determine Exercise Intensity
You can use running speed or pace to gauge the intensity of your exercise. For example, walking intensity levels may look like this:
Light intensity
: Speed less than 3 mph; pace greater than 20 minutes per mile
Moderate intensity
:
Speed between 3 and 4 mph; pace between 16 and 20 minutes per mile
Medium intensity
: Speed 4 to 5 mph; pace between 12 and 15 minutes per mile
Vigorous intensity
: Speed over 5 mph; pace more than 12 minutes per mile
The
rate of perceived exertion (RPE)
scale is a more individualized measure of intensity.
RPE uses a scale from 0 to 10, with lower numbers being less intense and higher numbers being quite intense.
For example, an RPE of 0 is akin to sitting in a chair, 1 is very light exercise, 2 is light, 3 is moderate, 4 is somewhat heavy, 5 is heavy, 7 is very heavy, and 10 is very, very heavy. A 10 is how you feel at the end of a stress test or very vigorous activity.
When rating your exertion level, include feelings of shortness of breath and how tired you feel in your legs and overall. Most people aim to exercise at level 3 or 4.
Use Pace With Apps and Fitness Wearables
A pace calculator can be a good check on what your GPS app or GPS speedometer is showing as your running speed or pace. These can be inaccurate, and you don't want to think you are faster than you are.
A common factor contributing to inaccuracy is being in an area with buildings, trees, or hills that block the satellite signal used to measure your position. It's a good idea to check the accuracy of your device by measuring your running or
walking speed
over a known distance using a timer.
We've tried, tested, and reviewed the
best fitness trackers
. If you're in the market for an activity tracker, explore which option may be best for you.
Distance Calculator
If you know your pace or speed and how much time you will be walking or running, you can calculate how far you should go. This can be useful if you have a set amount of time for a workout and want to see how far you could go. Sometimes you will need to convert distances, which is helpful to know that a kilometer is 0.62 miles and a mile is 1.61 kilometers.
Distance = Time / Pace
Distance = Speed x Time
Finish Time Calculator
Knowing how long it will take you to finish is essential before registering for a race. Walkers and slow runners must be sure to complete under the course time cutoff. You may also want to compare your finish time with lists of winners to see if you might qualify for a trophy for your age group.
To calculate your finish time, you will need to know your pace in minutes per mile or minutes per kilometer (or your speed in miles per hour or kilometers per hour) and the distance of the course.
Finish Time = Distance x Pace
Finish Time = Distance / Speed
Check your running speed and pace in more than one way, as a GPS-based speed may be inaccurate. Doing a timed mile or a timed kilometer can be a better way to find an accurate pace. Otherwise, your finish time will also be incorrect.
Predict Finish Time for Longer Races
While you may be able to time yourself over a mile or kilometer and use that to predict your
time for a 5K
or 10K race, you probably won't be able to maintain the same speed over a half marathon or marathon. Ways to
predict your finish time
vary.
Some runners add 20 seconds per mile each time you double your distance. For example, if you've run a half marathon (13.1 miles), find your average minutes per mile, add 20 seconds, and multiply by 26.2 miles. Marathon coach Hal Higdon suggests multiplying your 10-kilometer finish time by 5 to find your marathon finish time.
How to Improve Your Walking Pace
If you aren't happy with the results of the pace calculator, you can make improving your pace a goal. To
increase your walking speed
, take a look at your technique. Working on perfecting your form with posture adjustments and stepping techniques will help. Making adjustments may help you boost your pace.
Tips for Improving Walking Pace
Improve your
posture
: Proper walking posture will improve breathing, making it easier to
walk faster
and farther.
Bend your arms
: Adding proper arm motion during walks can significantly speed up your
brisk walking
pace.
Use proper stepping technique
: Step from heel to toe with a strong push-off, or
race-walking
technique using straighter legs can help increase your pace.
Try a
run/walk technique
: If you cannot run the entire distance or want to increase your pace while covering more distance, try running interspersed with walking.
Improve Your Running Pace
If you are a runner, you can
learn to run faster
, too. You'll want to work on specific techniques and training strategies,
Tips to Improve Your Running Pace
Work on your
stride turnover
: Increase how many steps per minute you take to improve your running pace. Use short, quick steps to increase your stride turnover and run more efficiently.
Add
interval training
: Improve your cardiovascular health and capacity by including interval training in your routine.
Plan weekly
tempo runs
: Running at a sustained, steady effort pace can help improve your running pace by helping you develop your
anaerobic or lactate threshold
(LT), a critical aspect of running faster.
Start
hill training
: Hill repeats are excellent for building strength, speed, increasing mental strength, and confidence in tackling hills.
Rest and recover
: Rest and recovery can help improve subsequent performance since your body has had time to repair.
A Word From Verywell
You can increase your walking or running speed with proper technique and training. A pace calculator can provide you with reasonable estimates of your overall performance. Remember that these are just best guesses, and you may not perform at the same pace over all distances or at different training sessions or races. Other factors will influence your pace on a given day.
Frequently Asked Questions
What is a good running pace?
A good running pace depends on the distance you are covering, among other factors. Longer distances require you to pace yourself more slowly to conserve energy over the long term. A review of over 10,000 5k runners found that the average person ran a mile in 11:47.

How to Run Faster and Improve Race Times
How is running pace different from running speed?
Running pace is the average time in minutes it takes you to run a mile. Your minute per mile pace will change depending on how long or how far you run. Pacing yourself means controlling your minute per mile pace according to how long you will run as a way to conserve energy. Running speed is measured in miles per hour and is how fast you are running. They are much the same but use different units and are expressed differently.

Improving Pace and Speed
How do you pace yourself when running?
You can pace yourself when running by sticking to a pre-determined speed during your run or for certain parts of your run. For instance, you may wish to start out a bit slower and then pick up your speed as you go. You can use a variety of methods for determining your ideal pace during a certain distance.

Our Editorial Process
There’s no one-size-fits-all model for healthy living. Let us help you find a way to eat well and stay active that works best for you, wherever you are on your journey.
The small, everyday choices you make about your diet, fitness, and overall well-being have the power to transform your life. But that doesn’t mean they’re always easy to sustain. We understand you’re an individual with specific goals and we’re here to support you with trusted information and tools to help you feel your best.

Review Board
The Verywell Fit
Review Board
, comprised of board-certified physicians, registered dietitians, personal trainers, and more, vet content containing statements of medical fact or health claims. They work tirelessly to provide the necessary critique that guarantees our information is accurate and current.

A reviewer will confirm that a piece of content—whether article, illustration, video, tool, or other resource—is thorough and contains facts and guidelines that reflect the latest in evidence-based research and health information.
If improvements are suggested, they are shared directly with our editorial team to be addressed and implemented immediately. It is only when a reviewer approves a piece of content that it is officially stamped as such in the byline of an article.
Fact Check
Our team of qualified and experienced fact checkers provides a critical step in our commitment to content integrity. Fact checkers rigorously review medical statements, claims, and recommendations for accuracy and timeliness. We rely only on the most current and reputable primary references, including peer-reviewed medical journals, government organizations, academic institutions, and advocacy associations.

How Our Review Board Process Works
Every article created by our team of expert writers that contains verifiable facts or medical information makes its way through our comprehensive Review Board process and gets assigned to a specialist based on their area of expertise. Even our custom illustrations go through the Review Board.
When you see this check mark on a Verywell Fit article, you can trust it meets the high standards of our Review Board.
The Verywell Fit Review Board members confirm each piece of content they review is up-to-date, thorough, and authoritative—containing unbiased facts and guidelines that reflect the latest in evidence-based research (not just the latest fads), as well as practical healthy living advice you can use right away.
If the Review Board suggests improvements, those are shared directly with our editorial staff so our editors can make any changes needed. Once a piece of content is approved, it receives the Review Board stamp in the byline—and you’ll know exactly who reviewed it and when.

Fitness is a broad term that can mean a lot of different things to different people. For some, it can mean a fitness program and for others, it can refer to their fitness level. But regardless of whether you are considering improving your personal fitness level or looking for an effective fitness program, the key is that fitness is a vital part of an active, healthy, and balanced lifestyle.
Plus, there are a number of
benefits to incorporating fitness into your daily life
. Physical exercise can boost your energy, reduce the risk of health problems, and improve mental health.
So, whether you are just embarking on your fitness journey or you are a seasoned exerciser, you will find trusted information here on working out safely and effectively and making physical fitness a part of your everyday life.
Frequently Asked Questions
What is fitness and why is it important?
Generally speaking, fitness involves not only defining your exercise goals and executing your plan, but it also refers to your level of fitness or the measure of your physical abilities like
endurance
, strength, balance, and flexibility. In other words, your fitness level is unique to you, as it is your body's ability to withstand a physical workout and recover in a timely manner.
Exercising consistently is one of the most important ways you can improve your fitness levels. In fact, regular physical activity not only impacts your physical strength, heart function, and endurance, but it also can improve your brain health, help you manage your weight, and reduce your risk of disease. It also can
strengthen your bones
and muscles and improve your ability to complete everyday tasks and activities.

6 Weeks to Fitness for Absolute Beginners
How much exercise should you get each day?
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), adults should get at least 150 minutes of
moderate-intensity activity
or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity activity—or a combination of the two—each week. Examples of physical activity include walking, running, swimming, and cycling.
The CDC also recommends that two days a week, you work to strengthen your muscles. Whether that involves using bodyweight exercises, dumbbells, gym equipment, or
resistance bands
, these activities should work all the major muscle groups of your body—legs, hips, back, chest, abdomen, shoulders, and arms. What’s more, these muscle-strengthening activities should be done in addition to your physical activity.

How Much Exercise Do You Really Need?

This means selecting activities you enjoy and are able to do consistently. Plus, research indicates that most people benefit from doing a variety of things in order to improve their fitness.
For instance, you should choose some endurance or aerobic activities to help improve your heart and lungs as well as some strength or
resistance training
activities to help your muscles get stronger. Even adding in some balance and flexibility exercises can help improve your fitness level.

5 Health-Related Components of Fitness
Key Terms
Strength Training
Cardio Exercise
FIIT Principle
Strength Training
Strength training—which is sometimes referred to as resistance training or weight training—is a form of exercise intended to
increase muscular strength
and endurance. It involves exercising muscles using some form of weight or resistance such as your body weight, hand weights, machines, and more.
Strength training is designed to increase your strength and endurance, but it has a number of other benefits, too, like increasing bone density,
boosting metabolism
, building muscle, and even improving mental health.
What Is Strength?
Cardio Exercise
Cardio, also known as cardiovascular exercise, is generally any activity that increases your heart rate. Whether that is walking, running,
cycling
, dancing, or swimming, these rhythmic activities help to strengthen your heart and lungs. What’s more, cardio has a number of health benefits.
Aside from improving heart function and lowering blood pressure, consistently fitting cardio into your weekly routine can help you sleep better, improve cognitive function, and boost your overall sense of well-being. The Physical Guidelines for Americans recommend that you fit in about 150 minutes of moderate physical activity each week.
What Is Cardio?
FIIT Principle
The FIIT principle—which stands for frequency, intensity, time, and type of exercise—is a guideline you can use to revise and improve your workout plan. When evaluating and creating your workouts, you will need to consider these four elements. Doing so will help put you on the path to achieving your fitness goals.
Additionally, these principles can be used to evaluate your existing fitness program and determine where changes need to be made. Sometimes, you will need to
adjust your program
—especially if you have hit a plateau—by making sure the elements of your workout are still meeting your physical needs.

How do you do a plank?
The most important aspect of the plank pose for a beginner isn’t the frequency or duration but rather the form. For instance, as you get into the plank position, you want to ensure your elbows are directly under your shoulders and that your forearms are facing forward. Keep your head relaxed, look at the floor between your forearms, and
engage your core

Walking is a form of cardio or aerobic exercise. It’s an effective and low-impact exercise for overall health and weight management. The 2018 Physical Activity Guidelines Advisory Committee recommends 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity per week, and walking satisfies that recommendation.
Walking is a convenient form of exercise because it can be done almost anywhere and nearly everyone can do it. All you need to get started is a good pair of shoes. Get tips on shoes, apps, and more to hit your stride on the trail or treadmill.
Frequently Asked Questions
How long does it take to walk a mile?
The time it takes to walk a mile depends on your pace. For most people, you can expect to walk a mile in about 15 to 20 minutes. With practice, you can improve your speed when walking a mile.

How to Know How Fast You Are Walking
How many calories do you burn walking a mile?
The amount of calories you burn doing any physical activity depends on several factors, such as age, sex, weight, and distance. For example, someone who weighs 165 pounds can burn about 85 calories from walking one mile at a 3 to 4 mile per hour pace. A 120-pound person burns approximately 64 calories walking the same distance at the same pace.

Walking Workout Schedule for Weight Loss
How many miles or steps should you walk per day?
If you’re going to start incorporating regular walks into your weekly routine, try to meet the recommended 150 minutes per week.
This is about 30 minutes of walking per day. However, you’re likely to get more steps by also being active throughout the day. A higher step count is associated with lower mortality, so aim for 8,000 to 12,000 steps per day.

Steps
Brisk Walking
A relaxed, slower pace that you normally walk at throughout the day is called a stroll. When you’re walking briskly, you’re walking at a faster pace of around 3.5 to 4 miles per hour. Even though you're not running, you may feel your breathing and heart rate increase as it’s more challenging than regular walking or strolling.
How Fast Is a Brisk Walking Pace
Treadmill Walking
If you can’t walk outside due to the weather (or other circumstances), you can use a treadmill to get in your daily steps. This also reduces your sun exposure. Treadmills can be a convenient way to track your speed, distance, heart rate, and time spent walking.
All About Treadmill Walking
Stride
Your stride is the distance taken in one step. If you have long legs, you may have a long stride. This means it takes you fewer steps to walk the same distance as someone with shorter legs.
The Best Technique for a Powerful Walking Stride
Gait
Your walking pattern is called your gait. It involves balance and coordination. Some people may have an abnormal gait due to neurologic, muscular, or skeletal problems.
What Wear Patterns Mean for Walking Shoes
Heart Rate
Your heart is always beating and the number of beats per minute is your heart rate. At rest, your heart doesn’t beat as fast. It beats much faster during exercise than at rest. Wearing a heart rate monitor during exercise can help you monitor your heart rate.
How to Use a Heart Rate Monitor
Steps
You can track your walking in terms of minutes, miles, or steps. Since people have different strides and therefore take a different number of steps to walk the same distance, tracking your steps can be helpful. Some people aim for 10,000 steps per day. You can track your steps with a pedometer, smartphone, or activity tracker.

Running, the action of moving yourself forward rapidly on foot, is a popular form of physical activity that requires little equipment. It's an excellent way to boost cardiovascular fitness anywhere and at any time.
All you need is a good pair of shoes, weather-appropriate gear, and a safe route.
Whether you're running for the first time or training for your next race, read this information about proper form, the best shoes, training strategies, and more.
Frequently Asked Questions
How do you run faster?
There are a few strategies that can help you pick up the pace in your runs. Incorporating
short sprints
will help, but interval training, tempo runs, and hills will also help you get faster. A treadmill may be an excellent tool for improving overall performance and increasing speed. The treadmill allows you to add hills and easily perform speed work. Of course, working on your form, weekly mileage, and allowing proper rest and recovery will also aid in increasing overall speed. Consider working with a running coach or
using a running app
to create a personalized training program to increase your speed.

How To Run Faster and Improve Race Times
How do you start running?
To ensure comfort and prevent injury, first, get medical clearance to begin running. Second, invest in
properly-fitting running shoes
. Finally, decide
where and when you will run
. Do you have a safe area (trails, road, or a track) that will enable you to regularly run outside? Or will you utilize a treadmill? Deciding which option is most readily available can help plan a running program. When you’re ready to put one foot in front of the other, consider a walk/run strategy in the beginning: commit to a set period of time, and alternate walking and running. You can increase the running component progressively over time.

How to Start Running: The Absolute Beginners' Guide
How many calories do you burn running a mile?
As a very general and simplistic rule, a runner will burn about 100 calories per mile.
Individual calorie expenditure is dependent on weight, pace, and other factors, so individuals who want a slightly more accurate estimate might use a tracking device, such as a running watch. Note that calorie counters on cardio equipment and
fitness trackers tend to overestimate calorie burn
.
Using a heart rate monitor with your tracking device may provide a more accurate estimate.
Learn More:
How Many Calories Do You Burn While Running?
What should you eat before a run?
A good rule of thumb is to choose a
combination
of foods that are high in carbohydrates and lower in fat, fiber, and protein. Carbohydrates are the body’s preferred source of fuel. There are a variety of options that can work, such as a bagel with peanut butter or a bowl of oatmeal with berries. You will want to consume your meal or snack within 90 minutes to an hour before a run. Foods to avoid before a run include spicy foods, high-fiber foods such as legumes, lactose-heavy foods, and greasy or fried foods.

Jogging is movement at a steady, gentle pace that is slower than running.  Similar to running, jogging is considered a high-impact exercise, as opposed to walking, which is low-impact.
The Difference Between Running and Jogging
Sprinting
Sprints are runs carried out at top speed for a short distance. You don’t have to be an Olympic athlete to reap the
benefits
of sprinting. Sprints can be performed in short bursts on the treadmill or outdoors as part of an overall running protocol to improve cardiovascular health and increase aerobic capacity.
How to Do Sprints
Trail running
Trail running is outdoor running that can be performed in a variety of settings, depending on your geographical location. Different trails may require different types of running shoes. Wherever you run outdoors, consider safety, and reap the physical and mental benefits of fresh air.

Strength training is a form of exercise that helps build muscle. It uses weight from your body mass or equipment to build muscle mass and increase overall strength.
Over time, lean muscle mass naturally decreases with age. Strength training helps maintain and build muscle mass, which is important for overall health. It’s beneficial for strengthening muscles and bones, maintaining a healthy weight, and improving your ability to perform everyday activities.
Frequently Asked Questions
Do runners need strength training?
A runner’s main form of exercise is likely cardio and aerobic training, but runners can also benefit from strength training. Cardio is necessary for heart health and weight management, but it doesn’t increase muscle mass like strength training. Runners should incorporate some strength training into their routines for balance.

Is strength training better than cardio?
Both strength training and cardio have their advantages. One is not outright better than the other. Cardio helps build stamina and endurance, and strength training works to increase strength and muscle mass.

What should I eat before strength training?
A high-carbohydrate meal with a moderate amount of protein and low amount of fat can fuel your strength training session. Complex carbohydrates provide energy. Follow the strength training session with a high-protein snack or meal.

How You Should Eat for Weight Training
Do I need equipment for strength training?
Equipment is not required for strength training, but it comes in handy. Beginners can start with exercises that only require body weight, such as push-ups and pull-ups. You can gradually increase the weight by using dumbbells, weighted barbells, and
various kettlebells

Functional Strength Training
Isometric Exercises
Muscle Endurance
Resistance Training
Functional Strength Training
There are different types of strength training, and functional strength training is one of them. This is when you target multiple muscles per exercise rather than isolate just one. Lunging is an example of this, since it works muscles across the legs, hips, knees, and ankles all at once.
How to Improve Your Functional Strength
Isometric Exercises
Isometric exercises are also known as static strength training. This is when your muscles are engaged, but they are not changing length. In some exercises, such as bicep curls, the muscle gets shorter and longer during the contraction. In isometric exercises, such as planks and wall sits, the muscle contraction doesn’t involve a change in length. Many isometric exercises require you to hold the exercise rather than repeat a movement.
Isometric Training Is Crucial for Building Strength
Muscle Endurance
This refers to the amount of time or repetitions you can perform an exercise before the muscle gets tired. Toward the end of your workout, you may notice your muscles feeling fatigued. They may burn towards the end of your set. Over time, your muscle endurance will improve and you can perform more repetitions.
How to Improve Muscular Strength and Definition
Resistance Training
Resistance training is a form of strength training. It uses resistance to strengthen the muscles. Resistance bands are a good example of this, but resistance is also used in pilates, cable workouts, and weighted exercises. Exercises like squats and lunges are examples of resistance training since your muscles are working against the weight of your dumbbells, body weight, or barbells.

Cardio Exercise
FIIT Principle
Strength Training
Strength training—which is sometimes referred to as resistance training or weight training—is a form of exercise intended to
increase muscular strength
and endurance. It involves exercising muscles using some form of weight or resistance such as your body weight, hand weights, machines, and more.
Strength training is designed to increase your strength and endurance, but it has a number of other benefits, too, like increasing bone density,
boosting metabolism
, building muscle, and even improving mental health.

Cardio Exercise
Cardio, also known as cardiovascular exercise, is generally any activity that increases your heart rate. Whether that is walking, running,
cycling
, dancing, or swimming, these rhythmic activities help to strengthen your heart and lungs. What’s more, cardio has a number of health benefits.
Aside from improving heart function and lowering blood pressure, consistently fitting cardio into your weekly routine can help you sleep better, improve cognitive function, and boost your overall sense of well-being. The Physical Guidelines for Americans recommend that you fit in about 150 minutes of moderate physical activity each week.
What Is Cardio?
FIIT Principle
The FIIT principle—which stands for frequency, intensity, time, and type of exercise—is a guideline you can use to revise and improve your workout plan. When evaluating and creating your workouts, you will need to consider these four elements. Doing so will help put you on the path to achieving your fitness goals.
Additionally, these principles can be used to evaluate your existing fitness program and determine where changes need to be made. Sometimes, you will need to
adjust your program
—especially if you have hit a plateau—by making sure the elements of your workout are still meeting your physical needs.

Weight management is a multi-faceted strategy that involves nutrition, exercise, hormones, mental health, sleep, and other lifestyle interventions to keep body weight at a level that allows the individual to live a comfortable, active, and productive life.
While lifestyle factors such as diet and exercise can impact weight, it’s also important to note that there is a genetic component when it comes to weight.
Maintaining energy balance, or the ability of the body to expend the calories it takes in, can be the most challenging aspect of weight management.
Additionally, some medical conditions and medications can impact weight as well making it difficult to achieve weight management goals. Whether you are looking to maintain, lose, or gain weight, we have nutrition plans and tips to help you reach your goals.
Frequently Asked Questions
What role does leptin play in weight management?
Leptin is a hormone that regulates fat storage by telling your brain how much fat your body has stored. The mechanism by which it works also helps regulate appetite. While leptin is considered the “hallmark” of obesity, its exact mechanisms and pathways in the pathophysiology and potential treatment of obesity are not fully understood.

Hormones That Regulate Hunger and Digestion
Which pattern of eating is best for weight management?
There is not a one-size-fits-all pattern of eating when it comes to weight management. Dietary choices must be customized to an individual, taking into account health history, preferences, and access, among other considerations. That said, many experts recommend the
Mediterranean Diet
for weight management and optimal nutrition due to its emphasis on fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and
healthy fats
. This eating pattern is easily customized for an individual's goals, preferences, and health concerns.
Learn More:
What Is the Mediterranean Diet?
How do you manage insulin resistance?
Insulin resistance (IR) is when your body stops responding to insulin and therefore cannot use glucose for energy. You might be more likely to develop insulin resistance if you are overweight or obese, making weight management a smart strategy for preventing this condition that can also lead to diabetes.
Diet, exercise, and managing abdominal fat are the first line of defense in management of IR. Through the guidance of a registered dietitian, some individuals may adapt
a lower-carbohydrate diet
or begin counting carbs. Maintaining a healthy lifestyle, as opposed to gaining and losing weight on a regular basis, can help prevent IR.
Learn More:
Can You Prevent Diabetes With Diet and Exercise?
How do you manage weight with hypothyroidism?
Also known as underactive thyroid, hypothyroidism is a condition in which the thyroid gland doesn't produce enough thyroid hormone. This can result in fatigue and unplanned weight gain. Because some of this unintentional weight gain may be due to fluid retention, or edema,
a low-sodium diet
may be advised, along with a caloric deficit.
Learn More:
What Is Metabolism?
How you manage weight with PCOS?
While PCOS (polycystic ovary syndrome) is associated with weight gain, the benefits of caloric restriction for this condition remain unclear. The exact causes of PCOS remain unknown, but one theory is that excess insulin may play a role, and therefore exercise paired with a lower-carbohydrate diet may benefit some individuals.
Learn More:
Low Carb Diet Overview
How important is exercise in weight management?
The foods you eat and the quantity in which they are consumed will play the larger role in weight management. However, exercise can help expend energy, build and
maintain muscle mass
, and encourage a healthier overall lifestyle. Both are important in maintaining a healthy weight throughout the life cycle.
Learn More:
How Much Do You Need to Exercise to Lose Weight?
What role does nutrition play in weight management?
Nutrition is the most important component in successful long-term weight management.  Whatever dietary pattern is chosen, maintaining a caloric deficit and then balance will be most important.  A registered dietitian can help individuals assess their caloric, macronutrient, and micronutrient needs within a culturally appropriate framework to aid in weight management.

An Overview of Nutrition
Why is intuitive eating important?
Intuitive eating can be a powerful tool in long-term weight management as it can increase comfort levels around food, and thereby remove the fears and anxieties associated with them. Removing these fears and anxieties can help eliminate the binge and restrict cycle that is associated with weight gain. Moreover, intuitive eating is positively associated with positive body image, self-esteem, and wellbeing.
Learn More:
What Is Intuitive Eating?
Is feeling satiated important in weight management?
Feeling satiated is extremely important in weight management, which is why a focus on nutrient-dense foods should be made a priority.
Many nutrient-dense foods, such as fruits and vegetables, are also
high-volume
foods, which can promote satiety. Some common mistakes in weight management are skipping meals or “saving” calories for later meals, both of which can lead to overeating later.
Learn More:
Foods That Are Satiating and Filling
What health conditions impact weight management?
Many health conditions can impact weight management, many of which are related to hormonal changes.
Metabolic syndrome
, a cluster of conditions that includes high blood pressure, elevated blood glucose levels, excess waist adiposity, and abnormal cholesterol levels, can raise an individual’s need for weight management.

Nutrition
Proper nutrition is a key component for weight management. However, it is important to choose an overall eating pattern that is sustainable over the course of your life. A diet that is too restrictive may lead to a binge and restrict cycle, bringing on weight gain and possibly even disordered eating.
The Basics of Balanced, Healthy Diet
Intuitive Eating
Intuitive eating is a non-diet approach to eating that focuses on getting back in touch with internal body cues. With this approach, you are no longer under diet restrictions that make you feel bad about yourself. It also helps you break free from diets and get healthy by improving your relationship with food and exercise. While intuitive eating may aid in weight management, it is not the end goal.
What Is the Difference Between Mindful and Intuitive Eating
Nutrient Dense Foods
Nutrient dense foods are foods that offer a high amount of nutrients for a small amount of calories. Meanwhile,
energy-dense
foods have fewer nutrients and more calories for the volume of food.
Why Nutrient Density Is the Key to Healthy Eating
Vitamins and Minerals
Vitamins and minerals are also referred to as micronutrients. Not only are they crucial to overall health, but different micronutrients are found in different foods. It is best to consume the majority of necessary micronutrients
through food,
and eating a wide variety of different foods can help ensure adequate intake.
Where to Find the Major Minerals in Food
Protein
Protein is a
macronutrient
found in foods such as meat, fish, eggs, dairy, beans, and other foods in smaller amounts. The protein found in animal-derived foods such as beef, chicken, pork, fish, milk, and eggs is more bioavailable than those derived from plants. A diet adequate in protein is key to weight management, as protein promotes satiety and helps maintain muscle mass.
How to Calculate How Much Protein You Need
Diet Types
While there are many different types of diets and eating patterns, it is important to note that weight management is achieved primarily through energy balance, and a balanced diet. A balanced diet includes a range of foods to meet the macro and micronutrient needs according to their lifestyle, preferences, and cultural norms.
As of 2022, the top ranking diet for weight loss according to "U.S. News and World Reports" is the Flexitarian Diet, which promotes weight management via vegetarian forward meals with sometimes having meat.
What Is the Flexitarian Diet?
Diet Culture
Diet culture is the pervasive belief that appearance and body shape are more important than physical, psychological, and general well-being. It's the idea that controlling your body, particularly your diet—by limiting what and how much you eat—is normal.
According to the National Eating Disorders Association, diet culture also conflates body size with health, which may stigmatize and/or pathologize larger bodies. Diet culture also refers to the concept that some foods are good and others are inherently bad, rather that encouraging the acceptance of all foods.
What Is Diet Culture?
Exercise
Exercise is planned, structured physical activity, that may include flexibility, strength, cardio, plyometric activities, or organized sports. It is important to differentiate between exercise and NEAT (
non-exercise activity thermogenesis
), which is the energy expended during tasks and daily activities aside from eating, sleeping, and exercise. This would include housework, gardening, and other bodily movements.
If an individual has a weight loss goal, maintaining a caloric deficit will be more beneficial, but exercise does indeed play a role in supporting and building muscle mass and encouraging better lifestyle choices overall.

When it comes to nutrition facts and health benefits for specific foods and beverages, Verywell Fit has you covered. From fruits and vegetables to whole grains, understanding different nutritional values helps you make educated nutrition choices.
While the numbers and percentages may seem confusing at first, a nutrition facts panel can quickly become a user-friendly tool. Whether your goal is weight management, heart health, managing diabetes, or just gaining general awareness, understanding what is going into your body has the potential to make all the difference in your personal wellbeing.
Frequently Asked Questions
How do you read nutrition labels?
The nutrition facts panel tells you what a serving size looks like, how many calories are in a serving, and how many grams of carbohydrate, fat, and protein are in that serving. It also highlights cholesterol, sodium, potassium, iron, Vitamin D, and calcium content. Some of these quantities are also expressed as a percentage, meaning that one serving of the food in question provides a certain percentage of the DV (daily value) for that nutrient. These numbers are based on a 2,000 calorie per day diet.
Learn More:
How to Read Nutrition Labels
What does RDA mean in nutrition?
RDA stands for Recommended Dietary Allowance. It is the average daily level of intake sufficient to meet the nutrient requirements of nearly all (97-98%) of healthy people.
Learn More:
How Many Calories Should I Eat in a Day?
How do nutritional needs change over time?
Nutritional needs are highest during infancy,
adolescence,
and pregnancy.
With age, some nutrient needs decline, but the need for protein may increase to prevent sarcopenia.
Most importantly, nutrition is highly personalized at all stages of life and should be planned with the assistance of a registered dietitian.

Weight Management
Weight management is the process and habits adapted over time to maintain a certain weight range throughout the lifespan. Lifestyle, including sleep, along with caloric intake and activity level, are all components of weight management.
How to Fix a Weight Loss Plateau
Calorie Counter
A calorie counter is an app or equation used to help determine the proper energy intake range to meet your unique needs. Calorie counting apps can be a great tool not only for scanning food labels, managing meals out, and logging food, but also for planning ahead by pre-logging. There are many different calorie counting apps available, and you may experiment with free trials of each until you decide on the best one for your needs and lifestyle. Note that calorie counters may not be helpful for all populations and should be avoided if they trigger disorder eating behaviors or negative associations with certain foods.
Best Calorie Counter Apps
Micronutrients
A micronutrient is a chemical element or substance required in trace amounts by humans for normal growth, development, and maintenance. Most people can get the micronutrients they need from a balanced diet. The micronutrients listed on the nutrition facts panel below the solid black line are those most Americans do not get enough of or are deficient in: Vitamin D, Calcium, Iron, and Potassium.
9 Facts About Micronutrients
Macronutrients
Macronutrients are the nutritive components found in food—fat, protein, and carbohydrate—needed in larger amounts for energy and to maintain the body’s structure and systems. The nutrition facts panel lists the percentage of each of these macronutrients in a serving based on a 2000-calorie diet. A registered dietitian can help plan the appropriate split of protein, fat, and carbohydrates to meet your needs and help you achieve your health goals.
Macro Calculators and Trackers: What You Need to Know
Supplements
Supplements are products taken by mouth that contain some kind of dietary element, such as vitamins and minerals. Some supplements may contain a botanical or herbal (plant-derived) ingredient. It is important to note that “natural” does not necessarily mean harmless and that supplements may interfere with the efficacy of other drugs or result in adverse reactions.
Moreover, the FDA (Food and Drug Administration) does not review dietary supplements before they are available to the consumer.
A registered dietitian can help plan and execute a supplement protocol if deemed necessary.
Benefits and Risks of Dietary Supplements
Balanced Diet
A balanced diet indicates a meal pattern that includes adequate calories, fat, protein, and carbohydrate, as well as micronutrients, to support overall bodily function and well-being. As the nutrition facts panel alludes to, most adults need somewhere between 2000 and 2500 calories per day, but these needs vary greatly depending on age, weight, lifestyle, and physical activity. Utilizing the nutrition facts panel can help achieve a more balanced diet by creating awareness of which nutrients to increase and minimize.

Diet is a catch-all term that refers to a person’s pattern of eating. Example diets can include vegan, vegetarian, keto, paleo, gluten-free, low-calorie, low-FODMAP, and Mediterranean diets. Each diet has its own set of guidelines that describe what is and isn’t compliant. For example, vegan diets don’t include animal products of any kind and instead are made up of all plant-based foods.
There is not a one-size-fits-all when it comes to diets and nutrition plans. Learn more about specific eating patterns to find what is best for you. You can also adjust any type of diet to make it fit better with your lifestyle, goals, and needs.
Frequently Asked Questions
What is the keto diet?
Originally used for the treatment of epilepsy, the keto diet involves a meal plan that is very low in carbs and high in fat. It touts significant weight loss by putting the body into a state of ketosis (the state when the body doesn’t have enough carbohydrates to use for energy, so it burns fat instead).
It's important to note that there is no research to date to assess the safety of the keto diet long-term.

What is a Ketogenic Diet?
What is the Mediterranean diet?
The Mediterranean diet is a highly regarded way of eating that is inspired by the eating and lifestyle habits of people who live in the Mediterranean, such as Greek populations. The long-term, lifestyle approach promotes flavor, community, movement, and abundance or nutrients and food choices. Staples of the Mediterranean diet include whole grains; vegetables; lean protein sources like fish, legumes, and nuts; and healthy fats like olive oil. Research suggests that the Mediterranean diet may reduce the risk of heart disease, cancer, and diabetes.
It is often named the
best overall diet
by "U.S. News and World Report."

What Is the Mediterranean Diet?
What is an anti-inflammatory diet?
Those with chronic inflammation or inflammatory diseases may be interested in following an anti-inflammatory diet. It focuses on foods that reduce inflammation in the body, such as fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and more. It recommends against foods that increase inflammation, such as processed foods and alcohol.
Learn More:
What Is the Anti-Inflammatory Diet?
How many carbs are in a low-carb diet?
There is no universal definition of a low-carb diet. The number of carbohydrates permitted on a low-carb diet depends on the specific meal plan. The keto diet, for example, is a variation of a very low-carb diet that typically recommends 20 to 50 grams of carbohydrates per day.
Some evidence suggests that a low carbohydrate diet may be defined as less than 130 grams per day, or 26% of total energy intake.

Low-Carb Diet Overview
What is the BRAT diet?
The BRAT diet is a highly restrictive diet recommended for people with gastrointestinal issues or upset stomachs. BRAT stands for bananas, rice, applesauce, and toast. It’s not recommended as much anymore, but it used to be highly recommended by pediatricians for children with stomach problems.

Weight loss
Many diets claim to help with weight loss. Weight loss involves lowering your body weight to prevent health complications such as heart disease and diabetes. Healthy weight loss can be achieved with the help of a registered dietitian or qualified health care provider.
The Benefits of Losing Weight
Weight gain
Those who are underweight or want to increase their muscle mass may list weight gain as one of their goals. This can usually be achieved by increasing the number of calories and adjusting the balance of macronutrients in your diet. Depending on your individual needs, you will likely need to increase your intake of protein, healthy fat, and complex carbohydrates. To gain weight healthfully, consider speaking to a registered dietitian.
What Is a Weight Gaining Diet?
DASH diet
The DASH diet aims to prevent and control hypertension (aka high blood pressure).
It’s recommended by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute and involves avoiding foods high in sugar, fat, and salt. Instead, the DASH diet focuses on fruits, vegetables, whole grains, nuts, legumes, fish and poultry, and low-fat dairy products.
What Is the DASH Diet?
Intermittent fasting
Intermittent fasting is a form of fasting that restricts eating during certain times of the day. There are many different variations of intermittent fasting, such as 5:2, alternative-day fasting, and time-restricted eating. All forms share a common thread: those who practice intermittent fasting eat all of their meals during a specific time period.
What Is Intermittent Fasting?
Nutrition
Nutrition, or the process of meeting your nutritional needs through diet, is important for overall health.
Inadequate nutrition can be associated with poor health outcomes, including increased risk for certain diseases, and growth and development issues. Adequate nutrition means consuming enough macronutrients (carbohydrate, fat, and protein) and micronutrients (vitamins and minerals) through food to help you meet nutritional needs throughout your lifespan.
An Overview of Nutrition for a Better Diet
Obesity
Obesity is a medical condition that involves having excess fat on the body, which is associated with an increased risk of certain diseases.
It’s usually defined as having a body mass index (BMI) of 30 or greater. At Verywell Fit, we acknowledge the bias and limitations of BMI and recommend speaking with a health care provider to assess your risk of obesity.
Why BMI May Not Be the Best Metric
Calories
When you look at a nutrition facts label on a food item, you will see the number of calories. This refers to a unit of energy. It describes how much energy your body could gain by eating it. Some people track their intake of calories to help with their weight loss or weight gain goals.

Fitness is a broad term that can mean a lot of different things to different people. For some, it can mean a fitness program and for others, it can refer to their fitness level. But regardless of whether you are considering improving your personal fitness level or looking for an effective fitness program, the key is that fitness is a vital part of an active, healthy, and balanced lifestyle.
Plus, there are a number of
benefits to incorporating fitness into your daily life
. Physical exercise can boost your energy, reduce the risk of health problems, and improve mental health.
So, whether you are just embarking on your fitness journey or you are a seasoned exerciser, you will find trusted information here on working out safely and effectively and making physical fitness a part of your everyday life.
Frequently Asked Questions
What is fitness and why is it important?
Generally speaking, fitness involves not only defining your exercise goals and executing your plan, but it also refers to your level of fitness or the measure of your physical abilities like
endurance
, strength, balance, and flexibility. In other words, your fitness level is unique to you, as it is your body's ability to withstand a physical workout and recover in a timely manner.
Exercising consistently is one of the most important ways you can improve your fitness levels. In fact, regular physical activity not only impacts your physical strength, heart function, and endurance, but it also can improve your brain health, help you manage your weight, and reduce your risk of disease. It also can
strengthen your bones
and muscles and improve your ability to complete everyday tasks and activities.

6 Weeks to Fitness for Absolute Beginners
How much exercise should you get each day?
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), adults should get at least 150 minutes of
moderate-intensity activity
or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity activity—or a combination of the two—each week. Examples of physical activity include walking, running, swimming, and cycling.
The CDC also recommends that two days a week, you work to strengthen your muscles. Whether that involves using bodyweight exercises, dumbbells, gym equipment, or
resistance bands
, these activities should work all the major muscle groups of your body—legs, hips, back, chest, abdomen, shoulders, and arms. What’s more, these muscle-strengthening activities should be done in addition to your physical activity.

How Much Exercise Do You Really Need?
How can you improve your fitness?
When it comes to improving your fitness level, there are many different types of exercises from which to choose. The key is to pick the right ones for you. This means selecting activities you enjoy and are able to do consistently. Plus, research indicates that most people benefit from doing a variety of things in order to improve their fitness.
For instance, you should choose some endurance or aerobic activities to help improve your heart and lungs as well as some strength or
resistance training
activities to help your muscles get stronger. Even adding in some balance and flexibility exercises can help improve your fitness level.

Strength Training
Cardio Exercise
FIIT Principle
Strength Training
Strength training—which is sometimes referred to as resistance training or weight training—is a form of exercise intended to
increase muscular strength
and endurance. It involves exercising muscles using some form of weight or resistance such as your body weight, hand weights, machines, and more.
Strength training is designed to increase your strength and endurance, but it has a number of other benefits, too, like increasing bone density,
boosting metabolism
, building muscle, and even improving mental health.
What Is Strength?
Cardio Exercise
Cardio, also known as cardiovascular exercise, is generally any activity that increases your heart rate. Whether that is walking, running,
cycling
, dancing, or swimming, these rhythmic activities help to strengthen your heart and lungs. What’s more, cardio has a number of health benefits.
Aside from improving heart function and lowering blood pressure, consistently fitting cardio into your weekly routine can help you sleep better, improve cognitive function, and boost your overall sense of well-being. The Physical Guidelines for Americans recommend that you fit in about 150 minutes of moderate physical activity each week.
What Is Cardio?
FIIT Principle
The FIIT principle—which stands for frequency, intensity, time, and type of exercise—is a guideline you can use to revise and improve your workout plan. When evaluating and creating your workouts, you will need to consider these four elements. Doing so will help put you on the path to achieving your fitness goals.
Additionally, these principles can be used to evaluate your existing fitness program and determine where changes need to be made. Sometimes, you will need to
adjust your program
—especially if you have hit a plateau—by making sure the elements of your workout are still meeting your physical needs.

Cross training might sound intimidating, but in reality, it is simply a smart strategy for getting the most out of your fitness regimen. With the ability to minimize injury and maximize recovery, cross training offers a variety of different exercises as part of an overall program.
Whether you’re working with a personal trainer, taking advantage of different classes in your neighborhood, or simply training at home, everyone from beginners to advanced exercisers can reap the benefits of cross training. Here you will learn the proper techniques and the health benefits of cross-training.
Frequently Asked Questions
What are cross training programs for beginners?
Cross training doesn’t require a specific program. Getting started can be as simple as checking out a strength-training class one day, going for a brisk walk the next, and doing a
yoga class online
at home later in the week. As with any fitness program, consult with a healthcare provider to be sure you are cleared for new activity.

An Overview of Cross Training
What are the benefits of cross training?
Cross training is a great way to minimize boredom while pursuing your fitness goals. A solid cross training program incorporates elements of strength,
cardio
, endurance, and
flexibility
. Due to the variations from day to day, cross training allows you to exercise more frequently while allowing for active recovery.

The Benefits of Cross Training
What are the best cross training shoes?
Unfortunately, one size does not fit all when it comes to
selecting shoes
for your cross training regimen. For example, you might include both running and strength-training as part of a cross training program, and these would require different footwear.
Further, the type of strength training that you partake in can impact the shoe you choose. A flat, harder-soled shoe might work best for squats and deadlifts, but a quicker-moving conditioning-based workout might require a flexible sole. Additionally, some shoes—specifically running shoes—may need to be
replaced
more often than others.

Ab workouts help increase core or abdominal strength, which leads to better balance and stability. Many ab workouts can be done at home and with minimal or no equipment. Ab workouts are also a staple in Pilates classes.
When building your workout routine, make sure to include some ab workouts. Ab exercises can help you build a strong core, improve posture, and reduce back pain.
Frequently Asked Questions
How do you strengthen your abs?
Performing ab exercises engages key muscles in the abdomen and helps you to strengthen your core. Examples include crunches, bicycle twists, planks, and mountain climbers.

Can you do ab workouts while pregnant?
To do ab workouts while pregnant, make sure to get your health care provider's approval. It’s usually safe to work out the abs during pregnancy, but you’ll likely have to make some modifications to each exercise to perform them safely and effectively.
Learn More:
The Best Exercises for Pregnancy
What's the difference between lower abs and upper abs?
It may seem like there is a difference between lower abs and upper abs, but there’s not. Your abdominal muscles are a group of muscles in the stomach area. There is usually less body fat in the upper region of the stomach, so the upper part of the abs may show through more easily. For this reason, some people feel the need to exercise their lower abs more often since they don’t show as easily.

What is the transverse abdominis?
The transverse abdominis, also known as the TVA, is a muscle located on the inside of the obliques. It’s the deepest part of the abdominal muscles and is the muscle you contract when you brace yourself for a punch. Its role is to protect the nearby organs and support the torso, spine, and pelvis.

Core
Core is another way of referring to the abdominal muscles. They’re sometimes called the core because the stomach is located in the center of the body. The word “core” also signifies the root or foundation of something, and these muscles make up the foundation of balance and stability.
How to Engage Your Core
Stability
Core strength helps improve stability, which is a degree of being stable. Having good stability helps you to balance and prevents you from falling over or stumbling.
Core Muscle Strength and Stability Test
Plank
Planks are classic ab workouts. You can perform a plank by getting on the floor on your toes and hands. Beginners may find it easier to modify planks by getting on your forearms and/or knees instead. Hold the position for at least 30 seconds to engage your core.
How to Do a Plank
Obliques
Obliques are abdominal muscles located on the sides of your stomach. Some ab exercises that target the obliques include bird dog, heel taps, side planks, and bicycle crunches.
Abdominal Muscles Location and Function
Crunch
Crunches are a go-to ab workout. They are a tried-and-true exercise that is easy to do and beginner-friendly. There are different variations of crunches, but they are always performed while lying on your back. To perform a basic crunch, bend your knees and place your hands behind your head. Use your abdominal muscles to lift your shoulders and head off the ground.
How to Do an Abdominal Crunch
V-sit
A v-sit is an ab workout that is performed on the ground. Start in a seated position and lift your extended legs to create a 45-degree angle with your torso. This also creates a V shape, hence the name. Like planks, hold the position to work the abs.

How do you do a plank?
The most important aspect of the plank pose for a beginner isn’t the frequency or duration but rather the form. For instance, as you get into the plank position, you want to ensure your elbows are directly under your shoulders and that your forearms are facing forward. Keep your head relaxed, look at the floor between your forearms, and
engage your core

Motivation: You know you need it to reach your fitness goals, but what exactly is it? Whether we’re talking exercise, work-related tasks, or managing a household, there are two main types of motivation at play: intrinsic and extrinsic. Intrinsic motivation refers to an internal stimulus, while extrinsic refers to an external one. Moreover, these two types of motivation may at times be intertwined.
Keeping up with exercise requires discipline and commitment, but it’s normal for motivation to come and go. Use the tips here to keep up with your routine and meet your fitness goals.
Frequently Asked Questions
How do you find the motivation to exercise?
Motivation to exercise can be both intrinsically and extrinsically driven.
An example of an intrinsic motivator would be the desire to feel more confident and comfortable completing day-to-day tasks. Carrying groceries, walking up the stairs without huffing and puffing, and playing more often with your kids are all examples of intrinsic motivators. You may also want to feel your best in your favorite clothes or out at the beach or by the pool. This appearance-driven motivation may be considered extrinsic.
Learn More:
What is Motivation?
What is a habit?
A habit is a regular tendency or practice. While research varies on the timeline of habit formation, over time, a habit becomes second nature.
Brushing your teeth or taking a walk every day after dinner are examples of habits.
Learn More:
How to Make Your Exercise Habit Stick
What causes a lack of motivation?
When intrinsic motivation is lacking, it may be more challenging to reach your goals. If you’re already on your journey and not seeing results, this also may be a deterrent.
Learn More:
Get Motivated to Exercise When You're Off Track
How do you make exercise a habit?
Planning and preparation can both help make exercise a habit.  This may be as simple as scheduling your workouts and honoring them in the same way you would an important meeting or doctor’s appointment.  Utilizing certain
cues
and focusing more on the habit than the reward when getting started may also be helpful.

Fitness Goals
When thinking about fitness goals, consider the SMART acronym:
s
pecific,
m
easurable,
a
ttainable,
r
ealistic/
r
elevant, and
t
imely. You’ll want to set a SMART goal that is focused on where you are today. For example, if you’re following a strength-training program, you might set a goal of being able to squat x amount of weight (say 70% of your 1RM) x number of reps in six weeks. Note that for some people, it may not be motivating to think about what they can do in 6 weeks, but rather, what they are going to do starting now and this week.
Setting SMART Goals
Fitness Journey
As the word “journey” implies, there is no destination as you embark on an active lifestyle! Your journey may even have stops and starts along the way, and that’s all part of the ride.  The key is to remain injury-free and enjoy the journey.

Reward
Rewards are incentives or benefits of completing a specific goal. Rewards can be material objects, such as a new pair of shoes, or health benefits, like increased strength. Increased physical fitness is one of the potential health-related rewards of your fitness journey. If you prefer material rewards, you might choose to treat yourself with a massage after completing a race, or a new mat carrier when you get into a groove of attending yoga classes.

Running, the action of moving yourself forward rapidly on foot, is a popular form of physical activity that requires little equipment. It's an excellent way to boost cardiovascular fitness anywhere and at any time.
All you need is a good pair of shoes, weather-appropriate gear, and a safe route.
Whether you're running for the first time or training for your next race, read this information about proper form, the best shoes, training strategies, and more.
Frequently Asked Questions
How do you run faster?
There are a few strategies that can help you pick up the pace in your runs. Incorporating
short sprints
will help, but interval training, tempo runs, and hills will also help you get faster. A treadmill may be an excellent tool for improving overall performance and increasing speed. The treadmill allows you to add hills and easily perform speed work. Of course, working on your form, weekly mileage, and allowing proper rest and recovery will also aid in increasing overall speed. Consider working with a running coach or
using a running app
to create a personalized training program to increase your speed.

How To Run Faster and Improve Race Times
How do you start running?
To ensure comfort and prevent injury, first, get medical clearance to begin running. Second, invest in
properly-fitting running shoes
. Finally, decide
where and when you will run
. Do you have a safe area (trails, road, or a track) that will enable you to regularly run outside? Or will you utilize a treadmill? Deciding which option is most readily available can help plan a running program. When you’re ready to put one foot in front of the other, consider a walk/run strategy in the beginning: commit to a set period of time, and alternate walking and running. You can increase the running component progressively over time.

How many calories do you burn running a mile?
As a very general and simplistic rule, a runner will burn about 100 calories per mile.
Individual calorie expenditure is dependent on weight, pace, and other factors, so individuals who want a slightly more accurate estimate might use a tracking device, such as a running watch. Note that calorie counters on cardio equipment and
fitness trackers tend to overestimate calorie burn
.
Using a heart rate monitor with your tracking device may provide a more accurate estimate.
Learn More:
How Many Calories Do You Burn While Running?
What should you eat before a run?
A good rule of thumb is to choose a
combination
of foods that are high in carbohydrates and lower in fat, fiber, and protein. Carbohydrates are the body’s preferred source of fuel. There are a variety of options that can work, such as a bagel with peanut butter or a bowl of oatmeal with berries. You will want to consume your meal or snack within 90 minutes to an hour before a run. Foods to avoid before a run include spicy foods, high-fiber foods such as legumes, lactose-heavy foods, and greasy or fried foods.

Aerobic exercise
Literally translating to “with oxygen,” aerobic exercise strengthens your cardiovascular and respiratory systems.
Running is a form of aerobic exercise as it uses oxygen as its primary source of energy.
Everything You Need to Know About Cardio
Jogging
Jogging is movement at a steady, gentle pace that is slower than running.  Similar to running, jogging is considered a high-impact exercise, as opposed to walking, which is low-impact.
The Difference Between Running and Jogging
Sprinting
Sprints are runs carried out at top speed for a short distance. You don’t have to be an Olympic athlete to reap the
benefits
of sprinting. Sprints can be performed in short bursts on the treadmill or outdoors as part of an overall running protocol to improve cardiovascular health and increase aerobic capacity.
How to Do Sprints
Trail running
Trail running is outdoor running that can be performed in a variety of settings, depending on your geographical location. Different trails may require different types of running shoes. Wherever you run outdoors, consider safety, and reap the physical and mental benefits of fresh air.

Strength training is a form of exercise that helps build muscle. It uses weight from your body mass or equipment to build muscle mass and increase overall strength.
Over time, lean muscle mass naturally decreases with age. Strength training helps maintain and build muscle mass, which is important for overall health. It’s beneficial for strengthening muscles and bones, maintaining a healthy weight, and improving your ability to perform everyday activities.
Frequently Asked Questions
Do runners need strength training?
A runner’s main form of exercise is likely cardio and aerobic training, but runners can also benefit from strength training. Cardio is necessary for heart health and weight management, but it doesn’t increase muscle mass like strength training. Runners should incorporate some strength training into their routines for balance.

Strength Training for Runners
Is strength training better than cardio?
Both strength training and cardio have their advantages. One is not outright better than the other. Cardio helps build stamina and endurance, and strength training works to increase strength and muscle mass.

What should I eat before strength training?
A high-carbohydrate meal with a moderate amount of protein and low amount of fat can fuel your strength training session. Complex carbohydrates provide energy. Follow the strength training session with a high-protein snack or meal.

How You Should Eat for Weight Training
Do I need equipment for strength training?
Equipment is not required for strength training, but it comes in handy. Beginners can start with exercises that only require body weight, such as push-ups and pull-ups. You can gradually increase the weight by using dumbbells, weighted barbells, and
various kettlebells

Functional Strength Training
Isometric Exercises
Muscle Endurance
Resistance Training
Functional Strength Training
There are different types of strength training, and functional strength training is one of them. This is when you target multiple muscles per exercise rather than isolate just one. Lunging is an example of this, since it works muscles across the legs, hips, knees, and ankles all at once.
How to Improve Your Functional Strength
Isometric Exercises
Isometric exercises are also known as static strength training. This is when your muscles are engaged, but they are not changing length. In some exercises, such as bicep curls, the muscle gets shorter and longer during the contraction. In isometric exercises, such as planks and wall sits, the muscle contraction doesn’t involve a change in length. Many isometric exercises require you to hold the exercise rather than repeat a movement.
Isometric Training Is Crucial for Building Strength
Muscle Endurance
This refers to the amount of time or repetitions you can perform an exercise before the muscle gets tired. Toward the end of your workout, you may notice your muscles feeling fatigued. They may burn towards the end of your set. Over time, your muscle endurance will improve and you can perform more repetitions.
How to Improve Muscular Strength and Definition
Resistance Training
Resistance training is a form of strength training. It uses resistance to strengthen the muscles. Resistance bands are a good example of this, but resistance is also used in pilates, cable workouts, and weighted exercises. Exercises like squats and lunges are examples of resistance training since your muscles are working against the weight of your dumbbells, body weight, or barbells.

Walking is a form of cardio or aerobic exercise. It’s an effective and low-impact exercise for overall health and weight management. The 2018 Physical Activity Guidelines Advisory Committee recommends 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity per week, and walking satisfies that recommendation.
Walking is a convenient form of exercise because it can be done almost anywhere and nearly everyone can do it. All you need to get started is a good pair of shoes. Get tips on shoes, apps, and more to hit your stride on the trail or treadmill.
Frequently Asked Questions
How long does it take to walk a mile?
The time it takes to walk a mile depends on your pace. For most people, you can expect to walk a mile in about 15 to 20 minutes. With practice, you can improve your speed when walking a mile.

How to Know How Fast You Are Walking
How many calories do you burn walking a mile?
The amount of calories you burn doing any physical activity depends on several factors, such as age, sex, weight, and distance. For example, someone who weighs 165 pounds can burn about 85 calories from walking one mile at a 3 to 4 mile per hour pace. A 120-pound person burns approximately 64 calories walking the same distance at the same pace.

Walking Workout Schedule for Weight Loss
How many miles or steps should you walk per day?
If you’re going to start incorporating regular walks into your weekly routine, try to meet the recommended 150 minutes per week.
This is about 30 minutes of walking per day. However, you’re likely to get more steps by also being active throughout the day. A higher step count is associated with lower mortality, so aim for 8,000 to 12,000 steps per day.

Brisk Walking
A relaxed, slower pace that you normally walk at throughout the day is called a stroll. When you’re walking briskly, you’re walking at a faster pace of around 3.5 to 4 miles per hour. Even though you're not running, you may feel your breathing and heart rate increase as it’s more challenging than regular walking or strolling.
How Fast Is a Brisk Walking Pace
Treadmill Walking
If you can’t walk outside due to the weather (or other circumstances), you can use a treadmill to get in your daily steps. This also reduces your sun exposure. Treadmills can be a convenient way to track your speed, distance, heart rate, and time spent walking.
All About Treadmill Walking
Stride
Your stride is the distance taken in one step. If you have long legs, you may have a long stride. This means it takes you fewer steps to walk the same distance as someone with shorter legs.
The Best Technique for a Powerful Walking Stride
Gait
Your walking pattern is called your gait. It involves balance and coordination. Some people may have an abnormal gait due to neurologic, muscular, or skeletal problems.
What Wear Patterns Mean for Walking Shoes
Heart Rate
Your heart is always beating and the number of beats per minute is your heart rate. At rest, your heart doesn’t beat as fast. It beats much faster during exercise than at rest. Wearing a heart rate monitor during exercise can help you monitor your heart rate.
How to Use a Heart Rate Monitor
Steps
You can track your walking in terms of minutes, miles, or steps. Since people have different strides and therefore take a different number of steps to walk the same distance, tracking your steps can be helpful. Some people aim for 10,000 steps per day. You can track your steps with a pedometer, smartphone, or activity tracker.

Physical activity is a crucial part of an overall balanced lifestyle. But it is important to use safe and thoughtful execution to help you get the most out of your workouts.
Not taking the appropriate health and safety precautions can result in you being sidelined and having your goals derailed in the process. In the end, this can reduce the likelihood of continuing with exercise as well as lead to disappointment.
Keep in mind, too, that certain conditions may require modifications, so it is important to speak to a healthcare provider for advice and input. Once you have the all-clear, you can work toward an injury-free fitness journey. Here you will find tips for preventing injuries and disease as well as managing stress so you can get the most out of your workouts.
Frequently Asked Questions
Does stretching prevent injury?
Stretching serves many purposes, first and foremost, aiding in your flexibility and range of motion. While you may have heard that stretching can
prevent injury,
there is not a lot of data to support this claim. In one older study, a static stretching routine resulted in significantly fewer incidences of muscle/tendon injury and lower back pain than in a control group, but total injury rates were equal.
Whether or not you choose to stretch is highly dependent on the type of physical activity for which you’re preparing. In fact, there is some evidence that it may do more harm than good with high-performance athletes.
Additionally, the type of stretching that may be appropriate varies as well. It should also be noted that just because
stretching feels good,
does not mean that it is necessarily preventing injury or that there is not the possibility of it aggravating an existing injury or even causing an injury.

Does exercise help to manage stress?
Exercise can aid not only physical well being, but mental health as well. By reducing tension, strengthening the
mind-body connection
, and in many cases, inspiring a sense of calm, different forms of exercise can play a role in stress management. Physical exercise also has been shown to alleviate symptoms of clinical depression,
while some forms of yoga may be a second line of defense for general anxiety disorder.

Exercise: The Best Stress Relief
Can you manage chronic illness with exercise?
Diseases such as diabetes can be prevented with exercise, and, in some cases, even reversed.
Different illnesses require different courses of action, but there is evidence that lack of exercise is a cause of chronic disease.
Learn More:
Can You Prevent Diabetes With Diet and Exercise?
Is exercise usually recommended when you have a chronic condition?
Exercising with a chronic condition requires special considerations. Alzheimers,
arthritis
, and COPD are a few of the chronic conditions that require special consideration and planning.
Above all else, ensure that you have clearance from a healthcare provider before beginning a new exercise program.

Why is it important to exercise safely?
When putting together an exercise program, considering safety allows you to optimize your efforts by limiting injury and supporting your individual health considerations. It is easy to become discouraged by exercising if you are consistently getting hurt or injured.
But exercising safely from the beginning and not pushing yourself beyond what is safe, will help ensure that physical activity becomes a lifestyle choice, not a temporary habit. In the end, this increases your enjoyment.

Key Terms
Stretching
Flexibility

Nutrition
Recovery
Stretching
Stretching is a form of exercise in which a specific muscle or tendon is intentionally flexed or stretched and temporarily lengthened. The American College of Sports Medicine recommends stretching 2 to 3 times per week. Eventually, you may want to work your way up to daily stretching.

Flexibility
Flexibility occurs when a joint or series of joints have the ability to move through an unrestricted, pain-free range of motion. Flexibility exercises help keep your muscles functioning properly and can improve your range of motion.
Health and Fitness Benefits of Flexibility Training
Stress
Stress is often defined as a state of mental or emotional strain or tension that people experience as they encounter changes in life. Although stress is a normal feeling, long-term stress may contribute to or worsen a range of health problems.
How Walking Can Boost Your Mood and Reduce Stress
Nutrition
Nutrition represents food and biological processes that allow us to utilize food for fuel. Proper nutrition involves eating a
healthy and balanced diet
and ensuring your body has the
nutrients it needs to be healthy.
Overview of Nutrition
Recovery
Recovery is the window of time that occurs after ending a round of exercise and returning to a resting state. When you exercise, you deplete the body's
glycogen
stores. Recovery allows your body to replenish these stores and give your muscles time to recover. Disregarding this need can lead to consistent muscle
soreness
and pain.

Cardiovascular exercise
, or “cardio,” is a pillar of a balanced exercise regimen. The word gets thrown around a lot, but it’s a short way of saying
aerobic exercise
. “Aerobic” refers to the requirement for oxygen. In fitness, cardio refers to physical exercises that increase your breathing rate as your body’s need for oxygen increases. It also gets your heart and blood plumping.
Classic examples of cardio exercise include walking, running,
jump roping
, swimming, and cycling. They can be low- or high-intensity, so most fitness routines can easily incorporate a style of cardio exercise.
Frequently Asked Questions
How can you increase your cardio endurance?
Endurance is the ability to ensure physical exercise or withstand physical exertion for a prolonged period of time.
Improved endurance
is a benefit of cardio exercise. Many aerobic athletes want to increase their endurance, such as running or swimming longer distances. Over time, your endurance will naturally improve. Some ways to actively work on this include incorporating intervals like sprints, decreasing your recovery time, and keeping your routine varied.

How to Improve Cardiovascular Endurance for Sports
Should you do cardio before or after strength training?
If your routine contains both cardio and
strength training
, you may wonder which to do first on the same day. There is no right answer to this age-old question. One way to figure out which works best for you is to determine your goals. If your goal is to build strength, consider strength training before cardio. If your goal is to improve your overall performance, consider doing cardio before strength training.

Cardio and Strength Training for Weight Loss: Why You Should Do Both
How long should a cardio workout be?
Roughly 150 minutes of cardio exercise per week is recommended for most people.
If you exercise five times per week, each
cardio workout
would be about 30 minutes. If you exercise three times per week, this would be about 50 minutes per workout. However, your 30 or 50 minutes of cardio exercise don’t have to be performed in succession. You can split them up, such as doing a 15- or 25-minute walk or jog in the morning followed by a 15- or 25-minute bike ride or swim in the evening.
Learn More:
Everything You Need to Know About Cardio
What should your heart rate be during cardio?
Your
heart rate
should be higher during exercise than at rest. However, it shouldn’t be too high. Here is how to determine your target heart zone and the maximum your heart rate should be. Your target heart rate should be 50 to 85 percent of your maximum heart rate. The American Heart Association has a helpful chart based on age.
Learn More:
Resting Heart Rate and Fitness
What does cardio do for your body?
Cardio directly affects your heart health. It makes it stronger and reduces the risk of heart disease.
Aerobic exercise burns calories, which can help with
losing weight
or maintaining a healthy weight. It’s beneficial for mental health, such as stress and anxiety disorders.
Cardio exercise can also help enhance sleep quality, which contributes to overall health.
Learn More:
How Beginners Can Get Started With Cardio
How much cardio is too much?
Love cardio? Then it may be easy for you to go overboard. Despite the benefits of cardio, too much of anything, including
overtraining yourself
, can be a bad thing. While there is no recommended upper limit of cardio per week, you can push yourself too hard if you do more than the recommended 150 minutes of cardio exercise per week. Cardio releases endorphins. The endorphins can become addicting, possibly creating an unhealthy
obsession with exercise
.

LISS Cardio
HIIT
HIIT stands for
high-intensity interval training
. It's a form of cardiovascular exercise that involves alternating between bursts of intense exercise and short periods of rest. Incorporating sprints throughout your treadmill workout or jog is an example. HIIT is often contrasted with
steady state cardio
.

Aerobic Exercises
Aerobic and
cardiovascular exercise
are interchangeable terms. They both refer to exercises that require more oxygen. Examples of aerobic exercises include running, jogging, walking, swimming, cycling, and much more. During these exercises, your breathing and heart rate will increase.
Anaerobic Metabolism vs. Aerobic Metabolism
Interval Training
Some cardio workouts involve
interval training
. It’s similar to HIIT. Interval training involves alternating between intense bursts of exercise and periods of rest, but there is more time for recovery in interval training than HIIT. This helps build
speed and endurance
.

Fasted Cardio
Your body is in a fasted state when you haven’t eaten in two or more hours. You’re naturally fasted when you wake up. Some people prefer to do cardio first thing in the morning before breakfast or between meals. This is called
fasted cardio
. Whether you eat before a cardio workout is largely up to you.
Does Fasted Cardio Lead to Greater Weight Loss?
Low Impact Cardio
Some forms of cardio can be more impactful on the body than others. This means it’s harder on parts of the body like joints. Many people with delicate knees, for example, seek low impact cardio exercises that are gentle on their joints.
Low impact cardio
exercises include swimming, walking, and cycling.

LISS Cardio
LISS stands for low-intensity steady state cardio. It’s the opposite of HIIT workouts. It involves performing cardio exercise at a steady pace. This could look like brisk walking or jogging at the same speed for a period of time instead of alternating between slower and faster speeds. Sustaining your speed can help increase your endurance.

As a key component for optimal athletic performance, flexibility is the ability of a joint or group of joints to move through an unrestricted, and preferably pain-free, range of motion. Stretching and flexibility exercises keep muscles functioning properly and improve range of motion. What's more, training your body to be more flexible boasts many potential benefits, including but not limited to reduced risk of injury, increased strength, better posture, and improved balance.
There are four different types of flexibility training—static stretching, dynamic stretching, active isolated stretching, and myofascial release. These flexibility training options can be performed either in isolation, or at the end of your current workout sessions. Just as with other training regimens, consistent stretching will reap the best results and enhance the rest of your fitness endeavors, too.
Here we provide information on how to become more flexible as well as how to incorporate stretching into your fitness regimen. Whether you want to improve your range of motion, reduce stiffness, or simply improve your flexibility, you will find it here.
Frequently Asked Questions
How do you become more flexible?
As with any physical goal, becoming more flexible requires a commitment to stretching. While
dynamic stretches
—active movements that stretch muscles through a full range of motion—might be best suited prior to other physical activities, static stretches can be performed as part of a cool-down or on their own.
Static stretches are held for a period of time, placing emphasis on muscle elongation. Active isolated stretching is similar to static stretching, but is performed for shorter periods of time—2 seconds repeated 10 to 12 times as opposed to static stretches, which are held for 15 to 30 seconds—and
myofascial release
is the application of a sustained pressure to a muscle as opposed to massage, which involves active rubbing and kneading.
While some stretching is better than none, incorporating all four modalities into an exercise regimen will reap the greatest benefits and increase flexibility. The efficacy of a flexibility regimen is generally measured by increased range of motion.

Health and Fitness Benefits of Flexibility Training
How often should you stretch?
The American College of Sports Medicine recommends stretching 2 to 3 times per week, working your way up to daily stretching. Hold each stretch for 15 to 30 seconds and repeat it 2 to 4 times.
Learn More:
Stretching 101: Benefits and Proper Technique
Why does stretching feel good?
While stretching may be somewhat uncomfortable (but not painful) it can feel good for a couple of different reasons. First, stretching activates the branch of the nervous system responsible for relaxation and rest known as the parasympathetic system. Additionally, stretching by nature induces
stress relief
, as feelings of tension are often held in our muscles. In fact, some research indicates that a stretching protocol can reduce anxiety levels.

8 Relaxing Total Body Stretches
How long should you hold a stretch?
Recommendations for holding static stretches vary. The American College of Sports Medicine recommends that most adults hold stretches for 15 to 30 seconds, but that older adults may benefit from stretches held for 30 to 60 seconds.
Focus on stretching major muscle groups such as the hips, glutes,
hamstrings
, calves, shoulders, back, and chest.

Muscles
Stretches for Flexibility
Stretching for flexibility should focus on major muscle groups such as the glutes, quadriceps, hamstrings,
back
, and chest. Dynamic stretches can be tailored to enhance an accompanying training session, while static and active isolated stretching may include stretches for the whole body, regardless of whether or not a workout was completed.
Benefits of Stretching
Range of motion
Range of motion is the maximum amount of movement available at a joint in one of the three planes of motion—or the capability of a joint to go through a complete spectrum of movement. Increased range of motion can be used as a measure of increased flexibility.
Some increased range of motion can be measured on your own, like increased
squat
depth or ability to stretch arms farther in
child’s pose
. A physical therapist can use a device called a goniometer to measure range of motion in other joints.
What Is Range of Motion and How Does it Impact Workouts?
Mobility
Mobility is the ability of a joint to move actively through a range of motion. Increased flexibility may result in increased mobility due to increased extensibility of stretched muscles. Some research suggests that regular stretching has a lasting effect on mobility.
Weak Hip Flexors Could Lead to Decline in Mobility
Joints
Your joints are the mobile areas where two or more bones meet. Working on range of motion through flexibility training, staying active, and maintaining a healthy weight can help maintain joint health.
Intensive Training May Help Bone Health as You Age
Muscles
Your
muscles
are the bands and bundles of fibrous tissue that contract to produce movement in the body. Skeletal—or striated muscle—is the particular type of muscle connected to bones that produces bodily movement. When muscles are tight, they can decrease range of motion. During stretching, muscles are lengthened, and tension is decreased.

What is Vinyasa yoga?
Vinyasa yoga
is a broad classification that encompasses many types of yoga, including Ashtanga, Baptiste, and power yoga. It is a rigorous practice that involves
sun salutations
, which pair movements to breathwork. If you’re looking for a type of yoga where the poses flow into one another and classes do not follow a set sequence of poses, vinyasa is the style you’re looking for.

Flexibility
When you perform exercises or
yoga poses

Balance
Balance is the practice of evenly distributing your body weight. Having good balance is helpful to perform many yoga poses. Doing yoga regularly can also

Pilates is a form of low-impact exercise similar to yoga. It involves performing exercises on a mat or on a machine (known as a reformer) to improve strength, posture, and flexibility. The repetitive moves in Pilates use resistance or bodyweight and focus on core engagement with the goal of helping the body to move with greater efficiency.
Pilates classes are a fun way to mix up your exercise routine. Many people use Pilates as a rehabilitation tool to relieve hip and back pain.
Here’s what to expect as you delve into the world of Pilates.
Frequently Asked Questions
What is the difference between yoga and Pilates?
Yoga and Pilates are often confused, but they are different forms of exercise. Both are low-impact and involve some stretching, and both seek to improve flexibility and strength. Pilates classes tend to use more equipment than yoga classes, and yoga involves holding poses or positions for longer.

Differences Between Pilates and Yoga Poses
What are the benefits of Pilates?
Pilates has many benefits. Many Pilates classes help to strengthen the core, which can improve posture and alleviate lower back pain. It can also help improve muscle strength and flexibility.

What Is Pilates?
What should you wear in a Pilates class?
What to wear to a Pilates class depends on the type of Pilates. Floor or mat Pilates classes require similar clothing to yoga classes. It’s recommended to wear form-fitting clothing that doesn’t get in the way of any movements. Reformer or megaformer Pilates classes also require form-fitting clothing that won’t get caught in the machine, but you may also need to wear grip socks. These are usually required to prevent you from slipping when using the machine. Grip gloves are usually optional.

Pilates reformer
The
Pilates reformer
is the main machine used in Pilates classes (some classes use the megaformer). The machine uses springs to add resistance to exercises. Most exercises are performed while lying down on the machine. The machine has straps for the hands and feet. When you pull on the straps, the main part of the machine—called the carriage—moves away from the starting position to stretch out the muscles.
What is the Pilates Reformer: Benefits and How To Use
Mat Pilates
Not all Pilates classes or workouts require equipment or machines. Some portion or all of a Pilates class may be done on the floor on a yoga mat. This is called mat Pilates. It uses bodyweight instead of resistance from the machine. Mat Pilates can also include smaller pieces of equipment, such as a Pilates ring, springboard, or sitting box.

Core strength
Many exercises in Pilates aim to increase core strength or the muscular strength of the torso. In Pilates, the core is sometimes called the deep core or powerhouse. Your Pilates instructor may remind you to engage your core throughout the class.
Best Exercises for Core Strength
Extension/Flexion
Extension and flexion are opposites, but they’re terms you may need to learn to get the most out of a Pilates workout. When you flex, you bring your arm or leg towards yourself. This decreases the angle between two bones. Think of flexing your arm or foot. When you extend, you open up a joint. Think of extending your arms towards the sky.
What Are the Three Planes of Motion?
Tuck
In a Pilates class, you may hear the instruction to “tuck” which simply means to tuck your pelvis. Learning how to position your pelvis is a key part of any Pilates class. When you tuck your pelvis, you protect your lower back by engaging your deep core muscles.
Tucked vs. Neutral Pelvic Alignment in Exercise
Grip socks
Grip socks are usually required for most Pilates reformer or megaformer classes. They aren’t needed for mat Pilates classes. These socks are used for safety reasons and prevent you from slipping while using the Pilates machine.

Postural alignment
Postural alignment helps encourage proper posture when standing or sitting. During a Pilates class, you may work on your posture by ensuring your spine, head, and limbs are properly aligned.

When you're creating a fitness routine, cardio is generally a common aspect to consider. How do you plan to get your heart rate pumping? There are plenty of options to add into your weekly habits, many of which, like cycling, are continuing to grow in popularity.
Whether indoors or out, following a guided program, in a group, or on your own, there’s a reason cycling continues to grow momentum. Get ready to push the pedals and reap the benefits of this full-body workout as we guide you on everything from footwear to choosing the best two-wheeler for your endeavors.
Frequently Asked Questions
What muscles does cycling work?
Cycling, indoor and outdoor, works more than just your legs and glutes (although studies confirm that cycling does stimulate deep muscles in the quadriceps and hamstrings).
Core, shoulders, hamstrings, and calf muscles all play a part in cycling, making it a full-body workout.

How Indoor Cycling Works Muscles All Over Your Body
Does cycling strengthen your core?
While cycling has the potential to strengthen your core, there is also evidence that improving your core strength off the bike can improve your pedaling performance.
For this reason, you might consider committing to cycling as your go-to training modality or as part of a cross-training regimen.
Learn More:
Power Up Your Indoor Cycling Workout
Is cycling a low-impact exercise?
Cycling is a low-impact exercise, meaning it is gentle on the joints and involves fluid motion. However, low-impact does not need to mean low intensity: changing gears, performing intervals, and cycling on an incline can increase the intensity of your cycling workouts.
Learn More:
Getting a Good Workout With Low Impact Exercise
Is cycling to work enough exercise?
As with any exercise, getting in some movement is better than nothing, including cycling to work.
In fact, one study found that cycling to work was associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular disease, cancer, and all-cause mortality.
However frequently you choose to bike to work, take appropriate safety precautions.

Upper body workouts target the chest, shoulders, arms, and back. Although fitness equipment, like dumbbells or
kettlebells
, is useful for many upper body workouts, many exercises, such as push-ups or tricep dips, can be performed with bodyweight.
If your goal is to increase your physical strength, working out your upper body is an important part of that process. In addition to
building muscle
, these workouts also can make everyday tasks such as lifting objects and carrying groceries much easier. Upper body workouts like those found here allow you to build muscle and strengthen your chest, back, shoulders, and arms.
Frequently Asked Questions
What are the benefits of upper body workouts?
The upper body is made up of smaller muscle groups than the lower body, so you may wonder if upper body workouts are worth your time. But incorporating exercises that target your upper body will help
increase your strength
, improve posture, and reduce the risk of injury. In fact, research has shown that strength training in general also increases in lean body mass, metabolic rate, and bone density as well.

How to Sculpt a Strong Upper Body
How often should I do an upper body workout?
If your weekly routine consists of 2 to 3 strength training workouts, at least one should target the upper body. In fact, two upper body workouts a week may be necessary for those who want to optimize results. Research indicates that when training major muscle groups—like the upper body—you should plan to train at least twice a week to maximize
muscle growth
.

How Often Should You Work Out?
How much weight should I use for strength training?
The weight recommended for use in a strength training session varies from person to person. Choosing a weight to use depends largely on your experience level and goals. If you’re a beginner, start with a lower amount of weight. For example, you may use 1- or 2-pound dumbbells to perform
bicep curls
as a beginner, but find that you can quickly graduate to 5- or 10-pound weights as you get more comfortable.

What are the primary upper body exercises?
Upper body exercises include staples like
push-ups
, pull-ups, bicep curls, overhead press, chest press,
tricep extensions
, rows, and more. These are exercises that target the upper body muscles, including biceps, triceps, chest, back, and shoulders.

How will upper body workouts impact weight management?
Strength training burns calories, which can help with weight loss or weight management. It also helps build muscle, which burns more calories—even at rest. What's more, a new systematic review and meta-analysis show it is possible to lose about 1.4% of your entire body fat through strength training alone.
If your goal is to lose weight, pair strength training with a
balanced diet
for the best results.

What does an upper body workout include?
An upper body workout can include a variety of exercises and depends largely on the equipment available to you. You can do a lot of upper body exercises with bodyweight or dumbbells such as
front raises
, kickbacks, and rows. But if you do not have access to these tools, you can use common household items, such as soup cans or water bottles, in place weights for some exercises.

Recovery is essential to any workout plan and can help prevent injuries. Learn more about how to optimize recovery through rest, nutrition, and hydration.
Frequently Asked Questions
How do you speed up muscle strain recovery?
You may have heard of the RICE method. No, we’re not talking grains here, but rather
R
est,
I
ce,
C
ompression, and
E
levation. Following these steps can help mitigate aggravation when suffering from muscle strain. A health care provider may also advise taking anti-inflammatory medication or acetaminophen to reduce swelling. Stretching and light movement, depending on mobility, can increase blood flow to the area and aid recovery, but some research suggests protection and immobility of a ruptured muscle is best.
Learn More:
Why You Need Rest and Recovery After Exercise
What is active recovery?
Active recovery involves performing a lower-intensity physical activity following more strenuous exercise. This can be performed either immediately after (for example, spending 10-15 minutes on a recumbent bicycle upon completion of a heavy squat session), or the next day (going for a swim or doing some gentle yoga the day after CrossFit).
Active recovery can encourage muscle rebuilding by increasing blood flow to heavily-taxed muscle groups, as opposed to passive recovery, which involves no movement at all. While arguably passive for the athlete, research suggests massage is an effective strategy for recovery and may result in decreased muscle soreness and inflammation.
Learn More:
What Is Active Recovery and When Should You Use It in a Workout?
Do muscle recovery supplements work?
Supplements, including those purported to promote muscle recovery, are not regulated by the FDA or approved for safety and efficacy before they are marketed to the public. For this reason, it is important to work with a knowledgeable health care provider prior to including a supplement in your routine.
That said, some evidence supports the use of products marketed to support muscle recovery, such as
BCAAs
.
While whole foods are preferable when possible, protein powder may be useful to hit protein requirements for athletes. For example,
whey protein
offers a complete amino acid profile to stimulate muscle protein synthesis.
Additionally, evidence shows that consumption of casein protein before bedtime can stimulate muscle protein synthesis.
Learn More:
The Best Post-Workout Supplements, According to a Dietitian
What foods help with muscle recovery?
While protein-rich foods (think lean meat, cottage cheese, eggs, and fish) promote muscle protein synthesis, restoring muscle glycogen with carbohydrates is key. The International Society of Sports recommends a post-workout feeding with a 4:1 carbohydrate to protein ratio.
Antioxidant-rich foods may also be beneficial. Tart
cherry juice
, which is rich in a group of antioxidants called polyphenols, can aid in muscle recovery and decrease inflammation.
Learn More:
The 8 Best Recovery Foods and Drinks for Your Workout
How much sleep is needed for muscle recovery?
Research suggests that higher sleep quality is associated with greater muscle strength,
and other data suggests that sleep hygiene is just as crucial to performance as physical training.
Sleep deprivation can also result in a reduction of IGF-1 (insulin-like growth factor), which helps regulate muscle protein synthesis.
While 7-9 hours of sleep is generally sufficient, experts warn that a one-size-fits-all is ill-advised, as sleep recommendations for optimal muscle recovery may be sports-specific.

Key Terms

Stretching
Post-workout snacks
Post-workout snacks are often easily digestible forms of carbohydrates and protein, such as protein bars, smoothies, or fruit with nut butter. Adequate nutrition after a workout is as important as the workout itself. The International Society of Sports Nutrition recommends following the guidelines of a 4:1 carbohydrate to protein ratio and limiting fiber and fat (too much of either will slow absorption of easily digestible carbs and protein) after an intense workout session. Meeting overall individual protein requirements is also crucial to recovery.
What to Eat After a Workout: Post-Workout Nutrition, Timing, and Tips
Pre-workout snacks
What you consume as a pre-workout snack depends on how much time you have. Eating immediately before a workout is generally not recommended. Pairing protein with carbohydrates approximately 1 to 4 hours before training will fuel your body while also giving it time to digest. Remember, digestion is “work” for your body, and you don’t want this process competing with the “work” of your training session.
Pre-Workout Snack Ideas
Rest days
While there are no hard and fast rules on how many days to rest between intense workouts (recovery varies based on the individual), it is generally recommended that muscles are given time to recover, whether it be 24-48 hours or less in some cases. Active rest days, such as participating in lower-intensity physical activity following strenuous training, may facilitate recovery by directing blood flow to muscle tissue.
Why You Need Rest and Recovery After Exercise
Stretching
Stretching is flexibility training that may increase range of motion and reduce muscle tension, but there is little evidence that it aids in actual recovery.
Flexibility as part of an overall training regime has other benefits, including stress relief and relaxation. Some research suggests that stretching may improve sleep quality, which in turn can have a positive impact on muscle recovery.

Incorporating lower body exercises is crucial for a balanced workout routine. These workouts target muscles in the lower body, such as the quads, hamstrings, calves, and glutes. The muscles in the lower body are some of the largest on the body, so you use them during everyday activities like walking and even lifting heavy objects.
You can perform lower body workouts at the gym, studio, or at home. You may need equipment like dumbbells, kettlebells, or weighted barbells. Or, you can perform bodyweight-only lower body exercises.
Frequently Asked Questions
What are the best exercises for glutes?
Glute exercises may vary depending on the equipment available to you and whether you work out at a gym or at home. Generally, exercises that target the glutes include squats, deadlifts, glute bridges, and lunges. These can be done anywhere and are often done with dumbbells or weighted barbells. Relying only on your body weight is also an option.

You don’t have to get a gym membership or join a workout studio to stay active. In fact, home workouts have become a popular way for everyone from stay-at-home parents to people who work from home to meet their fitness goals. They're especially beneficial for those with time or budget constraints.
Plus, at-home workouts are simple, fun, and effective. You can incorporate elements of gym and studio workouts—such as yoga, pilates, cycling, strength training, and more—into your home workout or create a routine that is unique to you and your goals. Check out our motivation tips and full-body workouts to help you get started on your home workout regimen.
Frequently Asked Questions
How do you get motivated to do a workout at home?
Motivation is one of the biggest challenges that people who work out at home face. Without the accountability of a gym buddy or a class to look forward to, you may find yourself struggling to stay motivated. To improve motivation and reach your goals, try logging your workouts in a
fitness journal
, using an activity tracker like a
smartwatch
, and be sure to find workouts you enjoy. However, don’t be too hard on yourself. If you’re struggling with motivation, it may be time to reassess your goals and your routine.

How do you create a workout plan for beginners?
Working with a
personal trainer
can be incredibly helpful for beginners. But, when you exercise at home, that may not be an option. Other ways for beginners to learn the ropes is turning to online resources like videos and articles. You can also take workout classes from home by streaming them online.

What are the benefits of home workouts?
Working out from home can save you time and money. After all,
gym memberships
and studio fees can get expensive. And although purchasing your own equipment requires some investment up front, over time, it’s usually more cost-effective. At-home workouts may also save you time because there’s no need to drive to and from the gym, check in at the front desk, or wait on equipment to free up.

How do you stay safe working out at home?
If you’re worried about injuring yourself when working out from home, there are a few precautions you can take. Always wear the proper attire when working out from home and handle equipment, like machines and weights, carefully. Additionally, avoid doing any heavy lifting without
someone to spot you
nearby. Stretch before and after a workout to reduce the risk of injury.

What You Need to Know About Working Out at Home
How do you set up a home workout space?
Working out from home requires ample space, so you’ll need to find a place in your home that is suitable for exercise. This can be inside, such as in your garage, a dedicated home gym, or even your living room. Some people enjoy
outdoor workouts
.
If you work out inside, you may want to protect your floors from heavy equipment with floor mats. But if your workout plan doesn’t require heavy machines or weights, you may only need a yoga mat, light dumbbells, and other miscellaneous pieces of equipment that you can store in a closet or basket when not in use.

Planks
Planks are abdominal exercises that increase
core strength
, but you may also feel them working your arms and shoulders as well. To perform a plank, begin in a position that is similar to a push-up. You can hold the plank position on your palms or forearms. For beginners, try lowering your knees to the mat to make it easier. Hold the position for as long as you can. Some people begin with a goal of 30 seconds.
How to Do a Plank
Squats
Squats are a lower-body exercise. You can perform them with bodyweight or make it more challenging by adding weights. There are different types of squats including box squats,
goblet squats
, pistol squats, wall squats, and more. Experiment with different types of squats to determine what is right for you.
How to Do a Squat
Lunges
Lunges target the muscles in the lower body. To perform a lunge take a step forward and place your foot flat in front of you. Your front knee should be bent at a 90-degree angle. Your back leg is slightly bent on the ball of your foot. Performing lunges will help you tone and strengthen the muscles in your lower body. You can even
add dumbbells to your lunges
to make them more challenging.
How to Do Lunges
Squat Jumps
Squat jumps take regular squats up a notch. Start in a squatting position and explode up in a jumping motion. Return to the starting position and repeat. This exercise warms up the lower body and increases core strength. It also gets your heart rate up. If you really want to push yourself, you can try doing a
30-day squat challenge
at home.
How to Do Squat Jumps
High Knees
Doing cardio at home can be difficult with limited space, but high knees are a good exercise to do at home if you want to get in more
cardio
. To do high knees, start in a standing position. One at a time, lift each knee to your chest and alternate between legs while swinging your opposite arm forward. As you gain speed, this exercise starts to look like running in place. Doing this exercise
targets the lower body
and core and is relatively easy to add to a home workout.
19 Effective Cardio Workouts for a Gym-Free Workout
Strength
Strength refers to the measure of a person’s physical exertion. In exercise, it usually refers to lifting weights. Strength training and
weight training
are the primary ways to increase physical strength.
At-Home Strength Workouts for All Levels
Cardio
Cardio is short for cardiovascular exercise. It’s also another word for aerobic exercise, which is when the body requires more oxygen to complete movements. Examples of cardio include running,
brisk walking
, jogging, swimming, and
cycling
. Cardio also gets your heart rate up and blood pumping and can improve cardiovascular health, lower all-cause mortality rates, and support weight management goals.
Everything You Need to Know About Cardio
Flexibility
Flexibility is used to measure a person’s range of motion when performing an exercise or stretch.
Stretching
is one way to improve your flexibility, which makes it easier to perform certain exercises. Flexibility also comes in handy in your daily life. For example, if you drop something in the backseat of your car, flexibility helps you to reach around and grab it.

Cardio Exercise
FIIT Principle
Strength Training
Strength training—which is sometimes referred to as resistance training or weight training—is a form of exercise intended to
increase muscular strength
and endurance. It involves exercising muscles using some form of weight or resistance such as your body weight, hand weights, machines, and more.
Strength training is designed to increase your strength and endurance, but it has a number of other benefits, too, like increasing bone density,
boosting metabolism
, building muscle, and even improving mental health.

Cardio Exercise
Cardio, also known as cardiovascular exercise, is generally any activity that increases your heart rate. Whether that is walking, running,
cycling
, dancing, or swimming, these rhythmic activities help to strengthen your heart and lungs. What’s more, cardio has a number of health benefits.
Aside from improving heart function and lowering blood pressure, consistently fitting cardio into your weekly routine can help you sleep better, improve cognitive function, and boost your overall sense of well-being. The Physical Guidelines for Americans recommend that you fit in about 150 minutes of moderate physical activity each week.
What Is Cardio?
FIIT Principle
The FIIT principle—which stands for frequency, intensity, time, and type of exercise—is a guideline you can use to revise and improve your workout plan. When evaluating and creating your workouts, you will need to consider these four elements. Doing so will help put you on the path to achieving your fitness goals.
Additionally, these principles can be used to evaluate your existing fitness program and determine where changes need to be made. Sometimes, you will need to
adjust your program
—especially if you have hit a plateau—by making sure the elements of your workout are still meeting your physical needs.

How to Address Weight Challenges
Wondering, "How many calories should I eat a day?" Eating a certain number of calories daily can help you achieve and maintain a healthy weight. Research further indicates that, when following a balanced diet, consuming the best number of calories for you can also help improve your health and boost longevity.
When determining how many calories you should eat per day, it helps to first understand the established recommended calorie intakes. From there, you can consider other factors to find the right calorie intake for you, given your body and health-related goals. Here is what you need to know about daily calorie consumption.
How Many Calories Should You Eat In a Day?
How many calories you should eat in a day will change as your body composition and size, activity level, and health change. Knowing the recommended calorie intake guidelines can provide a better idea of your calorie range. These vary based on whether you are an adult, a teen, or a child.
Adults
The recommended calorie intake for adult women ranges from
1,600 calories
per day to 2,400 calories per day, according to the 2020-2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans.
For men, the amount is slightly higher, ranging from 2,200 to 3,200 calories per day.
If you are somewhat sedentary or older, your calorie needs are likely toward the bottom of the range. You may be closer to the top if you are fairly physically active, pregnant, or breastfeeding.

Teens
Calorie intake recommendations for teens vary based on age, sex, and
activity level
. A 13-year-old girl's recommended intake ranges from 1,600 to 2,200 calories daily, with a 2,000 to 2,600 recommended intake for a 13-year-old boy.
These amounts increase slightly in the later teen years. The range for girls aged 14 to 18 is 1,800 calories per day to 2,400. The recommended calorie intake for boys in this same age range is somewhere between 2,000 and 3,200 calories.
Children
Children between the ages of 2 and 3 need between 1,000 and 1,400
calories daily
. Where they fall in this range depends on how active they are.
At 4 to 8 years of age, the range starts at 1,200 calories daily and increases to 1,800 calories for girls and 2,000 calories for boys. At 9 to 13 years, the calorie range is 1,400 to 2,200 calories per day for girls and 1,600 to 2,600 calories daily for boys.
Infants and young children are generally good at self-regulating their calorie intake, so it may be more helpful to ensure they have a balanced diet versus watching how many calories they consume.

Factors That Affect How Many Calories You Should Eat
As the recommended calorie intake guidelines suggest, the
number of calories you need
per day can vary based on various factors. Among them are:
Sex
Height
Weight
Age
Activity level
Additional factors that can affect how many calories your body uses for energy, thus also impacting how many you should consume, include your hormones,
some medications (such as steroids and some diabetes medicines),
and your overall health.
The
Nutrition Facts label
on foods provides information based on a
2,000 calorie per day diet
.
But people can have different calorie needs. Determining your individual needs can help you maintain a healthy weight.
Using Weight Loss Calculators
Whether your goal is to lose weight, gain weight, or
maintain your current weight
, an online calculator (or
calorie counter app
) can help. The calculator uses your sex, weight, height, and age to determine the number of calories you need to fuel your body for daily activity.
Then it adds the calories needed to gain weight or subtracts the calories required to
help you lose weight
if you're using it as a weight loss calculator. It can figure out how many calories you should eat to maintain weight as well.
Inputting accurate information can help determine your daily caloric needs. If you're unsure how active you are during the day, keep an activity journal for a week or look at data from your fitness tracker to get a quick estimate.
Next, the calculator will ask you about your goals. It's important to be realistic during this step. Try to
set goals
that you believe are attainable. Once you reach your goal, you can always set a new one.
If you are trying to lose weight, a
healthy rate of weight loss
is 0.5 to 2 pounds per week.
If you are trying to gain weight
,
adding 1 to 2 pounds per week is a healthy goal.
Reaching Your Goal Weight
After entering your information into the calorie calculator, you'll receive a daily calorie goal. This is the number of calories you should eat daily to reach your desired weight in the set time frame.
To Lose Weight
If weight loss is your goal, a
calorie deficit
is factored into your recommended daily
caloric intake
. A calorie deficit is simply an energy shortfall—consuming fewer calories than you use—so your body burns stored fat (excess weight) for fuel.
You can create a calorie deficit by eating less than your body needs. You can also burn extra calories by increasing your physical activity. Combining the two (a balanced diet and exercise) is a healthy strategy for losing weight.
While it may be tempting to restrict your calorie intake dramatically, a
very low-calorie diet
(fewer than 800 to 1000 calories per day) can backfire. You should only do so with a healthcare provider's supervision to ensure that the diet meets your nutritional needs.
To Gain Weight
If you are trying to gain weight, your daily calorie goal will include a calorie surplus. The key to making this gain healthy involves following a few simple guidelines:
Eat high-quality high-calorie foods, such as high-protein meats, healthy fats, and
whole grains
.
Eat more often (this helps if you get full quickly).
Add extra calories to your meals by putting
nuts
on your morning oatmeal.
Drink nutrient-rich shakes.
Stay active to boost appetite and consider adding
strength training
into your exercise routine.
Dine with friends and family to make meals more enjoyable
We've tried, tested, and reviewed the
best protein shakes
. If you're in the market for an activity tracker, explore which option may be best for you.
To Maintain Weight
Several pieces of research have sought the best ways to maintain one's current weight, especially after successful weight loss. Many of these studies report that results are mixed as to what strategies may work best.
However, many of these studies did find that following a
higher-protein diet
might help with weight maintenance. A diet rich in omega-3 fatty acids and
polyphenols
was also suggested as an effective approach to sustaining a healthy weight.
What to Know About Nutrition
You can eat whatever you want and lose weight if you stay within your calorie range. That said, it might be hard to stay in this range if you don't eat nutritious foods.
Plus,
empty-calorie foods
don't provide your body with the nutrients you need to live an active life. And when you eat less nutritious foods, you're likely to get hungry more often and overeat. Conversely, nutritious foods help you to feel strong, energized, and satiated.
Additionally, all calories are not created equal. Calories from nutritious food sources will help you feel full longer, fuel your daily activity, and improve your well-being. Empty calories can leave you feeling hungry, increase your food cravings, and even increase fatigue. You'll find them in processed foods that contain
added sugars
, trans fat, excess fat, and calories. They may provide energy but not the
fiber
, vitamins, and minerals you need.
What to Eat
Nutrition experts recommend that you fill your plate with:
Colorful vegetables
like leafy salad greens, bright peppers, crunchy
carrots
, or
radishes
(experiment to find flavors that you enjoy)
Lean meats
like
chicken
and
fish
, eating red meat in moderation
Whole grains
that provide fiber, such as
oatmeal
or
whole-grain bread
, or
crackers
Whole fruits
rather than fruit juices or fruit-flavored snacks
Nuts, seeds
, and other sources of healthy fats, in small servings
Water
instead of sports drinks, sweetened tea, or soda
How to Address Weight Challenges
Evaluate your eating and exercise habits to see if there are
adjustments you can make
to reach your goal. There may also be medical reasons that you can't lose weight. So talk to a healthcare provider if you are concerned.
Your physician may be able to refer you to a registered dietitian for personalized nutrition advice. They also can evaluate your medical history and current fitness level to help you determine what type of exercise is right for you.
The Psychology of Weight Loss: How to Overcome Negative Self-Talk
A Word From Verywell
Determining your ideal caloric intake is a smart part of being mindful of your nutrition. Although being intentional about weight is one way to contribute to your overall health, being overly focused on calorie intake can be a worrying sign of
diet culture
or even disordered eating. Consult a healthcare provider if you need help navigating your ideal calorie intake.
Frequently Asked Questions
How many calories a day should I eat to lose weight?
This depends on a host of factors, including sex hormones, genetics, base metabolism rate, size, and more. Conventional wisdom has said to aim for a 500 calorie per day deficit to lose weight at a safe and sustainable weight. It's not usually quite that simple, and a healthcare professional can help you figure out a good plan for your circumstances.

What Is a Calorie?
How many calories a day should I eat to gain weight?
Like losing weight, gaining weight depends on multiple factors. There isn't a one-size-fits-all approach, but adding an extra 500 calories per day is a great way to start to gain weight. Choose nutrient- and calorie-dense foods. Adding nutritious and heart-healthy polyunsaturated and monounsaturated fats is a good start.

What Does BMI Measure?
How It's Measured
Health Risks of High BMI
Health Risks of Low BMI
Benefits of a Normal BMI
Bias and Limitations
Other Measurement Methods
Body Mass Index (BMI) is a dated, biased measure that doesn’t account for several factors, such as body composition, ethnicity, race, gender, and age.
Despite being a
flawed measure
, BMI is widely used today in the medical community because it is an inexpensive and quick method for analyzing potential health status and outcomes.
Body mass index (BMI) is a calculation that is sometimes used in healthcare settings as an indirect method to determine a person's body weight category. This BMI calculator can help you learn what this measurement means and how it relates to your health and fitness.
What Does BMI Measure?
BMI is a measurement that takes into account your height, and weight to produce a calculation. This calculation is a measurement of your body size and can be used to determine how your body weight is related to your height. It is a method of determining whether you may be underweight, average weight, overweight, or obese, but it has flaws.
BMI is not a diagnostic tool nor is it a measurement of body fat percentage. A high BMI may or may not be an indicator of high body fat, but it doesn't necessarily mean that a person is overweight or obese and it alone is not a direct indicator of health.
In some populations, BMI has been found to be a fairly reliable indicator of body fat measures. But the calculation is less effective in other groups, such as bodybuilders and older adults. There are other methods that are more accurate in estimating body fat.
How BMI Is Measured
Your BMI is calculated using your height and weight. It can be a starting point for understanding the way your body fat may impact your overall health. You can use the number along with other health measurements to begin a conversation with your healthcare provider about ways to reduce your risk for disease and improve your overall wellness.
Imperial
Formula
: weight (lb) / [height (in)]
2
x 703
Example
: weight = 150 lbs, height = 5’5” (65")
BMI calculation
: [150 / (65)
2
] x 703 = 24.96
Metric
Formula
: weight (kg) / [height (m)]2
Example
: weight = 68 kg, height = 165 cm (1.65 m)
BMI calculation
: 68 / (1.65)2 = 24.98
Note that BMI is interpreted
differently in children
. Growth charts and percentiles are used. If children are at or above the 95th percentile of children their age, they are considered obese.
For adults, BMI results are interpreted as follows.
BMI Measurement
Weight Category
Below 18.5
Underweight
18.5 – 24.9
Normal weight
25.0 – 29.9
Overweight
30.0 and above
Obese
Health Risks Related to High BMI
The reason BMI is used for screening the health of the general population is due to the correlation between being overweight or obese and having certain health problems. People who are overweight or obese have an increased risk for:
Coronary heart disease
Hypertension
Osteoarthritis
Sleep apnea and respiratory problems
Some cancers
Stroke
Type 2 diabetes
Health Risks Related to Low BMI
While a high BMI may be an indicator for increased health risk, low BMI can also be indicative of health issues. People who are
underweight
according to the BMI scale can be predisposed to:
Cardiovascular disease
Depression
Difficulty conceiving (in women)
Dry skin
Hair loss
Irregular menstruation (in women)
Nutrient deficiencies
Osteoporosis
Poor immune system
Benefits of a Normal BMI
Maintaining a normal BMI (18.5 to 24.9) comes with many benefits, including limiting your risk to all of the above-listed health concerns. Not only are you less likely to have high blood pressure, heart disease, or diabetes, but maintaining a normal BMI can also help with better sleep, improved circulation, and even better energy throughout the day.
Bias and Limitations
The original index was developed to create statistics about population samples using European men as a baseline. It has since been used to assess people of all ages and races, perpetuating the creators' bias that the male, European body was the ideal body and measure of a person's fit-ness.
There are several known limitations of body mass index. First, the calculation does not take age or gender into account. Men tend to carry more muscle than women and this is not factored into the equation. BMI does not distinguish between muscle mass and fat mass in its calculation. Also ethnic and race variations are not considered.
While BMI can be a tool doctors use to understand your health status better, it is not a solitary diagnostic tool. When measuring your body fat composition, physicians also take into account your diet, lifestyle, level of physical activity, family history and genetics, as well as other health screenings.
Fitness, especially, is very important. Researchers have found that being fit negates the adverse effects of excess body fat, as well as other traditional cardiovascular risk factors, including obesity, metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and hypertension.
Body Composition, Body Fat, and BMI
Athletes who have higher levels of muscle mass need to be leery of the BMI calculation. Because the BMI number cannot distinguish the different components that make up total body weight, an athlete is better served by using a direct measurement of body composition and body fat.
The BMI calculation is used to screen the general population for health risks related to having too much body fat. This tool does not work well for most athletes who are curious about their body composition.
Body Fat Measurement Methods
BMI does not measure body fat. If you're interested in knowing your percentage of lean mass versus fat mass there are several methods of assessing a body's percentage of fat. These methods are referred to as
body composition analysis
. Some of the most common measurements include:
Bioelectrical impedance
: This common method of assessing body fat percentage determines total body weight, the percent and amount of body fat, muscle mass, water, and even bone mass. While readings can be affected by hydration level and other factors, they provide fairly accurate results over time. Some
smart scales
employ this method of measurement.
Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA)
: This is an x-ray scan that measures a person's bones (specifically their mineral density and bone loss) to calculate the possibility of developing osteoporosis. However, these DEXA machines have limitations and the technology that is widely used is unable to measure the bones in people who weigh 300 pounds or more or who are taller than 6 feet.
Skinfold thickness measurements
: Many experts use this simple method to determine body composition. Skinfold calipers are a common
device used to monitor body fat
.
Underwater weighing
: This procedure, also known as hydrodensitometry or hydrostatic weighing, is complex and complicated, so it is rarely used.
A Word From Verywell
While body mass index can be a useful tool for some people, it is just one number that should always be considered within the context of other data. Talk to your healthcare provider about the best way to understand your BMI as part of a comprehensive plan for good health and longevity.

Why Percentage Matters
Other Ways to Measure
How to Reduce Body Fat
There are different ways to calculate your body fat percentage. Some methods require special equipment or access to expert services. These methods are recognized as being the most accurate.
You can also estimate body fat percentage at home. A body fat calculator is the easiest method because it requires no special tools or lengthy appointments with a specialist.
This method will estimate your body fat percentage, which you may confirm with other methods. You'll need a basic tape measure and about five minutes to gather the data you need for an instant body fat measurement.
⁣How to Use the Body Fat Calculator
There are a few best practices to keep in mind when figuring out how body fat is calculated. Follow these guidelines for calculating the most accurate body fat percentage.
When to Take Body Fat Measurements
You'll want to take measurements first thing in the morning to get the most accurate result. Your
weight can fluctuate
throughout the day, so it's smart to get your numbers before you've had anything to eat or drink.
What to Use
Once you've weighed yourself, you'll need to take body measurements. Use a soft, flexible (cloth or fiberglass) tape measure to gather your numbers. Do not use an elastic tape measure. A measuring tape like what a tailor uses is optimal.
How to Take Your Body Fat Measurements
When you measure the circumference of each body part, the tape should feel firm enough against your skin so it stays in place. However, it should not be so tight that it causes an indentation. You can use either imperial or metric units.
The measurements that need to be taken are slightly different for men and women. Men only measure waist circumference, but women also measure other parts of the body, including the hips, wrist, and forearm.
Men
Current weight.
Use a digital scale if possible.
Waist circumference.
Measure the largest part of your belly, usually right at the level of your umbilicus (belly button). Make sure that the tape measure stays level with the floor. Don't hold your breath or suck in to get the measurement.
Women
Current weight.
Use a digital scale if possible.
Waist circumference.
Measure the largest part of your belly, usually right at the level of your umbilicus (belly button). Make sure that the tape measure stays level with the floor. Don't hold your breath or suck in to get the measurement.
Wrist circumference.
Measure around the smallest part of your wrist. You may need a partner to help with this measurement as it is hard to measure one-handed.
Hip circumference.
Measure around the largest part of your hips, usually at the posterior extension of the gluteals (where your butt extends back).
Forearm circumference.
Measure around the widest part of your arm below your elbow. It will be easiest to have a partner get this measurement. Keep your arm relaxed during the measurement and let it hang alongside your body (don't bend or flex the arm while measuring).
Once you've gathered your numbers, input the data to calculate your body fat percentage.
How to Improve Body Composition With Nutrition and Exercise
Body Fat Percentage Categories
Now that you've got your number, you probably want to know how your body fat percentage compares with other men or women in various categories. There are five ranges or body fat categories,
according to the American Council on Exercise (ACE). Keep in mind these categories are based on body fat norms and may not indicate your specific level of fitness or health.

Links to Disease Risks
It is problematic to assign a strict cut-off for what body fat percentage puts someone at higher risk of health concerns like heart disease, diabetes, and stroke. Body fat percentage as a standalone figure does not account for gender, ethnicity, or age differences.
Other measurements may help you evaluate your risk for conditions like cardiovascular disease. If your body fat is too high according to the calculator, speak to a healthcare provider about different tools that you can use to measure your health risks.
One of the most popular assessment tools is body mass index (BMI). BMI is a number that is used to evaluate your body size. It is not a percentage of body fat but a general score that helps determine if your weight falls into a healthy range.
The number is calculated using your weight and height. If you carry too much weight for your height, the excess weight is assumed to be fat.
Body mass index is simply a tool that puts you into a category based on weight. It is not designed to be an accurate diagnostic tool for determining health.
Body Mass Index (BMI)
is a dated, biased measure that doesn’t account for several factors, such as body composition, ethnicity, race, gender, and age.
Despite being a flawed measure, BMI is widely used today in the medical community because it is an inexpensive and quick method for analyzing potential health status and outcomes.
Why Measure Body Fat Percentage?
Why does body fat percentage matter? If your
goal is weight loss
, you might be tempted to use a simple bodyweight scale for feedback on your progress, but your body fat percentage will tell you more than the scale.
When your goal is weight loss or to increase your fitness, fat loss should be your goal rather than simple weight loss. You want to keep the lean mass, or fat-free mass, that your body needs. Lean mass includes bone, blood, connective tissue, organs, and muscle.
Muscle loss can occur when you lose weight, but it's not the kind of weight loss you seek. You want to maintain muscle mass because it helps your body to function and perform more efficiently, boosts your metabolism, and can help improve glycemic control.
By measuring changes in body fat percentage, you can gauge how well your fitness or weight loss program is helping you to lose fat while maintaining fat-free mass.

How to Determine Your Body Fat Percentage
More Ways to Measure Body Fat Percentage
There are many
ways to measure body composition
(or the amount of fat and lean mass). Using a body fat calculator is just one.
One method for measuring body fat percentage won't be appropriate for everybody. For example, if you would be uncomfortable going underwater, you would not want to attempt
hydrostatic weighing
. Each method also has its pros and cons.
Body Fat Calculator
When you input body measurements into a body fat calculator like the one above, the tool uses a specific formula to estimate your body fat percentage. The formula is slightly different for men and women.
For women, the formula begins with a simple weight calculation:
(Total bodyweight x 0.732) + 8.987
The tool uses fractions of each body measurement to estimate your body fat percentage.
For men, the formula begins with a different weight calculation:
(Total bodyweight x 1.082) + 94.42
The tool uses a fraction of the weight measurement to estimate body fat percentage.
A body fat calculator is not the most accurate measurement of body fat percentage. However, it's the most accessible system to use. Therefore, you may be able to use it more often.
Measuring at the same time each day and using the same tools (tape measure and online calculator) allows you to track trends in your progress, which can be far more valuable in assessing your fitness gains than a standalone body fat percentage measurement.
Skin Caliper Measurements
Several body fat calculators use skinfold measurements instead of body circumference measurements to estimate your body fat percentage. Skinfold calipers can be purchased to use at home, or you can hire a professional who is skilled in using them in healthcare or gym settings. It's one of the more popular
devices to monitor body fat
.
Skin calipers pinch a portion of your body to estimate fat levels. The caliper method can be more accurate than a calculator for measuring body fat percentage, but the accuracy depends on the skill level of the person using them.
Bioelectrical Impedance (BIA)
Home scales
, gym-quality scales, and devices in your healthcare provider's office may use bioelectrical impedance to estimate body fat. Simply put, the device sends a harmless, completely pain-free electrical signal through your body to measure fat.
You get a quick and instantaneous body fat percentage result. While this method is convenient, certain factors such as hydration level can influence the accuracy of the result.
DeXA Scanning
Whole-body scanning is quickly becoming the gold standard for measuring body fat percentage. However, the main reason the test is so accurate is that it is generally performed in a medical setting by highly skilled technicians. The DeXA test is often costly and may not be available where you live.
Hydrostatic Weighing
This submersion method has long been recognized as the most accurate measurement of body fat percentage. However, it requires a person to be fully immersed in a tank of water while holding their breath.
For many, the endurance required for hydrostatic weighing can be a challenge. It can also be difficult to find a location that performs the test.
How to Reduce Body Fat
Because thinness has so much value in many cultures, many people want to lose weight at some point. However, reducing body fat should not be a goal for everyone. Speak with a healthcare professional before starting a
weight-loss program
. It's also important to know that these numbers don't apply to pregnant women—you should not try to lose weight during pregnancy.
You'll also want to talk to a healthcare provider if you are trying to lose weight while on medications or during cancer treatment to ensure that it is safe. If your doctor determines that reducing your body fat percentage is a safe and beneficial health goal, here are some areas for you to consider making changes.
Your Diet
How much you eat and what you eat are significant factors in losing or gaining body fat. You might be tempted to try a popular diet, but
fad diets
generally don't work. What does work is making small lifestyle changes, such as:
Reducing your portion sizes.
Eating smaller meals more frequently throughout the day and avoiding the urge to skip breakfast.
Ensuring your diet contains lots of fruits and vegetables to fill you up and give you the necessary nutrients.
Adding more fiber to your diet to keep you full.
Avoid sugary drinks and junk food.
Limit how much alcohol you drink.
Your Cardiovascular Fitness Program
Cardiovascular exercise is an important part of any fat loss program, but you want to ensure it's the right cardio. Make sure you include
high-intensity interval training
in your program up to two to three times per week. In addition to cardio, you should also incorporate
moderate
and
easy workouts
.
Your Strength Training Program
People often focus on cardio to lose weight, but adding more muscle will help you burn more fat. Muscle is more metabolically active than fat, so the more you have, the more calories you burn all day.
Strength training
a couple of times a week is all you need to add lean muscle tissue and burn more fat.
Lifestyle Factors
Watching your stress levels and getting enough sleep are the keys to keeping your weight in check since stress hormones can contribute to weight gain. Taking care of yourself will make it easier to maintain the energy needed to complete key workouts and help you stay motivated to shop for and prepare nutritious foods.
A Word From Verywell
There are other methods of measuring body fat not listed here. Whichever way you choose, remember that if you plan to measure your body fat regularly, you need to use the same method each time to get the most accurate data.
If you want to change your body fat composition, a balance of nutritious eating and being sure to avoid fad diets, coupled with exercise, is the best bet. Consult a healthcare provider to assess your health risks and make a plan for staying healthy.

Calculator for Calories Burned
Other Options
Accuracy of Calorie Burn Calculators
The number of calories you burn during exercise will depend on age, gender, weight, and current activity level. A simple calorie burn calculator is useful when understanding how your activity level affects the number of calories you burn during exercise.
Calories Burned By Activity Calculator
Use this simple calorie burn calculator by choosing your activity, enter how long you performed the exercise, and add your weight. Though you're burning calories normally throughout your day, exercise can help boost your metabolism. The amount of calories depends on the type of exercise and duration.
It is important to note that calculators have an activity
MET (metabolic equivalent for task)
built-in. This number estimates how much energy the body uses during a specific activity. It varies based on activity and is standardized so that it can be used by anyone for a variety of activities.
For example, low-impact aerobic dancing (5 METs) burns fewer calories per minute compared with high-impact aerobic dancing (7 METs).
Slow-paced walking (3 METs) burns fewer calories than speed walking. If you do not have a calorie burn calculator, you can use the formula to determine how many calories your activities burn.
Calories Burned Formula
Total calories burned = Duration (in minutes)*(MET*3.5*weight in kg)/200
﻿
﻿
Other Options to Calculate Calories Burned
Other options for calculating calories burned include using a wearable activity tracker
or data from machines at the gym. In addition, you can calculate your
total energy expenditure (TEE)
by knowing your basal metabolic rate (BMR), the
thermic effect of food
(TEF) you eat, and your general activity level.
We've tried, tested, and reviewed the
best fitness trackers
. If you're in the market for an activity tracker, explore which option may be best for you.
Accuracy of Calorie Burn Calculators
Keep in mind that a calorie burn calculator provides an estimate and will not be exact. The only way to get a truly accurate number is at a lab with machines that measure everything from your
VO2 max
(maximum oxygen uptake) to your maximum heart rate.
Wearing a heart rate monitor consistently will allow you to note long-term trends.
Use your estimate of calories burned as a base point to track your workouts.
While numbers from calorie burn calculators and activity trackers are not 100% accurate, you will see which activities tend to
burn more calories
. You can tweak your workouts to ensure you are meeting your fitness goals.
Other Calorie Burn Factors to Consider
A calorie burn calculator doesn't take into account all factors that influence exercise intensity such as:
Age
: The older you are the more challenging it becomes to hit high-intensity activity levels.
Body Composition
: A person with
more muscle burns more calories
at rest than a person with high body fat.
Temperature
: The warmer the environment you're working out in, the more calories you will burn.
Heat raises your core body temperature so you do not have to warm up as much, and more energy can be directed toward calorie burn. You can also exercise longer but be cautious not to overdo it to the point of heat exhaustion.
Fitness Level
: An experienced exerciser will burn fewer calories because their body has become more efficient at exercise.
Diet
:
Your metabolism is the rate at which your body burns calories, and is directly affected by diet. Your metabolism will dip and negatively affect calorie burn without proper food as fuel.​
Sleep
:
Not getting adequate sleep can cause you to burn fewer calories. Not only will you feel more fatigued and possibly exercise less, but a lack of sleep can also reduce your metabolism.
Oxygen Intake
: Oxygen gives your body the energy to keep going. People who breathe heavily during their workout tend to burn more calories. It indicates that you're working harder and for every liter of oxygen you take in, you're burning 5 calories.
A Word From Verywell
When first understanding how to calculate calories burned during exercise, there's no need to overwhelm yourself with numbers. Try to focus on the goals of staying active.
If you add something new, run it through the formula to determine whether it will allow you to meet your health and fitness goals.

Daily Calorie Burn
Track Energy Expenditure
Strategies for Weight Loss
Your body is always burning calories. Up to 75% of your daily calorie burn is just for basic body functions like breathing, circulating blood and building cells. This means that even if you are just sitting around all day, you'll still burn at least 1,300 calories—and likely more. As you move your body through daily activities and exercise, you can add hundreds more calories to your total energy expenditure.
If you are curious how many calories you are burning in a day, you can
calculate your energy balance
to get a general estimate. Once you know your number, you can get a general estimate of how much to eat and exercise each day to maintain your weight. If your goal is to lose weight, you may need to reach a
reach a negative energy balance
; and if your goal is to gain weight you will need a surplus. To do that, though, you need to know how many calories you burn.

Daily Calorie Burn
When researchers evaluate the total number of calories you burn, they refer to the number as your total energy expenditure (TEE) or total daily energy expenditure (TDEE).
TEE (or TDEE) is a combination of these different factors: These include resting metabolic rate (RMR), non-exercise activity thermogenesis (NEAT), thermic effect of food (TEF), and calories burned during exercise.
Mira Norian / Verywell
Here is a closer look at each of the factors used to measure your daily calorie burn.
Resting Metabolic Rate (RMR
): Your
RMR
is the amount of energy your body needs to maintain basic functions like breathing, circulating blood and building cells. Things like age, body size and gender affect your resting metabolic rate.
Your RMR accounts for 60% to 75% of the total number of calories you burn each day.
Non-Exercise Activity Thermogenesis (NEAT)
: This is the amount of energy that your body uses to do daily activities like washing dishes, typing on your computer, or walking around your office. The number of calories you burn from
NEAT
varies greatly based on your activity level.
Thermic Effect of Food (TEF)
: Your body burns calories to chew, digest, and store food. Each type of food (macronutrient) has a different TEF.
Eating protein
burns the most calories by a small margin.
TEF
accounts for about 10% of the total number of calories you burn each day.
Calories Burned During Exercise
: The actual number of calories you burn during your workouts will depend on the
intensity
and
duration
of each session. Calories burned through exercise and non-exercise physical activity account for roughly 15% to 30% of your TEE.
How to Track Total Energy Expenditure
There are three common methods to estimate the number of calories burned each day. There are pros and cons to using each method. You can use more than one method and compare results to get the best estimate.
Metabolic Testing
The equipment required to perform
metabolic testing
is fairly expensive and used to be available only in hospital or lab settings. However, many health clubs now offer metabolic testing at affordable prices.
For some people, the test results help them schedule workouts and diet plans more effectively. But some critics feel the tests are not very accurate and therefore not worth the cost.
If you choose metabolic testing in a health club, make sure your trainer or technician is qualified to perform the test.
When you get re-tested to measure progress, it is usually smart to have the same technician re-do the tests and to use the same equipment. And since your body weight can vary by several pounds from morning to evening, it's also best to do your re-test at the same of day as the previous test(s).
Activity Monitors
Devices by brands like Polar, Garmin, and FitBit and are widely available online and in sporting goods stores. The gadgets monitor your daily movements to determine an estimated number of calories burned each day.
Some independent tests have shown that the devices are not completely accurate at providing an accurate number of calories burned.
But the devices are easy to use and can provide a very general estimate of variations in your day to day calorie expenditure.​
We've tried, tested, and reviewed
the best pedometers
. If you're in the market for an activity tracker, explore which option may be best for you.
Online Calculators
Calculators and
calorie-counting apps
can estimate your daily energy expenditure. Of course, the number is simply a guideline, but it's a good place to start if you want to maintain your weight. If you want to gain or lose weight, use a
weight loss calorie goal calculator
to calculate your daily caloric needs by adjusting your daily calorie count goal down (or up).
Strategies for Weight Loss
It's important to make shifts gradually if your goal is weight loss. For example, if you cut calories drastically to lose weight quickly, your body can fight back by increasing hunger and sparing energy to encourage you to put the weight back on over time.
A more sustainable approach may be to focus on the quality of your diet and your activity levels along with slight reductions in calories and increases in activity levels in order to consume less than you burn each day.
Of course, there are some components of your TEE that are hard to change.
Increasing your resting metabolic rate, for example, is fairly difficult. And increasing the number of calories you burn when you eat food isn't an effective way to reach your negative energy balance, either. But you can change your daily physical habits.
The most effective way to increase your TEE is with exercise and NEAT. Learn how to plan consistent workouts that are vigorous enough to
burn fat
but also allow your body
enough time to recover
, rebuild, and stay healthy.
Between workouts, stay active. If you are able, take the stairs instead of the elevator, walk to the store instead of taking the car and stay active at home to burn calories. You'll boost your calorie-burning potential and you may be able to
increase lean muscle mass
on your body, which can boost your resting metabolic rate.
A Word From Verywell
Remember that all calorie counts are estimates. Even the calorie counts on food packages are estimates. So, if you're trying to lose weight, expect that you will need to take some time for trial and error before you find the numbers that are right for you.
Use several different methods to find out how many calories you burn each day. Then experiment with food intake to find the right balance to meet your goals.

How to Improve Your Walking Pace
Frequently Asked Questions
A running speed calculator is a tool that can provide helpful information to runners of any level. It can help determine your pace per mile for a given distance using known variables: distance or time. Use our pace calculator to learn your running pace.
Why Use a Running Speed Calculator?
A pace calculator can help you determine how long
walking or running
a certain distance will take. Tracking your speed and how it changes over time can help you gauge your performance and see if your fitness efforts are paying off.
You may need to know your pace when registering for an event or race such as a
5K
,
10K
,
half marathon
, or
marathon
. You can use our running speed calculator or do the math yourself.
Running Pace Calculator
Your pace is expressed in
minutes per mile or minutes per kilometer
. This is the time it would take you to walk or run 1 mile or 1 kilometer. Race organizers use your pace to assign you to a
start corral
with others racing at a similar pace. Note that many running races have a time limit equal to a 16-minute mile pace.
To calculate your running pace, you will need to know the distance you have walked or run, and the time it took you to do so.
Pace = Time / Distance
Your running pace may not be a round number of minutes, so you will need to convert fractions of a minute to seconds. Multiply the fraction of a minute by 60. For example, 0.5 minutes = 30 seconds.
Running Speed Calculator
Speed is the flip side of pace. It is the calculation of distance over time, expressed in miles per hour or kilometers per hour. To calculate your running speed, you will need to know the distance you walked or ran and the time it took you to do so.
Speed = Distance / Time
Or, if you have your pace, you can convert it to speed. Simply divide 60 by your pace.
Speed = 60 / Pace
When you aren't using whole hours in the calculation, convert the number to minutes, then multiply the result by 60 minutes per hour to get miles per hour or kilometers per hour. Below are some sample running speed calculations:
Running 6 miles in 1 hour: 6 / 1 = 6 miles per hour (mph)
Walking 6 miles in 2 hours: 6 / 2 = 3 mph
Running a half marathon (13.1 miles) in 1.5 hours (90 minutes): 13.1 / 90 = .1455 x 60 = 8.73 mph
Run Pace for Common Distances
This running pace chart for standard distances displays how long it would take to finish a given distance race depending on your pace, measured in pace (minutes per mile) and speed (miles per hour).
For instance, running a 10-minute mile pace through an entire 5-kilometer race would take 31 minutes to complete. At the same pace, you could complete a marathon in 4 hours and 22 minutes (close to the global average time to complete a marathon).

Use Pace to Determine Exercise Intensity
You can use running speed or pace to gauge the intensity of your exercise. For example, walking intensity levels may look like this:
Light intensity
: Speed less than 3 mph; pace greater than 20 minutes per mile
Moderate intensity
:
Speed between 3 and 4 mph; pace between 16 and 20 minutes per mile
Medium intensity
: Speed 4 to 5 mph; pace between 12 and 15 minutes per mile
Vigorous intensity
: Speed over 5 mph; pace more than 12 minutes per mile
The
rate of perceived exertion (RPE)
scale is a more individualized measure of intensity.
RPE uses a scale from 0 to 10, with lower numbers being less intense and higher numbers being quite intense.
For example, an RPE of 0 is akin to sitting in a chair, 1 is very light exercise, 2 is light, 3 is moderate, 4 is somewhat heavy, 5 is heavy, 7 is very heavy, and 10 is very, very heavy. A 10 is how you feel at the end of a stress test or very vigorous activity.
When rating your exertion level, include feelings of shortness of breath and how tired you feel in your legs and overall. Most people aim to exercise at level 3 or 4.
Use Pace With Apps and Fitness Wearables
A pace calculator can be a good check on what your GPS app or GPS speedometer is showing as your running speed or pace. These can be inaccurate, and you don't want to think you are faster than you are.
A common factor contributing to inaccuracy is being in an area with buildings, trees, or hills that block the satellite signal used to measure your position. It's a good idea to check the accuracy of your device by measuring your running or
walking speed
over a known distance using a timer.
We've tried, tested, and reviewed the
best fitness trackers
. If you're in the market for an activity tracker, explore which option may be best for you.
Distance Calculator
If you know your pace or speed and how much time you will be walking or running, you can calculate how far you should go. This can be useful if you have a set amount of time for a workout and want to see how far you could go. Sometimes you will need to convert distances, which is helpful to know that a kilometer is 0.62 miles and a mile is 1.61 kilometers.
Distance = Time / Pace
Distance = Speed x Time
Finish Time Calculator
Knowing how long it will take you to finish is essential before registering for a race. Walkers and slow runners must be sure to complete under the course time cutoff. You may also want to compare your finish time with lists of winners to see if you might qualify for a trophy for your age group.
To calculate your finish time, you will need to know your pace in minutes per mile or minutes per kilometer (or your speed in miles per hour or kilometers per hour) and the distance of the course.
Finish Time = Distance x Pace
Finish Time = Distance / Speed
Check your running speed and pace in more than one way, as a GPS-based speed may be inaccurate. Doing a timed mile or a timed kilometer can be a better way to find an accurate pace. Otherwise, your finish time will also be incorrect.
Predict Finish Time for Longer Races
While you may be able to time yourself over a mile or kilometer and use that to predict your
time for a 5K
or 10K race, you probably won't be able to maintain the same speed over a half marathon or marathon. Ways to
predict your finish time
vary.
Some runners add 20 seconds per mile each time you double your distance. For example, if you've run a half marathon (13.1 miles), find your average minutes per mile, add 20 seconds, and multiply by 26.2 miles. Marathon coach Hal Higdon suggests multiplying your 10-kilometer finish time by 5 to find your marathon finish time.
How to Improve Your Walking Pace
If you aren't happy with the results of the pace calculator, you can make improving your pace a goal. To
increase your walking speed
, take a look at your technique. Working on perfecting your form with posture adjustments and stepping techniques will help. Making adjustments may help you boost your pace.
Tips for Improving Walking Pace
Improve your
posture
: Proper walking posture will improve breathing, making it easier to
walk faster
and farther.
Bend your arms
: Adding proper arm motion during walks can significantly speed up your
brisk walking
pace.
Use proper stepping technique
: Step from heel to toe with a strong push-off, or
race-walking
technique using straighter legs can help increase your pace.
Try a
run/walk technique
: If you cannot run the entire distance or want to increase your pace while covering more distance, try running interspersed with walking.
Improve Your Running Pace
If you are a runner, you can
learn to run faster
, too. You'll want to work on specific techniques and training strategies,
Tips to Improve Your Running Pace
Work on your
stride turnover
: Increase how many steps per minute you take to improve your running pace. Use short, quick steps to increase your stride turnover and run more efficiently.
Add
interval training
: Improve your cardiovascular health and capacity by including interval training in your routine.
Plan weekly
tempo runs
: Running at a sustained, steady effort pace can help improve your running pace by helping you develop your
anaerobic or lactate threshold
(LT), a critical aspect of running faster.
Start
hill training
: Hill repeats are excellent for building strength, speed, increasing mental strength, and confidence in tackling hills.
Rest and recover
: Rest and recovery can help improve subsequent performance since your body has had time to repair.
A Word From Verywell
You can increase your walking or running speed with proper technique and training. A pace calculator can provide you with reasonable estimates of your overall performance. Remember that these are just best guesses, and you may not perform at the same pace over all distances or at different training sessions or races. Other factors will influence your pace on a given day.
Frequently Asked Questions
What is a good running pace?
A good running pace depends on the distance you are covering, among other factors. Longer distances require you to pace yourself more slowly to conserve energy over the long term. A review of over 10,000 5k runners found that the average person ran a mile in 11:47.

How to Run Faster and Improve Race Times
How is running pace different from running speed?
Running pace is the average time in minutes it takes you to run a mile. Your minute per mile pace will change depending on how long or how far you run. Pacing yourself means controlling your minute per mile pace according to how long you will run as a way to conserve energy. Running speed is measured in miles per hour and is how fast you are running. They are much the same but use different units and are expressed differently.

Improving Pace and Speed
How do you pace yourself when running?
You can pace yourself when running by sticking to a pre-determined speed during your run or for certain parts of your run. For instance, you may wish to start out a bit slower and then pick up your speed as you go. You can use a variety of methods for determining your ideal pace during a certain distance.

What Does BMI Measure?
How It's Measured
Health Risks of High BMI
Health Risks of Low BMI
Benefits of a Normal BMI
Bias and Limitations
Other Measurement Methods
Body Mass Index (BMI) is a dated, biased measure that doesn’t account for several factors, such as body composition, ethnicity, race, gender, and age.
Despite being a
flawed measure
, BMI is widely used today in the medical community because it is an inexpensive and quick method for analyzing potential health status and outcomes.
Body mass index (BMI) is a calculation that is sometimes used in healthcare settings as an indirect method to determine a person's body weight category. This BMI calculator can help you learn what this measurement means and how it relates to your health and fitness.
What Does BMI Measure?
BMI is a measurement that takes into account your height, and weight to produce a calculation. This calculation is a measurement of your body size and can be used to determine how your body weight is related to your height. It is a method of determining whether you may be underweight, average weight, overweight, or obese, but it has flaws.
BMI is not a diagnostic tool nor is it a measurement of body fat percentage. A high BMI may or may not be an indicator of high body fat, but it doesn't necessarily mean that a person is overweight or obese and it alone is not a direct indicator of health.
In some populations, BMI has been found to be a fairly reliable indicator of body fat measures. But the calculation is less effective in other groups, such as bodybuilders and older adults. There are other methods that are more accurate in estimating body fat.
How BMI Is Measured
Your BMI is calculated using your height and weight. It can be a starting point for understanding the way your body fat may impact your overall health. You can use the number along with other health measurements to begin a conversation with your healthcare provider about ways to reduce your risk for disease and improve your overall wellness.
Imperial
Formula
: weight (lb) / [height (in)]
2
x 703
Example
: weight = 150 lbs, height = 5’5” (65")
BMI calculation
: [150 / (65)
2
] x 703 = 24.96
Metric
Formula
: weight (kg) / [height (m)]2
Example
: weight = 68 kg, height = 165 cm (1.65 m)
BMI calculation
: 68 / (1.65)2 = 24.98
Note that BMI is interpreted
differently in children
. Growth charts and percentiles are used. If children are at or above the 95th percentile of children their age, they are considered obese.
For adults, BMI results are interpreted as follows.
BMI Measurement
Weight Category
Below 18.5
Underweight
18.5 – 24.9
Normal weight
25.0 – 29.9
Overweight
30.0 and above
Obese
Health Risks Related to High BMI
The reason BMI is used for screening the health of the general population is due to the correlation between being overweight or obese and having certain health problems. People who are overweight or obese have an increased risk for:
Coronary heart disease
Hypertension
Osteoarthritis
Sleep apnea and respiratory problems
Some cancers
Stroke
Type 2 diabetes
Health Risks Related to Low BMI
While a high BMI may be an indicator for increased health risk, low BMI can also be indicative of health issues. People who are
underweight
according to the BMI scale can be predisposed to:
Cardiovascular disease
Depression
Difficulty conceiving (in women)
Dry skin
Hair loss
Irregular menstruation (in women)
Nutrient deficiencies
Osteoporosis
Poor immune system
Benefits of a Normal BMI
Maintaining a normal BMI (18.5 to 24.9) comes with many benefits, including limiting your risk to all of the above-listed health concerns. Not only are you less likely to have high blood pressure, heart disease, or diabetes, but maintaining a normal BMI can also help with better sleep, improved circulation, and even better energy throughout the day.
Bias and Limitations
The original index was developed to create statistics about population samples using European men as a baseline. It has since been used to assess people of all ages and races, perpetuating the creators' bias that the male, European body was the ideal body and measure of a person's fit-ness.
There are several known limitations of body mass index. First, the calculation does not take age or gender into account. Men tend to carry more muscle than women and this is not factored into the equation. BMI does not distinguish between muscle mass and fat mass in its calculation. Also ethnic and race variations are not considered.
While BMI can be a tool doctors use to understand your health status better, it is not a solitary diagnostic tool. When measuring your body fat composition, physicians also take into account your diet, lifestyle, level of physical activity, family history and genetics, as well as other health screenings.
Fitness, especially, is very important. Researchers have found that being fit negates the adverse effects of excess body fat, as well as other traditional cardiovascular risk factors, including obesity, metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and hypertension.
Body Composition, Body Fat, and BMI
Athletes who have higher levels of muscle mass need to be leery of the BMI calculation. Because the BMI number cannot distinguish the different components that make up total body weight, an athlete is better served by using a direct measurement of body composition and body fat.
The BMI calculation is used to screen the general population for health risks related to having too much body fat. This tool does not work well for most athletes who are curious about their body composition.
Body Fat Measurement Methods
BMI does not measure body fat. If you're interested in knowing your percentage of lean mass versus fat mass there are several methods of assessing a body's percentage of fat. These methods are referred to as
body composition analysis
. Some of the most common measurements include:
Bioelectrical impedance
: This common method of assessing body fat percentage determines total body weight, the percent and amount of body fat, muscle mass, water, and even bone mass. While readings can be affected by hydration level and other factors, they provide fairly accurate results over time. Some
smart scales
employ this method of measurement.
Dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA)
: This is an x-ray scan that measures a person's bones (specifically their mineral density and bone loss) to calculate the possibility of developing osteoporosis. However, these DEXA machines have limitations and the technology that is widely used is unable to measure the bones in people who weigh 300 pounds or more or who are taller than 6 feet.
Skinfold thickness measurements
: Many experts use this simple method to determine body composition. Skinfold calipers are a common
device used to monitor body fat
.
Underwater weighing
: This procedure, also known as hydrodensitometry or hydrostatic weighing, is complex and complicated, so it is rarely used.
A Word From Verywell
While body mass index can be a useful tool for some people, it is just one number that should always be considered within the context of other data. Talk to your healthcare provider about the best way to understand your BMI as part of a comprehensive plan for good health and longevity.

Storage and Food Safety
How to Prepare
Known for adding flavor, freshness, and acidity to drinks and foods, lemons are the most commonly used citrus fruits. Lemons are also used for garnish and flavoring desserts. They can be juiced, cut into wedges, or grated to make lemon zest.
This versatile fruit is an excellent source of vitamin C. Lemons are naturally low in calories and carbohydrates and are available all year long. They are a perfect fruit to keep on hand for salad dressings, seafood recipes, flavoring water, and more.
Lemon Nutrition Facts
One lemon (without rind) measuring approximately 2 1/8" in diameter (58g) provides 17 calories, 0.6g of protein, 5.4g of carbohydrates, and 0.2g of fat. Lemons are an excellent source of vitamin C. The following nutrition information is provided by the USDA.
Calories:

Fat:

Sodium:

Carbohydrates:

Fiber:
1.6g
Sugars:
1.5g
Protein:
0.6g
Vitamin C
: 30.7mg
Potassium
: 80mg
Carbs
One whole lemon contains 17 calories and just over 5 grams of carbohydrate. The carbs are primarily fiber (1.6 grams) and sugar (1.5 grams). Note that the juice of a whole lemon provides only 0.14 grams of fiber, according to USDA data, but almost the same amount of sugar (1.2 grams).
The glycemic load of a whole lemon is estimated to be 1, making it a low-glycemic food.
Fats
There is a very small amount of fat in lemons, under 1 gram if you consume the whole fruit.
Protein
Lemons are not a good source of protein, providing less than 1 gram per fruit.
Vitamins and Minerals
Lemons are an excellent source of vitamin C, providing over half (30.7mg) of your daily recommended intake. There are also minimal amounts of thiamin, vitamin B6, and folate in lemon.
Lemons are not a good source of minerals, but they do contain small amounts of calcium, iron, and potassium.
Summary
Lemons are an excellent source of vitamin C, and are low calorie and relatively high in fiber. They provide minimal amounts of other vitamins and minerals such as thiamin, vitamin B6, calcium, and potassium.
Health Benefits
The health benefits of lemons are attributed primarily to the high level of vitamin C that the fruit provides.
Prevents Vitamin C Deficiency
Lemons have been used throughout history to manage vitamin C deficiency. In the late 1700s, the British Navy discovered that scurvy, a disease caused by vitamin C deficiency, could be cured by eating lemons and oranges. Today, scurvy is a rare disease in developed countries, given that it can be prevented with as little as 10mg of vitamin C (and you'll get more than 30mg in a single lemon).
Healthy Foods That Are High In Lutein
Improves Heart Health
Studies indicate that a higher vitamin C intake is associated with a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD), including coronary heart disease and stroke. The benefit is likely due to the antioxidant content of lemon, which helps to prevent oxidative damage that can lead to cardiovascular disease.
But authors of one large review were careful to put their findings into perspective. They concluded that while research suggests that vitamin C deficiency is associated with a higher risk of death from cardiovascular disease, and that vitamin C may slightly improve endothelial function and lipid profiles in some groups, studies do not provide enough support for the widespread use of vitamin C supplementation to reduce cardiovascular risk or mortality.
Slows Age-Related Decline
Vitamin C is a powerful antioxidant.
Antioxidants
help to prevent cell damage caused by oxidative stress. There is ongoing research about the possible impact that antioxidants can have on the aging process. There is some evidence that they may help improve skin health or even help prevent certain types of diseases associated with aging. So far, however, study results have been mixed.
Improves Eye Health
Researchers are investigating whether a higher intake of vitamin C can help treat or prevent age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and cataracts—common causes of vision decline in older adults. So far, study results have been inconsistent, but research is ongoing.
Supports Immune Function
Vitamin C has been shown to play an important role in
immune function
. And while some people take vitamin C supplements or use lemons to prevent or manage the treatment of the common cold, studies regarding its effectiveness have yielded mixed results.
A few large studies have shown that taking a vitamin C supplement of about 250 mg per day may help certain specific populations reduce the duration of the common colds. But other studies have shown no benefit in the general population.
Also, it is important to note that studies investigating the relationship between the common cold and vitamin C examine supplements, not lemons.
May Help Prevent Some Cancers
Antioxidants, such as those in lemons, are being investigated for their potential impact on cancer.
According to the National Cancer Institute, increased levels of antioxidants may prevent the types of
free radical damage
associated with cancer development. Free radicals are chemicals that can cause cellular damage in the body. Exposure to certain environmental toxins (like cigarette smoke) may increase the free radicals in your body and even cause the body to make more free radicals.
But researchers still don't know if antioxidants have the power to combat or prevent cancer. More research needs to be done investigating the impact of antioxidants from food versus antioxidant supplements. For now, there is not enough evidence to know for sure if there is any benefit.
Allergies
People with an allergy to citrus fruits should avoid lemon or products made with lemon or lemon zest. Citrus allergy is not common but can be problematic in some people.
There are also reports of asthma as a reaction to the inhalation of lemon or orange peel.
If you suspect an allergy to lemon, seek care from a qualified allergy specialist.
Adverse Effects
The acid in lemon juice can strip the enamel on teeth, making them weak and sensitive. If you tend to drink water with lemon often, using a straw can reduce the exposure of acid to your teeth.
According to the Natural Medicines Database, it is not known if there are drug interactions with lemon.
However, one study indicated that there may be a positive impact on certain nuclear imaging tests when men ingest lemon juice prior to testing.
Varieties
There are many different types of lemons. Most are bright yellow, but some have a green hue. Interestingly, one of the most common varieties—the Meyer lemon—is not a true lemon, but a cross between a lemon and a mandarin or orange.
The lemons you buy at the grocery store are likely to be Lisbon, Bearss, or Eureka. These common varieties are grown in California, Florida, and Arizona.
When It’s Best
You can find most lemons in the grocery all year round. Many growers harvest their fruit year-round, but the peak harvest season is late winter to early spring or summer.
When picking lemons, look for fruit that has thin skin, as this is an indicator of juiciness. Lemons should feel heavy for their size, appear bright, vibrant yellow, and have a smooth, blemish-free surface. Avoid lemons that are soft and spongy or have wrinkled skin.
Storage and Food Safety
Many people store lemons on the countertop to take advantage of their bright, beautiful color. But if you keep lemons out at room temperature, they are likely to last only for about a week.
To help them last longer, store lemons in the refrigerator. Some people place them in a bowl of water, but you can also place them in a plastic bag for optimal shelf life.
You can also freeze Lemons. Freeze whole lemons, lemon wedges, or lemon juice in freezer bags with as much air removed as possible.
Lemons can also help your other foods last longer.
Certain produce, such as apples, turn brown when they begin to oxidize. The process is called enzymatic browning and occurs when certain enzymes and chemicals, known as phenolic compounds, combine and react to oxygen. The brown pigment, melanin, is completely harmless but not very appealing.
Other foods, such as
pears
,
bananas
,
avocado
,
eggplants
, and
potatoes
, also undergo enzymatic browning. The acidic nature of lemon juice prevents browning by denaturing the enzymes. To make these foods last longer, rub lemon or lemon juice on any exposed part of the fruit.
How to Prepare
You can eat a whole lemon, but you probably won't want to. Their intense sour flavor makes them difficult to eat on their own. Instead, use lemons to add color and flavor to all different types of cuisines and recipes.
Make your own
salad dressing
, using lemon juice as a nutritious way to reduce your sodium and calorie intake. Spice up your vegetables or fish with a lemony sauce. Cut up lemon wedges or slices to flavor your water or seltzer, use lemon juice in fruit salads to prevent browning, or as an ingredient in marinades to tenderize meat. Lemons and lemon juice can also be important ingredients in
healthier dessert
options.
You can use the peel of a lemon for lemon zest (the yellow, outer skin). To zest a lemon, use a peeler or a grater, taking care not to cut the bitter inner white skin, called the pith.

Our Editorial Process
There’s no one-size-fits-all model for healthy living. Let us help you find a way to eat well and stay active that works best for you, wherever you are on your journey.
The small, everyday choices you make about your diet, fitness, and overall well-being have the power to transform your life. But that doesn’t mean they’re always easy to sustain. We understand you’re an individual with specific goals and we’re here to support you with trusted information and tools to help you feel your best.
Online searches for nutrition or exercise topics can be overwhelming and result in a black hole of bogus fads and false claims. You need easy-to-understand and credible advice that cuts through the clutter—advice that’s written by experts who know what they’re talking about and who genuinely care. Every year, we help 120 million people who come to Verywell Fit seeking answers to their health questions.
It’s our duty and responsibility to make sure you’re getting science-backed facts with clear, actionable steps suited to your needs. We work hard to break down complex health terms, reflect the latest research, and present the most accurate information in a way that motivates you to take an active role in your diet and fitness. We’re here to cheer you on, not scare you off.
Our mission is simple—empower you to reach your diet and fitness goals.
Subject-Matter Expert Writers
Our writers are notable voices in their respective disciplines, from registered dietitians to certified personal trainers to physicians. These leading experts are specifically selected for their extensive knowledge and real-world experience, as well as their ability to communicate complex information in a clear, helpful, and unbiased way.
At Verywell Fit, we aspire to provide the highest quality content produced by humans, for humans. It is against our guidelines to publish automatically generated content using AI (artificial intelligence) writing tools such as ChatGPT.
Diverse Voices
We have a renewed commitment to help all people navigate their health and well-being—regardless of race, gender identity, sexual orientation, age, religion, culture, geography, body type, ability, or experience. We are invested in working with BIPOC health writers, Review Board members, expert sources, illustrators, photographers, and more to create, edit, and enhance our content—not just on isolated topics of race, but across our brands’ coverage. Read
Verywell’s Diversity and Inclusion Pledge
to learn more about our promise of diversity, inclusion, and equity.
Editorial Team
Our highly-skilled editorial team manages all of the content you read. Each individual article has several people behind it working to make sure it’s responsible, accurate, understandable, helpful, trustworthy, comprehensive, up-to-date, and inclusive.
Review Board
The Verywell Fit
Review Board
, comprised of board-certified physicians, registered dietitians, personal trainers, and more, vet content containing statements of medical fact or health claims. They work tirelessly to provide the necessary critique that guarantees our information is accurate and current.
Content is assessed by a reviewer whose specific area of expertise aligns with the content topic. A reviewer will confirm that a piece of content—whether article, illustration, video, tool, or other resource—is thorough and contains facts and guidelines that reflect the latest in evidence-based research and health information.
If improvements are suggested, they are shared directly with our editorial team to be addressed and implemented immediately. It is only when a reviewer approves a piece of content that it is officially stamped as such in the byline of an article.
Fact Check
Our team of qualified and experienced fact checkers provides a critical step in our commitment to content integrity. Fact checkers rigorously review medical statements, claims, and recommendations for accuracy and timeliness. We rely only on the most current and reputable primary references, including peer-reviewed medical journals, government organizations, academic institutions, and advocacy associations. Sources are listed both inline and at the bottom of every article.
News
Now, more than ever, people are going online for their news. It is our responsibility to ensure that every piece of news published on Verywell Fit is held to the highest standards of clarity, accuracy, thoughtfulness, and trustworthy reporting.
We rely on primary sources, input from credentialed medical experts, and a team of conscientious news writers and thorough fact checkers to provide you with the latest and most important updates in the world of fitness and nutrition. From groundbreaking research to the latest guidelines, Verywell Fit goes beyond breaking news—we provide the context and insights needed to keep you and your family informed.
References, Sources, and Citations
We fact-check medical statements, claims, and suggestions with the most current primary references, including peer-reviewed medical journals, government organizations, academic institutions, and advocacy associations. Sources are listed both inline and at the bottom of every article.
(Verywell favors human research and proven treatments, though relevant animal research and experimental/alternative treatments may be reported if that’s all that’s available to promote an understanding of a topic.)
Up-to-Date Information
Times change and so does information. With help from our subject-matter experts and Review Board, our editorial team routinely evaluates our existing content every few months to ensure all information is updated and reflective of the most current research, guidelines, and statistics.
If needed, content is re-worked, re-edited, and re-certified by our Review Board. If you happen to come across any inconsistencies or outdated facts, please don’t hesitate to
reach out
.
The Verywell Voice
We pride ourselves on being part of the revolution that is redefining what “being fit” really means, and we make sure to infuse that into all of our content. The information, advice, and very words that we use are all rooted in one goal: to help you learn how to live a happier, healthier life that’s free of diet culture driven fads and weight phobic trends. And we do that by offering a space that cuts through all the complications, confusion, and unrealistic expectations that are perpetuated by today’s media.
It is vital to us that you feel supported along your health journey, and we take that responsibility very seriously. To learn more, read about

What are Our Third-Party Data Collection and Online Advertising Practices?
General
We, and our third-party partners, use information that we receive about you (e.g., that you provide to us or about your use of the Services, or that we receive from third parties) to serve advertisements more relevant to your interests, the content on which the ads will appear, or audiences similar to you, to optimize marketing and advertising campaigns more broadly, as well as to generate analytics and provide marketing/advertising-related services such as reporting, market research, and measurement/attribution. These third-party partners may include online advertising networks or exchanges, measurement/attribution companies, ad fraud verification companies, social media companies, or other advertising technology services (e.g., demand-side or sell-side platforms, ad servers, clean room providers).
How We Collect This Information
The information used for these advertising practices is typically collected through tracking technologies, such as cookies, web beacons/pixels, SDKs, APIs, embedded scripts, location-identifying technologies, logging technologies, and similar technologies, which recognize the device you are using and collect information, including clickstream information, browser type, time and date you visited the Sites, mobile ad ID or other digital identifier (e.g., iOS IDFA, Google AAID, cookie ID, click ID, other proprietary IDs such as open-source “universal IDs” or other ID solutions), geolocation, and other information, such as the advertising/advertising measurement data discussed further above in this Privacy Policy. These tools may also collect other information you provide to us or other information about how you use the Services, such as your mouse movements, scrolling, clicks, and keystroke activity on the Services and other browsing, search, or purchasing behavior. These tools may also record information you enter when you interact with our Services or engage in chat or other features through our Service.
We may share a common account identifier (such as a hashed or encrypted email address or user ID) or other information (such as phone number, which also is typically provided in hashed or encrypted format) with our third-party advertising partners to help identify you across devices. We may share this information using mechanisms such as API, direct file upload, server-to-server transfer, or integrating the tracking technologies of those partners (e.g., pixel).
How To Exercise Your Choices Regarding Online Ads
Please see the “
What Controls Do I Have Over My Information?
” section below to learn how you can opt out of interest-based advertising.
More On Social Media Platforms and Advertising
Our Services may include social media features, such as the Facebook “Like” button, Pinterest, Instagram, Twitter, or other widgets. These social media companies may recognize you and collect information about your visit to our Services, and they may set a cookie or employ other tracking technologies. Your interactions with those features are governed by the privacy policies of those companies.
We display targeted advertising to you through social media platforms, such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn, and other social media platforms.  For example, these companies have interest-based advertising programs that allow us to direct advertisements to users who have shown interest in our services while those users are on the social media platform, or to groups of other users who share similar traits, such as likely commercial interests and demographics.  As mentioned in the section above, we may share a unique identifier, such as a user ID or hashed or encrypted email address or phone number, with these platform providers or they may collect information from our website visitors through a pixel (or other mechanism, such as API, direct file upload, or server-to-server integration), in order to direct targeted advertising to you or to a custom audience (including “look-a-like” audiences, such as audiences that are similar to you or other users) on the social media platform.  These advertisements are governed by the privacy policies of those social media companies that provide them.  If you do not want to receive targeted ads on your social networks, you may be able to adjust your advertising preferences through your settings on those networks.

U.S. State Privacy Notice
For residents covered under the State Privacy Laws (and Nevada, in the case of the “Notice to Nevada Residents” section only), this U.S. State Privacy Notice supplements the information contained in our Privacy Policy by providing additional information under such laws. The term “
State Privacy Laws
” means, as applicable, the U.S. state privacy laws that govern the processing of consumers’ personal information generally (e.g., the California Consumer Privacy Act (the “
CCPA
”), Colorado Privacy Act, Connecticut Data Privacy Act, Utah Consumer Privacy Act, Virginia Consumer Data Protection Act).
Your Privacy Rights
Depending on your state of residency, you may exercise the following rights under the State Privacy Laws in relation to the personal information about you that we have collected about you (subject to certain limitations under such laws, such as exceptions in the State Privacy Laws or the inability to verify your identity):
The Right to Access
Under the State Privacy Laws, you have the right to obtain confirmation regarding whether we are processing your personal information and to access that personal information and, in some cases, information about the third parties who may receive such personal information. You also have the right to access that personal information in a portable, readily usable format, unless not technically feasible to provide in such a format.
Specifically with respect to the CCPA’s right to access, you have the right to request the following: (a) the specific pieces of personal information the business has collected about you and (b) the categories of personal information collected, the sources of collection, the business/commercial purpose for collecting or "selling/sharing" personal information, and the categories of third party to whom the business discloses personal information.
The Right to  Deletion
You have the right to request the deletion of PI we have collected from you, subject to certain exceptions under the State Privacy Laws.
The Right to Correction
You have the right to request that inaccuracies in your PI be corrected, taking into account the nature of the personal information and the purposes of the processing of your personal information.
Opt-Out Rights
Under State Privacy Laws, you have the right to opt-out of “sales” and “shares” of personal information, “targeted advertising,” and certain use/disclosure of “sensitive” personal information.
As further described in this Privacy Policy, we disclose the following to our advertising/marketing and analytics partners (e.g., advertisers/agencies, social media networks, adtech partners, customer intelligence firms) for advertising and marketing purposes, including direct marketing: Identifiers, commercial information, geolocation data, internet or other network information, and data that may be considered “sensitive” personal information under certain State Privacy Laws. Please see our “Your Privacy Choices” link (found in the website footer) to exercise your opt-out rights accordingly.
We do not have actual knowledge of “selling” or “sharing” PI of consumers under sixteen (16) years of age.
To Exercise Your Privacy Rights
To submit a request to exercise your right to access, deletion, or correction, please use
this form
. You may also email
privacy@dotdashmdp.com
for assistance on exercising rights requests (where State Privacy Laws require that we provide another means for such assistance).
To exercise your right to opt-out of "sales," "shares," ”targeted advertising,” or certain use/disclosure of “sensitive” personal information, please click our
Your Privacy Choices
link (found in the website footer) and follow the instructions therein. As discussed in such link, you may also visit our website with the Global Privacy Control (GPC) signal enabled to opt-out of “sales/shares” via Targeting Cookies (learn more about GPC at
www.globalprivacycontrol.org
). The Targeting Cookies opt-out is on a per-website basis and applies at the browser level for the device you use to opt out.
Unless otherwise prohibited by the State Privacy Laws, we may need to verify your identity and confirm your residency before processing your request.  In order to verify your identity, we will generally either require the successful authentication of your account or the matching of sufficient information you provide us to the information we maintain about you in our systems.  This process may require us to request additional personal information from you, including, but not limited to, your email address, phone number, or date of last transaction on our Services.
In certain circumstances, we may decline a request to exercise the rights described above, particularly where we are unable to verify your identity or locate your information in our systems.  If we cannot comply with a request, we will explain the reasons in our response.
Non-Discrimination and Appeals
You have the right to not receive “discriminatory” treatment for exercising the rights discussed in the table above.  However, please note that if the exercise of these rights limits our ability to process personal information (such as in the case of a deletion request), we may no longer be able to provide you our products and services or engage with you in the same manner.
Further, under certain State Privacy Laws, you may appeal our decision to not take action on your rights request. All appeals should be submitted by emailing
privacy@dotdashmdp.com
, along with a copy of the decision that you are appealing.
Authorized Agents
In certain circumstances under the State Privacy Laws, you are permitted to use an authorized agent to submit requests on your behalf (using the mechanisms for submitting requests above), to the extent we can verify the authorized agent’s authority to act on your behalf.
For requests to access, delete, or correct personal information, we may require the following for verification purposes:
(a) a power of attorney from you or your authorized agent that is valid under the laws of the applicable state where you reside; or
(b) sufficient evidence to show that you have:
provided the authorized agent signed permission to act on your behalf; and
verified your own identity directly with us or directly confirmed with us that you provided the authorized agent permission to submit the request on your behalf.
For requests to opt-out of “sales,” “shares,” or the processing of your personal information for “targeted advertising” under the State Privacy Laws, we may require a signed permission demonstrating your authorized agent has been authorized by you to act on your behalf.
Deidentified Information
Where we process “deidentified information” (as such term is defined under the State Privacy Laws) and are required to keep such information deidentified, we commit to maintain and use the information in deidentified form and will not attempt to reidentify the information, except in instances where necessary for determining whether the deidentification process we used satisfies the requirements under applicable law.

Cross training might sound intimidating, but in reality, it is simply a smart strategy for getting the most out of your fitness regimen. With the ability to minimize injury and maximize recovery, cross training offers a variety of different exercises as part of an overall program.
Whether you’re working with a personal trainer, taking advantage of different classes in your neighborhood, or simply training at home, everyone from beginners to advanced exercisers can reap the benefits of cross training. Here you will learn the proper techniques and the health benefits of cross-training.
Frequently Asked Questions
What are cross training programs for beginners?
Cross training doesn’t require a specific program. Getting started can be as simple as checking out a strength-training class one day, going for a brisk walk the next, and doing a
yoga class online
at home later in the week. As with any fitness program, consult with a healthcare provider to be sure you are cleared for new activity.

An Overview of Cross Training
What are the benefits of cross training?
Cross training is a great way to minimize boredom while pursuing your fitness goals. A solid cross training program incorporates elements of strength,
cardio
, endurance, and
flexibility
. Due to the variations from day to day, cross training allows you to exercise more frequently while allowing for active recovery.
Learn More:
The Benefits of Cross Training
What are the best cross training shoes?
Unfortunately, one size does not fit all when it comes to
selecting shoes
for your cross training regimen. For example, you might include both running and strength-training as part of a cross training program, and these would require different footwear.
Further, the type of strength training that you partake in can impact the shoe you choose. A flat, harder-soled shoe might work best for squats and deadlifts, but a quicker-moving conditioning-based workout might require a flexible sole. Additionally, some shoes—specifically running shoes—may need to be
replaced
more often than others.

What is the difference between cross training and CrossFit?
Cross-training refers to incorporating a variety of exercise programs as part of an overall fitness plan.
CrossFit
is its own program that includes elements of cardio, strength, and endurance.

Ab workouts help increase core or abdominal strength, which leads to better balance and stability. Many ab workouts can be done at home and with minimal or no equipment. Ab workouts are also a staple in Pilates classes.
When building your workout routine, make sure to include some ab workouts. Ab exercises can help you build a strong core, improve posture, and reduce back pain.
Frequently Asked Questions
How do you strengthen your abs?
Performing ab exercises engages key muscles in the abdomen and helps you to strengthen your core. Examples include crunches, bicycle twists, planks, and mountain climbers.

Learn More:
How to Engage Your Core
How often should you do ab workouts?
You should do ab workouts 2-3 times per week. Don’t overwork yourself by doing ab exercises daily.
Learn More:

Can you do ab workouts while pregnant?
To do ab workouts while pregnant, make sure to get your health care provider's approval. It’s usually safe to work out the abs during pregnancy, but you’ll likely have to make some modifications to each exercise to perform them safely and effectively.
Learn More:
The Best Exercises for Pregnancy
What's the difference between lower abs and upper abs?
It may seem like there is a difference between lower abs and upper abs, but there’s not. Your abdominal muscles are a group of muscles in the stomach area. There is usually less body fat in the upper region of the stomach, so the upper part of the abs may show through more easily. For this reason, some people feel the need to exercise their lower abs more often since they don’t show as easily.

What is the transverse abdominis?
The transverse abdominis, also known as the TVA, is a muscle located on the inside of the obliques. It’s the deepest part of the abdominal muscles and is the muscle you contract when you brace yourself for a punch. Its role is to protect the nearby organs and support the torso, spine, and pelvis.

Core
Core is another way of referring to the abdominal muscles. They’re sometimes called the core because the stomach is located in the center of the body. The word “core” also signifies the root or foundation of something, and these muscles make up the foundation of balance and stability.
How to Engage Your Core
Stability
Core strength helps improve stability, which is a degree of being stable. Having good stability helps you to balance and prevents you from falling over or stumbling.

Plank
Planks are classic ab workouts. You can perform a plank by getting on the floor on your toes and hands. Beginners may find it easier to modify planks by getting on your forearms and/or knees instead. Hold the position for at least 30 seconds to engage your core.
How to Do a Plank
Obliques
Obliques are abdominal muscles located on the sides of your stomach. Some ab exercises that target the obliques include bird dog, heel taps, side planks, and bicycle crunches.
Abdominal Muscles Location and Function
Crunch
Crunches are a go-to ab workout. They are a tried-and-true exercise that is easy to do and beginner-friendly. There are different variations of crunches, but they are always performed while lying on your back. To perform a basic crunch, bend your knees and place your hands behind your head. Use your abdominal muscles to lift your shoulders and head off the ground.
How to Do an Abdominal Crunch
V-sit
A v-sit is an ab workout that is performed on the ground. Start in a seated position and lift your extended legs to create a 45-degree angle with your torso. This also creates a V shape, hence the name. Like planks, hold the position to work the abs.

How do you do a plank?
The most important aspect of the plank pose for a beginner isn’t the frequency or duration but rather the form. For instance, as you get into the plank position, you want to ensure your elbows are directly under your shoulders and that your forearms are facing forward. Keep your head relaxed, look at the floor between your forearms, and
engage your core
.
In the beginning, you will hold this position for 10 to 20 seconds and gradually work up to longer durations. Beginners may find it easier to start with their knees on the floor and work up to extended legs as their strength increases.

Motivation: You know you need it to reach your fitness goals, but what exactly is it? Whether we’re talking exercise, work-related tasks, or managing a household, there are two main types of motivation at play: intrinsic and extrinsic. Intrinsic motivation refers to an internal stimulus, while extrinsic refers to an external one. Moreover, these two types of motivation may at times be intertwined.
Keeping up with exercise requires discipline and commitment, but it’s normal for motivation to come and go. Use the tips here to keep up with your routine and meet your fitness goals.
Frequently Asked Questions
How do you find the motivation to exercise?
Motivation to exercise can be both intrinsically and extrinsically driven.
An example of an intrinsic motivator would be the desire to feel more confident and comfortable completing day-to-day tasks. Carrying groceries, walking up the stairs without huffing and puffing, and playing more often with your kids are all examples of intrinsic motivators. You may also want to feel your best in your favorite clothes or out at the beach or by the pool. This appearance-driven motivation may be considered extrinsic.

What is Motivation?
What is a habit?
A habit is a regular tendency or practice. While research varies on the timeline of habit formation, over time, a habit becomes second nature.
Brushing your teeth or taking a walk every day after dinner are examples of habits.
Learn More:
How to Make Your Exercise Habit Stick
What causes a lack of motivation?
When intrinsic motivation is lacking, it may be more challenging to reach your goals. If you’re already on your journey and not seeing results, this also may be a deterrent.
Learn More:
Get Motivated to Exercise When You're Off Track
How do you make exercise a habit?
Planning and preparation can both help make exercise a habit.  This may be as simple as scheduling your workouts and honoring them in the same way you would an important meeting or doctor’s appointment.  Utilizing certain
cues
and focusing more on the habit than the reward when getting started may also be helpful.

Fitness Goals
When thinking about fitness goals, consider the SMART acronym:
s
pecific,
m
easurable,
a
ttainable,
r
ealistic/
r
elevant, and
t
imely. You’ll want to set a SMART goal that is focused on where you are today. For example, if you’re following a strength-training program, you might set a goal of being able to squat x amount of weight (say 70% of your 1RM) x number of reps in six weeks. Note that for some people, it may not be motivating to think about what they can do in 6 weeks, but rather, what they are going to do starting now and this week.
Setting SMART Goals
Fitness Journey
As the word “journey” implies, there is no destination as you embark on an active lifestyle! Your journey may even have stops and starts along the way, and that’s all part of the ride.  The key is to remain injury-free and enjoy the journey.

Reward
Rewards are incentives or benefits of completing a specific goal. Rewards can be material objects, such as a new pair of shoes, or health benefits, like increased strength. Increased physical fitness is one of the potential health-related rewards of your fitness journey. If you prefer material rewards, you might choose to treat yourself with a massage after completing a race, or a new mat carrier when you get into a groove of attending yoga classes.

Running, the action of moving yourself forward rapidly on foot, is a popular form of physical activity that requires little equipment. It's an excellent way to boost cardiovascular fitness anywhere and at any time.
All you need is a good pair of shoes, weather-appropriate gear, and a safe route.
Whether you're running for the first time or training for your next race, read this information about proper form, the best shoes, training strategies, and more.
Frequently Asked Questions
How do you run faster?
There are a few strategies that can help you pick up the pace in your runs. Incorporating
short sprints
will help, but interval training, tempo runs, and hills will also help you get faster. A treadmill may be an excellent tool for improving overall performance and increasing speed. The treadmill allows you to add hills and easily perform speed work. Of course, working on your form, weekly mileage, and allowing proper rest and recovery will also aid in increasing overall speed. Consider working with a running coach or
using a running app
to create a personalized training program to increase your speed.

To ensure comfort and prevent injury, first, get medical clearance to begin running. Second, invest in
properly-fitting running shoes
. Finally, decide
where and when you will run
. Do you have a safe area (trails, road, or a track) that will enable you to regularly run outside? Or will you utilize a treadmill? Deciding which option is most readily available can help plan a running program. When you’re ready to put one foot in front of the other, consider a walk/run strategy in the beginning: commit to a set period of time, and alternate walking and running. You can increase the running component progressively over time.

How many calories do you burn running a mile?
As a very general and simplistic rule, a runner will burn about 100 calories per mile.
Individual calorie expenditure is dependent on weight, pace, and other factors, so individuals who want a slightly more accurate estimate might use a tracking device, such as a running watch. Note that calorie counters on cardio equipment and
fitness trackers tend to overestimate calorie burn
.
Using a heart rate monitor with your tracking device may provide a more accurate estimate.

How Many Calories Do You Burn While Running?
What should you eat before a run?
A good rule of thumb is to choose a
combination
of foods that are high in carbohydrates and lower in fat, fiber, and protein. Carbohydrates are the body’s preferred source of fuel. There are a variety of options that can work, such as a bagel with peanut butter or a bowl of oatmeal with berries. You will want to consume your meal or snack within 90 minutes to an hour before a run. Foods to avoid before a run include spicy foods, high-fiber foods such as legumes, lactose-heavy foods, and greasy or fried foods.

Aerobic exercise
Literally translating to “with oxygen,” aerobic exercise strengthens your cardiovascular and respiratory systems.
Running is a form of aerobic exercise as it uses oxygen as its primary source of energy.
Everything You Need to Know About Cardio
Jogging
Jogging is movement at a steady, gentle pace that is slower than running.  Similar to running, jogging is considered a high-impact exercise, as opposed to walking, which is low-impact.
The Difference Between Running and Jogging
Sprinting
Sprints are runs carried out at top speed for a short distance. You don’t have to be an Olympic athlete to reap the
benefits
of sprinting. Sprints can be performed in short bursts on the treadmill or outdoors as part of an overall running protocol to improve cardiovascular health and increase aerobic capacity.
How to Do Sprints
Trail running
Trail running is outdoor running that can be performed in a variety of settings, depending on your geographical location. Different trails may require different types of running shoes. Wherever you run outdoors, consider safety, and reap the physical and mental benefits of fresh air.

Strength training is a form of exercise that helps build muscle. It uses weight from your body mass or equipment to build muscle mass and increase overall strength.
Over time, lean muscle mass naturally decreases with age. Strength training helps maintain and build muscle mass, which is important for overall health. It’s beneficial for strengthening muscles and bones, maintaining a healthy weight, and improving your ability to perform everyday activities.
Frequently Asked Questions
Do runners need strength training?
A runner’s main form of exercise is likely cardio and aerobic training, but runners can also benefit from strength training. Cardio is necessary for heart health and weight management, but it doesn’t increase muscle mass like strength training. Runners should incorporate some strength training into their routines for balance.

Is strength training better than cardio?
Both strength training and cardio have their advantages. One is not outright better than the other. Cardio helps build stamina and endurance, and strength training works to increase strength and muscle mass.

What should I eat before strength training?
A high-carbohydrate meal with a moderate amount of protein and low amount of fat can fuel your strength training session. Complex carbohydrates provide energy. Follow the strength training session with a high-protein snack or meal.

How You Should Eat for Weight Training
Do I need equipment for strength training?
Equipment is not required for strength training, but it comes in handy. Beginners can start with exercises that only require body weight, such as push-ups and pull-ups. You can gradually increase the weight by using dumbbells, weighted barbells, and
various kettlebells

Functional Strength Training
Isometric Exercises
Muscle Endurance
Resistance Training
Functional Strength Training
There are different types of strength training, and functional strength training is one of them. This is when you target multiple muscles per exercise rather than isolate just one. Lunging is an example of this, since it works muscles across the legs, hips, knees, and ankles all at once.
How to Improve Your Functional Strength
Isometric Exercises
Isometric exercises are also known as static strength training. This is when your muscles are engaged, but they are not changing length. In some exercises, such as bicep curls, the muscle gets shorter and longer during the contraction. In isometric exercises, such as planks and wall sits, the muscle contraction doesn’t involve a change in length. Many isometric exercises require you to hold the exercise rather than repeat a movement.
Isometric Training Is Crucial for Building Strength
Muscle Endurance
This refers to the amount of time or repetitions you can perform an exercise before the muscle gets tired. Toward the end of your workout, you may notice your muscles feeling fatigued. They may burn towards the end of your set. Over time, your muscle endurance will improve and you can perform more repetitions.
How to Improve Muscular Strength and Definition
Resistance Training
Resistance training is a form of strength training. It uses resistance to strengthen the muscles. Resistance bands are a good example of this, but resistance is also used in pilates, cable workouts, and weighted exercises. Exercises like squats and lunges are examples of resistance training since your muscles are working against the weight of your dumbbells, body weight, or barbells.

Walking is a form of cardio or aerobic exercise. It’s an effective and low-impact exercise for overall health and weight management. The 2018 Physical Activity Guidelines Advisory Committee recommends 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity per week, and walking satisfies that recommendation.
Walking is a convenient form of exercise because it can be done almost anywhere and nearly everyone can do it. All you need to get started is a good pair of shoes. Get tips on shoes, apps, and more to hit your stride on the trail or treadmill.
Frequently Asked Questions
How long does it take to walk a mile?
The time it takes to walk a mile depends on your pace. For most people, you can expect to walk a mile in about 15 to 20 minutes. With practice, you can improve your speed when walking a mile.

How to Know How Fast You Are Walking
How many calories do you burn walking a mile?
The amount of calories you burn doing any physical activity depends on several factors, such as age, sex, weight, and distance. For example, someone who weighs 165 pounds can burn about 85 calories from walking one mile at a 3 to 4 mile per hour pace. A 120-pound person burns approximately 64 calories walking the same distance at the same pace.

How to Calculate the Calories You Burn During Exercise
Is walking good for weight management?

No matter what type of exercise you're doing, combining it with a nutritious, balanced diet will provide the best results for weight management.

Walking Workout Schedule for Weight Loss
How many miles or steps should you walk per day?
If you’re going to start incorporating regular walks into your weekly routine, try to meet the recommended 150 minutes per week.
This is about 30 minutes of walking per day. However, you’re likely to get more steps by also being active throughout the day. A higher step count is associated with lower mortality, so aim for 8,000 to 12,000 steps per day.

Brisk Walking
A relaxed, slower pace that you normally walk at throughout the day is called a stroll. When you’re walking briskly, you’re walking at a faster pace of around 3.5 to 4 miles per hour. Even though you're not running, you may feel your breathing and heart rate increase as it’s more challenging than regular walking or strolling.
How Fast Is a Brisk Walking Pace
Treadmill Walking
If you can’t walk outside due to the weather (or other circumstances), you can use a treadmill to get in your daily steps. This also reduces your sun exposure. Treadmills can be a convenient way to track your speed, distance, heart rate, and time spent walking.
All About Treadmill Walking
Stride
Your stride is the distance taken in one step. If you have long legs, you may have a long stride. This means it takes you fewer steps to walk the same distance as someone with shorter legs.
The Best Technique for a Powerful Walking Stride
Gait
Your walking pattern is called your gait. It involves balance and coordination. Some people may have an abnormal gait due to neurologic, muscular, or skeletal problems.
What Wear Patterns Mean for Walking Shoes
Heart Rate
Your heart is always beating and the number of beats per minute is your heart rate. At rest, your heart doesn’t beat as fast. It beats much faster during exercise than at rest. Wearing a heart rate monitor during exercise can help you monitor your heart rate.
How to Use a Heart Rate Monitor
Steps
You can track your walking in terms of minutes, miles, or steps. Since people have different strides and therefore take a different number of steps to walk the same distance, tracking your steps can be helpful. Some people aim for 10,000 steps per day. You can track your steps with a pedometer, smartphone, or activity tracker.

Physical activity is a crucial part of an overall balanced lifestyle. But it is important to use safe and thoughtful execution to help you get the most out of your workouts.
Not taking the appropriate health and safety precautions can result in you being sidelined and having your goals derailed in the process. In the end, this can reduce the likelihood of continuing with exercise as well as lead to disappointment.
Keep in mind, too, that certain conditions may require modifications, so it is important to speak to a healthcare provider for advice and input. Once you have the all-clear, you can work toward an injury-free fitness journey. Here you will find tips for preventing injuries and disease as well as managing stress so you can get the most out of your workouts.
Frequently Asked Questions
Does stretching prevent injury?
Stretching serves many purposes, first and foremost, aiding in your flexibility and range of motion. While you may have heard that stretching can
prevent injury,
there is not a lot of data to support this claim. In one older study, a static stretching routine resulted in significantly fewer incidences of muscle/tendon injury and lower back pain than in a control group, but total injury rates were equal.
Whether or not you choose to stretch is highly dependent on the type of physical activity for which you’re preparing. In fact, there is some evidence that it may do more harm than good with high-performance athletes.
Additionally, the type of stretching that may be appropriate varies as well. It should also be noted that just because
stretching feels good,
does not mean that it is necessarily preventing injury or that there is not the possibility of it aggravating an existing injury or even causing an injury.

Does exercise help to manage stress?
Exercise can aid not only physical well being, but mental health as well. By reducing tension, strengthening the
mind-body connection
, and in many cases, inspiring a sense of calm, different forms of exercise can play a role in stress management. Physical exercise also has been shown to alleviate symptoms of clinical depression,
while some forms of yoga may be a second line of defense for general anxiety disorder.

Can you manage chronic illness with exercise?
Diseases such as diabetes can be prevented with exercise, and, in some cases, even reversed.
Different illnesses require different courses of action, but there is evidence that lack of exercise is a cause of chronic disease.

Is exercise usually recommended when you have a chronic condition?
Exercising with a chronic condition requires special considerations. Alzheimers,
arthritis
, and COPD are a few of the chronic conditions that require special consideration and planning.
Above all else, ensure that you have clearance from a healthcare provider before beginning a new exercise program.

Why is it important to exercise safely?
When putting together an exercise program, considering safety allows you to optimize your efforts by limiting injury and supporting your individual health considerations. It is easy to become discouraged by exercising if you are consistently getting hurt or injured.
But exercising safely from the beginning and not pushing yourself beyond what is safe, will help ensure that physical activity becomes a lifestyle choice, not a temporary habit. In the end, this increases your enjoyment.

Stretching
Flexibility
Stress
Nutrition
Recovery
Stretching
Stretching is a form of exercise in which a specific muscle or tendon is intentionally flexed or stretched and temporarily lengthened. The American College of Sports Medicine recommends stretching 2 to 3 times per week. Eventually, you may want to work your way up to daily stretching.

Flexibility
Flexibility occurs when a joint or series of joints have the ability to move through an unrestricted, pain-free range of motion. Flexibility exercises help keep your muscles functioning properly and can improve your range of motion.
Health and Fitness Benefits of Flexibility Training
Stress
Stress is often defined as a state of mental or emotional strain or tension that people experience as they encounter changes in life. Although stress is a normal feeling, long-term stress may contribute to or worsen a range of health problems.
How Walking Can Boost Your Mood and Reduce Stress
Nutrition
Nutrition represents food and biological processes that allow us to utilize food for fuel. Proper nutrition involves eating a
healthy and balanced diet
and ensuring your body has the
nutrients it needs to be healthy.
Overview of Nutrition
Recovery
Recovery is the window of time that occurs after ending a round of exercise and returning to a resting state. When you exercise, you deplete the body's
glycogen
stores. Recovery allows your body to replenish these stores and give your muscles time to recover. Disregarding this need can lead to consistent muscle
soreness
and pain.

Cardiovascular exercise
, or “cardio,” is a pillar of a balanced exercise regimen. The word gets thrown around a lot, but it’s a short way of saying
aerobic exercise
. “Aerobic” refers to the requirement for oxygen. In fitness, cardio refers to physical exercises that increase your breathing rate as your body’s need for oxygen increases. It also gets your heart and blood plumping.
Classic examples of cardio exercise include walking, running,
jump roping
, swimming, and cycling. They can be low- or high-intensity, so most fitness routines can easily incorporate a style of cardio exercise.
Frequently Asked Questions
How can you increase your cardio endurance?
Endurance is the ability to ensure physical exercise or withstand physical exertion for a prolonged period of time.
Improved endurance
is a benefit of cardio exercise. Many aerobic athletes want to increase their endurance, such as running or swimming longer distances. Over time, your endurance will naturally improve. Some ways to actively work on this include incorporating intervals like sprints, decreasing your recovery time, and keeping your routine varied.

How to Improve Cardiovascular Endurance for Sports
Should you do cardio before or after strength training?
If your routine contains both cardio and
strength training
, you may wonder which to do first on the same day. There is no right answer to this age-old question. One way to figure out which works best for you is to determine your goals. If your goal is to build strength, consider strength training before cardio. If your goal is to improve your overall performance, consider doing cardio before strength training.

Cardio and Strength Training for Weight Loss: Why You Should Do Both
How long should a cardio workout be?
Roughly 150 minutes of cardio exercise per week is recommended for most people.
If you exercise five times per week, each
cardio workout
would be about 30 minutes. If you exercise three times per week, this would be about 50 minutes per workout. However, your 30 or 50 minutes of cardio exercise don’t have to be performed in succession. You can split them up, such as doing a 15- or 25-minute walk or jog in the morning followed by a 15- or 25-minute bike ride or swim in the evening.
Learn More:
Everything You Need to Know About Cardio
What should your heart rate be during cardio?
Your
heart rate
should be higher during exercise than at rest. However, it shouldn’t be too high. Here is how to determine your target heart zone and the maximum your heart rate should be. Your target heart rate should be 50 to 85 percent of your maximum heart rate. The American Heart Association has a helpful chart based on age.
Learn More:
Resting Heart Rate and Fitness
What does cardio do for your body?
Cardio directly affects your heart health. It makes it stronger and reduces the risk of heart disease.
Aerobic exercise burns calories, which can help with
losing weight
or maintaining a healthy weight. It’s beneficial for mental health, such as stress and anxiety disorders.
Cardio exercise can also help enhance sleep quality, which contributes to overall health.
Learn More:
How Beginners Can Get Started With Cardio
How much cardio is too much?
Love cardio? Then it may be easy for you to go overboard. Despite the benefits of cardio, too much of anything, including
overtraining yourself
, can be a bad thing. While there is no recommended upper limit of cardio per week, you can push yourself too hard if you do more than the recommended 150 minutes of cardio exercise per week. Cardio releases endorphins. The endorphins can become addicting, possibly creating an unhealthy
obsession with exercise

HIIT
HIIT stands for
high-intensity interval training
. It's a form of cardiovascular exercise that involves alternating between bursts of intense exercise and short periods of rest. Incorporating sprints throughout your treadmill workout or jog is an example. HIIT is often contrasted with
steady state cardio
.
Best HIIT Workout Apps
Aerobic Exercises
Aerobic and
cardiovascular exercise
are interchangeable terms. They both refer to exercises that require more oxygen. Examples of aerobic exercises include running, jogging, walking, swimming, cycling, and much more. During these exercises, your breathing and heart rate will increase.
Anaerobic Metabolism vs. Aerobic Metabolism
Interval Training
Some cardio workouts involve
interval training
. It’s similar to HIIT. Interval training involves alternating between intense bursts of exercise and periods of rest, but there is more time for recovery in interval training than HIIT. This helps build
speed and endurance
.
10 Best Interval Training Exercises
Fasted Cardio
Your body is in a fasted state when you haven’t eaten in two or more hours. You’re naturally fasted when you wake up. Some people prefer to do cardio first thing in the morning before breakfast or between meals. This is called
fasted cardio
. Whether you eat before a cardio workout is largely up to you.
Does Fasted Cardio Lead to Greater Weight Loss?
Low Impact Cardio
Some forms of cardio can be more impactful on the body than others. This means it’s harder on parts of the body like joints. Many people with delicate knees, for example, seek low impact cardio exercises that are gentle on their joints.
Low impact cardio
exercises include swimming, walking, and cycling.
Best Cardio Workouts and Exercises for Bad Knees
LISS Cardio
LISS stands for low-intensity steady state cardio. It’s the opposite of HIIT workouts. It involves performing cardio exercise at a steady pace. This could look like brisk walking or jogging at the same speed for a period of time instead of alternating between slower and faster speeds. Sustaining your speed can help increase your endurance.

As a key component for optimal athletic performance, flexibility is the ability of a joint or group of joints to move through an unrestricted, and preferably pain-free, range of motion. Stretching and flexibility exercises keep muscles functioning properly and improve range of motion. What's more, training your body to be more flexible boasts many potential benefits, including but not limited to reduced risk of injury, increased strength, better posture, and improved balance.
There are four different types of flexibility training—static stretching, dynamic stretching, active isolated stretching, and myofascial release. These flexibility training options can be performed either in isolation, or at the end of your current workout sessions. Just as with other training regimens, consistent stretching will reap the best results and enhance the rest of your fitness endeavors, too.
Here we provide information on how to become more flexible as well as how to incorporate stretching into your fitness regimen. Whether you want to improve your range of motion, reduce stiffness, or simply improve your flexibility, you will find it here.
Frequently Asked Questions
How do you become more flexible?
As with any physical goal, becoming more flexible requires a commitment to stretching. While
dynamic stretches
—active movements that stretch muscles through a full range of motion—might be best suited prior to other physical activities, static stretches can be performed as part of a cool-down or on their own.
Static stretches are held for a period of time, placing emphasis on muscle elongation. Active isolated stretching is similar to static stretching, but is performed for shorter periods of time—2 seconds repeated 10 to 12 times as opposed to static stretches, which are held for 15 to 30 seconds—and
myofascial release
is the application of a sustained pressure to a muscle as opposed to massage, which involves active rubbing and kneading.
While some stretching is better than none, incorporating all four modalities into an exercise regimen will reap the greatest benefits and increase flexibility. The efficacy of a flexibility regimen is generally measured by increased range of motion.

Health and Fitness Benefits of Flexibility Training
How often should you stretch?
The American College of Sports Medicine recommends stretching 2 to 3 times per week, working your way up to daily stretching. Hold each stretch for 15 to 30 seconds and repeat it 2 to 4 times.
Learn More:
Stretching 101: Benefits and Proper Technique
Why does stretching feel good?
While stretching may be somewhat uncomfortable (but not painful) it can feel good for a couple of different reasons. First, stretching activates the branch of the nervous system responsible for relaxation and rest known as the parasympathetic system. Additionally, stretching by nature induces
stress relief
, as feelings of tension are often held in our muscles. In fact, some research indicates that a stretching protocol can reduce anxiety levels.

8 Relaxing Total Body Stretches
How long should you hold a stretch?
Recommendations for holding static stretches vary. The American College of Sports Medicine recommends that most adults hold stretches for 15 to 30 seconds, but that older adults may benefit from stretches held for 30 to 60 seconds.
Focus on stretching major muscle groups such as the hips, glutes,
hamstrings
, calves, shoulders, back, and chest.

Stretches for Flexibility
Stretching for flexibility should focus on major muscle groups such as the glutes, quadriceps, hamstrings,
back
, and chest. Dynamic stretches can be tailored to enhance an accompanying training session, while static and active isolated stretching may include stretches for the whole body, regardless of whether or not a workout was completed.
Benefits of Stretching
Range of motion
Range of motion is the maximum amount of movement available at a joint in one of the three planes of motion—or the capability of a joint to go through a complete spectrum of movement. Increased range of motion can be used as a measure of increased flexibility.
Some increased range of motion can be measured on your own, like increased
squat
depth or ability to stretch arms farther in
child’s pose
. A physical therapist can use a device called a goniometer to measure range of motion in other joints.
What Is Range of Motion and How Does it Impact Workouts?
Mobility
Mobility is the ability of a joint to move actively through a range of motion. Increased flexibility may result in increased mobility due to increased extensibility of stretched muscles. Some research suggests that regular stretching has a lasting effect on mobility.
Weak Hip Flexors Could Lead to Decline in Mobility
Joints
Your joints are the mobile areas where two or more bones meet. Working on range of motion through flexibility training, staying active, and maintaining a healthy weight can help maintain joint health.
Intensive Training May Help Bone Health as You Age
Muscles
Your
muscles
are the bands and bundles of fibrous tissue that contract to produce movement in the body. Skeletal—or striated muscle—is the particular type of muscle connected to bones that produces bodily movement. When muscles are tight, they can decrease range of motion. During stretching, muscles are lengthened, and tension is decreased.

Pilates is a form of low-impact exercise similar to yoga. It involves performing exercises on a mat or on a machine (known as a reformer) to improve strength, posture, and flexibility. The repetitive moves in Pilates use resistance or bodyweight and focus on core engagement with the goal of helping the body to move with greater efficiency.
Pilates classes are a fun way to mix up your exercise routine. Many people use Pilates as a rehabilitation tool to relieve hip and back pain.
Here’s what to expect as you delve into the world of Pilates.
Frequently Asked Questions
What is the difference between yoga and Pilates?
Yoga and Pilates are often confused, but they are different forms of exercise. Both are low-impact and involve some stretching, and both seek to improve flexibility and strength. Pilates classes tend to use more equipment than yoga classes, and yoga involves holding poses or positions for longer.

What are the benefits of Pilates?
Pilates has many benefits. Many Pilates classes help to strengthen the core, which can improve posture and alleviate lower back pain. It can also help improve muscle strength and flexibility.

What Is Pilates?
What should you wear in a Pilates class?
What to wear to a Pilates class depends on the type of Pilates. Floor or mat Pilates classes require similar clothing to yoga classes. It’s recommended to wear form-fitting clothing that doesn’t get in the way of any movements. Reformer or megaformer Pilates classes also require form-fitting clothing that won’t get caught in the machine, but you may also need to wear grip socks. These are usually required to prevent you from slipping when using the machine. Grip gloves are usually optional.

Pilates reformer
The
Pilates reformer
is the main machine used in Pilates classes (some classes use the megaformer). The machine uses springs to add resistance to exercises. Most exercises are performed while lying down on the machine. The machine has straps for the hands and feet. When you pull on the straps, the main part of the machine—called the carriage—moves away from the starting position to stretch out the muscles.
What is the Pilates Reformer: Benefits and How To Use
Mat Pilates
Not all Pilates classes or workouts require equipment or machines. Some portion or all of a Pilates class may be done on the floor on a yoga mat. This is called mat Pilates. It uses bodyweight instead of resistance from the machine. Mat Pilates can also include smaller pieces of equipment, such as a Pilates ring, springboard, or sitting box.

Core strength
Many exercises in Pilates aim to increase core strength or the muscular strength of the torso. In Pilates, the core is sometimes called the deep core or powerhouse. Your Pilates instructor may remind you to engage your core throughout the class.
Best Exercises for Core Strength
Extension/Flexion
Extension and flexion are opposites, but they’re terms you may need to learn to get the most out of a Pilates workout. When you flex, you bring your arm or leg towards yourself. This decreases the angle between two bones. Think of flexing your arm or foot. When you extend, you open up a joint. Think of extending your arms towards the sky.
What Are the Three Planes of Motion?
Tuck
In a Pilates class, you may hear the instruction to “tuck” which simply means to tuck your pelvis. Learning how to position your pelvis is a key part of any Pilates class. When you tuck your pelvis, you protect your lower back by engaging your deep core muscles.
Tucked vs. Neutral Pelvic Alignment in Exercise
Grip socks
Grip socks are usually required for most Pilates reformer or megaformer classes. They aren’t needed for mat Pilates classes. These socks are used for safety reasons and prevent you from slipping while using the Pilates machine.

Postural alignment
Postural alignment helps encourage proper posture when standing or sitting. During a Pilates class, you may work on your posture by ensuring your spine, head, and limbs are properly aligned.

When you're creating a fitness routine, cardio is generally a common aspect to consider. How do you plan to get your heart rate pumping? There are plenty of options to add into your weekly habits, many of which, like cycling, are continuing to grow in popularity.
Whether indoors or out, following a guided program, in a group, or on your own, there’s a reason cycling continues to grow momentum. Get ready to push the pedals and reap the benefits of this full-body workout as we guide you on everything from footwear to choosing the best two-wheeler for your endeavors.
Frequently Asked Questions
What muscles does cycling work?
Cycling, indoor and outdoor, works more than just your legs and glutes (although studies confirm that cycling does stimulate deep muscles in the quadriceps and hamstrings).
Core, shoulders, hamstrings, and calf muscles all play a part in cycling, making it a full-body workout.

How Indoor Cycling Works Muscles All Over Your Body
Does cycling strengthen your core?
While cycling has the potential to strengthen your core, there is also evidence that improving your core strength off the bike can improve your pedaling performance.
For this reason, you might consider committing to cycling as your go-to training modality or as part of a cross-training regimen.
Learn More:
Power Up Your Indoor Cycling Workout
Is cycling a low-impact exercise?
Cycling is a low-impact exercise, meaning it is gentle on the joints and involves fluid motion. However, low-impact does not need to mean low intensity: changing gears, performing intervals, and cycling on an incline can increase the intensity of your cycling workouts.
Learn More:
Getting a Good Workout With Low Impact Exercise
Is cycling to work enough exercise?
As with any exercise, getting in some movement is better than nothing, including cycling to work.
In fact, one study found that cycling to work was associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular disease, cancer, and all-cause mortality.
However frequently you choose to bike to work, take appropriate safety precautions.

Upper body workouts target the chest, shoulders, arms, and back. Although fitness equipment, like dumbbells or
kettlebells
, is useful for many upper body workouts, many exercises, such as push-ups or tricep dips, can be performed with bodyweight.
If your goal is to increase your physical strength, working out your upper body is an important part of that process. In addition to
building muscle
, these workouts also can make everyday tasks such as lifting objects and carrying groceries much easier. Upper body workouts like those found here allow you to build muscle and strengthen your chest, back, shoulders, and arms.
Frequently Asked Questions
What are the benefits of upper body workouts?
The upper body is made up of smaller muscle groups than the lower body, so you may wonder if upper body workouts are worth your time. But incorporating exercises that target your upper body will help
increase your strength
, improve posture, and reduce the risk of injury. In fact, research has shown that strength training in general also increases in lean body mass, metabolic rate, and bone density as well.
Learn More:
How to Sculpt a Strong Upper Body
How often should I do an upper body workout?
If your weekly routine consists of 2 to 3 strength training workouts, at least one should target the upper body. In fact, two upper body workouts a week may be necessary for those who want to optimize results. Research indicates that when training major muscle groups—like the upper body—you should plan to train at least twice a week to maximize
muscle growth
.
Learn More:
How Often Should You Work Out?
How much weight should I use for strength training?
The weight recommended for use in a strength training session varies from person to person. Choosing a weight to use depends largely on your experience level and goals. If you’re a beginner, start with a lower amount of weight. For example, you may use 1- or 2-pound dumbbells to perform
bicep curls
as a beginner, but find that you can quickly graduate to 5- or 10-pound weights as you get more comfortable.
Learn More:
How Much Weight Should I Lift?
What are the primary upper body exercises?
Upper body exercises include staples like
push-ups
, pull-ups, bicep curls, overhead press, chest press,
tricep extensions
, rows, and more. These are exercises that target the upper body muscles, including biceps, triceps, chest, back, and shoulders.
Learn More:
Get Strong With This Intense Upper Body Workout
How will upper body workouts impact weight management?
Strength training burns calories, which can help with weight loss or weight management. It also helps build muscle, which burns more calories—even at rest. What's more, a new systematic review and meta-analysis show it is possible to lose about 1.4% of your entire body fat through strength training alone.
If your goal is to lose weight, pair strength training with a
balanced diet
for the best results.

Beginner's Guide to Weight Loss With Strength Training
What does an upper body workout include?
An upper body workout can include a variety of exercises and depends largely on the equipment available to you. You can do a lot of upper body exercises with bodyweight or dumbbells such as
front raises
, kickbacks, and rows. But if you do not have access to these tools, you can use common household items, such as soup cans or water bottles, in place weights for some exercises.

Push-Ups
Push-ups are upper body exercises that are traditionally performed with the hands and toes on the ground. Bend your elbows to lower your body closer to the ground and straighten your arms to push your body back to the starting position. You can even give
incline push-ups
a try if you are just getting started.

Kickbacks
Kickbacks are exercises that
target the triceps
and usually require the use of dumbbells or resistance bands. You can do these exercises standing or bent over a bench. Hold a dumbbell in your hand, keep your elbow glued to your side, and extend your hand behind you while keeping your arm straight. When you perform these exercises you should feel your tricep engage.

Bench Press
The bench press is an upper body exercise that targets the chest. This exercise is usually done in a gym using a bench, barbell, and plates, but you can always substitute dumbbells at
home

Recovery is essential to any workout plan and can help prevent injuries. Learn more about how to optimize recovery through rest, nutrition, and hydration.
Frequently Asked Questions
How do you speed up muscle strain recovery?
You may have heard of the RICE method. No, we’re not talking grains here, but rather
R
est,
I
ce,
C
ompression, and
E
levation. Following these steps can help mitigate aggravation when suffering from muscle strain. A health care provider may also advise taking anti-inflammatory medication or acetaminophen to reduce swelling. Stretching and light movement, depending on mobility, can increase blood flow to the area and aid recovery, but some research suggests protection and immobility of a ruptured muscle is best.
Learn More:
Why You Need Rest and Recovery After Exercise
What is active recovery?
Active recovery involves performing a lower-intensity physical activity following more strenuous exercise. This can be performed either immediately after (for example, spending 10-15 minutes on a recumbent bicycle upon completion of a heavy squat session), or the next day (going for a swim or doing some gentle yoga the day after CrossFit).
Active recovery can encourage muscle rebuilding by increasing blood flow to heavily-taxed muscle groups, as opposed to passive recovery, which involves no movement at all. While arguably passive for the athlete, research suggests massage is an effective strategy for recovery and may result in decreased muscle soreness and inflammation.
Learn More:
What Is Active Recovery and When Should You Use It in a Workout?
Do muscle recovery supplements work?
Supplements, including those purported to promote muscle recovery, are not regulated by the FDA or approved for safety and efficacy before they are marketed to the public. For this reason, it is important to work with a knowledgeable health care provider prior to including a supplement in your routine.
That said, some evidence supports the use of products marketed to support muscle recovery, such as
BCAAs
.
While whole foods are preferable when possible, protein powder may be useful to hit protein requirements for athletes. For example,
whey protein
offers a complete amino acid profile to stimulate muscle protein synthesis.
Additionally, evidence shows that consumption of casein protein before bedtime can stimulate muscle protein synthesis.
Learn More:
The Best Post-Workout Supplements, According to a Dietitian
What foods help with muscle recovery?
While protein-rich foods (think lean meat, cottage cheese, eggs, and fish) promote muscle protein synthesis, restoring muscle glycogen with carbohydrates is key. The International Society of Sports recommends a post-workout feeding with a 4:1 carbohydrate to protein ratio.
Antioxidant-rich foods may also be beneficial. Tart
cherry juice
, which is rich in a group of antioxidants called polyphenols, can aid in muscle recovery and decrease inflammation.
Learn More:
The 8 Best Recovery Foods and Drinks for Your Workout
How much sleep is needed for muscle recovery?
Research suggests that higher sleep quality is associated with greater muscle strength,
and other data suggests that sleep hygiene is just as crucial to performance as physical training.
Sleep deprivation can also result in a reduction of IGF-1 (insulin-like growth factor), which helps regulate muscle protein synthesis.
While 7-9 hours of sleep is generally sufficient, experts warn that a one-size-fits-all is ill-advised, as sleep recommendations for optimal muscle recovery may be sports-specific.

Post-workout snacks are often easily digestible forms of carbohydrates and protein, such as protein bars, smoothies, or fruit with nut butter. Adequate nutrition after a workout is as important as the workout itself. The International Society of Sports Nutrition recommends following the guidelines of a 4:1 carbohydrate to protein ratio and limiting fiber and fat (too much of either will slow absorption of easily digestible carbs and protein) after an intense workout session. Meeting overall individual protein requirements is also crucial to recovery.
What to Eat After a Workout: Post-Workout Nutrition, Timing, and Tips
Pre-workout snacks
What you consume as a pre-workout snack depends on how much time you have. Eating immediately before a workout is generally not recommended. Pairing protein with carbohydrates approximately 1 to 4 hours before training will fuel your body while also giving it time to digest. Remember, digestion is “work” for your body, and you don’t want this process competing with the “work” of your training session.
Pre-Workout Snack Ideas
Rest days
While there are no hard and fast rules on how many days to rest between intense workouts (recovery varies based on the individual), it is generally recommended that muscles are given time to recover, whether it be 24-48 hours or less in some cases. Active rest days, such as participating in lower-intensity physical activity following strenuous training, may facilitate recovery by directing blood flow to muscle tissue.
Why You Need Rest and Recovery After Exercise
Stretching
Stretching is flexibility training that may increase range of motion and reduce muscle tension, but there is little evidence that it aids in actual recovery.
Flexibility as part of an overall training regime has other benefits, including stress relief and relaxation. Some research suggests that stretching may improve sleep quality, which in turn can have a positive impact on muscle recovery.

Incorporating lower body exercises is crucial for a balanced workout routine. These workouts target muscles in the lower body, such as the quads, hamstrings, calves, and glutes. The muscles in the lower body are some of the largest on the body, so you use them during everyday activities like walking and even lifting heavy objects.
You can perform lower body workouts at the gym, studio, or at home. You may need equipment like dumbbells, kettlebells, or weighted barbells. Or, you can perform bodyweight-only lower body exercises.
Frequently Asked Questions
What are the best exercises for glutes?
Glute exercises may vary depending on the equipment available to you and whether you work out at a gym or at home. Generally, exercises that target the glutes include squats, deadlifts, glute bridges, and lunges. These can be done anywhere and are often done with dumbbells or weighted barbells. Relying only on your body weight is also an option.

How many lower body exercises should you do?
You don’t need a long list of exercises on your lower body days. A small handful of 3-5 lower body exercises should be enough to target lower body muscles.
Learn More:
The Best Lower Body Strength Exercises
How do you build a lower body workout?
Building a lower body workout is the same as building any workout. Determine which muscles you want to work on and build your routine around that information. For the lower body, focus on exercises that target the quads, hamstrings, glutes, hips, and calves.
Learn More:
Beginner Lower Body Workout for Strength
How often should you work out your lower body?
You can train your lower body muscles 1-3 times per week. Aim for at least one lower body workout per week. Depending on the workouts you do during the rest of the week, such as cardio, upper body, yoga, pilates, or stretching, you may or may not have time for 1-2 more lower body workouts.

Leg Workouts
This refers to workouts that target muscles in the legs, such as the quads and hamstrings. Leg workouts can be done using weights or bodyweight. Examples include squats and lunges. Some leg workouts also target other muscle groups in the lower body, such as the hips, glutes, or calves.
Leg Exercises for Strength and Conditioning
Bodyweight Leg Workouts
If you don’t have access to weights or you’re a beginner, bodyweight leg workouts are a great place to start. You can perform many of the same movements without additional weights. This allows you to focus on form and repetition.
19 Bodyweight Exercises You Can Do at Home
Squats
Squats are an example of a lower body exercise. They target the glutes, hamstrings, and quadriceps. There are different types of squats, but they’re generally performed by bending the knees and sending the hips back.
How to Do the Squat
Lunges
Lunges are a popular lower body exercise that can be done with or without weights. There are also different types of lunges, such as curtsy lunges, walking lunges, regular lunges, side lunges, and more. These target various muscles in the legs as well as the glutes.
How to Do Lunges: Proper Form, Variations, and Common Mistakes
Dumbbell Workout
Dumbbells are available at the gym and in many home gyms. If you’re low in equipment but still want to get in a full workout, you can follow a dumbbell-only lower body workout. This can include exercises like deadlifts, squats, lunges, step ups, and calf raises.
Total-Body Dumbbell Workout
Strength
Strength training is a sure-fire way to increase your physical strength, which is a measure of a person’s physical exertion. This comes in handy outside of the gym when you need to lift a heavy object, such as a large bag of dog food or box.
6 Facts About Strength Training
HIIT
HIIT stands for high-intensity interval training. It’s a form of cardio that involves alternating between bursts of intense exercise and periods of rest or low-intensity exercise. Some HIIT workouts focus on the legs. If you want to work on your legs but weight lifting doesn’t appeal to you, try lower body HIIT workouts.

You don’t have to get a gym membership or join a workout studio to stay active. In fact, home workouts have become a popular way for everyone from stay-at-home parents to people who work from home to meet their fitness goals. They're especially beneficial for those with time or budget constraints.
Plus, at-home workouts are simple, fun, and effective. You can incorporate elements of gym and studio workouts—such as yoga, pilates, cycling, strength training, and more—into your home workout or create a routine that is unique to you and your goals. Check out our motivation tips and full-body workouts to help you get started on your home workout regimen.
Frequently Asked Questions
How do you get motivated to do a workout at home?
Motivation is one of the biggest challenges that people who work out at home face. Without the accountability of a gym buddy or a class to look forward to, you may find yourself struggling to stay motivated. To improve motivation and reach your goals, try logging your workouts in a
fitness journal
, using an activity tracker like a
smartwatch
, and be sure to find workouts you enjoy. However, don’t be too hard on yourself. If you’re struggling with motivation, it may be time to reassess your goals and your routine.

How to Stay Motivated to Exercise
How do you create a workout plan for beginners?
Working with a
personal trainer
can be incredibly helpful for beginners. But, when you exercise at home, that may not be an option. Other ways for beginners to learn the ropes is turning to online resources like videos and articles. You can also take workout classes from home by streaming them online.

What are the benefits of home workouts?
Working out from home can save you time and money. After all,
gym memberships
and studio fees can get expensive. And although purchasing your own equipment requires some investment up front, over time, it’s usually more cost-effective. At-home workouts may also save you time because there’s no need to drive to and from the gym, check in at the front desk, or wait on equipment to free up.

Best Home Gym Equipment
How do you stay safe working out at home?
If you’re worried about injuring yourself when working out from home, there are a few precautions you can take. Always wear the proper attire when working out from home and handle equipment, like machines and weights, carefully. Additionally, avoid doing any heavy lifting without
someone to spot you
nearby. Stretch before and after a workout to reduce the risk of injury.

What You Need to Know About Working Out at Home
How do you set up a home workout space?
Working out from home requires ample space, so you’ll need to find a place in your home that is suitable for exercise. This can be inside, such as in your garage, a dedicated home gym, or even your living room. Some people enjoy
outdoor workouts
.
If you work out inside, you may want to protect your floors from heavy equipment with floor mats. But if your workout plan doesn’t require heavy machines or weights, you may only need a yoga mat, light dumbbells, and other miscellaneous pieces of equipment that you can store in a closet or basket when not in use.

Flexibility
Planks
Planks are abdominal exercises that increase
core strength
, but you may also feel them working your arms and shoulders as well. To perform a plank, begin in a position that is similar to a push-up. You can hold the plank position on your palms or forearms. For beginners, try lowering your knees to the mat to make it easier. Hold the position for as long as you can. Some people begin with a goal of 30 seconds.
How to Do a Plank
Squats
Squats are a lower-body exercise. You can perform them with bodyweight or make it more challenging by adding weights. There are different types of squats including box squats,
goblet squats
, pistol squats, wall squats, and more. Experiment with different types of squats to determine what is right for you.
How to Do a Squat
Lunges
Lunges target the muscles in the lower body. To perform a lunge take a step forward and place your foot flat in front of you. Your front knee should be bent at a 90-degree angle. Your back leg is slightly bent on the ball of your foot. Performing lunges will help you tone and strengthen the muscles in your lower body. You can even
add dumbbells to your lunges
to make them more challenging.
How to Do Lunges
Squat Jumps
Squat jumps take regular squats up a notch. Start in a squatting position and explode up in a jumping motion. Return to the starting position and repeat. This exercise warms up the lower body and increases core strength. It also gets your heart rate up. If you really want to push yourself, you can try doing a
30-day squat challenge
at home.
How to Do Squat Jumps
High Knees
Doing cardio at home can be difficult with limited space, but high knees are a good exercise to do at home if you want to get in more
cardio
. To do high knees, start in a standing position. One at a time, lift each knee to your chest and alternate between legs while swinging your opposite arm forward. As you gain speed, this exercise starts to look like running in place. Doing this exercise
targets the lower body
and core and is relatively easy to add to a home workout.
19 Effective Cardio Workouts for a Gym-Free Workout
Strength
Strength refers to the measure of a person’s physical exertion. In exercise, it usually refers to lifting weights. Strength training and
weight training
are the primary ways to increase physical strength.
At-Home Strength Workouts for All Levels
Cardio
Cardio is short for cardiovascular exercise. It’s also another word for aerobic exercise, which is when the body requires more oxygen to complete movements. Examples of cardio include running,
brisk walking
, jogging, swimming, and
cycling
. Cardio also gets your heart rate up and blood pumping and can improve cardiovascular health, lower all-cause mortality rates, and support weight management goals.
Everything You Need to Know About Cardio
Flexibility
Flexibility is used to measure a person’s range of motion when performing an exercise or stretch.
Stretching
is one way to improve your flexibility, which makes it easier to perform certain exercises. Flexibility also comes in handy in your daily life. For example, if you drop something in the backseat of your car, flexibility helps you to reach around and grab it.

How Our Review Board Process Works
Every article created by our team of expert writers that contains verifiable facts or medical information makes its way through our comprehensive Review Board process and gets assigned to a specialist based on their area of expertise. Even our custom illustrations go through the Review Board.
When you see this check mark on a Verywell Fit article, you can trust it meets the high standards of our Review Board.
The Verywell Fit Review Board members confirm each piece of content they review is up-to-date, thorough, and authoritative—containing unbiased facts and guidelines that reflect the latest in evidence-based research (not just the latest fads), as well as practical healthy living advice you can use right away.
If the Review Board suggests improvements, those are shared directly with our editorial staff so our editors can make any changes needed. Once a piece of content is approved, it receives the Review Board stamp in the byline—and you’ll know exactly who reviewed it and when.

Experience
Tara Laferrara started coaching fitness classes in 2013.

Tara believes in a three-pronged approach to wellness, encompassing mindset, movement, and nutrition. You are equally likely to hear her preach positive self-talk and daily gratitude as you are to hear her tell someone to grab a heavier weight from the rack.

Benefits of Strength Training for Mental Health
One Week Strength Training Plan
Strength training is a form of
resistance training
with the goal of increasing your physical strength. Because it is clearly measurable, you can see your results in action and observe how far you have come while improving your strength.
Strength training differs from other types of resistance training in that the main goal is not to build
muscle size
or
endurance
, although those effects may occur. Instead, a successful strength training routine will result in your body being stronger and able to lift heavier weights.
Strength training
offers other benefits as well. Not only does it improve your physical well-being but it also provides unique boosts to your mental well-being. Below are some of the many mental health benefits that a strength training routine can provide plus a sample plan you can follow for excellent results.
The 10 Top Exercises for New Weight Trainers
Benefits of Strength Training for Mental Health
How
strength training
benefits you can be a personal and unique experience. Here are some of the common ways strength training may benefit your mental health.
Improves Mood
Strength training can
improve your mood
in many ways. The act of committing to a goal,
building habits
, and sticking to a routine can help boost your mood.
What's more, endorphins released through strength training can give you a jolt of feel-good chemicals that help you see the brighter side of life.
Research shows that strength training can also reduce other depressive symptoms for many people.
It can improve self-confidence, build self-esteem, and improve body image. While several studies have shown the benefits of exercise, including strength training, for improving certain mental health conditions, it is imperative that you seek treatment if you are experiencing symptoms. You should always consult with a healthcare provider about your specific needs.
If you or a loved one are struggling with depression or anxiety, follow up with a healthcare provider or mental health professional. For additional information, support, and treatment facilities in your area, contact the
Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) National Helpline
at
1-800-662-4357
.
For more mental health resources, see our
National Helpline Database
.
Strengthens Mind-Body Connection
Strength training demands a high level of mind-body connection because with the use of heavy weights comes some risk. It's vital to be aware of how your body is responding.
"If you engage in movement with the intention of letting your body guide you—[such as] listening to your body about how much weight to lift, what
movements feel good
and what doesn't feel good—we are communicating to our body that it is a trusted and wise guide," explains
Alexis Conason
, PsyD, clinical psychologist and author of "The Diet-Free Revolution: 10 Steps to Free Yourself from the Diet Cycle with Mindful Eating and Radical Self-Acceptance."
But beware of the fact that strength training can also be done in a way that overrides your body wisdom, says Conason.
"The 'no pain, no gain' mentality or doing what an instructor tells you to do while pushing through signals that your body may be sending you, can lead to misattunement, disconnection, and ultimately injury," she adds.
Be mindful of how you are feeling and take the time to check in with yourself to ensure you are not ignoring any of those signals.
Lowers Stress and Anxiety
Strength training can reduce stress and anxiety by bringing down your stress hormone, cortisol, says certified personal trainer Kristie Alicea, CPT, co-founder of
ABC Fit Collective
. What's more, when we decrease cortisol, there is a reduction in anxiety.
"When we strength train the mind releases endorphins, the body's 'feel-good' hormones, that can help to bring down cortisol levels and make you feel good after a workout," she adds.
Kristie Alicea, CPT
Strength training can help our bodies maintain hormonal health. Our hormones affect every part of our body, especially our emotions and our mental state of being.
— Kristie Alicea, CPT
Recent research shows that strength training specifically reduced anxiety by up to 20% in study participants.
Researchers believe this likely led to feelings of mastery, increasing belief in their capabilities, and coping skills.
The increase in their abilities, most likely increased their confidence and self-esteem, which then could lead to a reduction in anxiety. Researchers also surmise that biological changes to the muscles and brain worked together to improve anxiety symptoms, but more studies are needed to draw solid conclusions.
"Strength training can help our bodies maintain hormonal health," says Alicea. "Our hormones affect every part of our body, especially our emotions and our mental state of being."
Why Aren't You Motivated to Exercise?
Boosts Brain Health
Strength training can also boost our brain, helping with things like memory and preventing cognitive decline.
"Incorporating strength training into your routine can make you feel more mentally engaged and boost your mental energy and focus," says Alicea.
Regular exercise such as a consistent strength training routine has protective effects for memory and cognitive decline.
Research shows that 70 to 150 minutes of weekly physical activity, such as strength training, lead to improved cognitive abilities for older individuals.
Evidence suggests that strength training and other exercises can bolster neuroprotective growth factors, reduce inflammatory markers in the brain, and assist in new brain cell formation.
Improves Relationship with Your Body
For some people, exercise may be seen as a form of compensation for poor eating habits, or as a way to force your body into a certain shape. For some people, this often means trying to look slimmer or lose weight. Focusing on your appearance can cause an unhealthy relationship with your body and exercise.
Alexis Conason, PsyD
Movement can become a way of compensating for the food we've eaten or an attempt to alleviate negative body image. These can be red flags for eating disorders, disordered eating, and unhealthy exercise behaviors.
— Alexis Conason, PsyD
"Movement can become a way of
compensating for the food
we've eaten or an attempt to alleviate negative body image. These can be red flags for eating disorders, disordered eating, and unhealthy exercise behaviors," says Conason.
Choosing to center your exercise routine on building strength, removes the appearance aspect of performing physical activity. Also, as you build strength, you have a clear indicator of how your body can perform and do amazing things that perhaps you never knew you were capable of. Plus, this physical activity can have a positive impact on body image as well as impact feelings of body dissatisfaction.
In fact, one study found that women who worked out were able to improve their body image significantly, compared with those who did not exercise. The researchers also found that the effect on body image was almost immediate and lasted a minimum of 20 minutes after exercise.
Meanwhile, a study of teens found that physical activity can help them achieve a positive self-concept and promote psychological well-being. In fact, researchers found that physical activity also decreased body dissatisfaction.
Cardio Workouts
One Week Strength Training Plan
A solid strength training plan will work all of the major muscle groups with
challenging weights
and focus on increasing the weight lifted with each session or week over week, depending on your program. When focusing on building muscular strength, there is a sizeable neurological component.
This means that practicing the same movements multiple times will train your brain and body to perform them at higher levels. Your central nervous system will become accustomed to heavier loads over time, allowing you to lift more safely.
"It is also important to approach strength training (and any kind of physical activity) in a kind and gentle way," says Conason. "In our culture that emphasizes a 'strong is the new skinny' mentality, it is easy to find yourself drawn to working out and strength training
as a way to change your body
."
But you need to be cautious about how your approach your strength training routine. Monitor how you feel about your routine and your body and make sure your approach is mentally healthy. For instance, if you notice you are dissatisfied or feel guilty, it may help to talk over your feelings with a mental health professional.
"[Also], if you notice that your strength training routine is rigid, that you have anxiety around skipping a workout, that you feel like you have to exercise because your body is 'bad,' or that you are comparing your body to other people in the class, it may be a good idea to reevaluate your relationship with exercise," Conason says.
Other signs of an issue include that you find it hard to listen to your body or you feel the need to push through pain or fatigue, Conason adds. You also should not feel guilty if you take a break or modify exercises.
You may want to pause to ask yourself why you are choosing to add strength training to your routine. The answer to this question may help you to determine whether it is for healthy reasons and appropriate for you right now.
Below is an example of a simple yet highly effective strength training plan for one week. This plan can be followed for 3 or 4 weeks, with a de-load week following. For this plan, use a rest period between sets of 3 to 5 minutes to allow maximum effort during your repetitions in the next set.
It is also vital to leave time for your body to recover between training days. Use
active recovery
exercises, such as walking and yoga, to boost your body's healing capabilities and still remain active during your off-days. You also should check with a healthcare provider to ensure that a strength training program is right for you.
Monday, Wednesday, Friday
Perform each exercise for three sets of 4 to 5. You should feel like you could only do two more reps when you stop your set. Do not push to failure and make sure you start every workout session with a
proper warm-up
.
During the following weeks, you can adjust your repetition range to two to three and even try to do a
1 rep maximum
during the final week. Make sure to use a spotter (a person that can ensure your safety by helping raise the bar if you cannot complete a lift).
Strength Building Exercises
Barbell shoulder press
Barbell deadlift
Barbell bench press
Barbell squat
Barbell row
Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday, Sunday
Spend the off days in active recovery, which is when you engage in a low-intensity exercise, placing minimal stress on the body if any. Examples of active recovery exercises include
stretching
, walking, swimming, and
yoga
.
During
active recovery
, the body works to repair your muscles, tendons, and ligaments. It also helps improve blood circulation and aids with the removal of waste products from muscle breakdown. Once this occurs, fresh blood can come in to bring nutrients that help repair and rebuild the muscles.
Active Recovery Options
Swimming Workout for Active Recovery
Walking or a
slow jog
Aqua jogging
Yoga
Strength training has clear benefits for your mental health. Your mood, confidence, and connection to your body may improve with consistent practice. To ensure you are making the most of your strength training practice, be aware of how it is affecting your thought patterns and adjust accordingly.

What Is Endurance?
Types of Endurance
Improving Endurance
Frequently Asked Questions
Endurance is a term we throw around often, particularly in relation to
long-distance running
or achieving high reps in weight lifting. It essentially means having the ability to maintain activity for an extended period of time.
It takes a great deal of time, effort, and consistent practice to achieve endurance, no matter what endeavor you're working toward increasing your endurance for. Practice may not make perfect, but it goes a long way in increasing endurance levels.
What Is Endurance?
Endurance is an ability that is most often acquired after extensive training—it's not necessarily something that someone is just “gifted” at.
“It is most often a combination of physiological and psychological factors that allow us to continue doing what we are doing for as long as we desire,” explains Bill Daniels, CSCS, CPT, founder of
Beyond Fitness
.
Some of these factors include fatigue—for example, if you didn't sleep well the night before or are simply worn out, you may have a harder time following through with certain activities that require an extensive amount of output or stamina. Fitness level is also a predictor of endurance; how physically fit a person is, coupled with their level of training will impact their endurance ability.
“If you are constantly challenging yourself mentally and physically day-in and day-out for weeks, months, and years at a time you are building endurance,” says Jordan Hosbein, NASM-certified personal trainer and owner of
Iron and Grit
.
Genetics is another factor, as our bodies have different types of muscle fibers that can influence our physical capabilities, explains Roger E. Adams, PhD, CISSN, doctor of nutrition and owner of
eatrightfitness
. While research shows you can gradually alter the amount of these fibers you have, it also emphasizes the role of genetics in dictating one’s muscle makeup.
Endurance vs Stamina
Endurance is often confused with the term
stamina
. However, the two are very different. According to Adams, stamina often refers to the amount of time a person can perform a certain activity at maximum capacity or without getting tired. Endurance, on the other hand, revolves around one’s ability to perform a certain activity, it does not take into consideration performing at maximum capacity the way that stamina does.
Types of Endurance
Endurance can be broken down into classifications that are defined by type. Here is a look at some of the main types of endurance when it comes to physical fitness and what they mean.
Cardiovascular Endurance
As the name suggests,
cardiovascular endurance
has to do with the amount of stress that your heart can take during physical activity. When you build up cardiovascular endurance, your body becomes more efficient at pumping blood while performing that certain activity, explains Hosbein.
In other words, a person who has built up more cardiovascular endurance can sustain longer and more intense training overall than someone who has not yet built up that level of cardiovascular endurance.
Muscular Endurance
Muscular endurance has to do with the length of time that your muscles can continue to contract enough to allow your body to carry out a certain activity. A person lacking in muscular endurance will succumb sooner to excess lactic acid build-up which causes cramps, explains Robert Dodds, CPT, fitness coach, and founder of
Nothing Barred Fitness.
A person with a significant amount of muscular endurance, on the other hand, will be able to keep lifting a weight for more repetitions before failure.
Anaerobic Endurance
The word
anaerobic
means without oxygen, so the concept of anaerobic endurance has to do with how long a muscle is able to keep working at a certain physical feat without much, or any, oxygen. Weight lifting is a great example of this. Due to the nature of anaerobic exercise, it tends to be shorter in duration, but higher in intensity than aerobic exercise, such as swimming or cycling.
How You Can Improve Your Endurance
Through endurance training, you can work to improve your ability to carry out a certain activity for longer periods of time. Here are some expert-approved tips for how to improve your endurance.
Participate in Interval Training
Interval training, which often goes by the name “
high-intensity interval training
,” involves increasing the intensity of your workout for a short period of time. If running is your workout of choice, you may intentionally push your pace harder than normal for 20-second intervals and then follow those intervals with a slower recovery pace for about a minute. This not only boosts your endurance over time but also comes with a slew of other benefits including improvement of insulin sensitivity. Pedaling on
an air bike
is another excellent activity to build strength and endurance.
Add a Few More Reps to Each Set
No matter the type of exercise you’re performing, one way to enhance your endurance is to add one more rep, one more mile, or 5 more minutes to each week’s, or month’s, fitness schedule. Slowly, your body will begin to adapt to that level of exercise and it will become your norm.
Rest Less Between Your Sets
While resting in between certain types of physical activity can be beneficial, it can also lower your heart rate and your endurance threshold, explains Hosbein. He recommends taking less rest between your workout sets so that your rate stays elevated and your endurance increases with each workout.
Increase Your Core Strength
No matter your workout of choice, be it running, swimming, cycling or weight lifting, it’s also important to focus on strengthening your core, as this will help improve your endurance in any activity you perform, explains
Allen Conrad
, BS, DC, CSCS, Montgomery County Chiropractic Center in North Wales Pennsylvania.
Allen Conrad BS, DC, CSC
Having a stronger core will help you perform just about any activity and help you achieve enhanced endurance faster
— Allen Conrad BS, DC, CSC
A Word From Verywell
If you’re having trouble taking your workouts to the next level and feel that your endurance has flattened, try one of the exercises mentioned above or consider enlisting the help of a certified personal trainer. If you have any discomfort or lingering pain as you work to increase your endurance, seek advice from a healthcare professional.
Frequently Asked Questions
What types of activities require endurance?
Nearly every activity in life requires some level of endurance, but we primarily think of endurance when it comes to physical activity, such as running, biking, swimming, and strength training. In order to improve your ability to perform these activities, or extend the timeframe that you are able to perform these activities, you need to increase your endurance.

How to Improve Cardiovascular Endurance for Sports
Why is endurance important in life?
Endurance is important because it carries over to nearly every single task we perform. For example, a person needs to have enough endurance to make it through a full day of activities, whether that’s carpooling their kids, tending to their professional responsibilities, carrying out their duties at home, and then having enough energy to prepare dinner and put their kids to bed.
What causes a loss of endurance?
A lack of endurance is usually the result of not performing a certain activity regularly. Our bodies become used to our day-to-day routine and activities. Therefore, if we stop performing a certain activity, such as running every day for 20 minutes, our endurance slowly declines along with our ability to perform that activity at the caliber in which we were once performing it.

Resistance Training Safety Tips
Frequently Asked Questions
Whether you’re looking to add strength training to your gym routine or thinking of working out at home, resistance training improves muscle strength and tone and protects your joints from injury. It also is a relatively accessible option that can help you reach your weight-management goals as well as maintain flexibility and balance.
These benefits are important, especially as you get older. While increased strength and mobility are helpful to all ages, you want to be sure you are fighting muscle loss as you age. Read on to learn what resistance training is and how to get started.
What Is Resistance Training?
Resistance training is a form of exercise intended to
increase muscular strength
and endurance. It involves exercising muscles using some form of resistance. This resistance could be weights, bands, or even
your own bodyweight
working against gravity.
When doing resistance training—which is sometimes called strength training or weight training—you can focus on specific results, such as joint stability, muscular endurance, increased muscle size, strength, and
power
.
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), you should do muscle-strengthening activities of moderate or greater intensity, two or more days a week. These exercises should involve all major muscle groups. For children, the CDC recommends three hours of resistance training per week.
Benefits of Resistance Training
Resistance training is intended to increase muscular strength and endurance, but it has a wide variety of health benefits, too. Here are a few benefits you may experience from incorporating resistance training into your workout routine.
Resistance Training: Why Is it Important for You?
Boost Metabolism and Reduce Body Fat
Resistance training could be helpful for your weight-loss goals. Studies have found that resistance training can help boost your metabolism. In fact, one study estimated that nine months of resistance training was enough to significantly increase your resting metabolic rate.
This means you can significantly change your metabolism in under a year by doing resistance training consistently. Further studies indicate that resistance training was even more effective for improving your metabolism than aerobic exercise. This fact can be helpful if you want to change your routine and try something new.
While studies suggest resistance training can be effective for improving metabolism, it doesn’t mean cardio is ineffective. Try incorporating a combination of both forms of exercise for the best results.

Increase Bone Density and Improve Balance
Your bones can benefit from resistance training, too. Studies have shown that doing resistance training consistently can maintain or increase bone mass and density.
Additionally, resistance training can help improve balance and stability. This is especially important as you age.
For instance, one study on balance improvement included 50 older adults who were assigned to either a training group or a control group. Throughout the study, the training group performed leg extensions and curl exercises over 12 weeks. At the end of that time, researchers noted that the training group had significantly improved balance compared with those in the control group.
5 Balance Exercises to Boost Stability
Improve Mental Health
Your physical health is not the only reason to start working out. Healthcare providers often recommend exercise for improving mental health, too. Your mental and emotional health is vital to your quality of life and day-to-day experience.
A study on improving the quality of life in older adults found that resistance training boosted mental, emotional, social function, and physical function.
Further studies found that resistance training can help alleviate
depression
symptoms, even if the exercise is mild enough to have no clear improvement in physical strength.
Resistance training can also help relieve general feelings of anxiety and worry. This means that even a small amount of resistance training consistently can improve your mental and emotional health and act as a stress reliever.
5 Mental Health Benefits of Strength Training
Build Muscle Mass
Some people's goals for resistance training may be to build muscle mass in a process known as
muscle hypertrophy
. This goal is for people who want to build muscle as well as older adults who want to minimize muscle loss, also known as muscle atrophy.
Regardless of your goal, resistance training is an excellent option for building muscle mass. According to studies, the best way to build muscle is to focus on mechanical tension and metabolic stress. Persistence in this type of training regimen is essential to getting results.
How to Build and Maintain Muscle
Improve Muscle Strength and Endurance
Improving the strength and endurance of your muscles isn’t just for show; it also can help keep your muscles healthy and improve your quality of life. Muscle strength and endurance are important in your daily life, especially as you get older.
Resistance training can help your muscles remain healthy and functional. For instance, your muscles help you do small tasks, such as lifting things, opening containers, or even being active for longer hours.
According to one study, the amount of resistance training you do is directly proportional to muscular strength and endurance. If you want to improve your strength or endurance, increase the amount of resistance training you do either by expanding how long you do it or how often.
Strength Training Tips and Workouts
Reduces the Risk of Sports Injuries
Resistance training workouts for children decrease rates of fracture, musculotendinous, and muscle injuries associated with playing sports. Regular resistance training may help children and adolescents avoid muscle injury when participating in athletics.
Of course, the workout routine for a child would not be the same as it would be for an adult. Consult a personal trainer when developing a workout routine for a child or adolescent.

Increases Self-Esteem
While resistance training can help you tone your muscles and even increase their size if that is your goal, it also can help you build confidence and boost your self-esteem. Researchers note that engaging in resistance training can raise self-esteem, particularly in women.
In fact, in one study of college women, researchers noted that participants reported feeling invigorated after a resistance-training workout. They also indicated they had improved self-concept, self-esteem, and self-efficacy, as well as improved overall mood.
Resistance Training: Why Is it Important for You?
How to Get Started With Resistance Training
According to the CDC, you should try incorporating resistance training into your workouts consistently. Because you can use your body weight to begin or even a simple set of dumbbells, you do not have to join a gym or hire a personal trainer to get started.
You need to make sure you are using proper form in your workouts. Proper form can ensure you get the most from your workout and decrease your risk of injury.
If you have a medical condition or a disability or are starting an exercise routine, talk to a healthcare provider for advice. They can provide insight into what is best for you given your medical history.
It is also important to note that you do not have to buy equipment to get started with resistance training. You can use your body weight for exercises like
pushups
,
squats
, and
planks
. Or, you can use household items to add more weight like gallon jugs of water, soup cans in a canvas bag, or a backpack with an unopened bag of flour. Once you've achieved a certain level of expertise, you may invest in equipment like
adjustable dumbbells
.
Resistance Training Equipment
Although equipment is not required when getting started with resistance training, here are some examples of equipment you can use:
Barbells
Dumbbells
Kettlebells
Resistance bands
Suspension trainers
Pull-up bars
As for the weight you begin with, some people like to start by using their body weight before adding free weights or other equipment. Here are two exercises that do not require special equipment recommended by Katie Pierson, a certified personal trainer and group fitness instructor.
Which Resistance Bands Should You Use?
Bodyweight Squat
This exercise engages your glutes, hamstrings, quadriceps, calves, and core. Pierson recommends performing two to three sets with 10 to 12 repetitions per set. Here is how you complete a bodyweight squat:
Begin with your feet slightly wider than your hips and toes slightly turned out.
Engage your glutes and lower down, as if you were sitting in a chair.
Make sure that your knees do not go past your toes.
Stop at the bottom of the move with your hips slightly higher than your knees.
Press through your heels as you come back to a standing position.
30-Day Squat Challenge
Pushups
Pushups engage your chest, triceps, and core. Pierson recommends doing two to three sets with five to eight reps per set. There are pushup variations depending on your fitness level. Pierson recommends starting on your knees if you are a beginner. Here is how to do a
pushup
from your knees:
Start on your hands and knees and walk your hands forward.
Stop when your abs engage, and a diagonal line forms from the back of your knees to your shoulders.
Place your hands slightly wider than your shoulders.
Lower your chest slowly toward the floor. At the bottom of the rep, your elbows should form a line with your wrists.

Resistance Training Safety Tips
Before starting a new workout program, always talk to a healthcare professional for guidance on what is right for you given your fitness level and medical history. It is also essential to stay safe and responsible when working out. Here are some tips on how to work out safely:
Use proper form
: If you cannot use proper form, consider lowering the weight or resistance. If this is impossible or you still can’t use the appropriate form, consider talking to a personal trainer about trying an altered form of the exercise.
Exercise safely
:
Never use more weight or resistance than you can handle at your fitness level. Using weights that are too heavy can lead to improper form and injury.
Bring water
: Drinking water can help you avoid dehydration and fatigue. Not all gyms offer drinking fountains or have water options.
Find a workout buddy
:
A workout buddy can help increase motivation and accountability but can also help if you injure yourself or need a spotter.
Stop if you experience pain
:
If you feel pain or discomfort, stop working out and talk to a healthcare provider. You also should seek medical attention if you injure yourself during a workout.
Principle of Specificity in Athletic Training
A Word From Verywell
Resistance training provides a wealth of benefits. Aside from building muscle tone and strength, it also improves mental health, relieves stress, and increases balance. It also can help with everyday activities like carrying groceries, climbing stairs, or working in your garden. For these reasons, you should consider adding resistance training to your routine, especially if you want to boost your metabolism and increase bone density.
Talk with your healthcare provider first to find out what is right for you given your current fitness level and medical history. It also may be helpful to talk to a personal trainer for advice on proper form if you are starting resistance training. You do not have to join a gym or work with a trainer to benefit from resistance training.

Verywell / Ryan Kelly
Whether you've taken a long
break from exercise
or you're just getting started, this six-week program is the perfect place to begin. You'll establish an exercise routine with simple, straightforward workouts that progress from week to week.
The workouts provided are only suggestions and won't work for everyone. You can modify them as needed to fit your fitness level, schedule, and preferences.
Prepare for Your Workouts
Before you get started, there are a few key points to make sure you have addressed:
Consult with your healthcare provider.
You should always talk to your doctor before starting or intensifying a workout routine, especially if you have any injuries or health conditions.
Gather your equipment
. For the strength workouts, you'll need
home workout equipment
like dumbbells, an exercise ball,
resistance bands
,
a medicine ball
, and a mat. If you're new to strength training, make sure that you familiarize yourself with
the basics
and know how to choose the right weight.
Record your
vital statistics
.
This information will be especially important if you want to track weight loss progress.
Prepare for your workouts
. The cardio workouts are designed to be done on any cardio machine or outside. If machines aren't your thing, you can substitute your own workouts (videos, classes, outdoor exercise, etc.) or
choose something else
you enjoy.
1
Week 1
Focus on Monitoring Intensity
Intensity is an important aspect of your cardio workouts. Monitoring intensity can help you learn how your body feels during different activities. You can monitor intensity in several ways, including:
The Talk Test
Monitoring Your Heart Rate
Your goal this week is to focus on the
intensity of your workouts
. During each cardio workout, use one of the methods above to track how you feel and match your Perceived Exertion to the suggested levels.
Most workouts will be at a
moderate level
, which means you'll be just out of your comfort zone but not huffing and puffing. Pay attention to how you do this week to get a sense of your exercise intensity.
Day 1: Cardio, Strength, and Stretch
These workouts are short and simple and should take you 35 to 45 minutes.

Week 2
Week 2 brings some small changes that will help you slowly progress. You'll have new, longer cardio workouts and you'll be doing an added set of each exercise during your strength training workouts.
You can modify the workouts to fit your fitness level, schedule, and goals. Listen to your body and take extra rest days as needed.
Focus on F.I.T.T.
Frequency
.
This week, you'll be doing cardio 3 times and strength training 3 times, which follows the basic
exercise guidelines
for improving your health. You'll gradually add more frequent exercise as you progress through the program.
Intensity.
During the first few weeks, you'll focus on achieving moderate intensity—about a Level 5 to 6 on the
Perceived Exertion Scale
. As you progress through the program, you will gradually change the intensity levels of your workouts with interval training and other techniques.
Time
.
Your workouts started at about 10 to 20 minutes. Each week, you will gradually add time to your workouts to build endurance and help you burn more calories.
Type
.
It's important to do activities you enjoy, but you also want to cross-train and mix things up to keep both your body and mind engaged. You'll choose new activities to add to your routine later in the program.
This week, your focus is on the F.I.T.T. principle, which guides us in setting up workout programs. This principle includes:
When you workout at a sufficient intensity, time, and frequency, you'll start to see changes in your weight, body fat, endurance, and strength.
Once your body adjusts to your current FITT levels, you'll need to manipulate one or more of them—and this program will help you learn how to do that.
Day 1: Cardio, Strength, and Stretch
Your cardio workout this week builds on last week's basic workout by adding 5 minutes. Your strength workout is the same, but you'll do 2 sets of each exercise with a brief rest in between.

Week 3
This week, you'll see some big changes in your schedule. You'll be upping the ante by splitting your cardio and strength workouts, giving you 3 days of cardio and 2 days of strength training.
By splitting your workouts, you can give more energy to each routine, which can help improve your performance and do more with your exercise time.
Focus on Tracking Progress
One of the most important things you'll do on your exercise journey is to track your progress. Knowing where you are and how you're improving is essential for staying motivated and knowing you're on the right track. Here are a few suggestions:
Health improvements.
Exercise can do more for you than just help you lose weight. It can also
improve your health
.
You might sleep better, have more energy, or feel like your daily tasks are easier. Think about what you'd like to improve (e.g., being able to walk up the stairs at work without passing out, being able to play with your kids or grandkids without getting tired, etc.) and make a note of it in your weekly checklist. Each week, check to see how far you've come.
Strength and endurance.
It's motivating when you see and feel yourself getting stronger. Keeping track of how many sets, reps, and how much weight you're using each week can tell you if you're getting stronger. You might also notice exercises are getting easier.
Weight loss.
Weight loss
is another common gauge of how you're doing with your workout, but remember that weight loss is often slower than you might expect. It may even take weeks or months to see significant changes.
Weighing yourself,
taking your measurements
,
getting your body fat tested
, and/or noticing how you look or how your clothes fit can help you keep track of your progress.
Workouts completed.
You might decide to focus less on the results and more on your fitness journey.
Setting a goal
to complete a certain number of workouts each week can help you stay focused on the process while celebrating your accomplishments.

What It Is
How Much You Need
Measuring
Examples
What It Isn't
Getting More
Many physical activity guidelines suggest that regular, moderate exercise is important for health and wellness. Getting the minimum amount of moderate activity per week can help prevent disease, boost mood, support
weight loss
(or
maintenance
), and more. So understanding what moderate exercise is and how to measure it is valuable for your well-being.
What Is Moderate Exercise?
"Anything that gets your heart beating faster" counts as moderate exercise, according to the U.S. Department of Health and Human Service's Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans.
Moderate-intensity cardio exercise includes brisk walking, raking the yard or mopping floors, and playing tennis with a partner.
The American Heart Association (AHA) adds that, when doing moderate exercise, you should be breathing harder than if you were inactive, yet still be able to speak.
So, using the
talk test
is a good way to monitor whether you're at a moderate intensity.
Benefits of Moderate Exercise
Getting moderate exercise regularly can:
Reduce the risk of major medical conditions such as heart disease,
type 2 diabetes
, and dementia
Improve
sleep
and sleep disorders
Support better brain function (memory, focus, and processing of information)
Help with weight loss or maintenance
Improve
bone health
Reduce depression and anxiety symptoms and other mental health symptoms
How Much Moderate Exercise Do You Need?
The Department of Health and Human Services and AHA both give the same prescription for moderate exercise:
30 minutes a day
for five days a week, or a total of two hours and 30 minutes per week.
Physical activity needs to continue for at least 10 minutes to be considered a session of exercise. So you can break up your 30 daily minutes into two to three shorter sessions, each at least 10 minutes long.
As you build your ability to exercise, aim to get even more moderate activity. If you can boost your moderate aerobic exercise time to 300 minutes (five hours) per week, you will have likely enjoy even more health benefits.
Measuring Moderate Exercise
A moderate level of activity noticeably increases your heart rate and breathing rate. You may sweat, but you are still able to carry on a conversation. You can talk, but you can't sing. You feel you are exercising, but you are not huffing and puffing. You can use a couple of different scales to measure your exercise intensity.
Heart Rate
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) defines a moderate-intensity heart rate zone as 50% to 70% of your
maximum heart rate
.
A person's maximum heart rate varies by age. Use a
heart rate chart or calculator
to determine yours.
To measure your heart rate mid-exercise, you can
take your pulse
or
use a heart rate monitor
, an app, a fitness tracker, or a smartwatch. This helps ensure that you are staying at a moderate intensity (not working too hard or taking it too easy).
MET
The term "MET" is an abbreviation for "Metabolic Equivalent for Task" and refers to the amount of oxygen the body uses during physical activity. By assigning METs to an activity, we can compare the amount of exertion an activity takes, even among people of different weights.
During moderate physical activity, your breathing and heart rate become more rapid and your body burns about 3.5 to 7 calories per minute. The actual number burned depends on your weight and fitness level.
For reference, your body uses 1 MET for basic functions, like breathing. When you get to 7 METs of effort, your physical activity is considered
vigorous
. So the spectrum is:
1 MET: At rest
2 METs: Light activity
3-6 METs: Moderate activity
7 or more METs: Vigorous activity
Perceived Exertion
You can also check your activity level using the
Borg Rating of Perceived Exertion scale
(RPE).
Using this scale involves monitoring how you feel about your activity level.
At one end of this 14-point scale, which starts at 6, is absolute stillness. At the other (20) is sprinting as hard as you can. An RPE between 11 and 14 is considered moderate activity.
6: No exertion (sitting still or sleeping)
7-8: Extremely light exertion
9-10: Very light exertion
11-12: Light exertion
13-14: Somewhat hard exertion
15-16: Heavy exertion
17-18: Very heavy exertion
20: Maximum exertion
Examples of Moderate Exercise
There are many activities that are generally counted as moderate-intensity exercise. Choose a few that appeal to you and work on adding them to your weekly routine.
Brisk walking
Easy jogging
Walking or jogging on a treadmill
Using an
elliptical trainer
Bicycling
under 10 miles per hour, on level ground or with few hills
Swimming leisurely
Water aerobics
Ballroom dancing and line dancing
Softball and baseball
Volleyball
Doubles
tennis
Gardening and some
housework
, such as vacuuming
If You Have Mobility Challenges
If you are not able to use your legs, you can achieve moderate intensity by using a manual wheelchair or a handcycle (ergometer), in addition to swimming or water aerobics. If you can use your legs but you don't tolerate walking or jogging, try bicycling or swimming. Cycling on an
under-desk bike
is an example of safe non-weight-bearing exercise.
What Doesn't Count
An easy walk of under 10 minutes doesn't count as moderate-intensity aerobic activity. You may accrue over
10,000 steps per day
on your pedometer, but unless you do some sessions of 10 minutes or more at a brisk pace, you haven't met your daily exercise goal.
Many activity monitors, pedometers, and smartwatches track continuous movement at a pace they consider to be right for achieving moderate-intensity exercise to vigorous-intensity exercise. They report this as "
active minutes
" and
exercise calories burned
. It is a good way to see if you are getting enough exercise of the right kind.
Calories in Food and Exercise
How to Get More Moderate Exercise
There are many ways to build moderate activity into your lifestyle. These include:
Try 10-minute bursts of activity
: Walk briskly for at least 10 minutes at a time.
Start by walking
at an easy pace for a couple of minutes, then pick up the pace for 10 minutes. Try to walk during work breaks or lunch, and/or before or after the workday. Or pick up
a basketball
and do some drills like dribbling and lateral footwork.
Try walking workouts
: You can walk indoors (at the mall or on a track at the gym), outdoors, or on a treadmill.
Using good posture and walking techniques
make it easier to achieve a brisk pace. After you are comfortable walking briskly for 10 minutes at a time, begin to extend your walking time. For variety, try different
walking workouts
that offer bursts of walking faster, jogging intervals, or adding hills or treadmill incline.
Try a new activity
:
You may discover that you can't walk fast enough to boost your heart rate into the moderate-intensity zone. If so, consider
cycling
, swimming, or using an elliptical trainer to achieve a higher heart rate. If you enjoy basketball, consider installing
a portable hoop
at home or work to practice jump shots or play pickup games with co-workers.
Rowing machines
can also get your heart pumping while targeting both your upper and lower body.
A Word From Verywell
Enjoying moderate physical activity will help keep your body in working order. Don't be distressed if you can only do a little at first. Give yourself time to
build your endurance
. Then make time each day for the activities you like best.

If you've got
a resistance band
, you may wonder exactly what to do with it and whether it's an effective tool for strengthening your body.
The band is great for adding a different type of resistance than you get from
dumbbells
. Because there's tension on the band throughout the entire movement, you'll fire up different
muscle fibers
, always a great idea when you're
building strength
.
With these exercises, you'll hit all the major muscle groups using the resistance band to
build strength and endurance
in your entire body.
Safety and Precautions
Resistance bands
can break if they are damaged, causing potential injury. Be sure your resistance bands are free from defects and are anchored securely—such as on a
weight bench
—during use.
Do not perform any movements that cause pain or discomfort. Be sure you know how to properly perform each exercise with correct form. A personal trainer can assist you if you are unsure. See your doctor if you have any medical issues or conditions.
Overview
Level
: Beginner to advanced
Equipment needed
: At least one resistance band. It's great to have a variety of bands if you can so you can switch them up as needed.
What to Expect
: Warm up with dynamic movements before beginning. Use a tension level that is challenging for you and vary your bands accordingly. Beginners should aim for one set of 12 to 16 reps; intermediates can aim for two sets of 16 reps; advanced exercisers can try three or more sets of 16 reps.
Warm-Up
Warm up with some light cardio to increase blood flow—a few minutes pedaling on an
under desk bike
or jumping rope—then proceed with dynamic movements that mimic the types of movements you will perform during this workout. Examples include arm swings, wall angels, bodyweight squats, bodyweight lunges with hip openers, and gate openers.
10 Best Warm-Up Exercises
The Workout
One thing to keep in mind is that some exercises will require different levels of tension. For example, you may be able to use a heavier band for exercises like chest presses or biceps curls. For that reason, having a variety of bands will allow you to get the most out of this workout.
Another thing to note is that you may need to adjust your hand position or the position of your body to get the most tension out of each move. If anything feels too easy, try using a heavier band with more tension.
Complete between one to three or more sets of 12 to 16 reps, depending on your fitness level and time constraints.
Resistance Band Workout for the Lower Body
One Arm Chest Press
The one-arm chest press is perfect for working not only the
chest muscles
but the core as well since you have to hold your body steady as you move your arm through the exercise.
Safety Tip
Don't twist your hips or allow your back to arch or hyperextend. Brace your core and focus on moving only your arm.
How To Do it Right
Wrap the band around a sturdy object behind you and loop one handle through the other.
Hold the end in the left hand and step away from the anchor point until there's tension on the band.
Begin the movement with the left arm bent, ​the band coming under the arm, and the elbow bent at 90 degrees, palm facing down.
Squeeze the chest to press the left arm out in front of you. Come back to start and repeat for 16 reps on each side.
You can also do this exercise in a superset with the one-arm fly exercise, alternating each exercise.
One Arm Rotating Chest Fly
The one-arm rotating chest fly is another excellent move targeting the outer part of the chest and the core.
Safety Tip
Your feet should pivot with you as you rotate through the movement.
How To Do It Right
Wrap the band around a sturdy object behind you and loop one handle through the other.
Stand with the left side facing the anchor point, arms straight out to the sides and feet about hip distance apart, and hold the handle in the left hand.
Stand far enough away that there's tension on the band. Rotate the left hand towards the right hand, keeping the arms very straight.
Try to touch the left fingers to the right, feeling the exercise on the left side of the chest, shoulder, and arm.
Release and repeat for all reps on the left side, then switch sides. 16 reps and switch sides.
Lat Pulls With Resistance Bands
Verywell / Ben Goldstein
Lat pulls are another great exercise, this one
working the lats
, the muscles on either side of the back. You really have to focus on this one to make it work.
Safety Tip
Avoid this movement if you have shoulder impingement or experience any discomfort.
How To Do It Right
Stand or sit and hold a band in both hands above your head.
Start with your hands a few inches apart. You may need to adjust them to change the tension.
Keeping the left hand in place, squeeze the back to pull the right elbow toward the ribcage.
Return to start and repeat for 16 reps before switching sides.
Upper Back Squeeze
Hero Images / Getty Images
The upper back squeeze exercise is perfect for working the posture muscles of the upper back. You'll need to adjust the distance of your hands to make this one harder or easier.
Safety Tip
Move in a slow and controlled manner, not allowing the band to snap back. Keep the band in front of your chest and do not hunch your shoulders.
How To Do It Right
Standing or sitting, hold ​the band in the middle, arms straight out in front of you, hands a few inches apart.
Squeeze the shoulder blades together and open the arms out to either side, pulling the band apart and squeezing your shoulder blades.
Return to start and repeat, keeping tension on the band the entire time. Repeat for 16 reps.
One Arm Rear Flies
One arm rear flies are the perfect move for working both the back of the shoulders as well as the muscles between the shoulder blades.
Safety Tip
Keep your spine neutral and brace your core to protect your back.
How To Do It Right
On hands and knees, hold one side of the band in the right hand and grab the other end with the left hand.
Keep the right hand in place as you lift the left arm straight up to shoulder level leading with the elbow and squeezing the back and shoulder.
Adjust hand placement to increase or decrease tension.
Repeat for 16 reps on each side.
Overhead Press
The overhead press targets your shoulder complex to build strength and stability.
Safety Tip
The overhead press is one of the more challenging exercises, and you'll want to be careful with the band here. Taking your band past its furthest tension point can stress the band and cause it to snap. If your band is tight, try doing this one arm at a time with the band secured under one foot.
How To Do It Right
Place band under both feet if you have an easier band, one foot if it's tighter.
Hold the handles in both hands and begin the move with the arms bent in the 'goal post,' wrists straight, and abs in.
Contract the shoulders to straighten arms up and lower back down.
Complete 16 reps.
One Arm Triceps Extensions
This simple triceps extension is perfect for working the muscles in the back of the arms.
Safety Tip
Keep the shoulders down throughout the movement and concentrate on squeezing the triceps muscles.
How To Do It Right
Hold the band in both hands at shoulder level with the right arm bent so that it's in front of the chest, left arm straight out.
Keeping the left arm straight to hold tension on the hand, contract the triceps to straighten the right arm.
Return to start and repeat before switching sides.
Complete 16 reps on each side.
Band Biceps Curls
SolStock / Getty Images
Biceps curls are a classic arm exercise and the band adds a little more depth to the exercise. You really have to use your stabilizer muscles to keep the arm steady as you curl the band up and down.
Safety Tip
Do not use your hips or swing your body and keep your spine neutral. People often tend to hyperextend their backs to move the weight. If the weight is too heavy, decrease the resistance.
How To Do It Right
Stand on the band and hold handles with palms facing out.
Keeping abs in and knees slightly bent, bend arms and bring palms toward shoulders in a bicep curl.
Position feet wider for more tension.
Return to start and repeat for 16 reps.
How to Use Resistance Band Workouts for Strength and Muscular Endurance
Side Step Squat
Verywell / Ben Goldstein
Side steps squats are great for the glutes, the outer thighs, and the quads. Remember, when you squat, send the hips behind you so the knees don't go forward.
How to Do It Right
Stand on the band with feet together, keeping tension on the band by holding a half-bicep curl.
Step to the right as far as you can and lower into a squat.
Step the left foot in and continue stepping to the right with a squat for the length of the room before switching sides.
Continue pulling on the band to add tension.
Band Lunges
The band makes an excellent tool for adding resistance to traditional lunges. As a bonus, you'll also get a little isolation work on the biceps.
Safety Tip
Move slowly and with control, bracing your core and balancing throughout.
How To Do It Right
Stand with right leg forward, left leg back, and band positioned under right leg.
Keep the tension on the band by bending elbows, and lowering into a lunge until both knees are at 90 degrees.
Return to start and repeat for 16 reps on each side.
You may need to adjust the tension on the band, holding it closer to your foot, for example, to keep the intensity up.
Criss Cross Outer Thigh
The
criss-cross
outer thigh is an excellent move for targeting the glutes, hips, and, of course, the outer thighs. You might want to use a band with heavier tension for this exercise.
Safety Tip
Avoid this exercise if it aggravates your knees.
How To Do It Right
Lie down with the legs up, band looped around the feet.
Criss-cross the band for added tension and pull the elbows down to the floor.
Keep the elbows down and the upper body relaxed as you open the feet, concentrating on squeezing the outer thighs.
Come back to start and repeat for 16 reps.
Glute Kickback
Nastasic / Getty Images
The glute kickback is just what it sounds like, a challenging move
targeting your rear
.
Safety Tip
Getting into the correct position can be tricky, and you'll want to ensure the band is secure around your foot, so the band doesn't snap back.
How To Do It Right
Get on your hands and knees and wrap a resistance band around the right foot.
Hold the handles in each hand and begin the move with the right knee bent and flex the foot while extending the right leg straight back, squeezing the glutes.
Repeat for 16 reps on each side.
Make sure you keep your foot flexed to avoid the band snapping back.
Cool Down
Cool down with
gentle stretching
and/or light cardio.

How Much Exercise Is Needed to Lose Weight?
Why Exercise Is Important to Weight Loss
How to Create an Exercise Routine
Do Not Forget Nutrition
Frequently Asked Questions
Exercise is one of the first things people think of when they hear the word “weight loss.” After all, exercising is almost always part of a weight-loss regimen because it’s one of the fastest ways to reduce the number on the scale, explains Bill Daniels, CSCS, CPT, the founder of Beyond Fitness.
There are so many other reasons to exercise that have nothing to do with weight loss: improving your mood and reducing the risk of a myriad of diseases including heart disease, diabetes, and even some cancers.
Exercise also increases strength, mobility, endurance, and stamina. Plus, it helps us move better, breathe better, and improve visceral (organ) health.
If you are considering exercise to lose weight, you may wonder how much you need daily or weekly to drop those pounds. Here is what you should know about exercising for weight loss, including tips on creating a personalized exercise routine.
How Much Exercise Do You Need to Lose Weight?
To lose weight, it is recommended to get 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity, 75 minutes of vigorous aerobic activity, or a combination of the two each week. Guidelines suggest you spread out this exercise during the week. Greater amounts of exercise will provide even greater health benefits.
The American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommend adults get at least 30 minutes of
moderate-intensity
aerobic activity five days per week or more. If you prefer more
vigorous
activity per week, three or more 20-minute sessions (60 minutes) will help you meet your goal.
The ACSM and CDC also recommend engaging in strength training activities a minimum of twice weekly. These activities should hit all of the major muscle groups, working the
upper body
,
lower body
, and
core
.
To reduce your body weight by 5% or more or to
maintain your recent weight loss
, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services indicates that a minimum of 300 minutes of moderate-intensity activity weekly is needed.
If you modestly (not drastically) reduce your
calorie intake
in addition to exercise, this rate of physical activity per week can improve your weight-loss results. Of course, it depends on your starting baseline, changes in dietary habits, and your response to these exercises and dietary changes, says Jason Machowsky, RD, CSSD, a sports dietitian and registered clinical exercise physiologist at Hospital for Special Surgery's Tisch Sports Performance Center.
Once you've reached your goal weight, the CDC suggests continuing to get at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity per week, 75 minutes of vigorous activity, or a mixture of the two.
However, remember this amount varies by person. Some people may need more exercise to maintain their weight.
Daily Exercise Guide for Weight Loss
Weight loss is achieved through the basic means of calories in (consumed) versus calories out (burned), explains Jennifer Sobel, NASM-certified personal trainer. In other words, if you consume fewer calories than you’ve burned in a day, you will achieve weight loss.
“One of the biggest issues is that people often wind up eating more because they think that if they exercise that day it entitles them to eat more food because they burn more calories,” Sobel says. “The thing is, we often burn a lot [fewer] calories exercising than we think, and it’s not hard to eat those equivalent calories we burned off in a workout, and then some.”
Jennifer Sobel, NASM-CPT
We often burn a lot [fewer] calories exercising than we think, and it’s not hard to eat those equivalent calories we burned off in a workout, and then some.
— Jennifer Sobel, NASM-CPT
If you are hoping to lose weight, aiming to lose 1 to 2 pounds per week is a
healthy weight-loss goal
.
Losing 1 pound of weight generally requires burning about 3,500 calories.
But keep in mind that trying to lose 1 pound of fat with exercise alone can be difficult and time-consuming for some. You may want to
combine diet and exercise
to reach the right calorie deficit for your weight loss.
How Much Exercise Is Needed to Lose Weight?
Because the road to weight loss can look a little different for every individual, the best way to determine how much exercise you need to support your weight-loss efforts is to first calculate your
basal metabolic rate
, or BMR, Sobel says.
Your BMR measures the calories your body needs to perform basic functions like breathing, circulation, and cell production. Once you determine how much of a caloric deficit you need each day to reach your weight-loss goals, you can create an exercise regimen that affords you this deficit.
Why Exercise Is Important to Weight Loss
Not only does exercise burn calories and help you create the daily deficit to yield results, it also helps build muscle and reduce body fat, explains Daniels.
“Muscle uses more energy than fat, which means that the more muscle you have on your body, the more calories your body will naturally burn [even when not working out],” he says.
Additionally, research found that muscle tissue contributes to an estimated 20% of total calories burned daily versus 5% for fat tissue.
So, in addition to exercise creating a calorie deficit that helps you lose weight, building muscle can assist in burning more calories during periods of rest.
Cardio and Strength Training for Fat Loss: Why You Should Do Both
How to Create an Exercise Routine
The ideal exercise routine for you may look different than that of your friend, colleague, or neighbor. These tips can help you create an exercise routine that yields weight loss in a safe and healthy manner.
Choose Activities You Enjoy
The best way to establish a fitness routine you will commit to is to choose an activity you enjoy doing.
“Forcing yourself to do an activity you don’t enjoy will always be an uphill battle and will make it much more likely that you’ll eventually quit,” says Sobel.
Think about activities you most enjoyed throughout your life—especially as a child—whether playing a sport, gardening, landscaping, or going for a jog, she adds.
“Expand your mind around what exercise is and think of it more as being active rather than exercising,” Sobel suggests. “Focus on enjoyment first and you’ll naturally hit your goals.”
Getting Your Spouse or Partner to Exercise With You
Start Simple and Progress Slowly
Your exercise routine should be something you can maintain—not something that wears you out and makes you want to take long breaks. There is no rush to intensify your exercise routine, and doing so can lead to injuries, Sobel warns.
“Whatever activity you choose, think about progressing slowly from week to week,” she says. “Increasing by 20% is a good guide. For example, if you walk 1 mile in week one, walk 1.2 miles in week two.”
10 Reasons People Do Not Exercise Consistently
Cross-Train
Cross-training
, or switching up your exercise routine frequently to establish balance and strength in your body can help boost weight loss, improve your total fitness, and even reduce your risk of injury.
“If you walk as your primary source of exercise, try adding some strength training as well, or, if you strength train, incorporate some yoga for flexibility,” says Sobel. “Doing multiple types of activities will minimize the risk of injury and help ensure your body is balanced and fit.”
How to Run Longer Without Burnout or Fatigue
Do Not Forget Nutrition
Eating a nutrient-dense diet is an important part of any
weight-loss regimen
. Eating whole foods rich in vitamins, minerals, and nutrients helps keep you healthy and provides the fuel needed to increase energy during workouts, notes Daniels.
He recommends eating plenty of vegetables, fresh whole fruits, quality sources of protein, and avoiding processed foods. He also recommends drinking adequate water to prevent dehydration. The goal is to ensure you eat a nutritious, balanced diet to fuel your body during exercise and daily activities.
7-Day Healthy and Balanced Meal Plan Ideas: Recipes & Prep
A Word From Verywell
If trying to reach your exercise goal sounds overwhelming, don't worry. Your workout plan doesn't have to be perfect to be effective. And setting up a workout plan is easier than it sounds.
Following basic exercise recommendations can provide a framework for finding out how much exercise you need per day to lose weight. Just remember consistency matters.
If you’re unsure where to begin, use a basic
weekly workout plan
to make sure the time you spend working out is time that helps you lose weight. You also may benefit from talking to a healthcare provider, especially if you are new to exercise. In addition, seek out a
certified personal trainer
who can help you develop a
workout plan
that helps you meet your goals.
Frequently Asked Questions
How much do you need to workout per day to lose weight?
If you are active everyday with activities or if your job requires you to move around a lot, then you’re going to need less exercise each day than someone who sits at a seat for 12 hours per day. You may want to start with 20 to 30 minutes 2 to 3 days each week and then expanding to longer and more frequent workouts as you gain confidence and strength.

How to Create a Calorie Deficit for Weight Loss
Which is more important to weight loss, cardio or resistance training?
The answer really depends on your weight loss, goals, and body type. However, some experts recommend resistance training  because building muscle burns more fat and calories, even if you are at rest. The best exercise programs, though, contain both cardio and resistance training.
Learn More:
What Is Resistance Training and Why It is Important
How much exercise should a beginner do per day?
The ACSM recommends a minimum of 30 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise, 5 days a week.
If you’re just starting out, you can start with less frequency. The key is consistency—even if that involves 20 minutes on 3 days a week. In short, some exercise is better than no exercise.

Can 10-minute workouts spaced throughout the day be effective in losing weight?
Some movement is always better than no movement. In fact, research has found that short bouts of exercise throughout the day can be beneficial. Each burst of exercise is burning calories and if you add them all up at the end of the day, they could amount to the same as if you did one single exercise for a longer period of time.

Resistance Training Safety Tips
Frequently Asked Questions
Whether you’re looking to add strength training to your gym routine or thinking of working out at home, resistance training improves muscle strength and tone and protects your joints from injury. It also is a relatively accessible option that can help you reach your weight-management goals as well as maintain flexibility and balance.
These benefits are important, especially as you get older. While increased strength and mobility are helpful to all ages, you want to be sure you are fighting muscle loss as you age. Read on to learn what resistance training is and how to get started.
What Is Resistance Training?
Resistance training is a form of exercise intended to
increase muscular strength
and endurance. It involves exercising muscles using some form of resistance. This resistance could be weights, bands, or even
your own bodyweight
working against gravity.
When doing resistance training—which is sometimes called strength training or weight training—you can focus on specific results, such as joint stability, muscular endurance, increased muscle size, strength, and
power
.
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), you should do muscle-strengthening activities of moderate or greater intensity, two or more days a week. These exercises should involve all major muscle groups. For children, the CDC recommends three hours of resistance training per week.
Benefits of Resistance Training
Resistance training is intended to increase muscular strength and endurance, but it has a wide variety of health benefits, too. Here are a few benefits you may experience from incorporating resistance training into your workout routine.
Resistance Training: Why Is it Important for You?
Boost Metabolism and Reduce Body Fat
Resistance training could be helpful for your weight-loss goals. Studies have found that resistance training can help boost your metabolism. In fact, one study estimated that nine months of resistance training was enough to significantly increase your resting metabolic rate.
This means you can significantly change your metabolism in under a year by doing resistance training consistently. Further studies indicate that resistance training was even more effective for improving your metabolism than aerobic exercise. This fact can be helpful if you want to change your routine and try something new.
While studies suggest resistance training can be effective for improving metabolism, it doesn’t mean cardio is ineffective. Try incorporating a combination of both forms of exercise for the best results.
The Fast Metabolism Diet: Is It Right for You?
Increase Bone Density and Improve Balance
Your bones can benefit from resistance training, too. Studies have shown that doing resistance training consistently can maintain or increase bone mass and density.
Additionally, resistance training can help improve balance and stability. This is especially important as you age.
For instance, one study on balance improvement included 50 older adults who were assigned to either a training group or a control group. Throughout the study, the training group performed leg extensions and curl exercises over 12 weeks. At the end of that time, researchers noted that the training group had significantly improved balance compared with those in the control group.
5 Balance Exercises to Boost Stability
Improve Mental Health
Your physical health is not the only reason to start working out. Healthcare providers often recommend exercise for improving mental health, too. Your mental and emotional health is vital to your quality of life and day-to-day experience.
A study on improving the quality of life in older adults found that resistance training boosted mental, emotional, social function, and physical function.
Further studies found that resistance training can help alleviate
depression
symptoms, even if the exercise is mild enough to have no clear improvement in physical strength.
Resistance training can also help relieve general feelings of anxiety and worry. This means that even a small amount of resistance training consistently can improve your mental and emotional health and act as a stress reliever.
5 Mental Health Benefits of Strength Training
Build Muscle Mass
Some people's goals for resistance training may be to build muscle mass in a process known as
muscle hypertrophy
. This goal is for people who want to build muscle as well as older adults who want to minimize muscle loss, also known as muscle atrophy.
Regardless of your goal, resistance training is an excellent option for building muscle mass. According to studies, the best way to build muscle is to focus on mechanical tension and metabolic stress. Persistence in this type of training regimen is essential to getting results.
How to Build and Maintain Muscle
Improve Muscle Strength and Endurance
Improving the strength and endurance of your muscles isn’t just for show; it also can help keep your muscles healthy and improve your quality of life. Muscle strength and endurance are important in your daily life, especially as you get older.
Resistance training can help your muscles remain healthy and functional. For instance, your muscles help you do small tasks, such as lifting things, opening containers, or even being active for longer hours.
According to one study, the amount of resistance training you do is directly proportional to muscular strength and endurance. If you want to improve your strength or endurance, increase the amount of resistance training you do either by expanding how long you do it or how often.
Strength Training Tips and Workouts
Reduces the Risk of Sports Injuries
Resistance training workouts for children decrease rates of fracture, musculotendinous, and muscle injuries associated with playing sports. Regular resistance training may help children and adolescents avoid muscle injury when participating in athletics.
Of course, the workout routine for a child would not be the same as it would be for an adult. Consult a personal trainer when developing a workout routine for a child or adolescent.

Increases Self-Esteem
While resistance training can help you tone your muscles and even increase their size if that is your goal, it also can help you build confidence and boost your self-esteem. Researchers note that engaging in resistance training can raise self-esteem, particularly in women.
In fact, in one study of college women, researchers noted that participants reported feeling invigorated after a resistance-training workout. They also indicated they had improved self-concept, self-esteem, and self-efficacy, as well as improved overall mood.
Resistance Training: Why Is it Important for You?
How to Get Started With Resistance Training
According to the CDC, you should try incorporating resistance training into your workouts consistently. Because you can use your body weight to begin or even a simple set of dumbbells, you do not have to join a gym or hire a personal trainer to get started.
You need to make sure you are using proper form in your workouts. Proper form can ensure you get the most from your workout and decrease your risk of injury.
If you have a medical condition or a disability or are starting an exercise routine, talk to a healthcare provider for advice. They can provide insight into what is best for you given your medical history.
It is also important to note that you do not have to buy equipment to get started with resistance training. You can use your body weight for exercises like
pushups
,
squats
, and
planks
. Or, you can use household items to add more weight like gallon jugs of water, soup cans in a canvas bag, or a backpack with an unopened bag of flour. Once you've achieved a certain level of expertise, you may invest in equipment like
adjustable dumbbells
.
Resistance Training Equipment
Although equipment is not required when getting started with resistance training, here are some examples of equipment you can use:
Barbells
Dumbbells
Kettlebells
Resistance bands
Suspension trainers
Pull-up bars
As for the weight you begin with, some people like to start by using their body weight before adding free weights or other equipment. Here are two exercises that do not require special equipment recommended by Katie Pierson, a certified personal trainer and group fitness instructor.
Which Resistance Bands Should You Use?
Bodyweight Squat
This exercise engages your glutes, hamstrings, quadriceps, calves, and core. Pierson recommends performing two to three sets with 10 to 12 repetitions per set. Here is how you complete a bodyweight squat:
Begin with your feet slightly wider than your hips and toes slightly turned out.
Engage your glutes and lower down, as if you were sitting in a chair.
Make sure that your knees do not go past your toes.
Stop at the bottom of the move with your hips slightly higher than your knees.
Press through your heels as you come back to a standing position.
30-Day Squat Challenge
Pushups
Pushups engage your chest, triceps, and core. Pierson recommends doing two to three sets with five to eight reps per set. There are pushup variations depending on your fitness level. Pierson recommends starting on your knees if you are a beginner. Here is how to do a
pushup
from your knees:
Start on your hands and knees and walk your hands forward.
Stop when your abs engage, and a diagonal line forms from the back of your knees to your shoulders.
Place your hands slightly wider than your shoulders.
Lower your chest slowly toward the floor. At the bottom of the rep, your elbows should form a line with your wrists.
How to Do Push-Ups: Proper Form, Variations, and Common Mistakes
Resistance Training Safety Tips
Before starting a new workout program, always talk to a healthcare professional for guidance on what is right for you given your fitness level and medical history. It is also essential to stay safe and responsible when working out. Here are some tips on how to work out safely:
Use proper form
: If you cannot use proper form, consider lowering the weight or resistance. If this is impossible or you still can’t use the appropriate form, consider talking to a personal trainer about trying an altered form of the exercise.
Exercise safely
:
Never use more weight or resistance than you can handle at your fitness level. Using weights that are too heavy can lead to improper form and injury.
Bring water
: Drinking water can help you avoid dehydration and fatigue. Not all gyms offer drinking fountains or have water options.
Find a workout buddy
:
A workout buddy can help increase motivation and accountability but can also help if you injure yourself or need a spotter.
Stop if you experience pain
:
If you feel pain or discomfort, stop working out and talk to a healthcare provider. You also should seek medical attention if you injure yourself during a workout.
Principle of Specificity in Athletic Training
A Word From Verywell
Resistance training provides a wealth of benefits. Aside from building muscle tone and strength, it also improves mental health, relieves stress, and increases balance. It also can help with everyday activities like carrying groceries, climbing stairs, or working in your garden. For these reasons, you should consider adding resistance training to your routine, especially if you want to boost your metabolism and increase bone density.
Talk with your healthcare provider first to find out what is right for you given your current fitness level and medical history. It also may be helpful to talk to a personal trainer for advice on proper form if you are starting resistance training. You do not have to join a gym or work with a trainer to benefit from resistance training.

Week 5 and Beyond
One of the easiest parts of starting an exercise program is deciding to do it. Usually, something inspires you to make a change: Maybe you tried on a pair of jeans that were too tight or there's an upcoming event—a reunion, wedding, or party—where you will see people you haven't seen in a while.
Whatever it is, you're
motivated
and excited, and the fantasy of a revamped you is enough to inspire you. It's the start of your exercise program that can be tricky. Here's how to harness that energy to get started and follow through, making your wellness goal a reality.
Getting Started
Planning and preparation are important when you're getting started with exercise, but to be successful, you also need momentum—and the more you can create, the easier it is to stay motivated.
The best way to build and maintain momentum is with action. While it's great to ponder
your weight loss
and general fitness goals, focusing on your exercise commitment and finding success in the workout can help motivate you to keep at it. There's something about just doing it—before too much contemplation drains your energy.
But before you jump into your workouts, there are a few things you should do to prepare.
Get Your Doctor's Clearance
If you have any injuries, illnesses, or conditions, or are on any medications, talk to your doctor to make sure it's OK to exercise. Some medications may affect your heart rate.
It may be helpful to make an appointment with a
personal trainer
to guide you in using
proper form
for different exercises. When you are new to exercise, it can be beneficial to have someone watch your body to ensure you aren't moving incorrectly.
Prepare to Work Out
When it comes to slimming down and toning up, there are two key types of workouts: cardio, which burns calories by raising your heart rate, and strength training, which builds
lean muscle
that boosts metabolism, the rate at which you burn calories. Together, this pairing can produce powerful
weight-loss results
.
The cardio workouts included in this beginner workout plan are designed to be done on any cardio machine (e.g.,
treadmill
,
elliptical
,
stationary bike
, or
rowing machine
). If you prefer other activities (for instance,
running
, cycling, fitness videos, group fitness classes, or even
battle ropes
), choose another option as a substitute.
Gather Your Workout Equipment
For the beginner strength workouts, you'll need the following equipment:
Exercise balls
: These are some of the best tools to strengthen the abs and back and increase stability. They come in different sizes to accommodate your height. When you sit on one, there should be a 90-degree angle at your hip and knee joints.
Exercise mat
: Yoga mats are thinner and have more gripping ability to hold poses. Thicker mats are best for
Pilates
and
abdominal exercises
because they cushion the spine while lying on your back.
Various weighted dumbbells
: Some exercises require heavier weights while others need lighter weights. Try to have a range of dumbbells including a light set (3 to 5 pounds for women, 5 to 8 pounds for men), a medium set (5 to 10 pounds for women, 10 to 15 pounds for men), and a heavy set (10 to 20 pounds for women, 15 to 30 pounds for men).
How to Do a Beginner Workout at Home
Learn the Basics
When beginning basic workouts for beginners, start with a lighter weight and perform a set. Continue adding weight until the exercise feels challenging but you can do the desired number of reps with
good form
, which includes moving slowly enough that you're using muscle—not momentum—to lift the weight.
The last rep should be challenging but not impossible, and you should be able to keep solid form.
Beginners Guide to Sets, Repetitions, and Rest Intervals
Record Your Measurements
This isn't a must, but tracking your progress has many benefits, especially if your goal is to
lose weight
. In addition to keeping you accountable to yourself and committed to achieving your
goals
, it makes it more likely you'll reach—and even surpass—them.
Weighing yourself and keeping an
exercise journal
are two ways to track your progress, but
taking your measurements
(chest, arms, waist, hips) will give you more information. For example, you may
lose inches
even if your scale weight doesn't change. In that case, monitoring your measurements every few weeks can reassure you that you are, in fact, making progress.

Beginner Cardio Workout
Choose any cardio machine—elliptical,
recumbent bike
, or treadmill—set it on a manual mode (versus pre-set programs), and find your warm-up pace.
For the bulk of the workout, you'll change the settings (including incline, speed, and resistance) every few minutes to work at a
moderate level
, ending with a cooldown. Throughout, you'll use the
perceived exertion (PE) scale
to gauge the intensity you're exercising from 1 to 10, to work at the suggested levels.

Beginner Flexibility Workout
Cardio and strength training may be the cornerstones of any solid workout program, but you don't want to end your workout without stretching.
Stretching when your muscles are warm has many benefits—from building greater flexibility to offering relaxation and stress relief.
The great thing about stretching is that you don't have to spend a lot of time to get the benefits. This
total-body flexibility workout
, which includes eight stretches, can be done in as little as 2 minutes.
Week 1
Now that you've completed your first workout, it's time to plan your first week of your workouts for beginners. Here's an idea of how to schedule your cardio and
strength-training
activity.
Day 1
Perform the 20-minute cardio routine outlined above.
Day 2
For this basic
strength-training workout
, you'll do 1 set of 15 reps of each of the nine exercises listed below, resting briefly between exercises as needed.
This beginner workout plan targets all muscles in your body, including your chest, shoulders, arms, back, hips, glutes, and thighs. It's short and simple—a great way for beginners to get started with
strength training
.
Assisted lunges
Modified pushups
Ball squats
Overhead presses
Dumbbell rows
Biceps curls
Triceps extensions
Crunches on the ball
Back extensions
It's normal to be sore after lifting weights for the first time, or if it's been a long time since you've pumped iron. If you find you're extremely sore the next day, take an extra rest day and lighten the weights and intensity on your next workout.
Day 3
Today you'll do the same 20-minute cardio routine as Day 1, followed by 10 lower-body stretches included in this
lower-body stretching workout
.
Day 4
For today's beginner workout, go through the following eight
yoga poses
, holding each for 3 to 5 breaths. Do the workout anytime you like—it will refresh you in the morning and help you unwind before bed.
Take your time performing each exercise and focus on your breath. Breathe in and out through the nose, taking air in through the back of your throat. Do each pose at least once.
Standing
cat stretch
Sun salutation
Hanging
back stretch
Warrior I
Warrior II
Modified triangle
Spine twist
Corpse pose
Day 5
Today's workout for beginners involves basic strength training you did on Day 2. Perform 1 set of 15 reps for each exercise, resting briefly between moves as needed. If you feel that's too easy, add another set or use heavier weights.
Day 6
Today's cardio workout involves
interval training
where you alternate work sets (working at a higher intensity) with rest sets using the perceived exertion scale to monitor your intensity. This beginner workout can be done on any cardio machine.
5 minutes
:
Warm up at an easy pace (PE: 4).
3 minutes
: Rest set: Increase speed and resistance/incline to a moderate level (PE: 5).
1 minute
:
Work set: Increase incline and resistance by 1 percent to 5 percent to raise the intensity level (PE: 7).
3 minutes
: Rest set (PE: 5).
1 minute
: Work set (PE: 7).
3 minutes
: Rest set (PE: 5).
5 minutes
: Cooldown (PE: 4).
Recap
Day 1
: 20-minute cardio routine
Day 2
: Basic strength-training workout
Day 3
: 20-minute cardio routine
Day 4
: Basic yoga
Day 5
:
Basic strength-training workout
Day 6
: Beginner intervals
On Day 1, you completed your first workout. During week 1, you got through a full week of cardio, strength, and
flexibility workouts
. Now you're ready to build on that success with progressively more challenging workouts.
Schedules are only suggestions. You may want less cardio, more rest days, or to stick with the same workouts for more than a week. Use this program as a place to start and adjust the schedule so it works for you.
Week 2
Continue with the same beginner workout plan as last week but progress with a few small changes to keep you challenged.
For cardio, do the same workouts with an added 5 minutes to build endurance and increase your exercise time.
5 minutes:
Warm up at an easy-moderate pace (PE: 4).
6 minutes
: Increase speed, incline, and/or resistance so you're just out of your comfort zone, but still able to talk (PE: 5); this is your baseline.
3 minutes
:
Increase your speed, incline, and/or resistance until you're working harder than baseline (PE: 6).
4 minutes
: Reduce your speed, incline, and/or resistance back to baseline (PE: 5).
2 minutes
:
Increase your speed, incline, and/or resistance until you're working harder than baseline (PE: 6).
5 minutes
:
Reduce speed, incline, and/or resistance back to a moderate level (PE: 4).
Your strength-training workouts include the same exercises, but you'll be doing 2 sets of each for added intensity. Interval training increases by 4 minutes, to 25 minutes.
Modify this beginner workout plan as needed for your fitness goals.
Day 1
: 25-minute cardio session
Day 2
: Basic strength training; perform each exercise for 2 sets of 15 reps, resting 20 to 30 seconds between sets.
Day 3
:
Beginner intervals level 2
Day 4
:
Basic yoga
Day 5
:
Basic strength training; perform each exercise for 2 sets of 15 reps, resting 20 to 30 seconds between sets.
Day 6
: 25-minute cardio session
Week 3
This week, the changes to your beginner workouts are more drastic with higher-intensity cardio, a more challenging strength routine, as well as a new
yoga workout
to try.
Your cardio workouts go up from 25 minutes to 30 minutes and the interval workout takes you to higher levels of intensity. The strength workout includes new exercises and heavier weights. A new yoga routine is performed on an exercise ball for extra support and challenge.
Remember, if these changes feel too fast, keep the same beginner workouts for as long as you need to.
Day 1
:
30-minute cardio
session
Day 2
: Beginner total-body strength level 2; perform each exercise for 1 set of 15 reps.
Day 3
: Beginner intervals level 3
Day 4
:
Yoga on the ball
Day 5
: Beginner total-body strength level 2; perform each exercise for 1 set of 15 reps.
Day 6
: 30-minute cardio session
Week 4
With three weeks of workouts under your belt, you'll maintain your previous schedule with a few small changes to keep things interesting.
Continue your 30-minute cardio workouts for beginners, but try a new interval routine that includes making more frequent changes. Your strength workout remains the same, but you'll add a second set to challenge your muscles and continue progressing.
The American College of Sports Medicine suggests aiming for your weight and reps to feel like an 8 out of 10, with 0 being no effort and 10 being a maximum effort.
Day 1
: 30-minute cardio session
Day 2
: Beginner total-body strength level 2; perform each exercise for 2 sets of 15 reps, resting 20 to 30 seconds between sets.
Day 3
: Interval workout level 3
Day 4
: Yoga on the ball
Day 5
: Beginner total-body strength level 2; perform each exercise for 2 sets of 15 reps, resting 20 to 30 seconds between sets.
Day 6
: 30-minute cardio session
Week 5 and Beyond
Change things up in your beginner workout plan to continue making progress. In exercise lingo, it's called
exercise adaptation
. Change can come in a variety of ways—modifying weights, repetitions, intensity, speed, duration, variations on exercises, and more. You only have to make one change at a time to make a difference and continue reaching new goals.

Evaluation
Body Composition Testing
Cardiovascular Endurance Testing
Strength and Endurance Testing
The Bottom Line
A fitness test, also known as a fitness assessment, comprises a series of exercises that help evaluate your overall health and physical status. A wide range of standardized tests is used for these exams, including body composition tests, cardio stress tests, endurance tests, and range of motion tests.
The tests are considered the starting point for designing an appropriate exercise program for general health and fitness purposes.
They are meant to ensure you won't be at risk of harm and provide the trainer with the insights needed to establish clear and effective fitness goals.
General Health Evaluation
Before starting a fitness program, it is important to share your medical history with your trainer and get the necessary approval from a healthcare provider to proceed.
Most fitness specialists will use one or more screening tools to help determine your baseline health. This may include obtaining vital sign measurements such as height, weight,
resting heart rate (RHR)
, and resting blood pressure (RBP).
Many trainers will also use a
physical activity readiness questionnaire (PAR-Q)
comprising seven or more questions about your general health.
Among the questions, you may​ be asked about the medications you take, any problems you have with dizziness or pain, or any medical condition that may impair your ability to exercise.
Body Composition Testing
Body composition
describes the components that comprise your total body weight, including your muscles, bones, and fat. The most common methods for estimating body composition include the following:
Bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA)
: During
BIA
, electrical signals are sent from electrodes through the soles of your feet to your abdomen to estimate your body composition.
Body mass index (BMI)
:
BMI
is a generalized calculation of body fat based on height and weight.
Skinfold measurements
: During
skinfold measurements
, calipers are used to estimate how much body fat there is in a fold of skin.
Body Mass Index (BMI)
is a dated, biased measure that doesn’t account for several factors, such as body composition, ethnicity, race, gender, and age.
Despite being a
flawed measure
, BMI is widely used today in the medical community because it is an inexpensive and quick method for analyzing potential health status and outcomes.
Cardiovascular Endurance Testing
Cardiovascular endurance testing, also known as stress testing, measures how efficiently your heart and lungs work to supply oxygen and energy to your body during physical activity.
Among the three most common tests used:
12-minute run tests
: Performed on a treadmill,
12-minute run tests
compare your pre-exercise heart and respiration rates with your post-exercise heart and respiration rates.
Exercise stress
: Exercise stress testing is also performed on a treadmill or stationary bike and involves using a heart monitor and blood pressure cuff to measure your vital signs during exercise.
VO2 max testing
: Performed on a treadmill or stationary bike,
V02 max testing
uses a breathing device to measure your maximum rate of oxygen consumption during an activity
Some trainers will incorporate exercises such as sit-ups or push-ups to measure how you respond to specific exercises. These baseline results can be used later to see if your health and fitness levels have improved.
Strength and Endurance Testing
Strength testing measures the maximal amount of force a muscle group can exert at one time.
Muscle endurance
testing, by comparison, measures the length of time a muscle group can contract and release before it fatigues.
The exercises used include the
push-up test
and
core strength and stability test
. Sometimes, a trainer will use a metronome to see how long you can keep up with the rhythm. The results are then compared to people of the same age group and sex to establish your baseline levels.
Strength and endurance tests are valuable as they help the trainer pinpoint which muscle groups are stronger and which are vulnerable and in need of focused attention.
Flexibility Testing
Measuring the
flexibility
of your joints is vital in determining whether you have postural imbalances,
foot instability, or limitations in your range of motion.
Shoulder Flexibility Testing
Sometimes called the zipper test,
shoulder flexibility testing
evaluates the flexibility and mobility of your shoulder joint. Use one hand to reach behind your neck, between your shoulders, while reaching behind your back, toward your shoulders, with the other.
Measure how many far apart your hands are.
Sit-And-Reach Testing
This is used to measure tightness in your lower back and hamstring muscles.
The
sit-and-reach test
is performed on the floor with your legs fully extended. Flexibility is measured by how many inches your hands are from your feet when reaching forward.
Trunk Lift Testing
Trunk lift testing is used to measure tightness in your lower back. It is performed while lying face-down on the floor. With your arms at your side, you would be asked to lift your upper body with just your back muscles. Flexibility is measured by how many inches you can lift yourself off the ground.
The Bottom Line
Fitness testing has many benefits, from helping professionals understand what types of exercise are most safe and most effective for you to helping you measure your fitness progress over time. It can also identify fitness areas that need improvement, allowing for an individualized plan to identify areas of potential for increased fitness. This can help prevent injuries and help maintain your body's overall health. If you're wondering whether fitness testing would benefit you, ask a healthcare provider.
Frequently Asked Questions
What is the main purpose of fitness testing?
Fitness testing allows healthcare or fitness professionals to measure specific areas of health and fitness. It establishes a fitness baseline, allowing you to track your fitness gains.
What factors affect fitness testing?
There are a number of variables that affect the results of fitness testing. Your age, gender, and prior exercise routines will affect your fitness test results. In addition, the conditions of an individual test can affect results, for example, weather, time of day, and whether you are hydrated.
How do you improve your fitness testing results?
Consistent exercise is the best way to improve fitness. If you're a beginner, focus on making exercise part of your routine. Design a workout program you are
able to sustain
. As your fitness improves,
add intensity
and endurance to your routine. Ask a healthcare professional or fitness professional for guidance if you need advice.

Flexibility and Range of Motion
Hyper-Flexibility
Benefits of Flexibility
Types of Flexibility Training
Frequently Asked Questions
Flexibility allows your body to move through a wide range of motion for better, more functional movement.
Working to become more flexible has many benefits beyond improving
range of motion
, such as reducing fatigue and improving overall well-being. Many overlook the importance of flexibility, assuming it is only for those looking to boost
sports performance
.
Incorporating flexibility training into your day could improve fitness for everyday activities and enhance overall health. If you frequently experience
muscle fatigue
,
muscle stress
, or
poor joint health
, these could be signs that you could significantly benefit from flexibility exercises.
Here is what you need to know about flexibility and how to make it part of your daily routine.
Flexibility and Range of Motion
Many times people confuse flexibility with
range of motion
. Range of motion is the movement of a joint without pain in all directions possible. Flexibility is the ability of the muscles, ligaments, and tendons to elongate through the range of motion.
Using flexibility exercises to improve your range of motion helps decrease your risk of injuries and avoid tightness and soreness around your joints. Plus, having a good range of motion can impact your other workouts and activities. For instance, you are more likely to use proper form and activate your muscles, making your exercise safer and more effective.
One way to improve flexibility is through regular
stretching exercises
. You should stretch as part of a consistent workout routine, but you should also stretch after exercising.
Even stretching after sitting in your office chair for an extended period is essential.

Hyper-Flexibility
There also is such a thing as being too flexible. This phenomenon is called hyper-flexibility or joint hyper-mobility. Hyper-flexibility could signify a connective tissue disorder, such as Ehlers–Danlos syndrome (EDS). If you can move a joint past a normal range of motion, you might have joint hyper-mobility.
This excessive range of motion can cause joint pain, swelling, joint dislocation, joint cracking, tiredness, and widespread pain. These symptoms typically come on during or after exercise.
If you suspect that you are dealing with hyper-flexibility, speaking with a healthcare provider for a diagnosis and treatment plan is crucial.
Benefits of Flexibility
Poor flexibility can impact your health and well-being in several ways. You may experience muscle fatigue, stress on your muscles, and inadequate joint health. Increasing your flexibility helps you avoid these problems and reap various benefits.
Improved Muscle Condition
One way to reduce injuries and improve the condition of your muscles is through flexibility-enhancing activities like
foam rolling
and dynamic stretching. Foam rolling can help loosen tight muscles and is particularly useful if you have contracted or tight muscles that don't fully release.
When you use a
foam roller
along the length of your muscle, you encourage it to return to its original and intended length. Lengthened muscles that are not tight or contracted will improve your flexibility in the long run.
Stretching increases blood flow to your muscles. This improved circulation nourishes your muscles and helps rid them of waste byproducts. Improved circulation can help shorten your
recovery time
, particularly after a
challenging workout
. This is particularly important if you have experienced injuries like a pulled or strained muscle.
One option is
dynamic stretching
before your workout and foam rolling after. Research shows that dynamic stretching boosts muscle strength and decreases muscle stiffness.
Running Warmups, Cooldowns & Stretching
Better Balance
Having good balance is something many people take for granted. But having good balance can help make you lighter on your feet and improve your athletic performance. It also is imperative as you age because it can help prevent injuries and falls.
Improving flexibility and balance also can help strengthen the core and
improve stability
. One study asked a group of adults over 65 to participate in stretching and mobility exercises twice a week for 12 weeks. They experienced improved balance, which decreased their risk of falls. Participants also showed improved flexibility and lumbar strength.
Reduced Risk of Injury
When combined with exercise
, flexibility can reduce back pain and stiffness.
Aerobic exercise
increases blood flow to soft tissues and muscles while flexibility improves the range of movement for muscles, ligaments, and tendons.
There is less likelihood of injury when muscles and surrounding structures are well-nourished and mobile.
If you want to reduce your risk of injury, stretching the muscles in your back, hamstrings, and hip flexors may help. Stretching can even help you in everyday activities like
walking
, bending, and reaching.
Stretching lengthens muscles and improves blood flow (which promotes recovery and healing), so investing a few minutes in gentle, targeted stretching may pay off in the long run.
10 Soccer Stretches for Your Next Match
Types of Flexibility Training
You can improve flexibility with four stretching exercises: static stretching, dynamic stretching, activated isolated stretching, and
myofascial release
.
Avoid over-stretching. Pushing yourself too hard or trying to stretch beyond your capabilities could work against your progress. Take it slow and steady, and stop if you feel any pain.
Static Stretching
Static stretching means moving into a position that lengthens specific muscles and holding that stretch for 30 seconds, working your way up to 60 to 90 seconds. Move into the stretch and stop when you feel some slight discomfort (not pain). Hold the position there for the desired length of time.
You've overstretched if you feel pain. Bring it back a bit. Move out of the stretch gently. Aim to stretch your major muscles, muscles used during your workout routines, and muscles that need flexibility improvement.
Dynamic Stretching
Dynamic stretching is a movement that stretches your muscles and joints. This type of stretching provides a warmup. It improves power, jump, and
sprint abilities
.
To do a dynamic stretching routine, look to the movements you're preparing for in whatever exercise or sport you're performing. For example, runners may do hip circles,
lunges
, and leg pendulums. Swimmers may do
shoulder rolls
and arm circles.
Activate Your Central Nervous System Before a Workout
Active Isolated Stretching
Active isolated stretching is done by stretching a muscle while simultaneously contracting the opposite muscle, holding it for 2 seconds, and then relaxing. You go a little further into the stretch each time and repeat 8 to 10 times.
Active isolated stretching requires resistance (such as with a
resistance band
or your hands) to contract one muscle. For example, you can
stretch your quads
by starting in a kneeling lunge position. With your hands on your hips, move your front knee forward. In this stretch, you're contracting your
glutes
while stretching your
quadriceps
.
Myofascial Release
Foam rolling is a type of
myofascial release
that targets the fascia, a connective tissue, to increase flexibility and relieve tension. You can use foam rollers on muscles on your legs, arms, and back. For example, to roll your calf, start in a sitting position with the foam roller under your calf. Then move your lower leg back and forth over the roller for 30 to 60 seconds.
A Word From Verywell
Stretching regularly improves flexibility, crucial for joint health and overall well-being. Stretch daily to improve your flexibility, whether with static stretching, dynamic stretching, foam rolling, or a combination of all three.
Stretching multiple times a day, particularly if sitting a lot for work, can be beneficial. Contact a healthcare provider if you have recurring joint pain or muscle fatigue or you notice hyper-flexibility. They can help you determine what is causing your discomfort and offer a treatment plan.

Frequently Asked Questions
The five factors of fitness contribute to physical health and help guide the process of getting fit. You already know that benefits come when you prioritize physical activity. The trick is understanding what health-related fitness is and how to achieve it.
The five components of fitness are the blueprint for the American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) physical activity guidelines and serve as a helpful tool for organizing and executing a well-balanced
workout routine
.
Creating a fitness plan that incorporates these elements can help ensure you get maximum health benefits.
5 Factors of Fitness
Cardiovascular endurance
Muscular strength

Flexibility
Body composition
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) links regular physical activity to a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, some cancers, improved bone health, enhanced mental health, and improved quality of life with age.

Cardiovascular Endurance
Martin Novak / Getty Images
Cardiovascular endurance (
cardiorespiratory endurance
or aerobic fitness) refers to your body's ability to efficiently and effectively intake oxygen and deliver it to your body's tissues through the heart, lungs, arteries, vessels, and veins.
By engaging in health-related fitness exercises that challenge your heart and lungs, you can:
Maintain or improve the efficient delivery and uptake of oxygen to your body's systems
Enhance cellular metabolism
Ease the physical challenges of everyday life
Because heart disease accounts for roughly 630,000 deaths in the United States each year, starting a health-related fitness program that enhances
cardiovascular wellness
is particularly important.
Running
,
walking
,
cycling
,
swimming
,
dancing
,
circuit training
, and
boxing
are a few workouts that can benefit heart health.
The ACSM's physical activity guidelines call for at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity exercise, or 75 minutes of vigorous exercise, each week.
The key, of course, is consistency. It may sound like a lot, but 150 minutes breaks down to just 20 to 30 minutes of exercise daily, five to seven days a week.
Building Cardiovascular Endurance
Muscular Endurance
PeopleImages / Getty Images
Muscular endurance
is one of two factors that contribute to overall muscular health (muscular strength is the other). Think of muscular endurance as a particular muscle group's ability to continuously contract against a given resistance.
Long-distance cycling offers a clear example. To pedal a bike over a long distance, often up steep inclines, cyclists must develop fatigue-resistant muscles in their legs and
glutes
. These are evidence of a high level of muscular endurance.
Likewise, holding a plank to develop core strength is another example of muscular endurance using
isometric exercise
. The longer you can contract your abdominals and keep your body in a steady position the greater endurance you have through your hips, abs, and shoulders.
The extent to which you focus on muscular endurance should be directly related to your health or fitness goals. It's important to realize that muscular endurance is muscle group-specific.
This means you can develop high endurance levels in some muscle groups (like cyclists building endurance in their legs) without necessarily acquiring the same levels in other muscle groups, depending on your needs.
Best Exercises for Core Strength
For Everyday Health
For general health, talk to a healthcare provider to determine what is best for you given your medical history and current fitness level. Everyone's needs and goals are different, so do what is right for you. Some people may want to develop enough endurance to transport groceries from the car to your house. Low-intensity weight-bearing or strength-training workouts will help you build up that endurance.
For Fitness-Related Goals
Suppose you want to become an endurance athlete capable of competing in sports that require continual muscle contraction, such as obstacle course races,
CrossFit
, or cycling. In that case, you'll need a higher level of muscular endurance. You may want to focus more on training regimens that use
high-repetition strength training
and sport-specific activity to make you a better athlete.
Measuring and Improving Muscle Endurance
Muscular Strength

While muscular endurance refers to how fatigue-resistant a particular muscle group is,
muscular strength
refers to the amount of force a specific muscle group can produce in one, all-out effort. In strength-training terms, it's your
one-rep max
.
Like muscular endurance, muscular strength is muscle group-specific. In other words, you may have
strong glutes
but comparatively weak deltoids; or powerful pectoral muscles but comparatively weak
hamstrings
.
Consider Your Health-Related Fitness Goals
Your health-related fitness goals, physical abilities, and limitations determine your training. Keep in mind that everyone is different and will, therefore, have different goals.
For instance, some people may want to be strong enough to lift a heavy box or easily stand up from a chair.
In this instance, enhanced muscular strength may be a byproduct of a workout routine focused on developing muscular endurance.
If, however, you want to develop muscle mass or to be able to
lift heavier weights
at the gym, focus your training regimen on lifting heavy weights.
To improve muscle strength
: Use heavier weights with fewer reps, causing your muscles to fatigue with each set.
To improve muscle endurance
: Use lighter weights and higher reps to increase endurance over time.
It's possible to improve muscular strength and endurance at the same time. You can do this in conjunction with cardiovascular training. For instance,
circuit-training routines
that combine strength exercises and cardio into a single training routine can make your health-related fitness program more efficient.
ACSM's guidelines state that adults should perform strength-training exercises two to three days a week using a variety of movements and equipment to target all major muscle groups.
Flexibility
Hero Images / Getty Images
Flexibility
refers to the range of motion around a given joint without pain.
Like muscular strength and endurance, flexibility is joint-specific. For instance, you may have very
flexible shoulders
but tight and inflexible hamstrings or hips.
Flexibility is essential at any age. It plays a role in unhindered movement and can affect your balance, coordination, and agility. Maintaining a full range of motion through your major joints can reduce the likelihood of injury and enhance athletic performance.
As you get older, the importance of flexibility becomes even more apparent. While completely stopping the aging process isn't possible, protecting your joints and maintaining mobility can help keep you spry well into your later years.
The ACSM's physical activity guidelines call for adults to engage in flexibility exercises at least two or three days each week.
How to Increase Your Flexibility
There are simple ways you can work
flexibility exercises
into your health-related fitness regimen:
Static stretching, where you hold a stretch for 10 to 30 seconds at a time
Workouts that take you through dynamic stretching exercises, such as
barre
,
yoga
, tai chi, or
Pilates
Active stretching
, such as lifting your leg and holding it uses the contraction of the opposing muscle
Passive stretching also called relaxed stretching, is where you assume a stretch position and hold it with the assistance of another part of your body, a partner, or an apparatus, like a strap.
Isometric stretching, a type of static stretching, uses resistance to alternate between relaxing and contracting the muscle.
We've researched and reviewed the
best online tai chi classes
. If you're looking for an online class, explore which option may be best for you.
6 Easy Hamstring Stretches to Do at Home
Body Composition
Body composition
, or your body's fat mass ratio to
fat-free mass
, is the final component of health-related fitness. Because fat mass can be associated with adverse health outcomes, such as heart disease and type 2 diabetes, attaining and maintaining the right body composition for your unique situation is the goal of most exercise routines.
A healthcare provider can advise you on what is right for you and your situation.
Measuring Body Composition
To see improvements in body composition, you need to know your starting point. Weighing yourself on a scale is not recommended, as weight alone doesn't tell you the makeup of your internal tissues.
Some methods of measuring body composition are more accessible than others.
Bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA)
: Some gyms offer this type of testing, or you can purchase a scale for gone use that uses
bioelectrical impedance analysis
to estimate body fat percentage.
Hydrostatic underwater weighing
:
Hydrostatic testing
involves being weighed on dry land followed on an underwater scale. You can find these testing facilities in research labs and some fitness centers.
DEXA (dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry) scans
: These are typically used for measuring bone mineral density but can also accurately measure body composition. DEXA scans are usually performed at radiology centers and may or may not be covered by insurance.
Body fat percentage calculator
: These tools are not as accurate as a DEXA scan or hydrostatic testing but are readily available and easy to use. The results typically fall within three to four percentage points of your actual
body fat percentage
.
Are You Losing Inches But Not Losing Weight?
A Word From Verywell
Keeping these five elements of fitness in mind can help you reach your health-related fitness goals. Designing a fitness routine that incorporates all these elements can ensure that you follow a well-rounded workout plan that will boost your health. It is normal to be drawn specifically to a particular factor of fitness more than others. Incorporating aspects that suit your goals and lifestyle is key to maintaining your passion for fitness.
Frequently Asked Questions
How are the components of fitness interrelated?
Some of the components of fitness are interrelated. For instance, when you train with weights, you can build muscular strength and endurance at the same time. When you lift weights with intensity, your heart rate can increase to the point you are working your cardiovascular system vigorously.

Precautions
Building muscular strength will help you become better able to lift and move weights and increase your sports performance and total body functioning. Daily tasks, including opening those pesky pickle jars, will become easier once you are stronger.
The size of your
muscle fibers
and the ability of nerves to activate muscle fibers is related to muscle strength and measured during muscular contraction. Building muscular strength helps with body alignment, making everyday actions easier while increasing metabolism.
What Is Muscular Strength?
Muscular
strength
refers to the force a muscle can produce with a single maximal effort. Muscular definition is the visual aspect when muscle shape is visible through the skin and underlying body fat.
You might think that muscular strength is how strong you are: How much weight you can carry,
how many pounds you can lift at the gym
, or how many
push-ups
you can do during a workout. But the true definition of muscular strength is a little more complicated.
According to the American Council on Exercise (ACE), muscular strength is the ability to generate maximal muscle force while performing a particular exercise. Other factors affect how strong you are and how much strength you have to complete daily chores or exercises. ACE provides definitions for these terms that are related to muscular strength:
Muscular endurance
: The ability to produce and sustain muscle force over a certain period.
Muscular power
: The ability to generate enough force to move weight in the shortest time possible.
For example, the number of push-ups you can do in one minute depends on your muscular strength, power, and endurance.
What happens in your body to produce the effect of strength relies on several factors. One component is muscle size and ratio of
fast- and slow-twitch fibers
in that muscle.
Neural connection is critical, as the motor neurons in muscles coordinate their firing they signal muscle fibers to contract simultaneously. Strength also relies on muscles having solid support for the movement of joints, including the health of joints, bones, ligaments, and tendons.
Muscle-Strengthening Exercise Recommendations
The Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services recommend:
Children and adolescents
: Muscle-strengthening physical activity at least three days per week.
Adults and older adults
:
Muscle-strengthening activities
that are moderate or high intensity, involving all major muscle groups, two or more days per week.
Benefits of Muscular Strength
When you improve muscular strength and definition, you enjoy many benefits, especially if you are trying to lose weight—and you don't have to be an
expert bodybuilder
to take advantage of them.
Strength training
provides benefits for exercisers of all levels, such as:
Building more
lean muscle mass
Increasing metabolism
Reducing
body-fat percentage
Moving through daily activities more easily
Improving
sports performance
Burning more calories
, even while at rest
Enhancing thinking processes
Increasing self-esteem
Protecting against major diseases, such as
type 2 diabetes
and heart disease
Reducing pain
Encouraging independence with age, such as by improving
balance and stability
Preventing both acute and overuse injuries
Measuring Muscular Strength
The one-repetition maximum (1RM) test is standard to measure muscle strength. During a 1RM test, an exerciser performs one repetition of a single exercise to see how much weight they can lift using the
correct technique
. There is a protocol to conduct this test, usually done with the
bench press
for
upper-body strength
and the
leg press
for
lower-body strength
.
In physical therapy, a therapist may measure a client's muscular strength in two ways. In manual muscle testing, the client resists the pressure exerted by the therapist to push a body part (such as your arm) in a specific direction. This is graded on a five-point scale. A dynamometer device can also be used, with the client pressing on it to exert a force measured in pounds or kilograms.
How to Do the 1RM Test
Exercise to Improve Strength and Definition
The best way to build muscular strength is to have a resistance-training plan. Some call it strength training or "weightlifting," but you don't have to lift weights to improve your muscles. You can perform simple
bodyweight exercises
for muscular strength or use equipment like a

.
Strength training improves both the size of your muscle fibers and the ability of your nerves to communicate with the muscles. So as your muscles get bigger with resistance training (
muscle hypertrophy
), they also become more coordinated to perform movements requiring strength.
Exercises that can help improve strength and definition include:
Squats
: Squats help build your quads (thighs) and glutes (buttocks). This makes walking or running easier, lifting heavy things, and going up and down stairs.
Lunges
: This exercise strengthens your
hamstrings
and the muscles on the back of your upper leg. Stronger hamstrings help you run faster while providing more stability to your knee joints.
Biceps curls
: Your
biceps
are the muscles on the front of your upper arms. Strong
biceps
means easily performing everyday activities like carrying groceries and picking up your kids or grandkids.
Push-ups
: Push-ups work many muscles in your upper body, including your chest, back, and arms. This exercise prepares you for activities like pushing a heavy grocery cart or stroller.
Planks
: A plank also works your upper body while strengthening your
core muscles
at the same time. A stronger core means better posture and improved balance and mobility.
Abdominal crunches
: The crunch also builds strength in your midsection and back, which some research has found may help ease chronic
lower back pain
.
Precautions
Taking these steps can help make your muscle-building sessions safer and injury-free:
Use proper form throughout the entire exercise, from beginning to end.
Ensure weights are heavy enough to provide resistance but light enough to lift them without sacrificing form.
Increase your resistance slowly as you get stronger.
Give yourself
rest days
so your muscles can recover between workouts. A
protein drink
can also help.
Eat enough protein
(lean meats, dairy,
nuts
, and seeds) as this is the building block of muscle.
Getting the Right Start
Before you start strength training, talk to your healthcare provider to ensure there aren't restrictions or modifications you should follow to stay safe. If you are new to training, ask for help. A few sessions with a
qualified trainer
can help you get your program off to a strong start for lasting results.
A Word From Verywell
Exercise of any kind is essential for good health and for maintaining
a healthy body weight
. Challenging your muscles regularly helps them grow bigger and increases your muscular strength.
When you do strength or resistance training two to three times per week, you build strong muscles to
stand taller
, burn
more calories
, and improve the quality of your daily activities and movement. And you can do them inside or outside the gym.
Incorporate muscle-strengthening activities into your everyday routine by doing squats when you pick up laundry off the floor or lunges when moving from one room to the next. It all adds up, giving you stronger muscles as a result.

What Can You Eat on the Fast Metabolism Diet?
Sample Shopping List
Pros and Cons of the Fast Metabolism Diet
Is the Fast Metabolism Diet a Healthy Choice for You?
At Verywell, we believe there is
no one-size-fits-all approach to a healthy lifestyle
. Successful eating plans need to be individualized and take the whole person into consideration. Prior to starting a new diet plan, consult with your healthcare provider or a registered dietitian, especially if you have an underlying health condition.
The Fast Metabolism Diet claims to rev up your metabolism so that you can eat plenty of food and still lose weight. The diet's inventor, Haylie Pomroy, suggests that you can eat three full meals a day plus two snacks and lose up to 20 pounds in 28 days.
Your dietary goals are accomplished by rotating foods throughout the week. This, according to Pomroy, who is also a nutritionist, will speed up your metabolism so you burn more calories and lose weight.
The Fast Metabolism Diet does not require you to count fat or carbs or
track your calories
. It does, however, require you to stick with the allowed foods on the plan and to strictly avoid other foods, which may pose a challenge since some of the foods that aren't allowed are common in the standard American diet (wheat and dairy products among them).
The Fast Metabolism Diet allows plenty of healthy fruits,
vegetables
, lean meats, and
whole grains
, which is a point in its favor. However, you're only permitted to eat certain things on certain days, which may be problematic for
meal-planning
purposes. The premise of this diet—that it's possible to make your body's metabolism run faster by eating only certain foods in a particular order—does not have any medical studies to back it up.
Pomroy, a regular on NBC's "Extra" and "Access Hollywood," has worked with celebrities ranging from Cher to Robert Downey Jr. on
weight loss
and nutritional goals. She calls herself "the metabolism whisperer" due to her focus on how the body burns calories and uses
nutrients
obtained through food.
According to Pomroy, diets, low-nutrient foods, and too much stress can slow down your metabolism, and weight gain is the result. The diet blueprint outlined in her bestselling book goes into detail on various hormonal effects of weight gain, plus the impact on your liver, your muscles, and your different
types of fat
.
The Fast Metabolism Diet might suit people who are seeking weight loss but who are also willing to
incorporate exercise
into their routines and give up entire categories of foods to achieve their goals.
What Experts Say
"The Fast Metabolism diet focuses on eating fairly healthy foods and promotes exercise, but the structure and rules around the diet are regimented and are not based on science."
—
Kelly Plowe, MS, RD
What Can You Eat on the Fast Metabolism Diet?
There are six rules that Pomroy says are critical to follow in order to see success with the Fast Metabolism Diet. They involve eliminating five foods that make up the bulk of many people's diets, plus one particularly common ingredient in popular beverages:
Wheat
Corn
Dairy
Soy
Refined sugar
Caffeine
To make the elimination of these dietary staples more manageable, especially caffeine, Pomroy recommends patience—along with adding cinnamon to a morning smoothie and trying feverfew or ginkgo biloba, which may help with caffeine withdrawal headaches. Still, some people may find that giving up their morning latte (neither the caffeine nor the cow's milk is allowed as part of the Fast Metabolism Diet) is a bridge too far.
What You Need to Know
"
The Fast Metabolism Diet
," first published in 2013, has its roots in Pomroy's work in animal nutrition. In animal husbandry, it's possible to shape the type of meat produced by farm animals (fatty and marbled vs. lean) by manipulating the food the animals eat, which in turn either revs up or turns down their metabolism.
﻿
﻿﻿﻿ Pomroy says she realized humans could achieve the same effect by eating different foods.
"Your metabolism is your body's system for dealing with the energy you take in through food," Pomroy writes. "The metabolism shuttles that energy into different directions according to what you eat and what you do. The beauty of your metabolism is that it can be manipulated because how you eat and move and live affects how much of your food is stored as fat, how much is used as energy, and how much is devoted to building the structure that is your body."
The Fast Metabolism Diet has a devoted following, with many people stating that it helped them lose significant weight without
going hungry
. However, critics note that the weight loss that's possible on the diet seems to result from calorie restriction, not from the complicated schedule of different foods.
3 Phases of the Fast Metabolism Diet
Each phase of the Fast Metabolism Diet has its own focus and distinct food lists. According to Pomroy, the phases help your body recover from the previous phase and prepare for the next phase. The phases last for a week altogether, then repeat three times for four weeks in total:
Phase 1
(days one and two) is to "unwind stress and calm the adrenals."
Phase 2
(days three and four) is to "unlock stored fat and build muscle."
Phase 3
(days five, six, and seven) is to "unleash the burn," and focuses on your hormones, heart, and "heat."
The idea, Pomroy says, is to provide your body with the variety it needs in order to obtain all your necessary nutrients. "You need complex carbohydrates, natural sugars,
protein
, fat, and even
salt
to maintain normal body chemistry," she says, adding that you may need high levels of these elements, especially if you've been eating a poor diet for a long time.
However, she says, you shouldn't include everything you need at once, which is the idea behind the different phases of the Fast Metabolism Diet. Shifting between the phases allows the systems and organs targeted in each phase to rest and restore in turn, she says.
Phase 1: What to Eat
Phase 1 of the Fast Metabolism Diet is the
high-glycemic
, moderate protein, low-fat phase. It includes carbohydrate-rich foods such as
brown rice
and
quinoa
, fruits that are high in natural sugars, and low-fat, moderate-protein foods.
What to Eat
Brown rice
Brown rice pasta
Quinoa
Oatmeal
Mangoes
Apples
Figs
Oranges
Lean beef
Turkey
Lentils
What Not to Eat
Foods with refined sugar
Wheat
Corn
Juice
Dried fruit
High-fat meats
Milk-based products, including cheese
Phase 1 includes breakfast, lunch, and dinner, plus snacks. Breakfast consists of grains and fruit, lunch includes a grain, a protein, a vegetable, and a fruit, and dinner features a grain, a vegetable, and a protein. This routine, according to Pomroy, teaches your body to use food as energy instead of storing it as fat.
Exercise in Phase 1 should include at least one day of vigorous cardio. Pomroy recommends running, working out on an
elliptical trainer
, or an upbeat
aerobics class
.
Phase 2: What to Eat
Phase 2 is the high-protein, high-vegetable, low-carbohydrate, and low-fat phase of the Fast Metabolism Diet. It features high-nutrient cruciferous vegetables and lots of lean protein.
What to Eat
Leafy greens such as kale, collards, and mustard greens
Broccoli
Cabbage
Onions
Asparagus
Lean beef
White meat poultry
Buffalo/bison
Low-fat fish
Egg whites
What Not to Eat
Fruit or fruit juice
Grains (including corn and wheat)
Refined sugar
High-fat meat
Milk-based products, including cheese
Like Phase 1, Phase 2 includes breakfast, lunch, and dinner, plus two snacks. However, the emphasis is on foods that will
build muscle
, as opposed to relatively high-carb fruits and grains. Breakfast features lean protein and a vegetable, lunch is another protein and vegetable, and dinner is protein and more vegetables. Both snacks are lean protein, such as buffalo jerky or a few slices of
deli chicken
.
Exercise in Phase 2 includes at least one day of
strength training
, with a focus on
lifting heavy weights
with low reps.
Phase 3: What to Eat
Phase 3 of the Fast Metabolism Diet is the high healthy-fat, moderate carbohydrate, moderate protein, low-glycemic fruit phase. It includes foods that are high in healthy fats, such as
avocados
and
coconuts
, lots of berries, some
grains
, and little meat.
What to Eat
Nuts, seeds, and nut butters
Avocados
Coconuts
Olives
Salmon
Berries
Asparagus
Beans
Cauliflower
Quinoa
Seaweed
Beef and chicken liver
What Not to Eat
Oranges
Peaches
Mangoes
Beef
Poultry
Corn and wheat
Refined sugar
Milk-based products, including cheese
Phase 3 includes breakfast with fruit, a fat/protein food, a grain, and a vegetable. Lunch features a fat/protein source, a vegetable, and a fruit, and dinner has a fat/protein source, a vegetable, and a grain/starch. Both snacks include a healthy fat plus a vegetable.
Exercise in Phase 3 includes at least one day of
stress-reducing activity
such as
yoga
or a
massage
.
Once you've gone through one week and all three phases, you are instructed to repeat the Fast Metabolism Diet as many times as you wish until you obtain the results you want.
Sample Shopping List
The Fast Metabolism Diet emphasizes healthy fruits, vegetables,
lean meats
, and
whole grains
, but limits consumption of certain food groups depending on which phase of the diet you're in. The following shopping list provides an overview of what you'll need during each phase. Keep in mind this is not a definitive shopping list and you may find other foods that work better for you.

Brown rice pasta
(penne, macaroni shells, spaghetti)
Quinoa
(regular and tricolor)
Oatmeal
(steel cut, quick-cooking, rolled oats)
Mangoes
Apples
(pink lady, granny smith, Honeycrisp)
Oranges
(navel, Cara Cara, mandarin)
Figs
(fresh and/or dried)
Lean beef
(lean cuts of steak and ground sirloin)
Turkey
(turkey breast and ground turkey)
Lentils
(green, red, black)
Phase 2
Dark leafy greens
(kale, collards, mustard greens, Swiss chard)
Broccoli
(florets and whole crowns)
Cabbage

Cauliflower
Quinoa
Seaweed
(wakame, hijiki, kombu)
Beef and chicken liver
(whole/raw or canned/pate)
Sample Meal Plan
A variety of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, legumes, and healthy fats are encouraged during different phases of the Fast Metabolism Diet. You are advised to consume lean protein like
chicken
breast, lean cuts of beef, and low-fat fish. Since it's recommended you restrict your caffeine and sugar intake, it might be best to just drink water with your meals to promote hydration and weight loss.
The following meal plan shows you what a typical day during each of the three phases might look like. Note this plan is not all-inclusive, and if you choose to follow the Fast Metabolism Diet, there may be other meals that are more appropriate to suit your tastes and preferences.

Pros and Cons of the Fast Metabolism Diet
Pros
Diet contains lots of healthy fresh fruits, vegetables, lean meats, and whole grains
Exercise is strongly recommended
Different types of exercise are included
Cons
Diet is complicated to follow
Food choice is limited day-to-day
Program may be difficult to follow long-term
As with all diets, the Fast Metabolism Diet has its benefits and drawbacks. Reviewing the pros and cons can help you decide whether this is the right diet plan for your
weight loss goals
.
Pros
Healthy Foods
The foods included in one week of this plan certainly are part of an overall healthy diet, which calls for plenty of fruits and vegetables, lean protein sources, and whole grains. If you take the week as a whole, there's sufficient variety to keep you from getting bored, plus plenty of variation that should provide your body with the vitamins, minerals, and micronutrients it needs to function.
Exercise
The Fast Metabolism Diet recommends rotating between different forms of exercise: aerobic, strength training, and yoga. This is a recommendation that's supported by research since it keeps your overall level of activity up while allowing specific muscle groups to recover on off days.
Cons
Complicated
Although Pomroy's book is filled with descriptions of how simple the Fast Metabolism Diet is to follow, it's somewhat complicated. It can be easy to forget which foods you're supposed to eat (and avoid) on which days. Since the most effective weight loss program is one you'll stick with, this one might not be ideal for some people. Pomroy does, however, offer
an app
that helps in meal planning and keeping the three phases straight.
Limited Choices
While it's possible to strictly limit your regular food options if you're only planning on doing it for a limited time, it's probably not sustainable for most people in the long-term. In addition, although the diet may help to introduce you to foods you don't normally eat, its regimentation probably won't help you to develop healthy eating habits that you'll stick with.
Although the Fast Metabolism Diet does include many healthy foods and a good, varied exercise plan, it's too complicated and too limiting for most to follow long-term.
Is the Fast Metabolism Diet a Healthy Choice for You?
The day-to-day food regimen of the Fast Metabolism Diet lacks balance and fails to meet the healthy diet recommendations outlined by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA).
However, there are research-supported ways to
ramp up your metabolism
without the need to restrict food choices. If you learn how many calories you need per day, and then boost your physical activity level, it should boost your metabolism as well.
There's also a bit of evidence that low-carb diets, such as the
Atkins Diet
and the
South Beach Diet
, may actually help to increase your metabolism. A 2014 study found that people following a low-carb diet lost more weight than people following a low-fat diet.
While this study isn't definitive, it does indicate that you might have different choices when it comes to eating plans that potentially increase your metabolism. You also should note, though, that low-carb diets have nutritional issues of their own.
Pomroy has turned the Fast Metabolism Diet into a successful franchise with a companion cookbook and an app. Although there's plenty of information out there purporting to help you speed up your metabolism, there are competing diets, some of which have more research behind them.
Health Benefits
The Fast Metabolism diet focuses on eating fairly healthy foods and promotes exercise, which is integral to long-term health and weight management.
Despite the many positive reviews of the Fast Metabolism Diet, there's no robust medical science behind the idea that this diet plan with its strict regimen will increase your metabolism.
Health Risks
While there are no common health risks associated with the Fast Metabolism Diet, the strict rules around the diet are strangely regimented and are not based on science. In general, eliminating healthy food groups is not part of a
balanced diet
.
A Word From Verywell
Choosing a
weight loss program
can be confusing. It's easy to buy into the hype surrounding popular diets, especially if the diet in question is presented with celebrity backing plus hundreds of glowing reviews. The Fast Metabolism Diet might help you to lose weight—lots of people report that it works, at least in the short-term. But it won't help you to develop healthy eating habits that will sustain your weight loss beyond that initial effort.
Remember, following a long- or short-term diet may not be necessary for you, and many diets out there simply don’t work. While we do not endorse fad diet trends or unsustainable weight-loss methods, we present the facts so you can make an informed decision that works best for your nutritional needs, genetic blueprint, budget, and goals.
If your goal is weight loss, remember that losing weight isn’t necessarily the same as being your healthiest self, and there are many other ways to pursue health. Exercise, sleep, and other lifestyle factors also play a major role in your overall health. The best diet is always the one that is balanced and fits your lifestyle.

Hypertrophy vs. Strength

Strength Training Benefits
Frequently Asked Questions
Strength training and hypertrophy training (or muscle building) do not necessarily have the same goal or outcome. Strength training aims to make muscles stronger.
On the other hand,
muscle building
aims to modify muscle cell physiology to make muscles larger.
Most people would assume that larger muscles produce the most force. However, when comparing bodybuilding versus strength training, strength-training muscles may have overall better muscle fiber quality.
Although larger muscle mass and overall physical size may provide some strength advantage, performance goals, and appropriate training approaches will differ depending on the desired outcome: more muscle mass or more strength.
Hypertrophy means increasing muscle size through targeted training that aims to increase you volume of weight lifted over time (sets x reps). Strength (the state of being strong) and strength training are the goals of increasing muscle force and the ability to lift heavier weights. This is accomplished with heavy weight lifting above 85% of your 1-rep max.
Weight Training
Weight training
, also referred to as resistance training or weight lifting, offers a number of benefits for your physical and mental health. Lifting weights can help increase metabolism, lower body fat, and reduce the risk of certain chronic diseases. And if you're feeling stressed, weight training can reduce stress and anxiety and even improve your mood.
When you start weight training, you're likely going to gain strength and muscle mass at the same time. As you continue and become more advanced, focusing on building strength or muscle becomes imperative to reach your goals faster.
Hypertrophy vs. Strength
Muscle building aims to induce
hypertrophy
of muscle tissue, with the muscle gaining overall size. On the other hand, strength training aims to increase the functional ability of the muscles. Hypertrophy training requires a higher training volume with more frequent workouts and shorter rest periods in between sets.
The workouts include more sets and reps with a lower weight. Strength training has a lower training volume (fewer days, longer rest periods) but higher intensity. The goal is to lift heavier weights with fewer reps and sets.
Even nutrition and diet needs are different between the two programs. Bodybuilding, or hypertrophy training, uses training protocols that focus primarily on enhancing muscle size, so a balanced nutrition program that supports low body fat maintenance and sufficient protein to
gain muscle
is vital.
There is an on and off-season preparation if you are competing in events. The nutrition plan will also change depending on the category that is involved. Strength training uses nutrition for the recovery and repair of muscles.
Volume vs. Intensity in Weight Training
Hypertrophy Training Exercises
Muscle-building programs use exercise machines for the majority of the workout but also utilize free weights and bodyweight exercises. Sample hypertrophy exercises include:
Biceps curls
Bench press
Deadlifts
Squats
Hypertrophy training involves
progressive overloading
, which is necessary for maximal muscle fiber recruitment and size increases. For beginner and intermediate athletes, use moderate loading: 65% to 80-85% of your one-rep maximum (1 RM), 6–12 repetitions per set, and 1–3+ sets per exercise. Rest should be between 30 seconds to 1.5 minutes in between sets.
For advanced training, achieve 67% to 85% of 1 RM, 6–12 repetitions per set, at least 3 sets per exercise. Rest should be between 30 seconds to 1.5 minutes in between sets.
Strength Training Exercises
Strength training typically centers around compound lifts (as opposed to hypertrophy training, which uses both compound and isolation lifts). Sample strength training exercises include:
Lunges
Overhead press
Pushups
Triceps extensions
For strength training, the advice on progressive overloading is a little different. For beginner to intermediate athletes, experts recommend training with loads corresponding to 70% to 80% of 1 RM, at least 6 repetitions per set for 1-3+ sets. Two to five minutes of rest in between sets is also recommended.
For advanced training, 85% of 1 RM for at least 3 sets to maximize muscular strength. There are at least 6 reps for each set, with two to five minutes of rest in between each set.
Advanced trainers tend to use more repetitions and lower weights for bodybuilding and higher weights and fewer repetitions for strength training.
Benefits of Hypertrophy Training
With hypertrophy training, the aim is to achieve an aesthetic look with bigger, bulkier muscles. But that's not the only benefit. A muscle-building program will increase:
Calorie expenditure
Confidence and self-esteem
Lean muscle mass
Metabolism
Power
Strength
Benefits of Strength Training
Strength training focuses on improving your functional fitness so that you can translate the workouts you do in the gym to your everyday life. You'll find that the stronger you get, the easier it is to carry groceries, play with your kids, and lift heavy objects like furniture.
The perks don't end there. Strength training has been shown to provide many physical, mental, and emotional health benefits and can help:
Boost confidence
Enhance athletic performance
Improve strength
Increase bone density and muscle mass
Lower body fat
Reduce stress, anxiety, and fatigue
Reduce the risk of certain chronic diseases
Reduce the risk of injuries and joint pain
Regulate mood
Rev up your metabolism
Frequently Asked Questions
Does hypertrophy training or strength training have a greater impact on muscle appearance?
Hypertrophy training has a greater impact on muscle appearance than strength training.
Does cutting or bulking impact whether you should hypertrophy or strength train?
Cutting and bulking are more appropriate for hypertrophy training.
For strength training, focus on recovery nutrition for repairing muscles between workouts.
Should you train strength or hypertrophy first?
If you're beginning a weight training program, you will increase muscle and strength at the same time. Then you can choose either a strength training program or a muscle-building (hypertrophy) program depending on what you're aiming for. Also, consider adding
a vibration plate
to your training, which can enhance muscle growth and improve muscle strength in less time.
A Word From Verywell
A suitable combination of strength and muscle training will be the most useful for most recreational athletes and fitness trainers. However, should you need to specialize, it's worth knowing how to adapt your workout once you reach an intermediate weight training level of condition. It is also beneficial to work with a personal trainer in order to work on your form and learn how to prevent injuries.
Whether you train for strength, muscle, or a combination, you need to be committed to the appropriate exercises and program protocols to achieve success. But you should also listen to your body. Take caution against certain risks, like skipping your warmup, increasing weight too quickly, using poor form, or not making time for rest and recovery.

When you're creating a fitness routine, cardio is generally a common aspect to consider. How do you plan to get your heart rate pumping? There are plenty of options to add into your weekly habits, many of which, like cycling, are continuing to grow in popularity.
Whether indoors or out, following a guided program, in a group, or on your own, there’s a reason cycling continues to grow momentum. Get ready to push the pedals and reap the benefits of this full-body workout as we guide you on everything from footwear to choosing the best two-wheeler for your endeavors.
Frequently Asked Questions
What muscles does cycling work?
Cycling, indoor and outdoor, works more than just your legs and glutes (although studies confirm that cycling does stimulate deep muscles in the quadriceps and hamstrings).
Core, shoulders, hamstrings, and calf muscles all play a part in cycling, making it a full-body workout.

How Indoor Cycling Works Muscles All Over Your Body
Does cycling strengthen your core?
While cycling has the potential to strengthen your core, there is also evidence that improving your core strength off the bike can improve your pedaling performance.
For this reason, you might consider committing to cycling as your go-to training modality or as part of a cross-training regimen.

Power Up Your Indoor Cycling Workout
Is cycling a low-impact exercise?
Cycling is a low-impact exercise, meaning it is gentle on the joints and involves fluid motion. However, low-impact does not need to mean low intensity: changing gears, performing intervals, and cycling on an incline can increase the intensity of your cycling workouts.

Getting a Good Workout With Low Impact Exercise
Is cycling to work enough exercise?
As with any exercise, getting in some movement is better than nothing, including cycling to work.
In fact, one study found that cycling to work was associated with a lower risk of cardiovascular disease, cancer, and all-cause mortality.
However frequently you choose to bike to work, take appropriate safety precautions.

Cardio for Weight Loss
Cardiovascular exercise is low- and high-intensity activity that depends on the aerobic energy-generating process to elevate your heart rate. Though some use it solely for weight loss, cardio has many other benefits.
Cardio should be used in combination with strength training exercises for overall wellness. And while there are many cardio exercises to choose from, consistency, duration, and intensity are the most critical factors for meeting your fitness goals. Read on to learn more about cardio, as well as its benefits, and how to create a safe and effective cardio workout routine.
What Is Cardio?
Cardio exercise, which is sometimes referred to as aerobic exercise, is any rhythmic activity that raises your heart rate into your target heart rate zone—such as boxing drills on
a punching bag
. This is the zone where you burn the most fat and calories.
Some of the most common examples of cardio include
walking
,
cycling
, and
swimming
. However, even household chores like vacuuming and mopping qualify as cardio exercise.
Part of what sets cardio apart from other types of exercise—such as
strength training
—is that it relies on your body's ability to use oxygen during the workout session. A person's cardio ability or capacity can vary based on a number of factors.
Research published by the American Heart Association reports that genetics have a 20% to 40% influence over what you can do cardio-wise.
Also, females tend to have a 25% lower cardio capacity than males and, for both genders, this capacity tends to decline with age.
This is not to say that your genes, gender, or age will prevent you from improving your cardiovascular health. But it does help to know that many factors can influence how (and how well) your body responds to cardio exercise.
Using Your Target Heart Rate to Maximize Your Workouts
Benefits of Cardio
Verywell / Theresa Chiechi
There are few activities you can do for a short period that have the physical and mental health benefits that cardio offers. Some of the known benefits of cardio include:
Burns fat
and calories, making it easier to
lose weight
Enhances sleep quality, especially if the exercise is moderate to vigorous in intensity
Expands lung capacity or the amount of air that your lungs can hold
Improves your sex life
by increasing your body's ability to become aroused, improving your body image, and even potentially helping to treat medication-related sexual dysfunction
Increases bone density when you do weight-bearing cardio exercises like
hiking
or
climbing stairs
Lowers stress
in part by improving your ability to cope with issues positively
Promotes feeling good, and can even help relieve depression
and anxiety
Improves confidence in how you look and feel
Reduces risk of heart attack, high cholesterol, high blood pressure, diabetes, and some forms of cancer
Sets a good example for those around you, encouraging them to exercise with you
Strengthens the heart so it doesn't have to work as hard to pump blood
How to Choose Cardio Workouts
Your first step in choosing the right cardio workout is to decide which activities you enjoy. Think about what fits your personality and movement you'd feel comfortable fitting into your life. This is key because if you don't like the exercise, you're less likely to
stick with it long-term
.
Exploring nature, running, cycling, or walking—all great cardio options. If you prefer going to the gym, you have many options in the form of
stationary bikes
,
elliptical trainers
,
treadmills
,
rowing machines
,
climbers
,
swimming pools
, and more.
Want to increase your heart rate at home? You can do
at-home cardio exercises
like jumping rope, jumping jacks, jogging in place, and
burpees
. Another option is to
buy your own treadmill
,
rowing machine
, or
elliptical
machine. You might also consider using:
Exercise DVDs
Fitness apps
Online workouts
You may not even know what you like yet. In this case, try several different activities to find ones you enjoy. For instance, grab
a pickleball paddle
and play a few rounds with friends. Don't be afraid to try something new and, if it doesn't work out, move on. For example, you might find that
workout sandbags
offer a full-body workout with a single piece of equipment.
Beginner Cardio Workouts
If you are new to cardiovascular exercise, try beginner workouts to help get you started. These include:
Cardio for Absolute Beginners
: This program lets you pick any machine or activity you're comfortable with.
Elliptical Workout for Beginners
: The elliptical is great for building strength with low impact (meaning it is easier on your joints).
Stationary Bike Workout for Beginners
: This 20-minute indoor cycling workout is great if you want a low-impact workout.
Another option is to start with about 10 to 20 minutes of brisk walking at a moderate intensity. This means you should be at Level 5 or 6 on a
perceived exertion scale
of zero to 10, where sitting is zero and the highest level of effort possible is 10.
How Long Should a Cardio Workout Last?
Health authorities recommend that most people get 150 minutes of cardio exercise per week.
The great thing about cardio is that you don't have to work out for an hour to receive benefits.
Even cardio sessions as short as 10 minutes count toward your weekly exercise totals.
So, figure out how much you need to do each week and split it up in a way that makes sense for you.
Beginners
can find it more manageable to break up cardio into 10- or 15-minute segments. Increase your time by 5 minutes as exercise begins to feel easier. Work your way up to 30- to 60-minute sessions.
How Much Exercise Do You Need to Lose Weight?
Frequency of Cardio Workouts
The answer to how often to do cardio depends on several factors. Among them are your fitness level, schedule, and goals.
If you are new to exercise, want to be healthier, don't have a lot of free time, and aren't worried about losing weight, exercising a little bit every day can do you good. If you have been exercising regularly for years, are used to
hitting the gym
for 60 minutes at a time, and are more focused on
building muscle
than burning fat, cardio three to four times a week is likely enough.
When thinking about frequency, it's important to consider intensity as well. Light- or moderate-intensity cardio workouts can usually be performed every day. But if you do
high-intensity training
, you'll need more rest days between workouts. Mixing the two helps you work different energy systems and keeps you from burning out.
Guidelines for Cardio Frequency
The frequency of your workouts depends on your fitness level and schedule. The basic guidelines are:
For general health
, try moderately intense cardio for 30 minutes a day, five days a week, or vigorously intense cardio for 20 minutes a day, 3 days a week. You can also do a mixture.
For weight loss and/or to avoid
regaining weight
, you may need to do more than 300 minutes of moderate-intensity activity each week to meet your goals.
To maintain a healthy body weight
, you need 150 to 300 minutes of moderate-intensity activity a week.
Doing too much cardio
is a no-no and can backfire. There is a point of diminishing returns, so keep it reasonable (three to six days per week, depending on your fitness level), vary your intensity, and don't forget to take rest days.
When Life Gets in the Way of Cardio
What happens if you can't follow the guidelines? If you're still building endurance and conditioning with cardio exercises, it may take a few weeks to work up to more frequent movement.
If a
busy schedule
stands in your way, work out as many days as possible. Try shorter, more intense circuit-training workouts to make the most of the time you have. Try these quick workouts:
10 Minute Low-Impact Cardio Workout
: A low-impact workout that doesn't require any equipment and uses your body weight as resistance
Burn 100 Calories in 10 Minutes
: Six workout options help keep things interesting
Keep in mind that if you can't follow the guidelines due to a busy schedule, your wellness goals may take a back seat until you can
change your lifestyle
to accommodate more daily movement.
Cardio Exercise Intensity
Once you're used to exercising at 30 minutes of continuous movement, begin working on intensity. How hard you work is a crucial factor in your workout because of:
Calorie burn
: Intensity is directly related to how many calories you burn.
Ease of monitoring
: A
heart rate monitor
or the perceived exertion scale makes it easy to monitor your exercise intensity.
Time savings
: Elevating intensity burns more calories when you're short on time.
Variation
: Swap your usual cardio workout with something new, whether cycling, a HIIT or dance class, rock climbing, or workouts on
a trampoline or rebounder
. Your body will love the new challenge.
How Hard Should You Work?
Your best cardio intensity level depends on several factors, including your fitness and goals. There are three different levels of intensity you can focus on during your workouts, and you can even incorporate all levels into the same workout:
High-Intensity Cardio
: This falls between 70% and 85% of your
maximum heart rate (MHR)
, or a 7 to 8 on the perceived exertion scale. High-intensity cardio is challenging and leaves you too breathless to talk much. If you're a beginner, try beginner interval training to work harder for shorter periods.
Moderate-Intensity Cardio
: Moderate intensity falls between 50% and 70% of your MHR (a level 5 to 6 on the perceived exertion scale). The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services often recommends this level of intensity in its Physical Activity Guidelines. This is the level you typically want to shoot for during your workouts.
Low-Intensity Cardio
: This type of exercise is considered below 50% of your MHR, or about a level 3 to 4 on the perceived exertion scale. This is a good level to work at during warm-ups or when you're squeezing in other activities, like walking, throughout the day.
How to Calculate Your Target Heart Rate
Keep in mind that target heart rate calculation isn't 100% accurate. You might want to use a combination of perceived exertion and your heart rate to find a range that works for you.
Cardio for Weight Loss
While the Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans suggest that most people get 150 minutes of
moderate-intensity physical activity
weekly, the amount of exercise needed to lose weight is often greater. If you want to lose more than 5% of your body weight, you may need 300 minutes per week or more.
These guidelines state that moderate-intensity cardio is any activity that elevates your heart rate. However, they also indicate that incorporating
high-intensity interval training
often provides better results for people who are overweight or obese.
Adding
resistance training
to your weekly cardio can also help. It works by increasing lean muscle mass to create a higher energy demand on your body to burn more calories at rest and while exercising.
Combine cardio with a healthy diet to boost your weight loss. The
Dietary Guidelines for Americans
recommends eating fruits, veggies, grains, low-fat dairy, lean proteins, and healthy oils while limiting added sugar, saturated fat, sodium, and alcohol.

A Word From Verywell
Before beginning cardio or any other exercise program, talk to your doctor to ensure exercise is safe. Also, listen to your body. If it tells you to slow down, reduce your intensity, frequency, or exercise duration.
Keep your cardio workouts simple. Start somewhere and make it a goal to do something every day, even if it's a five-minute walk. Try doing it at the same time every day and schedule it on your calendar. The more you practice, the easier it gets.

Why You May Want To Track Your Progress
What to Look for When Evaluating Your Progress
How to Track Your Progress
When to Make Adjustments
Frequently Asked Questions
Strength training
is a form of
resistance training
wherein your goal is to increase your strength.
Learning how to track your strength training progress is essential for ensuring your hard work pays off. This includes pre-planning and keeping a record of what you've accomplished so you know what's working and what may need to be adjusted as you progress.
Below, you will learn why you may want to track your strength training progress, what to look for when self-evaluating, how to track, and when to make adjustments to keep you on track toward your goals.
Why You May Want To Track Your Progress
Like any goal, if you want to ensure the best results, you should track your progress. When it comes to increasing your strength, you may think being able to lift a heavier weight the next time you train is enough to indicate you are on the right track. But it is challenging to get a complete picture of your progress without knowing how many
repetitions, sets, and weekly workouts
you are doing.
One of the most vital aspects of any well-designed strength training program is
periodization
or planning and tracking your training routine over periods that switch goals and techniques. This also includes planned de-load periods, to
prevent overtraining
and increase results.
For instance, a strength training phase may be followed by a de-load before embarking on a muscle hypertrophy phase,
muscular endurance
phase, or fat loss phase.
Tracking your progress is not only about keeping a record of how heavy your weights are; it's also crucial to understand what might cause a
strength plateau
, a decrease in strength, or other roadblocks that might cause you to become frustrated and unsure what to do next.
6 Tips to Overcome a Weightlifting Plateau
What to Look for When Evaluating Your Progress
When evaluating your
strength training progress
, look for consistent changes over time. Without routinely tracking your training details and results of each workout, you might not be able to tell whether you're progressing or not and become frustrated. Small increases in strength over time add to significant changes once your strength training cycle ends and you are ready for a new phase.
That said, don't be too hard on yourself if you aren't making the strength gains you would expect. The purpose of tracking your progress is to see where adjustments need to be made to keep you making progress. If you stall entirely, reviewing your tracked workouts can provide insight into what to do next.
Look for increases in the amount of weight lifted, increases in reps using the same weight, and ease and proficiency in performing specific movements (such as deadlifts, squats, bench presses, etc.) as your central nervous system adapts. You also should look for signs of stalling and performance decline since these can indicate a need for switching things up or taking a de-load.
Why Strength Train?
Strength training has incredible benefits, including increasing bone density, boosting heart health, facilitating circulation, reducing your resting blood pressure rate, controlling blood sugar and cholesterol levels, preventing muscle loss, increases coordination, balance, and stability for less risk of falls and injuries.
How to Track Your Progress
Knowing how to track your strength training progress is essential for implementing any changes you may need to keep working toward your goals. Here are key ways to do just that.
Keep a Record of Your Training Sessions
The number one way to track your progress is to record your training sessions. While it stands to reason, that you should have pre-planned your sessions for the expected sets, reps, and weights you will attempt to lift, this information is often based on previous training sessions.
For this reason, keeping track of your workouts is vital to your success.
While you may not always be able to accomplish what you have planned, knowing what you actually did accomplish will inform your next workout.
How to Track Training Sessions
Record which exercises you perform
Track how many sessions per week you do
Record sets and reps performed
Record weight used for each set
Track rest periods
Monitor range of motion for each exercise (keep consistent)
Note any circumstances that impacted results (lack of sleep, nutrition, stress, motivation, etc.)

Test Your Strength
The best way to know if you're getting stronger is to plan your strength phase to include regular strength testing. One of the best and most reliable ways to do this is by testing your one-repetition maximum (1RM).
Testing your one-rep max every week or month is ideal for tracking your strength training progress.
Make sure you warm up and use a
spotter
when testing your one-rep max. Lifting maximal amounts of weight can be risky, and you shouldn't attempt it when you're alone or if you are unable to perform the exercises with the correct form.
There are other ways to test your strength, too, such as how many repetitions you can do using a specific weight. However, this is not as accurate due to the levels of fatigue that accumulate when you perform multiple reps.
Repetition Maximum for Weight Training
Monitor How You Feel
Monitoring how you feel is vital for tracking your strength progress. Recording how you feel can provide crucial insight into the potential causes if you cannot make strength gains. For instance, if you feel energized, strong, and motivated, yet you were unable to increase your weight during your session, the steps you should take to keep advancing will be much different than if you felt weak, tired, and unmotivated.
Adjustments to your training plans only work if you know they are the correct changes. If you feel tired, weak, and unmotivated, you'll need lifestyle changes and training adaptations to ensure you don't burn out and risk overtraining. Record when you're feeling this way and any indications as to why it might happen. If you've been eating and sleeping well but still feel run down, it's time for a de-load or even a visit with a healthcare provider.
Monitoring Physical Effects of Training
Record fatigue levels and sleep habits
Monitor muscle soreness and recovery
Keep track of how motivated you are (or aren't)
Make note of any mood changes
Indicate any hormonal disruptions (periods, cravings, hunger, etc.)
Note whether you felt weak or out of breath
When to Make Adjustments
If you have stopped progressing or are seeing a decline in
your strength
, it's clearly time to make adjustments. However, you can avoid declines in strength if you carefully monitor and plan your workout phases to account for fatigue management.
Much of strength training progress depends on your central nervous system adapting to learning new skills and handling heavier loads. It is not purely muscular but neurological as well. If you've been feeling physically and mentally well but have noticed a strength plateau, you can adjust your training and technique to see continued results.
Tactics include revisiting your form and techniques to ensure you are doing everything correctly. Proper form can mean the difference between increasing your load on a lift or stalling completely.
Asking a personal trainer or advanced lifting partner to check your form is a great idea.
Another option is to work on sticking points using unique methods that can help you build up strength in the areas of a lift you are struggling with, such as the lockout on a deadlift, grip strength, getting out of the hole on a squat, and so on.
You may need a trainer to help you with this.
Don't Forget Rest Between Sets
Resting enough between sets is an often overlooked but vital aspect of strength training. When pursuing gains in strength, a 3- to 5-minute rest interval between sets is ideal.
However, your rest can be longer than this if needed and will increase depending on how strong you are. Very strong individuals may need to rest more than people just starting out in order to be recovered enough to put enough effort into their next set.
As stated previously, if the issues are arising from feeling tired and rundown, adjusting your nutrition, sleep, recovery, and training intensity/load may be the best path forward. If you have not taken a break from intense lifting for more than 4 weeks, it's time for a de-load week.
Heavy lifting of compound exercises commonly performed in strength training such as deadlifts and squats are very taxing to the nervous system and cause a lot of fatigue.
Recovery is vital
.
Improve Your Muscular Strength and Definition
A Word From Verywell
Strength training is an excellent form of exercise everyone should do to increase their daily functioning, prevent age-related strength loss, and build confidence. If you aim to get stronger, it's crucial to track your training sessions and progress over time to ensure you are on the right track.
If nothing seems to be going well, you should seek the guidance of a personal trainer. And don't forget, significant changes do not happen overnight. These goals take time, dedication, consistency, and patience to achieve. If you are having trouble getting started, you may benefit from a session or two with a certified personal trainer.
5 Mental Health Benefits of Strength Training
Frequently Asked Questions
Why is it important to evaluate progress?
It's important to evaluate your progress when strength training so you know if what you're doing is working or not. Knowing when you have stalled or declined in strength indicates a need for change.
How long does it take to see progress when strength training?
You will see progress in strength training after the first week. Much of strength training is neurological. As your brain catches up to learning new skills and handling increasing loads, you will see your progress climb quickly.
What is the most effective measurement of strength training progress?
The most effective measurement of strength training progress is testing your one-rep maximum to see if you can lift more weight for the same exercise as you did previously. Consistently testing your one-rep max has been shown to be the most reliable method for measuring strength.

How to Use FITT
FITT Principle and Injury Prevention
Frequently Asked Questions
The FITT principle is a set of guidelines for structuring your exercise and tracking your progress to help reach your fitness goals. FITT stands for frequency, intensity, time, and type of exercise.
Whether new to exercising or a professional bodybuilder or athlete, you need to consider these four elements to create workouts that fit your goals and fitness level. For instance, working out 3 to 5 days a week with a mixture of low-, medium-, and
high-intensity exercise
for 30 to 60 minutes per session, and performing cardio and
strength training
. Working out these details and progressing them over time helps create an effective fitness program.

Watch Now: How to Use FITT In Your Workouts
Frequency
The first thing to set up with your workout plan is frequency—how often you exercise. Frequency often depends on various factors, including the type of workout, how hard you're working, your fitness level, and exercise goals.
In general, the exercise guidelines set by the American College of Sports Medicine give you a place to start when figuring out how often to work out for
cardio
and strength training.
Cardio Workouts
Cardio workouts
are usually scheduled more frequently. Depending on your
fitness goals
, guidelines recommend moderate cardio exercise five or more days a week or intense cardio three days a week to improve your health. If you want to lose weight, you may want to work up to more frequent workouts, up to six or more days a week. Just remember that more is not always better, and
recovery time is essential
.
How Much Exercise Do You Need to Lose Weight?
Strength Training
The recommended frequency for
strength training
is two to three non-consecutive days a week.
You should have at least one to two days between sessions.
Your frequency, however, will often depend on the type of training sessions you perform as well as your goals. You want to work each muscle group at least two times a week if your goal is to build bigger muscles.
If you do
split training
, like upper body one day and lower body the next, your workouts can be more frequent than total body workouts.
5 Mental Health Benefits of Strength Training
Intensity
Intensity has to do with how hard you work during exercise. How you increase or decrease intensity depends on the type of workout you're doing.
Cardio Workouts
For cardio, you will usually monitor workout intensity by
heart rate
,
perceived exertion
, the
talk test
, a
heart rate monitor
, or a combination.
The general recommendation is to work at a moderate intensity for steady-state workouts.
Interval training
is done at a
higher intensity
for a shorter period. It's a good idea to have a mixture of low-, medium-, and high-intensity cardio exercises to stimulate different energy systems and avoid
overtraining
.
What Is Moderate Exercise?
Strength Training
Monitoring the intensity of strength training involves a different set of parameters. Your intensity comprises the amount of weight you lift, and the number of reps and sets you do. Intensity can change based on your goals.
If you are a
beginner
looking to build muscle, stability, and endurance, use a lighter weight and do fewer sets with high repetitions: two or three sets of 12 to 20 reps.
To
grow muscle
, do more sets with moderate repetitions (for instance, four sets of 10 to 12 reps each). You can build muscle with a wide range of repetitions and weights, but the volume (total number of repetitions), is often higher than for other goals.
Building strength
requires using heavy weights to do more sets with fewer reps (five sets of three reps each, for example).
19 Cardio Exercises for a Gym-Free Workout
Time
The next element of your workout plan is how long you exercise during each session. There isn't one set rule for how long you should exercise, and it will typically depend on your fitness level and the type of workout you're doing.
Cardio Workouts
The exercise guidelines suggest 30 to 60 minutes of cardio, but the duration of your workout will depend on your fitness level and what type of exercise you're doing.
If you're a beginner, start with a
15- to 20-minute workout
. Experienced exercisers can go for a run or use a cardio machine for 30 to 60 minutes. If you're doing interval training and working at high intensity, your workout will be shorter, around 10 to 15 minutes for all-out-effort
interval training
.
Having a variety of
cardio workouts
of different intensities and durations will give you a solid, balanced cardio program.
Strength Training: A Beginner's Guide to Getting Stronger
Strength Training
How long you lift weights will also depend on the type of workout you're doing and your schedule. For example, a total body workout could take more than one hour, whereas a split routine could take less time because you're working fewer muscle groups in one session.
Running Warmups, Cooldowns & Stretching
Type
The type of exercise you do is the last part of the FITT principle. It is easy to manipulate to avoid overuse injuries or weight-loss plateaus.
Cardio Workouts
Cardio is easy to change since any activity that raises your heart rate counts.
Running
,
walking
,
cycling
,
dancing
,
swimming
, and the
elliptical trainer
are some of the wide variety of activities you can choose. Having more than one go-to cardio activity is the best way to
reduce boredom
and increase variability.
19 Cardio Exercises for a Gym-Free Workout
Strength Training
Strength training workouts can also offer variety. They include any exercise using resistance (bands,
dumbbells
, machines, etc.) to work your muscles. Bodyweight exercises can also be considered a form of strength training.
You can easily change strength workouts from total body training to moves like
supersets
or
pyramid training
to liven things up. Incorporating new exercises for each body part is another way to vary workouts.
You can spend a few weeks working on functional strength-based movements, then move to
hypertrophy
or strength-based programming. Each of these modalities includes various alternative types of strength-based exercises to try.
Should You Work Out Twice a Day? Here's What Experts Say
How to Use FITT
The FITT principle outlines how to manipulate your program to get in shape and achieve better results. It also helps you figure out how to change your workouts to avoid boredom, overuse
injuries
, and
plateaus
.
For example, walking three times a week for 30 minutes at a moderate pace might be a great place for a beginner to start. After a few weeks, however, your body
adapts
to these workouts and you will notice you burn fewer calories, you're bored, or your weight management efforts stall. It's at this point you want to adhere to one or more of the FITT principles. For example, you might:
Change frequency
by adding another day of walking
Change intensity
by walking faster or adding hills or running intervals
Change time
by walking for a longer time each workout day
Change the type
of workout by swapping one or more of your walks for
swimming
or
cycling
Even changing one of these elements can make a big difference in your workout and in how your body responds to exercise. Change things regularly to keep your body healthy and your mind engaged.
FITT Principle and Injury Prevention
One of the best things about using the FITT principle is that it allows you to monitor the length and intensity of your workouts. When you are working out too frequently or not getting enough rest, you run the risk of overuse injuries, burnout, and muscle strains.
Additionally, the FITT principle encourages you to add variety to your workouts. When you do this, you allow your body to rest and recover. Plus, you are not working the same muscle groups over and over again, which in the end will produce better results.
If you notice you are starting to have less energy, experience more aches and pains, or feel fatigued, make changes to your exercise regimen. If your symptoms persist, consult your healthcare provider. They can help pinpoint the root cause of your symptoms.
A Word From Verywell
The FITT principle is a well-established way of modifying and adapting exercise programming to fit your unique goals, lifestyle, preferences, and progress. You can change and modify each of the factors to suit these needs. Incorporating changes to frequency, intensity, time, and type of exercise helps to stave off boredom while also providing a framework for continued progress.

What is Balance?
How to Improve Balance
Exercises to Try
Considerations
Balance is a fundamental aspect of daily life, playing an integral role in everything from simple tasks such as walking and standing to more complex activities like playing soccer and lifting weights. It's the invisible glue that holds all movements together, helping you navigate your environment while keeping stable.
Balance involves
a complex system using vision, proprioception (body awareness), and the vestibular system (inner ear), all working together to maintain equilibrium. It includes how your body responds to movement, adjusts to various surfaces, and recovers from disturbances to your stability, like when you trip or stumble.
Poor balance increases the risk of falls, which are the leading cause of fatal and non-fatal injuries for older Americans, according to the National Council on Aging.
Even for younger individuals, a lack of balance can lead to sports injuries and impede overall physical performance. Improving balance is an important part of maintaining good health and longevity for healthy, active aging and an enjoyable life.
Understanding Balance
Balance is a complex process that relies on the coordination of three components: proprioception, vision, and the vestibular system.
Proprioception
, or body awareness, is your sense of self-movement and body position. It involves the ability to sense the position, location, orientation, and movement of the body and its parts. This is necessary for maintaining balance as it allows you to understand where your body is in space at any moment. Proprioception is primarily facilitated by receptors in your muscles and joints that send information to your brain about your body's position and movement, according to
Seth Forman
, M.Ed., Athletic & Sports Performance Trainer, CSCS and head of education and training for the Kayezen VECTOR System.
Vision
provides critical information to the brain about your environment. It helps you identify obstacles, judge distances, and perceive motion, all of which are essential for maintaining balance. Your eyes continuously scan your surroundings and send messages to your brain about changes in the environment, according to
Dr. Caryn McAllister
, PT, DPT, CEO of High Quality Home Therapy in Stamford, Connecticut. “This allows us to modify our movement in response to the directions and to predict which way we will move so our muscles can react appropriately to seamlessly maintain balance,” she explains.
The
vestibular system
, located in the inner ear, plays a vital role in maintaining balance by providing your brain with information about head position and movement and whether your body is moving up and down or forward at a slow or rapid pace, says
Dr. Debbie Dy
, Doctor of Physical Therapy and Orthopedic Clinical Specialist at Fusion Wellness & Physical Therapy in Los Angeles, CA. This system works closely with our vision and proprioception to ensure stability and a sense of equilibrium.
These three systems—proprioception, vision, and the vestibular system—work synergistically to maintain balance. Dr. McAllister explains these systems continuously provide the brain with sensory information, which it processes to send appropriate responses to your muscles and joints, ensuring stability and equilibrium. “Muscles contract and/or relax to prevent the body from falling in response to the incoming sensory input,” she says.
However, balance can be affected by various factors. Age-related changes, for instance, can lead to a decline in these systems, affecting balance. Other factors, such as certain medications, health conditions, and lack of physical activity, can also impact balance.
It's important to be aware of these factors and take steps to mitigate their impact, such as regular exercise and maintaining good overall health, says Dr. Dy.
Research has shown that exercise programs can reduce falls that cause injuries by 37%, serious injuries by 43%, and broken bones by 61%.
Simple Strategies for Better Balance
There are several ways to improve balance, such as working on your mobility and strength to improve posture and core engagement, using mindful movement and incorporating single-leg exercises into your routine.
Focus on Posture
Good posture is the cornerstone of balance. It provides a strong foundation, aligning the body in a way that optimizes stability. Forman says that if you have poor mobility, you will struggle to maintain the correct posture necessary for keeping your balance.
Maintaining a neutral spine, with the head aligned over the shoulders and the shoulders over the hips, can significantly improve balance. "Adopting a consistent mobility routine can be very beneficial to reverse the effects that repetitive motions or activities such as sitting, computer or desk work, or texting may have on your spinal posture," says Dr. Dy.
Strengthen Core Muscles
According to Dr. Dy, a strong core is essential for balance since the core muscles provide stability and support for the entire body, facilitating weight transfer from one leg to another and enabling us to navigate uneven terrain. Core-strengthening exercises, such as planks, bridges, and abdominal curls, can enhance balance by improving stability and body control.
Learning how to
correctly engage your core
, which includes your back, abdominals, and glutes, will also help you keep your balance. If your core is strong and stable, engaging your core can keep you upright when faced with balance challenges such as uneven terrain or stumbles.
5 Balance Exercises to Boost Stability
Mindful Movement
"Mindful movement entails listening to your body or checking in with your body as you move," says Dr. McAllister. Incorporating mindfulness into daily activities can significantly enhance body awareness and, in turn, improve balance. She recommends a physical activity “diet” where people engage in “movement snacks," which are short stints of activity spread over the day, making incorporating mindful movement activities easier to manage.
Mindful movement involves being fully present in the body and paying attention to how it feels during exercise. According to Dr. McAllister, practices like Qi Jong, Tai Chi, and yoga, which focus on the body-mind connection, can help improve balance, flexibility, strength, and mental health. Workouts on
a trampoline or rebounder
, for instance, can help improve proprioception, as can activities that combine footwork and balance with hand-eye coordination—such as hitting a ball with
a pickleball paddle
.

Single-Leg Exercises
Single-leg exercises are a great way to challenge and improve balance. Exercises like standing on one leg, leg lifts, and lunges can help strengthen the muscles used for balance, enhance proprioception, and improve stability.
These exercises can be included in your regular workout routine for optimal results. You can also add weights such as dumbbells or
a medicine ball
to make each move more challenging.
Single Leg Exercises
Single-leg stance for physiotherapy
Single-leg deadlift
Single-leg squat
Bulgarian split squat
Incorporating balance exercises into your regular routine is essential for lasting improvement since consistent practice helps the brain and body adapt and improve, leading to better balance over time, says Dr. McAllister.
Advanced Balance Exercises
Balance-Boosting Forms of Exercise
Other balance boosting forms of exercise include tai chi, yoga, and using a balance board or wobble cushion.
"The best exercise for an individual is what they enjoy, so preference should always come first. Nobody should do what doesn’t feel good, so it’s important that your body enjoys the activity you choose," says Dr. McAllister.
Tai Chi
Tai Chi is a form of exercise that offers balance, flexibility, and mindfulness benefits. This ancient Chinese martial art involves slow, deliberate movements, deep breathing, and focusing on the present moment. According to Dr. McAllister, the slow and controlled footwork of Tai Chi requires strength and good sensory input, naturally shifting your weight back and forth, which can help your body get used to balancing in various positions.
"It's gentle and never uses forced movements, so we tend to see fewer injuries in our adult patients who engage in Tai Chi. She explains that Tai Chi is easily adaptable, so it can benefit people recovering from surgeries or who cannot stand for long periods," she explains. Studies have shown that Tai Chi can reduce the risk of falls in older adults by up to 50%, making it a powerful tool for improving balance and overall health.
Yoga
Yoga is another excellent exercise for improving balance and
core strength
.
Specific yoga poses, such as
Tree Pose
, Warrior III, and Half Moon Pose, can
target balance
by challenging your stability and strengthening your core muscles.
Yoga also enhances body awareness, a key component of balance, by encouraging mindfulness and focus on the body's movements and sensations, says Dr. Dy. "Increasing body awareness is a great step towards strengthening the sensory systems involved with balance," she adds. Regular yoga practice can lead to significant improvements in balance, flexibility, and strength.
31 Yoga Poses for Beginners
Balance Boards and Wobble Cushions
Balance boards and wobble cushions are useful tools for challenging and improving balance since they provide an unstable surface that requires you to engage your core muscles and use a sense of balance to stay upright. According to Dr. Dy, they can help to strengthen the muscles used for balance, enhance proprioception, and improve stability.
"Performing exercises on unstable surfaces can be very beneficial to prepare our body and nervous system to navigate in the real world, as we know that walking surfaces are not always flat and smooth," says Dr. Dy, who recommends Airex pads. "Performing balance exercises on the soft foam will allow for greater reliance on the proprioceptive input from your feet and ankles," she adds.
Exercise balls
are also a great alternative, particularly since you can also use them for stretches.
Other Considerations
Other factors to consider that play a role in balance are footwear, vision, and hydration.
Footwear
Your
choice of footwear
can significantly impact balance. Shoes with good support and traction help provide a stable base.
Dr. McAllister says to look for
shoes with proper arch support
and a wide enough toe box to avoid squishing your toes, which are essential for balance. The soles should grip surfaces well and not slip, and if you're not wearing flat shoes, opt for a low, wide heel. Laces that tie well and don't come undone easily are also beneficial. When performing weight-bearing exercises such as strength training, it's better to wear
weightlifting shoes
to help you stabilize and brace properly to ensure correct form. According to Dr. McAllister, the proper footwear can enhance your balance and reduce the risk of slips and falls.
What to Look for in Footwear for Balance
Proper arch support
Wide enough toe box—don’t squish your toes—you need them for proper balance.
Soles that grip surfaces well and don’t slip
Low wide heel if not wearing flat shoes
Laces that tie will and don’t come undone easily
Vision Check-ups
Your balance relies on vision, proprioception, and vestibular senses to relay information from your body and the environment and maintain adequate balance, according to Dr. Dy. "When one of these systems is missing, your body has to adapt and rely more heavily on the other two. This can cause issues with balance and increase your risk of falls," she says. Regular eye exams can identify and address any vision issues promptly, preventing them from impacting balance, especially as you age.
Dr. McAllister says receiving one exam at least every 24 months for those between the ages of 18 and 64. After 64, the general rule of thumb is to have an exam at least every 1-2 years, but some people require it more frequently due to visual deficits
Hydration
Staying hydrated is vital for maintaining proper muscle function and balance. If you are dehydrated, Dr. Dy says it is common to become dizzy, which can sometimes be caused by low blood pressure. "It can also be caused by changes that occur to the vestibular system with dehydration, as the canals in the inner ear that give input to where your head is in space are filled with fluid," she explains. When the volume of this fluid is not stable, these sensory receptors can be off, causing the feeling of dizziness or vertigo.
9 Ways to Improve Your Balance
Improving balance is possible using tips such as maintaining good posture, strengthening core muscles, practicing mindful movement, and incorporating single-leg exercises. Balance-boosting exercises like Tai Chi, Yoga, and using balance boards can also be beneficial. Remember to ensure you have proper footwear, regular vision check-ups, and that you're staying hydrated. Prioritizing balance can lead to a safer, more confident, and joyful life. Embrace these strategies and activities to enhance your balance and overall health for years to come.

Why Trust Verywell Fit
Verywell Fit / Brian Kopinski
With its social aspects, simple rules, and health benefits, it's no wonder pickleball is one of the
fastest-growing sports
in the country. While the
required pickleball equipment
is minimal compared to other court sports, a reliable and practical pickleball bag is essential. The best pickleball bags allow players of all skill levels to conveniently store and sport their gear to and from the court.
Unlike traditional
gym bags
, pickleball bags have plenty of compartments for storing pickle-specific tools, like balls, paddles,
water bottles
, snacks, towels, and even shoes. While they can come in different styles and sizes—from the compact sling to the classic duffle—pickleball bags share one common purpose: to keep your essentials safely together so you can hit the court in style. To find the top options on the market, we first spoke to a pickleball expert to find out which
key features to look for
when shopping. Then,
we researched dozens of products
,
narrowing down bags based on their
style, design, size, capacity, storage compartments, and cost.
We also had a certified personal trainer from our
Review Board
review this article for accuracy, including how to shop for pickleball bags based on your needs.

Multiple pockets, adjustable shoulder straps, back support pads
Who It's For
Best for picklers who want a functional bag with lots of storage that is easy on the back.
Why We Love It
An all-in-one tote, the
Franklin Sports Pickleball Bag
is a great choice for any pickler who’s looking to
store everything
they need to hit the courts easily. It features
three zippered pockets
that can hold up to three paddles, two cans of balls, and sweaty socks or clothes. There's also a fence hook,
smaller compartments
to store your keys and phone, and a
mesh side pocket
for your water bottle—features that certified pickleball coach
Laurie Coyne
says are great to have.
Lugging all that gear around can strain your shoulders and back, but this pickleball bag has a
built-in cushioning system
that helps reduce the pressure. Plus, the
adjustable shoulder strap
lets you find the perfect fit for your body type. We also love that the bag is made of
lightweight yet durable polyester fabric
to withstand the wear and tear of frequent use—making it even more worth its already budget-friendly price. And the
zippers are weather-resistant
and constructed with an inverted design, so all your gear will stay safe and secure when moving.
Potential Flaws
This bag also doesn't have a specific shoe compartment, which is the only potential downside we could find.

Why We Love It
Affordability meets functionality with
LLYWCM’s Pickleball Bag.
This pick is made for
budget-conscious
picklers looking for a
reliable way to transport their gear
without breaking the bank. While the price is already a selling point for this sling-style bag, its
ultra-organized pockets
set it apart from the rest.
There are
five pockets in total,
each designed for a specific purpose—from holding up to
six paddles
and several balls to housing your keys, phone, and other small items. The
mesh side pocket
is perfect for storing your water bottle, while the
hidden back pocket
lets you keep valuable items safe and out of sight as you play. And, once you've tucked your gear away, you can
adjust the reversible strap
to easily switch between left and right-handed carry. We also love the top loop that allows you to hang the bag as you move about the court.
Potential Flaws
Some users say that the strap occasionally slips down and doesn’t stay secure on their shoulder, but we think that this bag still offers amazing value for the price.

Who It's For
Best if you want a light and easy-to-carry sling bag for storing just the essentials.
Why We Love It
Sling bags are a popular option for their convenience and portability, and
Athletico's Sling Bag
is no exception. With an
adjustable, reversible, and padded strap,
this bag is designed with your comfort in mind. Simply flip the strap to your preferred side and adjust the buckle until you find the perfect fit.
Along with optimal adjustability, we love that this bag provides
plenty of organization
for your gear. The largest compartment can
store up to six paddles,
while the four remaining pockets are great for carrying balls,
cooling towels
, and other smaller items. There's even a
felt-lined pocket specifically
designed to keep your phone safe and secure, so you can bring it along without worrying about scratches or damage. Plus, this bag also comes with a
one-year warranty,
so you can have peace of mind knowing that your investment is protected.
Potential Flaws
It's a little pricier than some other sling bag options on our list, but we think that the pro-grade sports polyester makes this bag well worth the cost upgrade.

Who It's For
Best if you want a spacious bag with tons of compartments to carry all your gear, and then some.
Why We Love It
Is a standard pickleball bag not cutting it for you? You may need to upgrade from that compact sling to a
large-capacity duffel
—like
Pickleball Fanatic's Duffel Bag.
The main, zippered compartment offers a roomy,
spacious interior
that's perfect for storing all of your pickleball gear. There’s
even room for additional accessories
like extra clothes, towels, or your favorite
protective sunscreen
.
Unlike other duffel bags, the main compartment is not the only pocket you’ll find. Located on the front side of the bag are not one, but
three pockets: one mesh, one drawstring, and one zippered.
We also love that there’s a
zippered shoe compartment
on the bottom of the bag that keeps your sweaty sneakers separate from the rest of your gear.
Potential Flaws
This bag may not be as stylish or as comfortable to carry as some other options on our list, but we still think it's worth it for serious picklers.

is your best bet. This luxurious tote bag features a
chic canvas body
(available in several patterns) and a
water-resistant nylon interior
with a pocket for balls, a water bottle sleeve, and a
zippered compartment to stow away valuables.
The exterior of the bag is just as impressive, with a
top carry handle and adjustable shoulder straps
for added convenience. There's also a
separate pocket to hold your paddle,
complete with a protective cover to help keep it safe. And for those who want to make their pickleball bag stand out from the rest,
monogramming is available
for an additional cost. Overall, this is an excellent pick if you want to
make a statement on the courts.
Potential Flaws
If you need to store more than one paddle, this tote won't have enough room for you.

Why We Love It
Boulder Bee’s Pickleball Tote Bag
is perfect for players who want
extra space for their gear
without the bulk of a full-sized duffel bag. It features an
isolated paddle pocket
on the exterior that can hold two paddles, plus a
large main compartment

The tote also has

two external side pockets
for storing drinks or smaller accessories, like a pair of
sports sunglasses
. This is a great choice for picklers who want spacious storage without sacrificing style.
Potential Flaws
While this tote offers plenty of room, it lacks size-specific internal pockets for organizing items like balls and valuables.
Also, while the isolated, external paddle pocket can fit two paddles, getting them in and out may be difficult because the space is quite small.

Potential Flaws
This bag is only meant for carrying one paddle, so it doesn't have extra storage for balls, shoes, and other valuables.

Best if you want a chic yet practical tote, whether it's for dominating the pickleball courts, traveling, or any other adventure.

Potential Flaws
This one's a bit pricier in our lineup, but we're sold on its versatility—not just on the courts but also in various other settings.
What to Look for When Shopping for a Pickleball Bag
Cost:
Prices vary greatly when it comes to pickleball bags—which is great because it means you can find one to fit almost any budget. Lower-priced options typically have fewer pockets and compartments, while higher-end bags may offer more features like adjustable straps and durable, waterproof materials.
Style and Design:
There are five main types of pickleball bags: duffels, backpacks, sling bags, totes, and single-paddle bags. Each style will offer unique storage features and a maximum capacity. Duffel bags and totes are great if you need a lot of storage space, while backpacks and sling bags are lightweight and easier to carry. Single-paddle bags are best for occasional players who don’t need to bring additional gear to the courts.
Size and Capacity:
The most important things to consider when purchasing a pickleball bag is size and maximum capacity. Ask yourself: What do I plan to store in this bag? If you're a casual player who only needs to bring along one paddle and a couple of balls, then a compact sling bag will do the trick. On the other hand, if you're planning on carrying several paddles, balls, and spare accessories (like clothing, shoes, or towels), then it's best to choose something with more storage space, like a duffel.
Compartments:
When it comes to compartments, look for pickleball bags with internal and external pockets. Internal pockets are perfect for keeping items like your phone or wallet safe, while external pockets can be used to store water bottles, balls, and other quick-access items. If it’s important to you, look for a bag with an isolated shoe compartment to bring your sweaty socks and sneakers on the go without stinking up your bag.
Materials:
Most pickleball bags are made with polyester, nylon, or a blend of the two. Both offer durability and flexibility, though nylon tends to be slightly stronger. Some bags also offer waterproofing, which is especially helpful if you live in a rainy or hot climate. Since pickleball courts tend to have a rugged, rough surface, you should avoid bags made from cotton that are not as durable, Coyne says.

How We Selected the Pickleball Bags
To find the best pickleball bags on the market, first spoke to a certified pickleball coach to learn more about the different types of pickleball bags and what to look for when shopping. Then, using the expert advice, we researched dozens of popular products, evaluating each one based on these four key criteria:
Capacity:
When shopping, one of the most important things to consider is capacity. In our research, we ensure that each bag can carry at least a paddle and a few balls—the minimum game-day essentials. From there, we explore bags with larger capacities to provide various options for each type of pickler. Our priority is to highlight bags with sufficient storage and easy portability.
Features:
Next, we evaluate each bag's features—like specialized pockets or adjustable straps—and consider whether they would improve our overall experience with the product. Ideally, we seek bags that bring something unique or special to the table.
Materials:
We also look at each bag's materials and construction: Does the fabric look durable? Are the zippers, hooks, or straps high quality? We avoid any bags that will not hold up to regular use or smelly socks and shoes.
Cost:
Finally, to diversify our list, we select an array of bags at various costs to meet the needs of every pickler, from the brand-new player to the veteran competitor.

Frequently Asked Questions
Can I use a regular gym bag or tennis bag for pickleball?
You can carry your gear in any bag of your choosing, but keep in mind that gym and tennis bags likely won’t feature specific compartments and slots that are designed to hold pickle-specific items. A pickleball bag may be the best choice to keep your gear well-organized and protected. It's also appropriate for carrying
padel racket
s and balls.
What should I pack in my pickleball bag?
At a minimum, you should pack a
pickleball paddle
, a few balls, and a water bottle. Depending on the size of your bag, you may also be able to fit extra items like sunglasses, sunscreen, snacks, a hat, a towel, and extra shoes.
What size bag should I get to fit all my pickleball equipment?
The size of pickleball bag you should purchase will depend on the gear you’ll bring to the court. If you want to carry multiple paddles, lots of balls, and some extra accessories, you should look for a backpack or duffle bag with lots of compartments. On the other hand, if you only have one paddle and a few balls, you can probably get away with a compact sling.

How to Plan Twice-Daily Workouts
Two-a-Day Training Ideas
Frequently Asked Questions
Working out twice a day is usually relegated to the world of high-level athletes training for a specific sport or competition. That, or celebrities with expensive in-home personal trainers. The average person has enough trouble
making time for a
single
workout
, much less carving out enough time for two bouts of exercise a day.
But that doesn't mean you should scoff at the concept altogether. Two-a-day workouts have their benefits, as long as you know how to implement the proper schedule for you to stay safe.
Benefits
Increased training volume
Reduced sedentary time
Performance gains
Accelerated muscle growth
Drawbacks
Higher overtraining risk
Increased injury risk
Benefits of Working Out Twice a Day
One of the most apparent benefits of two-a-day workouts is that you're logging more activity than if you were only exercising once. A 2017 study published in the
International Journal of Obesity
points to time spent sedentary as a clear risk factor for coronary heart disease and increased
waist circumference
.
So if you can increase your daily activity, that's a good thing.
But increasing your total daily activity isn't the only potential benefit.
Brandon Mentore
, a strength and conditioning coach and sports nutritionist, points out that two-a-day workouts are great for improving overall performance.
"Training twice in the same day can trigger accelerated
muscle growth
and strength gains," Mentore says. "Training volume is an essential factor for almost all fitness goals, and training several times a day allows you to squeeze in more volume,
increasing protein synthesis
, metabolic capacity, and anabolic output."
In other words, when programmed correctly, two-a-days could help you reach your goals faster. Plus, you may find that two shorter workouts are a better fit for your schedule than one longer one.
How Much Muscle Can You Gain in a Month?
Drawbacks
Aside from the fact that double the workouts mean double the sweaty laundry, the primary problem with two-a-days is that increased training volume puts you at greater risk for
overtraining
.
Exercise is considered a form of physical stress, and even though this type of stress stimulates physical adaptations that support all-around good health, adding too much at once can prove problematic.
"It can really tax your neuromuscular system," Mentore says. "Increasing your likelihood for injury, disrupting sleep patterns, suppressing your immune system, and many other symptoms if you don't take the time to
recover appropriately
."
As the adage goes, there
is
such a thing as too much of a good thing. So be aware of what you are doing and how your body is feeling. Don't try to push yourself beyond what you can handle. Overusing certain parts of your body, such as the elbow, can strain the muscles and tendons around it, which may necessitate the use of
a tennis elbow brace
.
Overtraining and Exercising Too Much
Advice for Beginners
Anyone
new to exercise
, or anyone who has taken a break from regular sweat sessions for several weeks or months, should not jump into a two-a-day training routine. For starters, there's no clear benefit to doing so.
There's also no guarantee you'll build muscle or burn fat faster or more efficiently by implementing a two-a-day plan, especially if you're a beginner.
The people who benefit most from this type of training are specifically training for a competition or event or those who have been exercising consistently and are looking for a way to
increase workload
in a way that naturally fits with their schedule.
Not to mention, most people doing two-a-days are doing so with the guidance of a trainer or coach. This helps ensure that the potential drawbacks of overtraining and injury risk are being monitored and, hopefully, managed appropriately.
How to Add More Movement to Your Day
If you're new to exercise or coming off a break, the best way to implement twice-daily workouts is to simply look for ways to increase your total daily activity level. This does not mean you head to the gym and pump iron for 30 minutes, then head back later in the day for a run on the treadmill. Rather, it's all about finding ways to
stay active throughout the day
. For instance:
Use a
foam roller
at night
if you did a morning strength training session. Rolling can relieve soreness, reduce inflammation, and increase your range of motion.
You can also try
a vibrating foam roller
, which has the added benefit of vibration therapy to help accelerate recovery.
Turn on music
while doing your regular housekeeping and dance as you go. Doing so will increase your heart rate and provide a little extra cardio, especially if you did
yoga
or
Pilates
earlier in the day.
Try taking a 10-minute walk
with your family after dinner. Afterward, spend a few minutes stretching together, especially if you don't have time to stretch immediately following a workout.
Small bouts of activity throughout the day can be a helpful way to gradually increase your workload over time. Just remember to take it slow and listen to your body's cues.
Two-a-Day Workout Plans for Fitness and Weight Loss
How to Plan Twice-Daily Workouts
Of course, no one wants to end up sick or injured. If you've been consistently exercising for at least six months and you plan to work out twice a day, you still have to be smart about implementing your plan. Mentore suggests these guidelines:
Allow at least six hours of space between
moderate-intensity
workouts
. So, if you finish your first workout at 8 a.m., you shouldn't start your next workout until at least 2 p.m. For higher-intensity activities, allow more time between sessions. Also, try changing into a
pair of slides
to aid in recovery after intense workouts.
Engage in strenuous training earlier in the day
and less demanding exercise during your second session. This keeps you on a steady schedule and supports continued recovery after your first, more challenging routine.
Perform longer workouts earlier in the day
and shorter workouts later. Sweating more in the morning may improve your mental health and make you more productive throughout the day—using
a good deodorant and antiperspirant
is also good practice, especially if you're not able to shower immediately afterward.
Prioritize nutrition and hydration between workouts
to prepare your body for the second session. Again, this supports recovery between and following each session.
Add naps to your day
to facilitate rest and recovery—sleep is critical to performance. Plus, naps can boost creativity, reduce stress, and increase alertness. They may even improve your motor skills and
improve your stamina
.
Start slow
. The more advanced or competitive you are, the more days in a row you can do two-a-days. However, typical "weekend warriors" shouldn't do more than two days in a row of multiple workouts. As your body adapts, you can gradually increase training volume.
Increase calorie and nutrient intake on rest days
to facilitate recovery, and make sure you pay attention to your sleep and stress management. Consider adding massage therapy—use
a massage gun
, for instance—or meditation to your recovery days.
Rest and Recovery After Exercise
Training Ideas
The nice thing about twice-daily workouts is that there's no "one size fits all" plan that everyone should follow. The decision to incorporate multiple workouts can be as simple as separating two types of training, such as
cardio
and strength work, rather than mashing them together into a single routine.
Or, if you want to add a new type of
training to your schedule
, but you can't fit both workouts into your lunch break, adding a second workout gives you the ability to accomplish multiple goals. Here are a few ways to try two-a-days:
Heavy Training Followed by Recovery
If you're bad about stretching after your typical routine, adding a second workout focused on recovery and
mobility
may be a good option. Your first session can incorporate your typical, heavy training, whether you strength train, do more intense cardio, or do high-intensity interval work.
Then later in the day, you can add a recovery workout consisting of low-intensity cardio, yoga,
stretching
, or foam rolling. Remember, recovery is just as important as strenuous exercise and will help reduce the likelihood of injuries. You can also try using
an acupressure mat
to ease muscle tension and promote relaxation and recovery.
Strength Training and Cardio
If you like doing strength training and cardio on the same day, but you hate how long it takes to do both, you may want to split your workout into two separate routines.
Start your morning with whichever workout is most taxing. If you tend to
lift heavy
, do your strength training in the morning, but if you're training for a race, run or bike first thing. Then do the opposite routine in the evenings.
Split Sessions
When you're training for a serious competition or event, splitting your training into two separate sessions is a good way to add miles or repetitions while giving your body rest between workouts.
For instance, if you're
training for a marathon
, you could split your miles into two running sessions, one in the morning and one in the evening. Likewise, if you're a strength athlete, you could lift certain muscle groups in the morning, and different ones in the evening.
A Word From Verywell
If you decide to try working out twice a day, ease your way into it. As Mentore suggests, don't start with more than two days in a row of twice-daily routines, and decrease your overall intensity for a few weeks before ramping up your effort. It takes time to acclimate to new stressors, so be smart and give yourself time to adjust.
Frequently Asked Questions
Will working out twice a day increase your metabolism?
Working out twice per day will not necessarily increase your metabolism. However, it can increase your daily total energy burn. Metabolism is complicated and can adapt to the stress you place on it. Too much activity without enough fuel can cause a drop in your metabolism.

What Is Metabolism and How Do I Change It?
Will working out twice a day help you lose weight?
Working out twice a day might help you lose weight but only if you also consume fewer calories in your diet than you burn. Note that if you are working out at a rate that is unsustainable, any weight you lose in not likely to be maintained.

What Is a Calorie Deficit?
Is it safe to work out twice a day?
Working out twice a day can be safe as long as you do not push your body past its limits. Be aware of how you are recovering and never sacrifice form. Changing into
recovery shoes
after intense workouts can also help with muscle fatigue. The safest way to workout twice per day is to have one of the workouts be recovery based, such as light swimming, hiking, cycling, or walking.

How to Use Active Recovery
Should you use post-workout supplements if you work out twice a day?
Post-workout supplements are not necessary if you are eating a well-balanced diet. If you find getting enough calories or protein difficult with so much activity, it may be worth considering a supplement such as protein powder.

Basics of Burning Fat
Fat Burning Zone Myth
Mixing Cardio Intensities
Exercising Consistently
Lifting Weights
Your body stores calories as fat to keep you alive and safe. Many gimmicks claim to amplify fat burning, such as working out in the fat-burning zone, spot reduction, and foods or supplements that supposedly make you burn more fat.
If you're looking for information on how to burn fat quickly, learn how to burn fat through movement instead of seeking a quick fix that won't work long-term. Read on for what you need to know.
Fat-Burning Zone: What It Is and How to Target It
How to Burn Fat
Exercise consistently
Perform a mix of high-, medium- and low-intensity cardiovascular exercise
Lift heavy weights
Try circuit training
Include
compound exercises
Watch your stress levels
Get enough sleep
Increase your
total daily energy expenditure
Eat the
correct number of calories for your goal
Basics of Burning Fat
If you're trying to reduce your body's fat stores, knowing how your body uses calories for fuel can make a difference in how you approach
weight management
. You get energy from fat,
carbohydrates
, and
protein
. Which one your body draws from for energy depends on the kind of activity you're doing.
Most people want to use fat for energy. It may seem that the more fat you can use as fuel, the less fat you will have in your body. But,
using
more fat doesn't automatically lead to
losing
more fat. Understanding how to burn fat starts with basic facts about how your body gets energy.
The body primarily uses fat and
carbohydrates
for fuel. The ratio of which fuels are utilized will shift depending on your activity. A small amount of protein is used during exercise, but it's mainly used to
repair muscles after exercise
.
Higher-intensity
exercises such as
running
cause the body to rely on carbs for fuel. The metabolic pathways available to break down
carbs for energy
are more efficient than those for fat breakdown. Fat is used more for energy than carbs for long, slower exercise.
This is a simplified look at energy with a solid take-home message. Burning more calories matters more than using fat for energy. The harder you work, the more calories you will burn overall.
It doesn't matter what type of fuel you use for
weight loss
. What matters is how many calories you burn.
Think about it this way—when you sit or sleep, you're in your prime fat-burning mode. But you probably don't think of sitting and sleeping more as a pathway to losing body fat. The bottom line is that just because you're using more fat as energy doesn't mean you're burning more calories.
Myth of the Fat-Burning Zone
Exercising at lower intensities will use more fat for energy.
This basic premise started the theory of the fat-burning zone: exercising in a certain
heart rate zone
(around 55% to 65% of your
maximum heart rate
) will allow your body to burn more fat.
Over the years, this theory has become so ingrained in the exercise experience that we see it touted in books, charts, websites, magazines, and even on
cardio machines
at the gym. The trouble is that it's misleading.
Working at lower intensities can be great, but it won't necessarily burn more fat. One way to increase your calorie burn is to exercise at higher intensities.
This doesn't necessarily mean that you should avoid
low-intensity exercise
if you want to burn more fat. There are some specific things you can do to burn more fat and it all starts with how often and for how long you exercise.
Burn Fat With a Mix of Cardio
You may be confused about exactly how hard to work during
cardio
. You may even think that
high-intensity exercise
is the only way to go. After all, you can burn more calories and you don't have to spend as much time doing it.
But variety can help you stimulate your energy systems, protect you from overuse injuries, and help you enjoy your workouts more. You can
set up a cardio program
with various exercises at different intensities.
High-Intensity Cardio
For our purposes,
high-intensity cardio
falls between 80% to 90% of your maximum heart rate (MHR). Or, if you're not using heart rate zones, about a six to eight on a
10-point perceived exertion scale
. This is exercising at a level that's challenging and leaves you too breathless to talk in complete sentences.
But you're not going all-out, like
sprinting
as fast as you can. There's no doubt that some
high-intensity training
can be helpful for weight loss as well as improving endurance and aerobic capacity.
You can get the same benefit from
short workouts
spread throughout the day as you do with continuous workouts. For example, a 150-pound person would burn about 341 calories after running at 6 mph for 30 minutes.
If this person walked at 3.5 mph for that same length of time, they would burn 136 calories.
But, the number of calories you can burn isn't the whole story. Too many
high-intensity workouts
every week can put you at risk in a number of ways.
Potential Risks
If you do too many high-intensity workouts, you put yourself at risk for:
Burnout
Hating exercise
Inconsistent workouts
Overtraining
Overuse injuries
If you don't have much experience with exercise, you may not have the conditioning or desire for breathless and challenging workouts. If you have any medical condition or injury, check with a healthcare provider before training.
If you're doing several days of cardio each week, you would probably want only one or two workouts to fall into the high-intensity range.
You can use other workouts to target different fitness areas (like endurance) and allow your body to recover. Here are some examples of how to incorporate high-intensity workouts.
Exercising at a fast pace for a 20-minute workout keeps you in the high-intensity work zone. Twenty minutes is usually the recommended length, and most people wouldn't want to go much longer.
Tabata training
is another high-intensity interval training in which you work hard for 20 seconds, rest for 10 seconds, and repeat for 4 minutes. In this workout, you should be breathless and unable to speak.
Additionally,
interval training
is a
great way to incorporate high-intensity training without doing it continuously. Alternate a hard segment (e.g., running fast for 30 to 60 seconds) with a recovery segment (e.g., walking for 1 to 2 minutes). Repeat this series for the length of the workout, usually around 20 to 30 minutes.
Moderate-Intensity Cardio
There are a variety of definitions of what
moderate-intensity exercise
is, but it typically falls between 70% to 80% of your maximum heart rate. That would be a level four to six on a 10-point perceived exertion scale. You are breathing harder than usual but can carry on a conversation without difficulty.
Schedule your day around exercise instead of trying to squeeze it in. Making your workout a priority increases the chances that you will accomplish your goal. The American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) often recommends this level of intensity in its exercise guidelines. The lower end of this range usually incorporates the fat-burning zone.
Moderate-intensity workouts also have great benefits. For instance, even modest movement can improve your health while lowering your risk of heart disease, diabetes, and high blood pressure. Also, it takes time to build the endurance and strength to handle challenging exercises. Moderate workouts allow you to work at a more comfortable pace, which means you may be more consistent with your program.
You also can usually get into the moderate heart rate zones with a variety of activities. Even raking leaves or shoveling snow can fall into that category if you do it vigorously enough.
Examples of Moderate-Intensity Workouts
For
weight management
, you would likely want most cardio workouts to fall into the moderate range. Some examples include:
A 30- to 45-minute cardio machine workout
A
brisk walk
Riding a bike at a moderate pace
Low-Intensity Activity
Low-intensity exercise is below 60% to 70% of your MHR, or about a level three to five on a 10-point perceived exertion scale. This level of intensity is no doubt one of the most comfortable areas of exercise, keeping you at a pace that isn't too taxing and doesn't pose much of a challenge.
This fact, along with the idea that it burns more fat, makes
low-intensity exercise
popular. But, as we've learned, working at a variety of intensities is ideal for weight loss.
That doesn't mean low-intensity exercise has no purpose.
It involves the long, slow activities you could do all day. Even better, it includes activities you usually enjoy, such as taking a stroll, gardening, riding a bike, or a gentle stretching routine.
Low-intensity cardio can be everyday activities like taking an extra lap when shopping,
taking the stairs
, parking farther from the entrance, and doing more physical chores around the house. Exercise such as
Pilates
and
yoga
are lower intensity but help develop your core, flexibility, and balance. They can be a part of a well-rounded fitness routine.
Importance of Consistent Exercise
It may seem like a no-brainer that regular exercise is key for how to burn fat. But it's not just about the calories you're burning; it's also about adaptations your body makes when you exercise regularly. Many of those adaptations lead directly to your ability to burn more fat without trying.
Benefits of Consistent Exercise
Here are some benefits of consistent exercise.
Become more efficient
:
Your body becomes more efficient at delivering and extracting oxygen. Simply put, this helps your cells burn fat more efficiently.
Have better circulation
:
This allows fatty acids to move more efficiently through the blood and into the muscle. That means fat is more readily available to fuel the body.
Increase the number and size of mitochondria
: These are the cellular power plants that provide energy inside each cell of your body.
Lift Weights to Burn Fat
Adding muscle by
lifting weights
and other resistance exercises can also help burn fat.
While many people focus more on
cardio for weight loss
, there's no doubt that strength training is a key component in any weight loss routine. Here are some benefits of weight training.
Burn More Calories at Rest
If you lift weights at a higher intensity, you can increase your afterburn, or the calories you burn after your workout. That means you burn calories during workouts—and after your workouts, while your body returns to its resting state.
Keep Metabolism Going
A diet-only approach to weight loss could lower a person's
resting metabolic rate
by up to 20% a day. Lifting weights and maintaining muscle helps keep your metabolism elevated, even if you're cutting your calories.
Preserve Muscle Mass
If you are restricting calories, you risk losing muscle. Muscle is
metabolically active
, so when you lose it, you also lose the extra calorie burn muscles produce.
To start, choose a basic
total body workout
and do that about twice a week, with at least one day in between. As you get stronger, you can do more exercises, increase intensity, or add more days of strength training. It may take a few weeks but you'll eventually see and feel a difference in your body.
Strategies
Here are strategies to burn more fat when strength training.
Incorporate circuit training
:
Circuit training is a great way to burn more calories by combining high-intensity cardio with strength training exercises. You keep your heart rate elevated by moving from one exercise to another with little or no rest while focusing on cardio and strength in the same workout.
Lift heavy weights
: If you're a beginner, work up to heavy weights over time. Once your body is ready for more,
lifting heavy weight
forces your body to adapt by building lean muscle tissue to handle that extra load.
Use compound movements
: Movements that
involve more than one muscle group
(e.g.,
squats
,
lunges
,
deadlifts
, and
triceps dips
) help you lift more weight and burn more calories while functionally training the body.
If you want a more structured program, try a
four-week slow-build program
that includes a schedule of cardio and strength workouts to increase your intensity gradually.
A Word From Verywell
When it comes to how to burn fat, you have to work at it. The good news is that it doesn't take much activity to push the body into its fat-burning mode.
Try incorporating activity every day, even if it's just a quick walk. Then, build on that over time. Soon you're on the way to burning more fat. It also can be beneficial to work with a registered dietitian or
certified personal trainer
to develop a more individualized program.

"Man boobs" can be an enlargement of breast tissue due to hormone changes that result in gynecomastia—a condition that occurs most frequently during puberty and the aging process. Or, an increase in total body fat may cause enlarged pectoral fat stores; this is often called "pseudo-gynecomastia."
Both conditions are common and generally nothing to worry about, often resolving on their own as hormone levels normalize.
But if an increase in chest size due to increased fat stores has led to self-consciousness or embarrassment, you can perform exercises to help get rid of man boobs and
reduce total body fat percentage
.
In some instances, gynecomastia is a sign of other conditions. If you're concerned or experiencing other symptoms like swelling, pain, or nipple discharge, schedule an appointment with your doctor.
How to Get Rid of Chest Fat (Colloquially Known as Man Boobs)
Spot reduction
, or selecting where on your body to try to lose fat, isn't possible. Cranking out
bench presses
in the hopes of reducing fat in your chest isn't the best approach. While bench presses can help build muscle mass in your pecs, exercise that only focuses on your chest is unlikely to
speed metabolism
enough to garner
significant fat loss
.
Your best bet is to follow a
total-body workout routine
that hits all major muscle groups, combining
strength training
with
cardiovascular exercise
. This approach helps speed your metabolism during and following exercise while simultaneously building muscle mass.
The one-two punch of
fat loss and muscle gain
garners the most visible and lasting results. As you lose fat throughout your body, you'll notice changes in the size and shape of your chest.
To get rid of man boobs, or chest fat, you will need to reduce your total body fat with consistent exercise and proper nutrition. Eat fewer calories than you burn with strength training, cardio, and eating a bit less than you would to maintain weight.
Consistency is key. Your fat stores didn't grow overnight and you can't expect fat loss to occur at the drop of a hat. Perform the following workout at least three days a week for two to four months before gauging your initial results.
As you develop your
workout habits
, remember that nutrition is a vital component of fat loss. Focus on eating lots of produce, lean meats, and whole grains while avoiding refined or
processed foods
. With consistent work toward an overall healthy lifestyle, you will begin to see results.
The Circuit Workout
Perform this
circuit workout
by completing all eight exercises back to back, resting for 2 minutes, then repeating the circuit two to four times. Rest as little as possible between exercises. The total workout should take between 20 and 45 minutes, depending on how many rounds you do and how long it takes to move between exercises.
Equipment Required:
Medicine ball
(preferably a wall ball-style medicine ball)
Dumbbells
We've tried, tested, and reviewed the
best dumbbells
. If you're in the market for dumbbells, explore which option may be best for you.
Jumping Jacks
Time
: 60 seconds
Start your routine by performing jumping jacks. This equipment-free move will
raise your heart rate
and help you warm up for the rest of your workout.
Stand with your feet together, hands at your sides. Jump your feet out laterally while simultaneously swinging your arms overhead. Immediately after landing, jump your feet back to the center while bringing your arms back to your sides.
If excess body weight or
injuries
prevent you from comfortably performing a traditional jumping jack, modify the exercise by stepping your right foot out to the side as you swing your arms overhead, then step back to center as you swing your arms back to your sides. Repeat with your left leg and continue this pattern for 60 seconds.
Medicine Ball Passes
Time
: 60 seconds
This exercise will target your entire body with a focus on the large muscle groups of your
quads
(thighs),
hamstrings
,
glutes
(butt),
chest
,
shoulders
, and
core
.
Stand about an arm's length away from a sturdy wall, holding a medicine ball in both hands at your chest. Press your hips back, bend your knees, and lower your glutes toward the ground.
When you've squatted as low as possible, reverse the movement, pressing forcefully through your heels to extend your knees and hips. As you do so, explosively throw the medicine ball as high as you can against the wall.
As the medicine ball comes down, catch it with both hands, secure it back at your chest, and immediately lower yourself into another
squat
to continue.
Renegade Rows
Time
: 60 seconds
The renegade row targets the large muscle groups of your
back
and
biceps
while also requiring the engagement of the
core
,
quadriceps
,
shoulders
, and
triceps
.
Start in a high
plank position
with your body forming a straight line from heels to head, and your hands directly under your shoulders. Grip a dumbbell in each hand.
From this position, shift your weight slightly to the right while keeping your torso squared to the ground. Pull the dumbbell in your left hand straight up toward your chest while keeping your arm close to your body—your elbow should point up toward the ceiling.
Lower the dumbbell back to the ground in a controlled fashion, then switch sides, this time shifting your weight to the left before pulling the dumbbell in your right hand to your torso. Continue alternating sides while keeping your hips, shoulders, and torso as steady as possible.
Modification
If you're having a hard time completing the exercise for a full 60 seconds in the plank position, lower your knees to the ground.
Single-Arm Dumbbell Chest Presses
Time
: 30 seconds per arm
The single-arm dumbbell
chest press
targets your pecs, shoulders, and
triceps
while requiring core engagement to prevent your hips or shoulders from twisting during the exercise.
Lie on a sturdy bench with your knees bent and feet flat on the floor. Position a dumbbell in your right hand, your arm extended directly over your chest. Place your left hand lightly on your left hip as a reminder to keep that hip stable and engaged with the bench.
In a controlled fashion, bend your right elbow, lowering the dumbbell toward your chest. When the dumbbell is an inch or two away from your chest, reverse the movement and engage your
pecs
and triceps to press the dumbbell straight up, back to the starting position.
Continue for 30 seconds before switching sides.
Mountain Climbers
Time
: 60 seconds
Mountain climbers
offer another burst of cardio in the middle of your circuit to keep your heart rate high. The body position also requires continued engagement of the chest, shoulders, and triceps, which is especially challenging after completing a strength exercise targeting the same muscle groups.
Start in a high plank position, palms under the shoulders, legs extended, and core engaged to keep the hips level. Draw your right knee toward your chest, and plant your right foot on the ground, as if you were about to take off in a sprint.
From this position, jump both feet into the air, switching their positions before you land so your left foot is drawn forward and your right foot is extended. Immediately jump both feet into the air again and switch their position. Continue this pattern for the duration of the exercise.
Modification
Start in a high plank position, legs extended. Draw your right knee forward, touching your right foot to the ground before immediately extending your right leg again, planting it in the original plank position. Switch sides, draw your left knee forward, and tap your left foot on the ground. Continue alternating sides for the duration of the exercise.
Overhead Walking Lunges
Time
: 60 seconds
The overhead
walking lunge
hits the major muscles of your lower body—your hamstrings, quads, and glutes—while simultaneously challenging your shoulders and core.
Hold a medicine ball between both hands and extend it directly overhead. Step forward with your right foot, planting it a couple of feet in front of your left foot. Engage your core to keep your torso tall and bend both knees, lowering your left knee toward the floor.
Just before your knee touches down, press through your right foot and rise to stand as you propel your left foot forward, taking a step in front of your right. Repeat the lunge and continue the exercise, stepping forward with the opposite foot with each repetition.
Pushups
Time
: 60 seconds
You've already targeted your chest, triceps, shoulders, and core throughout this routine, so expect to burn out these muscle groups with a series of
pushups
. Drop your knees to the ground or move to a wall to decrease the difficulty of the exercise.
Start in a high plank position with your hands directly under your shoulders, but slightly wider than shoulder-width apart. Keeping your core tight and your torso steady, bend your elbows and lower your body toward the floor.
When your chest touches the ground, reverse the movement, pressing through your palms as you extend your elbows, returning to the high plank position. Continue the exercise, switching to a modified version as needed to complete the set.
Medicine Ball Rainbow Slams
Time
: 60 seconds
For a final core-focused exercise that also challenges the entire upper body, grab a medicine ball for a series of
rainbow slams
. Use a medicine ball without much bounce, like a wall ball.
Kneel on the ground on a mat and hold a medicine ball between both hands at your chest. Lift the ball over your head and twist your torso slightly to the right, drawing the medicine ball to your right side as you forcefully use your arms and core (particularly your
obliques
) to slam the ball down on the ground to the outside of your right knee.
Pick the ball up with both hands, lift it up and over your head, this time twisting your torso to the left before using your core and upper body to slam the ball down to the outside of your left knee. Continue alternating sides for the duration of the exercise.

You may have loose skin if you have lost
a large amount of weight
. You are not alone, as loose or saggy skin is a common problem after losing a large amount of weight (100 pounds or more) quickly. In time, you may see improvements in your skin's elasticity, but some people may require surgery to remove excess skin.
What Influences Your Skin's Elasticity
No two people have the same skin, and an identical amount of weight loss will look different on different people. Several factors determine how your skin will react to weight loss:
Age
: As you get older, your skin becomes less elastic.
Amount of weight lost
: Weight loss of 100 pounds or more typically results in more hanging skin.
Genetics
: Genes influence how much firmness your skin retains. Some people are just more susceptible to sagging skin than others.
How long you've been overweight
: If you're overweight for a more extended period, your skin may not be able to contract when you lose weight.
How quickly you lose weight
: When you lose weight quickly, such as with
weight loss surgery
, your skin's elasticity doesn't have time to catch up. The result is loose skin.
Nutrition and water intake
: Your skin may not be as healthy or firm if you aren't getting balanced nutrition, vitamins, and minerals (especially
vitamins C
and
E
) and
staying hydrated
.
Smoking
:
Smoking
can speed up the normal aging process of your skin.
Sun exposure
: Your past, present, and future exposure to the sun can damage your skin.
How Do I Get Rid of Loose Skin after Weight Loss?
How to Avoid Loose Skin
While you won't be able to completely prevent loose skin if you're losing significant amounts of weight, there are some ways to help avoid as much sagging as possible.
Lose Weight Slowly
Losing weight slowly is the best way to avoid excessive sagging. Most experts recommend aiming for 1 to 2 pounds a week, which translates to 4 to 8 pounds per month. This will help you lose more fat than muscle and allow your skin to adjust as you lose weight.
Focus on Nutrition
Getting adequate macronutrients and micronutrients is essential to maintaining your skin's health and elasticity. Skin-nourishing foods contain
unsaturated
and
polyunsaturated
fatty acids; vitamins A, C, and E;
selenium
; zinc; copper;
polyphenols
; and
carotenoids
.
Prioritize Fitness
Working toward improving your fitness is a worthy goal, but it can also benefit the skin. For example, one study suggests that exercisers are more likely to have moist skin.
Some studies have investigated whether exercise can boost collagen production, but more research is needed. Exercise does increase blood flow, which is beneficial for the skin.
Walking for Weight Loss: How to Burn More Calories and Lose Weight
How to Tighten Loose Skin
Because we're all different, people will respond differently after losing weight. Some people may bounce back quickly, while others may consider body contouring surgery to remove extra skin. Body contouring is an expensive and serious procedure requiring a long recovery time.
Plastic surgery experts recommend waiting at least a year after weight loss to allow your weight to stabilize before considering body contouring plastic surgery.
You may be able to make a difference with other options, such as exercise and a
healthy diet
. A
basic cardio
and
strength training
program can help you reduce body fat while building muscle. When you add muscle, you can improve how the skin looks and may be able to reduce some sagging.
A Word From Verywell
People who lose moderate weight at a measured pace usually see their skin return to a normal appearance. However, those who lose more than 100 pounds or lose weight quickly may be frustrated that they are left with loose skin after their efforts. There are ways to maximize your skin's elasticity through nutrition, and building and maintaining fitness will help the skin's appearance. Ask a healthcare professional for advice if you are concerned about loose skin.
Frequently Asked Questions
Does loose skin after weight loss go away?
Some loose skin could go away after a small or moderate weight loss. When you lose a larger amount of weight, especially if you lose weight quickly, loose skin may stick around. It is important to know there are options you can discuss with a healthcare provider.
How does resistance training impact loose skin?
Resistance training does not tighten up loose skin, but rather increases muscle mass. Increasing muscle mass can help fill the void left by excess fat, making the skin appear less loose. This is especially true with muscles of the arms, legs, back, and shoulders. It is less likely to make a difference on abdominal skin, although increasing core strength will benefit your body all around.
Are there exercises that can target loose skin?
Skin cannot be spot-tightened through exercise. However, exercise can help build muscle, which may help reduce the appearance of loose skin. In addition, some studies suggest exercise in general can lead to beneficial changes in the skin.

Verywell / Sabrina Huang
People work with personal trainers for many reasons. Whether you want to develop an individualized program to support weight-loss goals, get in shape, or need the accountability or instruction a personal trainer can provide, they can be a great resource.
But sometimes, people are cautious about investing in personal trainers. Cost can be an issue; some people might feel intimidated by working with a pro. However, certified fitness professionals are trained to work with clients of all backgrounds and fitness levels. And many can work out package deals to make their services more affordable.
If you are starting an exercise program or don't see results with your current routine (such as
relying on a fitness mirror
), a
personal trainer
might be your best option. Here are 10 reasons why you might want to hire a personal trainer.
What Does a Personal Trainer Do?
Personal trainers work with you one-on-one to design an engaging exercise regimen, help you with form, ensure you are working all muscle groups safely, and more. The accountability of meeting your trainer for a set appointment can help stay on track and meet your wellness goals. Personal trainers are excellent resources for beginners who need help getting started as well as for more seasoned exercisers who want to push themselves further.
You're Not Seeing Results
If you've been exercising consistently for several weeks or months and aren't reaching your goals (whether you are seeking to
lose weight
, improve your performance at a sport, or build strength), there are a few ways a personal trainer might be able to help.
Evaluate Your Current Program and Goals
By looking at what you're already doing, a personal trainer can suggest ways to change or tweak your workouts to make them more efficient and effective. A personal trainer can help determine if your
fitness goals
are realistic.
Help You Stay Motivated and Keep Pushing
Knowing you have an appointment with a pro can help you stay motivated to exercise. People often don't see results because they're not working as hard as they could.
It's easy to slack off when you're alone, but having a personal trainer challenge you (and cheer you on) can make a difference. A trainer can help you set weekly goals, then check in regularly to see how you're doing, keeping you motivated and pushing toward your goals.
Provide Educated Advice
Whether you want to learn to lift weights properly or perform a new exercise, a personal trainer is a wealth of fitness knowledge. For example, you might think you need to focus on
cardio to lose weight
, but you need strength training and core training, too,
and a personal trainer can help you set up a plan.
You may be getting results—just not in the way you expected. You might gain muscle and lose fat, changing your body composition while your weight stays constant. While this is rare for those who've been training consistently, it's a phenomenon that happens frequently among new lifters.
A personal trainer can see your situation more clearly from the outside and offer you a new perspective.
You may only need a few sessions with a personal trainer to hone your skills or get inspired. Once you have new ideas for exercises and workouts, you can always get back to a routine on your own.
You Don't Know Where to Start
We're not born knowing
how to exercise
, or how to design a
complete program
that includes
cardio
,
weight training
, and
flexibility training
, which specific exercises to do for each of those, and how to fit it into a busy schedule. Facing the task can feel so overwhelming that you don't do anything.
A trainer can help you with the basics. Your workouts should be based on the
F.I.T.T. principle
: You choose the
frequency
,
intensity
,
time
,
and
type
of workout and manipulate these elements over time.
How a Personal Trainer Can Help
Suggesting activities that work for your body, schedule, and available equipment
Helping you figure out how hard to work during exercise and how to monitor your intensity
Showing you how to choose exercises, weights, reps, and sets
Using different tools (such as a heart rate monitor,
weightlifting app
, or activity tracker) to enhance your workouts
Teaching you how to get the most out of your workout while also making sure you don't overdo it
You're Bored With Your Workouts
If you're an experienced exerciser, you may not have considered working with a personal trainer. However, it can be a great choice if you need some variety in your workouts.
It's easy to fall into a workout rut, doing the same workouts repeatedly. This isn't just boring; it can also lead to
weight-loss plateaus
, overuse injuries, and
burnout
.
If you're already workout-savvy, consider hiring a personal trainer for a fresh perspective to continue challenging yourself toward your goals with an objective eye.
They might see areas of your
workout program
that could be adjusted to make your fitness routine more interesting, more challenging, or just more fun. A personal trainer will review your workout performance and let you know areas to improve or where you can push yourself a little harder.
Personal trainers are experienced in many different types of workouts. Find someone to show you the ropes if there's one you've wanted to try. This could mean
high-intensity interval training
(
Tabata training
), different strength training methods, including
supersets
and
pyramid training
, or new equipment like the water-filled Kamagon Ball.
A personal trainer offers a fresh perspective and new ideas to challenge your body and your mind. Even if you only have a few sessions or meet every few weeks, it can be refreshing to have new workouts and exercise equipment to try.
You Need to Be Challenged
If you feel stuck or ready to take your training to the next level, an experienced personal trainer can help you find ways to challenge yourself.
Trainers can help find and train for competitive events like a "Tough Mudder" (where you run through an obstacle course) or a local
marathon
.
If you've hit a plateau in your progress, trainers can be a tool for change. They can switch up your programming to add volume or intensity to keep you progressing. A personal trainer can help you choose correct weights and spot you as you do more challenging exercises.
A personal trainer can also engage in the workout with you, adding a competitive element to your workouts or helping you with partner exercises.
You'll find it's tough to slack off with a trainer standing over you, telling you to do just
one more rep.
You may even find you have hidden strengths to tap, which can motivate you even more.
You Want to Learn How to Exercise on Your Own
Even if your goal is to create your own workouts and exercise by yourself, hiring a personal trainer for a few sessions offers the benefit of helping you learn the right way to perform a new exercise. This is especially true if you're new to
strength training
and need to practice. A personal trainer can:
Teach You Exercise Varieties and Form
This knowledge is gold, especially for the home exerciser. Knowing a variety of exercises that target different muscles allows you to create your own workouts.
To get the most out of your workouts and avoid injury, you need to perform each exercise in a certain way. A personal trainer can offer cues to help get your body into the right position to ensure you perform each move correctly (and safely).
Provide Information for Program Design
A personal trainer can help you decide how often to lift weights and how to choose your weights, sets, and reps. They can create a variety of workouts for you to continue doing when you're ready to go out on your own.
Trainers can also teach you which exercises work for each muscle group so you know what to choose when designing a plan. Learning about your muscles, as well as how they work, is essential if you plan to work out on your own at home or at the gym.
Even after you stop training, a personal trainer can still be an available resource. Most trainers are fine with you contacting them from time to time for advice and you can always go back to training at any time.
You Need Accountability and Motivation
Motivation comes from all kinds of places, both internally and externally. You may already have some intrinsic motivation to exercise, such as wanting to be healthier or to get off your high blood pressure medication.
You also need extrinsic motivators to keep exercising. A personal trainer can be that motivator. By hiring a trainer, you're creating
motivation
in several different areas:
Accountability and Commitment
Your trainer will probably ask about your week, wanting to know if you did your workouts and how your eating plan is going. Knowing that you'll have to report in can make you less likely to
skip your workouts
.
There's nothing like a regular standing appointment to get you in gear for a workout—you don't want to let down a trainer or yourself. It might even inspire you to start logging your activities and goals in
a fitness journal
to better track your progress.
Time and Money
You're investing money into reaching your goal. Just showing up for your sessions to ensure you don't lose the money might be all you need to keep going.
Money isn't the only thing you're investing—you're also investing time, which is a precious resource. Some people feel more motivated when they've committed to something with their dollars.
You Have a Specific Illness, Injury, or Condition
If you have a specific injury or condition, your doctor may want you to exercise—but how do you do that if you're in pain or have to work around an injury?
That's where an experienced trainer comes in. Personal trainers work with all kinds of people. Many trainers even have specialties that allow them to work with special needs clients.
How a Personal Trainer Can Help
Creating a program that works on the areas you need without risking new or re-injury, as well as dealing with old or chronic injuries
Coming up with a fitness plan if you're pregnant or ​want to become pregnant
Exercising with a chronic health condition such as arthritis,
diabetes
, or heart disease
Increasing your balance
,
core strength
, and stability if you've had a fall or need to work on those areas.
Overcoming back or neck pain
Before you start working with a personal trainer, there are a few essential things to keep in mind:
Always talk to your doctor and get clearance for exercise
. If you have a specific medical condition, your trainer might require your doctor's OK before they will work with you.
Work with your physical therapist
(if you have one). Your trainer might want to get in touch with your physical therapist to find out what exercises you should (or shouldn't) do.
Make sure your trainer is experienced with your condition.
Ask about any classes or certifications they have taken to ensure the personal trainer knows what they're doing.
You're Training for a Sport or Event
An experienced personal trainer can greatly help if you're into a specific sport or training for an upcoming event.
Whether you're a
golfer
, a
runner
, or into
cycling
, there's likely a personal trainer out there who can help you to up your game. Just make sure they have specific education in an area like sports conditioning or a related field. Specialized trainers can:
Create Effective Workouts and Schedules
A sports conditioning trainer knows what exercises to do for a specific sport, such as golf or basketball. They can help you develop workouts to strengthen the areas you need to work on while avoiding overdoing it.
Training is about more than working out. You also need to have the right amount of
recovery time
. A personal trainer can help you create a program that allows your body to get the most out of your workout while also giving it time to heal and recover. This type of personal coaching can also help you better analyze fitness tracker metrics to make the most out of your device's functionality, whether it's a
Whoop or a Fitbit
.
Help Avoid Injury and Burnout
One primary concern in sports is that making the same motions repeatedly can cause an overuse injury.
A trainer can help you cross-train, allowing your muscles to rest or work differently.
Personal trainers will help with fatigue management, which is crucial for avoiding overtraining and burnout.
They will incorporate rest and
recovery techniques
for you to follow and monitor your symptoms.
Overtraining Syndrome: Warning Signs and How to Cut Back
You Want Supervision or Support During Workouts
Even if you know how to exercise and do so correctly, you might like to have a personal trainer around for support and supervision.
How a Personal Trainer Can Help
Being a workout buddy
:
A trainer can do more than tell you what to do; they can guide you through your workouts and even do them alongside you.
Keeping you in line
: If you know you tend to slack on your own, a trainer may motivate you to work harder because you know they're right there watching.
Motivating you
: If you find it hard to exercise alone, having someone arrive at your door (or having an appointment to hit the gym or fitness studio) can motivate you to show up and do the work.
Spotting you
: If you're lifting heavy weights, a personal trainer can help
keep you safe
and rack your weights.
You Want to Work Out at Home
If you'd like to
exercise at home
but you don't have a lot of equipment or aren't sure how to use what you have, in-home personal training is an excellent choice. Look for trainers in your area who offer that option.
Benefits of At-Home Workouts
Convenience
: You don't have to pack a bag or drive to the gym if your personal trainer comes to you.
Equipment ideas
:
A trainer might bring equipment with them but can also make recommendations for home exercise equipment to help you reach your goals (i.e., equipment worth the investment).
Instruction
: A personal trainer can show you how to use standard workout tools like
resistance bands
, dumbbells, and an
exercise ball
. A good trainer can also show you how to use unexpected equipment like a
staircase
, a couch, a chair, or paper plates.
Privacy
: Working out in your own space instead of a gym. It can be more comfortable and make you
feel less self-conscious
.
Variety
: A trainer can also change your workouts as often as possible to ensure you don't get bored.
What to Look for in a Personal Trainer
Most gyms have personal trainers on staff and offer attractive packages for one-on-one training. You can also look online to find trainers in your area.
The cost of a personal training session will vary depending on where you live and your
trainer's experience and education
.
An effective personal trainer will listen closely to what you say and make sure they understand your goals and will be focused only on you during your sessions. Most importantly, they will regularly assess your progress and make changes if necessary.
Things to Consider
Business policies
: The personal trainer should have liability insurance and provide a copy of policies and procedures for services, costs, cancellations, and refunds.
Certification and qualifications
:
A personal trainer should be certified through a reputable personal training organization, such as NASM, ACSM, or ACE. Your trainer should have an updated certification in CPR and/or first aid.
Experience
:
Make sure your trainer has the experience, especially in relation to your goals. For example, if you're a bodybuilder, you want someone knowledgeable in that area.
Specifics
: If you have a specific medical problem, injury, or condition (such as being pregnant, difficulty getting pregnant, heart problems, diabetes, etc.) make sure your trainer has education in these areas and will work with your doctor.
What a Session Is Like
A personal training session usually lasts about one hour. Your first meeting with your trainer will be devoted to assessing your fitness level, taking
body measurements
, talking about your current exercise regimen, getting a health history, and setting some goals.
Be prepared to step on a scale, have your
body fat measured
, and answer specific questions about your fitness goals.
After your initial meeting, you'll spend each session doing cardio,
weight training
, flexibility exercises, or other activities depending on your goals. A personal trainer will show you how to do each exercise, help you figure out how much weight to use, and give you pointers for getting the most out of your workout.
A Word From Verywell
Hiring a personal trainer is an important investment in your health. Take the time to hire someone who accommodates your specific needs. Ask friends or colleagues for recommendations but keep in mind that if their goals are different than yours, their personal trainer may not be the best fit. Once you've hired your trainer, keep the lines of communication open. Provide constructive feedback to help them guide you to success.
Frequently Asked Questions

While gyms and fitness studios are excellent venues to get your sweat on, there are a variety of activities you can do that don't require joining a fitness facility and still help you accomplish exercise goals. Keep reading if you're looking for way to burn 100 calories or more quickly—without a gym while at home, work, or traveling.
How to Burn 100 Calories
Let's dive into how you can quickly burn 100 calories:
Climb stairs for 10 minutes
Do yoga for 30 minutes
Walk for 30 minutes
Perform your work standing rather than sitting
Jump rope for 7 minutes
Dance for 30 minutes
Do rigorous chores for 30 minutes
Hike for 15 minutes
Run a 10-minute mile
Garden for 25 minutes
Verywell / Ryan Kelly
The activities you choose may vary based on how much time you have available, what you feel your body needs that particular day, the weather, and so on. There are no right or wrong choices here. There are many options to get moving.
The exact amount of calories your body will use doing these activities depends on your weight, gender, age,
body composition
, and more. Therefore, this rate is different or everyone. For simplicity's sake, the
calorie counts
used in this article are for a 150-pound woman. Calculate
your individual calorie burn rate
for a more precise number.
1
Climb Stairs
JGI/Jamie Grill Blend Images / Getty Images
There's almost always a staircase nearby at work, at home, or even in a hotel when you're traveling.
Walk the stairs
for just 10 minutes to burn 100 calories. It is also correlated with a reduction in disease.
You'll build strong legs as well. Climbing stairs helps to shape the muscles in your
lower body
. Walking downstairs provides benefits, too!​
2
Stretch and Relax
Hero Images / Hero Images / Getty Images
If you stretch and relax or do an
easy yoga workout
for 30 minutes, you'll burn about 100 calories.
In addition, you help to increase the range of motion in your
joints
, decrease stress, and it may improve the quality of your sleep.
Stretching for Weight Loss
3
Walk and Talk

When you can, take your phone calls on the go. You can even walk during business calls simply by pacing around your office. Do this during two 15-minute phone calls a day for a 100-calorie burn. Wear a
fitness tracker
to see how far you can go.
4
Stand Up
Klaus Vedfelt / Taxi / Getty Images
You burn about 10 extra calories for every 10 minutes you stand rather than sit at the office. And the good news is you don't need a
standing desk
to take advantage of the benefit. Ask co-workers if you can hold meetings at a standing location instead of in the conference room. Better yet, take the meeting on the road and solve workplace problems while you walk. You can also stand more at home, like when
watching TV
or reading. It all adds up!
Office Workout Moves You Can Do Right at Your Desk
5
Jump Rope

If you have a reason to burn calories fast,
jump rope
. You only need to jump for seven minutes to blast away 100 calories. You'll also improve coordination
and build strength in your
lower legs
at the same time.
Can't jump for a solid seven minutes? Work your way up to it. Keep a
jump rope
handy at your house so you can do it in your living room, on your driveway, or in your yard—anywhere you have enough space. Keep one in your car so you can jump rope at the park.
6
Get Active
Dan Dalton / The Image Bank / Getty Images
If you're at home with your family or hanging out with friends, have an impromptu dance party. Thirty minutes of casual dancing burns about 165 calories.
Playing more active games with kids or grandkids can also burn calories. Try hula hooping, hide-and-seek, passing a balloon or beach ball without letting it touch the ground, or tossing around
a Frisbee
in the backyard.
7
Tidy Up
Paul Bradbury / Caiaimage / Getty Images
Got a house to clean? Believe it or not, housework can be an effective exercise session. Standard housecleaning burns about 100 calories in 30 minutes. Need to burn a few more?
Change up your chores
to burn more calories when you clean. Simple tasks like vacuuming and dusting can be modified into exercises that build strength.
8
Take a Hike
Cultura RM Exclusive / Matelly Cultura Exclusive / Getty Images
Who needs an excuse to get outdoors? Lace up your hiking boots and head for the hills to burn 100 calories in just 15 minutes.
Hiking
burns more calories than walking because of the difference in terrain. When you hike up a hill or on unstable trails, your leg muscles have to work harder to move you forward and your
core muscles
have to work harder to keep you stabilized. The result? More calories burned. If you don't have a trail nearby,
walking briskly
for 20 minutes will burn 100 calories, too.
9
Run
Blend Images - Erik Isakson / Brand X Pictures / Getty Images
The simplest way to burn 100 calories fast is to
run
. And you don't have to be a
marathoner
or sprinter to blast away fat. Run one 10-minute mile to burn 100 calories. If you're not ready to run for a full mile, try
run/walk intervals
to build stamina while burning fat.
10
Garden
Cultura RM / Matelly Cultura / Getty Images
Got a green thumb? Put it to work for you! Gardening burns about 100 calories for every 25 minutes you spend digging, weeding, and planting. The added bonus is that you enjoy the outdoors while you create a beautiful garden—and maybe even grow a few healthy
vegetables
.
A Word From Verywell
There are endless ways to burn 100 calories in your everyday life. Keep these and
other easy workout ideas
on slips of paper in the jar. Encourage co-workers, friends, or family members to join you and complete a workout two or three times throughout the day to promote healthy movement and increased fitness.

Pros and Cons
Getting Certified
Finding a Job
Consider a Specialty
Skills and Education
Set Up Your Business
Become Indispensable
Becoming a personal trainer can be a good
career choice
if you love fitness and helping others achieve their goals. As a fitness enthusiast, you may have already done
unofficial personal training
over the years; perhaps you've coached or created a fitness plan for yourself. But there are more steps to take to get certified as a personal trainer, find employment, or set up your own business. Learn more about this career to decide if it is the right one for you.
How to Become a Personal Trainer
Decide if personal training is right for you and weigh pros and cons.
Get certified with a professional certifying organization (ACE, NASM, ACSM).
Find a job that suits your goals and personality.
Consider specializing.
Continue your education.
Consider starting your own business.
Go above and beyond.
Decide If Personal Training Is Right for You
From the outside, personal training often looks like a
satisfying career
, and it can be. You get to help people achieve their goals in a field you love, it's flexible, and you have lots of options for where you can work. There are some great things about personal training, but it's important to look at every angle before taking the plunge.
Just like any other specialized field, personal trainers need to have a variety of skills. Between coaching clients and building personalized training plans, a successful personal trainer must be analytical, motivational, and nurturing. To be an effective trainer, you should enjoy working with different kinds of people, be self-motivated, and a good listener. Organizational skills, patience, and a healthy dose of persistence can also help elevate you in this competitive industry.
Challenges
Before diving into this new career, it's also helpful to know what it's like to do the job day in and day out. Of course, you can perfect your client training expertise with time. Learning about the day-to-day of the personal training business is something you can pick up when you get certified, but hands-on experience is always the best teacher. Training may seem like a breeze, but it's tougher than you may think.
You'll work with clients who:
Are afraid to push too hard or want to push harder than they should
Are not compliant with the workouts you give them
Blame you if they don't reach their fitness or
weight loss goals
Cancel with little or no notice
Have all kinds of excuses for why they can't or don't exercise
Have
injuries
or other conditions
Have never exercised and need good modeling for even the most basic of exercises
Show up without workout shoes or other
necessary exercise gear
Every person is different, and you need to be able to determine how hard you can push that client, what that client needs, and what they want. You also have to be flexible and ready to change on a dime if a workout isn't going well.
Pros and Cons

Unpredictable pay
Potential for burnout
A career in personal training comes with many exciting and enriching benefits. From the work itself to the client connections, here are some of the best parts of personal training:
It's flexible
. In many cases, you can set your own work schedule. You may even be able to set your fees if you work for yourself.
It's rewarding
. There's nothing better than that moment when a
client can finally see and feel the difference
in their body thanks to your help.
There is room for growth and variety
. Personal training can often be a jumping-off point for other things like being a fitness instructor, a health writer, or pursuing higher education.
You get to build relationships
. If you're good with people, personal training gives you a chance to delve into each client's situation, get to know them, and then use your knowledge and creativity to create workouts that fit them.
If you decide to become a personal trainer, you should also be prepared for the challenges that come with it. While the journey and job can have gratifying aspects, consider these when choosing to pursue the personal training path:
Peak hours are those that are most convenient for the client
. Clients may need to cancel or reschedule without much notice. And most will want to train either before or after work and on weekends, so your busiest hours will often be on the weekends and very early in the morning or late at night on weekdays.
You'll have to learn to sell your services
. Most people don't get in the business because they love selling, but that is a part of your job, especially if you work at a commercial gym. You'll need to be part-trainer as well as part-marketer, selling your training services to potential clients.
There is a wide range in pay
. Personal trainers can make anywhere from $15 per hour to more than $100 per hour, depending on where they live and work and their level of experience. In addition to your hourly rate, your income will also be tied to how many hours you work and can fill each week.
Income may not be stable
. Cancellations happen all the time in personal training. One day you may have a full schedule and the next, no one to work with, which often means you're not getting paid.
There is an increased risk of burnout
. Personal training takes a lot of energy, both physical and mental. It's easy to get burned out, especially if you're training all the time.
Get Certified as a Personal Trainer
If you've decided personal training is for you, your next step is to get certified. The most important factor in the decision of where to obtain your certification is whether the certifying organization has been
accredited
.
Certifying organizations
have their certification procedures and protocols accredited by an independent third party, such as the National Commission for Certifying Agencies (NCCA). If there is a specific employer you want to work for, find out what certifications they require or recognize.
Do your research and look for answers to the following questions at the websites for certifying organizations:
Can the exam be taken online, or must you attend an on-site examination? If on-site, where and when are the exams offered?
Does the exam require attendance at a workshop or seminar, and where are these offered? Is it a home study program?
How much does it cost? The costs vary from about $300 to more than $1000 and may not include the study materials and workshops.
Is it a national/international certification? Is it universally recognized?
What are the continuing education requirements to renew the certificate? Completing a certain number of continuing education (CE) hours is a requirement of most certifications and will be an extra expense and commitment to consider.
What are the prerequisites for the exam? Most require a high school diploma, a CPR certification, and that you're at least 18 years of age at a minimum.
Certifying Organizations
While there are others, these are some of the well-known certification organizations and their accreditations:
ACE
(American Council on Exercise), accredited by NCCA
ACSM
(American College of Sports Medicine), accredited by NCCA
AFPA
(American Fitness Professionals and Associates), not accredited
IFPA
(International Fitness Professionals Association), accredited by NCCA
ISSA
(International Sports & Sciences Association), accredited by the Distance Education Accrediting Commission
NASM
(National Academy of Sports Medicine), accredited by NCCA
NCSA
(National Strength and Conditioning Association), accredited by NCCA
NCSF
(National Council on Strength and Fitness), accredited by NCCA
NFPT
(National Federation of Professional Trainers), accredited by NCCA
Find a Job as a Personal Trainer
As a personal trainer, you may be an employee of a business or work as an independent contractor for them. You may also train clients independently. When just starting out, many new trainers choose to work for an established business to get experience. Some ideas for employment opportunities include:
Commercial gyms
: Popular gyms such as
XSport
,
24 Hour Fitness
,
Gold's Gym
, and
Planet Fitness
hire new trainers all the time. The drawback can be lower pay, working on commission, lots of selling, and having to work long hours doing new member orientations to get new clients.
Corporate fitness
: You can work for a company that offers corporate wellness packages for businesses wishing to improve their employees' health.
Cruise ships
: Many cruises offer personal training for guests. Online resources such as
Cruise Ship Job Finders
allow you to search for a variety of cruise lines for different jobs.
Hospitals or wellness centers
: Many hospitals employ personal trainers to help patients recover from illnesses and conditions. These opportunities may require a higher degree or a specialty for working with clients who may have health challenges.
Local community centers
: Check with your local community centers or park district to find out about local clubs that hire personal trainers. Almost all fitness clubs have personal training available, which may be a great place to start.
Personal training studios
: Studios focus almost entirely on personal training and small group training. Because they're so specialized, they may require more experience or education, but as a result, they will also typically pay more.
Spas and resorts
: All-inclusive resorts sometimes hire personal trainers or fitness instructors to teach exercise classes. Online job boards like
Cool Works
and
ResortJobs.com
provide job listings for parks, resorts, and spas.
Consider a Specialty
Over time and with experience, you will develop a sense of which types of clients you most enjoy training. You can then invest in further education and get a specialty certification. With a specialty, you will have more to offer these clients, and you can usually charge a little more for your services. Most certifying organizations offer several specialty certifications, and you may get a discount if you already have a basic certification.
Options include:
Athletics and sports
: You can help athletes improve their balance, speed, agility, and performance.
Lifestyle and weight management
: You can work with clients on behavior changes to turn around bad habits and develop healthier ones.
Medical
: With medical specialty like the
Medical Exercise Specialist
certification offered through ACE, you can work with post-rehabilitation clients who are recovering from conditions such as heart problems, muscle sprains, or orthopedic surgery.
Nutrition
: With this add-on certification, you can help clients with the diet portion of their fitness goals, giving them specific advice on how they can eat healthily and lose weight.
Orthopedics
: You can work with clients who have knee pain, arthritis, or other conditions.
Special populations
: With this kind of certification, you can work with older adults to help them improve their quality of life and maintain muscle mass, or you can work with younger kids to build fitness programs that fit their age and goals.
Continue Your Education
Continuing education is a requirement for keeping your certification current, whether or not you choose to pursue a specialty. It also keeps you up to date on the latest in fitness, weight management, and health.
Your certifying organization will offer courses, workshops, and other ways to earn credits, but there are other ways to stay informed and keep learning.
The American Council on Exercise (ACE) offers
touring workshops
with credits that count for ACE, ACSM, NFPT, and more.
Empower Fitness Events
conferences are held in various cities throughout the year; you can get all your credits at one time while keeping up with what's new in fitness.
Human Kinetics
offers a variety of continuing education courses for almost every certifying organization.
The
IDEA Health & Fitness Association
offers a wide variety of courses, both online and in person. They also have a yearly conference, the
IDEA World Convention
, where you can get almost all of your required credits in one weekend.
Start a Business
Once you get certified and gain some work experience, you may decide to set up your own business as a sole proprietor, limited liability company (LLC), or corporation. If you are an independent contractor for a gym rather than an employee, you should learn the advantages and disadvantages of these forms of businesses as well.
Business Management
Many people get into personal training because they want to help people, but you need to know the details of business registration or incorporation, licensing, zoning, budgeting, accounting, tracking your expenses, filing taxes, and more. It is worthwhile to take a small business course at a local community college if you are not familiar with these things.
Financial Investment
At the outset, you will have to spend money to get your business off the ground. Depending on your business model, you may need:
Business expenses
: Website, business cards, liability insurance, health insurance, marketing costs, and continuing education courses to maintain your certification
Fitness gear
: Cardio equipment such as a treadmill, weights, resistance bands, mats, weight bench, step, exercise balls, BOSU, and other balance and stability equipment
Other
: Quality workout clothes, shoes, music system, water dispenser, towels
Marketing and Promotion
If you decide to set up your own business, marketing is probably the single most important thing you'll do to build a client base. Here are just some of the things you may need to get your name out there:
Networking
: Do research locally to find out if you can join the Chamber of Commerce or some other group of professionals. You can also find groups through
Meetup
. Annual or regular expos, fairs, trade shows, or other community events are also great opportunities to network with industry professionals.
Referrals
: Your existing clients can be a great source of marketing to their social circle. Offer discounts or a free session to the people they refer and benefits to the clients who make referrals.
Seminars
: Offering free local or virtual seminars about exercise, health, diet, and related topics is often a great way to meet potential new clients.
Social media
: Set up profiles on social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram so you have a way to communicate with clients and potential clients.
Website
: Setting up your website can be as simple as getting a domain name and signing up with a simple website company. You can also work with a web designer to create your own custom website.
Advertising
: Design, purchase, and distribute digital and print ads. Consider sponsorships—of local sports teams, perhaps—for added exposure in local markets.
Become Indispensable
Being successful as a personal trainer takes work, talent, skill, and experience. Getting a certification is no guarantee that you'll get clients or, more importantly, be able to keep those clients. How you train your clients is important, but how you treat them is even more important.
Attend conferences and workshops
. It's amazing how much you learn from one weekend taking classes from experts. You also get a look at new equipment and can usually buy it at a discount. Your clients will appreciate new workouts and gear as well as your renewed enthusiasm.
Give regular assessments
. Whether your clients want to lose weight or be stronger, set up an assessment every few weeks so they can see their progress.
Keep in touch
. Make it a point to connect with your client outside of sessions. Send a quick email or text just to check in. Make and print workouts for them to follow on their own. Give them your favorite recipes, or send them interesting articles that pertain to their goals both inside and outside of the gym. It's little things like these that let clients know you're invested in their success and your relationship.
Listen
. Being an active listener is the single most important thing you can do for a client. At the beginning of the session, make it a point to check in and see how they feel that day, and adjust the workout accordingly.
A Word From Verywell
Personal trainers have many job opportunities, with the need growing due to the rise in obesity and sedentary lifestyles. The world always needs new, enthusiastic trainers to get the word out about health and fitness. Take the time to learn what's involved in becoming a trainer before choosing your career.

Should You Use an Exercise Ball as a Chair?

FAQs
Multiple studies confirm the negative effects of too much sitting, from slowing down your metabolism to increasing your risk of diabetes. Besides counteracting that by getting up frequently and moving around, some people swap an exercise ball—also called a yoga ball, balance ball, or stability ball—in place of their regular desk chair to achieve "active sitting."
Rather than the slumping and poor posture that can happen even with ergonomic desk chairs, the theory is that sitting on an exercise ball (which is inherently unstable) forces your body to constantly make small adjustments in your core and lower body. The hope is that this results in abdominal strength and
better posture
.
Researchers agree that sitting for long periods of time isn't healthy. But as far as the effectiveness of an exercise ball as a desk chair, the results are more mixed.
Benefits of Exercise Ball Chairs
There are many perceived benefits of using an exercise ball, such as improved posture, more energy, and better overall balance.
Since the ball prompts frequent position shifts, it may also increase
energy expenditure
, which means more calories burned.
Researchers in a 2017 study monitored how bodies physically reacted over a 10-minute sitting period and concluded that sitting on a stability ball activated lower body muscles.
Another study found that it might even boost core endurance.
Many proponents further believe that sitting on a ball encourages exercise. Once you have the ball handy, it's easy to roll back from the desk and do a few
core-strengthening moves
.
Office Workout Moves You Can Do Right at Your Desk
Drawbacks of Exercise Ball Chairs
Some studies have found little to no connection between using an exercise ball in the workplace and the purported benefits. In fact, some of the research shows the potential for injury.
No core activation
: Researchers are split on the theory that sitting on an exercise ball increases
core strength
. While one analysis found that this form of active sitting engages the core muscles,
others found no difference in how the core is used between an exercise ball and a regular desk chair.
Insignificant calorie burn
: If there's any increased energy expenditure when sitting on an exercise ball, it's likely fractional and not enough to reduce the health risks of sitting too long, according to a 2015 study.
Increased pain
: Sitting for prolonged periods can lead to
back pain
,
but using a stability ball may have a similar effect. One study found almost half of those who used the ball reported some pain when using it.
Greater injury risk:
Because an exercise ball chair is unstable, there is a potential for injury if you lose your balance and fall off the ball. You may also be injured if it breaks while you are sitting on it.
If you experience any pain when using an exercise ball as a chair, discuss it with your medical provider and consider discontinuing use.
Precautions
If you decide to use an
exercise ball
at your desk, keep these factors in mind to get the most out of your new chair and ensure safety.
Consider the Size
Your ball's height, angle, and inflation level all make a difference. Your thighs should slope downwards slightly rather than be at 90 degrees. But the ball shouldn't be so tall that you end up balancing your wrists on the keyboard.
How to Find the Right Size Exercise Ball
Create a Safe Space
Particularly during initial use—and if you have the freedom to customize your workstation—it may be helpful to place your ball in front of a wall to catch you if you roll. An exercise mat underneath your ball can provide cushion and support for the same reason.
Another option is to use a base or frame to hold your ball chair in place. Some even provide lumbar support, which may be beneficial for your
lower back
by promoting a healthier posture (as long as it doesn't change your posture too much, thereby increasing low-back strain).
Add Time Gradually
When starting out using a ball as a chair, begin with a half-hour or less. Build up your time each day to see how you tolerate it.
Alternatives to Office Ball Chairs
You may want to alternate between an ergonomic desk chair, a ball chair, and other forms of active workstations. In addition to ball chairs with frames, wheels, and lumbar support, there are other alternatives, such as:
A sit-stand desk
A
treadmill desk
A
Deskcycle
An active sitting cushion
Research shows that many of these options can increase energy expenditure without impairing your ability to perform your tasks.
And they can be just as comfortable (if not more so) than sitting in a chair.
Still, regular standing, walking, and
stretch breaks
are probably better alternatives. Prolonged, continuous sitting is more problematic than total sitting time.
Frequently Asked Questions
How do you clean an exercise ball chair?
Soap and water can help keep your exercise ball chair clean and free from bacteria. Stay away from harsh chemicals, as these can harm the ball's surface. The manufacturer's instructions can provide more guidance for the best cleaning methods.
Is an exercise ball chair good for pregnancy?
If you are pregnant
and want to work while sitting on an exercise ball, check with your doctor or obstetrician to make sure this is safe for you. Research has connected the use of an exercise ball during pregnancy with reduced lower back pain and improvements in daily life.
But these studies involve using the ball chair for exercise and for only limited amounts of time.
How long should you sit on an office ball chair?
Aim to get up every hour or so, as sitting for long periods, whether on an exercise ball or traditional chair, isn't good for your health. Set your smartphone alarm or download a chime app to remind you to get up and move around.
A Word From Verywell
Despite its popularity, research studies haven't solidified the benefits of using an exercise ball as a chair. If you're considering alternatives, you might want to investigate other options like sit-stand desks and balance chairs.
If you have back pain or other musculoskeletal disorders, consult with a physician or physical therapist to help determine the safest, most comfortable workstation seating for you. You might also benefit from
shoes for back pain

, improves functional movement, prevents injuries and pain, reduces the risks of several diseases, and boosts mental health and self-confidence.
Like most hobbies, the more you practice and perform it, the more skill you develop and, in most cases, the better your results will be. However, there are limitations to how much of a good thing you need or should do for the best results.
While consistency is
imperative for building healthy habits
and seeing progress toward your goals, it is possible to overdo it. Below, you will learn the benefits of lifting weights daily, the potential risks involved, and how to incorporate weight lifting into your daily routine.
Women Are Missing Out
The American College of Sports Medicine (ACSM) recommends at least twice weekly resistance training, with eight to 12 repetitions of eight to 10 exercises targeting all major muscle groups.
However, some reports show that only 20% of women do any form of resistance training two or more times weekly, which is less than the U.S. population.
The Benefits of Weight Lifting for Women
Benefits of Lifting Weights Every Day
Lifting weights has innumerable benefits, and scientists continue to discover new ways of doing things that improve health and well-being. Like all forms of exercise, lifting weights boosts cardiovascular and metabolic health, leading to less risk of developing chronic diseases and dying from any cause. Here are some benefits specific to lifting weights.
Helps With Healthy Body Composition, Weight Loss, and Maintenance
Lifting weights increases your metabolism, which is a factor in achieving and maintaining a healthy weight. Because lifting weights can help build and retain muscle when eating fewer calories during weight loss efforts, consistently performing it will improve calorie burning, even at rest.
This effect is due to muscle tissue being
more metabolically active
(burns more energy) than fat tissue. Weight lifting also increases your ability to use fat as energy (fat oxidation and lipolysis) and reduces amounts of visceral and subcutaneous fat, which means better
body composition
.
Increases Strength
Muscle strength
facilitates your body's ability to perform any task, allowing you to walk, carry, run, climb, lift objects, and open pesky jar lids. But muscle size and strength begin to decline with age. Including resistance
training to build muscle
and preserve strength as you age is crucial.
Even without considering the aging process, being strong and capable improves your daily life. In many ways, it allows you to be independent, feel empowered, and carry out tasks with less difficulty. Stronger muscles mean better protection for your joints, too, and can even make simple tasks like walking more functional and easy.
5 Ways to Maintain Muscle Mass
Builds Muscle
Muscle tissue is built by creating a stimulus that forces it to adapt in order to meet the demands being placed on it. The best way to do this is by lifting weights or performing any kind of resistance training. Lifting weights is an extremely effective, efficient, and easily trackable way to build muscle.
Although healthy for many other reasons, cardiovascular exercise that doesn’t include resistance training is not effective for building muscle.
Building muscle improves several factors of your health because having low
levels of lean body mass
which includes muscle and bone, increases your risks of chronic diseases, injuries, pain, and all-cause mortality.
Lifting weights is essential for building the muscle that will improve your health and boost longevity.
Improves Bone Health
Weight lifting also stimulates bone development and
increases bone mineral density
. Lifting weights is a first-line treatment for conditions that affect bones and has been shown to reduce lower back pain and ease pain caused by arthritis and fibromyalgia.
A study published in the
Journal of Bone and Mineral Research Plus
found that specific types of training are safe and effective for
improving bone health
. The study examined male sprinters between the ages of 40 and 85 over the course of 10 years. Those who lifted weights throughout that time saw improvements in bone strength.
While bones typically decrease in density and strength with age, this study shows that lifting weights can not only maintain but also build bones. Conversely, those who did not consistently maintain their training habits throughout the study experienced a loss in bone density and strength.
Although that particular study was performed on active males with less risk of bone loss, other studies—including those observing women with low bone mineral density, osteopenia, and osteoporosis—show that lifting weights increases bone density and improves painful conditions that lead to bone fractures and breaks.
Prevents Injuries and Pain
Pain and injuries sideline most people at some point in their lives.
Back pain alone affects
up to 80% of adults during their lifetime.
Lifting weights
reduces your risk of injuries and pain by boosting muscle and tendon strength and functionality so you can move better, recover more easily, and be more resilient.
Moreover, lifting weights can prevent and manage pain better than pharmacological treatments, like painkillers and NSAIDs, or instrumental therapies such as heat or spinal manipulation.
Hip, shoulder, and general muscle weakness, limited core strength, and inactive "sleepy" muscles are the biggest culprits for pain and injury.
Sitting for long periods
creates muscle tightness and weakness in the body that leads to dysfunction, muscle compensation, and becoming injury prone. Lifting weights consistently works wonders to combat these effects.
Another effect of lifting weights is
improved muscular endurance
. Increasing your muscular endurance or stamina reduces the risk of musculoskeletal injuries, improves your performance in the gym, and helps with functional performance. It even wards off cardiovascular diseases.
What Happens to Your Body When You Walk 30 Minutes Per Day
Potential Risks and Dangers of Lifting Weights Every Day
While a consistent weight-lifting routine is invaluable, lifting weights every single day may lead to pain, injuries, and fatigue since energy stores and your body's ability to repair itself cannot keep up with demands.
You may also end up feeling the effects of overtraining if your daily weight-lifting sessions are too intense.
Overtraining leads to several health problems
, including insomnia, muscle soreness, mood changes, loss of menses, increased illness, loss of appetite, fatigue, and more.
Rest and recovery
are when your body heals and
makes the adaptations necessary
to meet demands and perform better next time. It's also when tissues such as ligaments and joints have time to repair so pain from overuse doesn't set in.
If you do choose a weight-lifting plan that is not too strenuous, you may be able to lift every day, but it is unlikely you will see the best results. This is because a certain amount of stimulus in each training session is best for producing muscle adaptations that lead to growth and strength. You could hinder your results by spreading your total workout volume too thin.
Lifting weights every day may also take a toll on your mental health if it takes up too much of your time that should be spent on other daily tasks and responsibilities. While setting aside time for yourself each day is admirable, spending some of that time working on de-stressing activities, personal growth, and other forms of self-care may serve you better and even boost the results of your weight-lifting sessions by facilitating recovery.
Research supports a 24- to 48-hour rest period before training the same muscle groups again. This time off from stimulus allows muscles to grow and repair, benefiting your overall physical and mental health.
However, you don't have to be inactive on rest days. Instead, choose activities supporting recovery and lowering stress, such as walking, gentle yoga, swimming, or mobility work.

How to Incorporate Weight Lifting Into a Daily Routine
To incorporate weight lifting into your daily routine, the first step is starting with two or three days of weight training and slowly building your tolerance to
increasing the total volume
(sets, reps, weight) over time. This can take months to do successfully in a way that will be sustainable. You also will need plenty of de-loading periods where you take it easy for a week or two to recover more fully.
If you want to focus on lifting weights every day of the week, use one or two days for very light maintenance work. For instance, if you have worked up to five fairly challenging weight-lifting sessions each week, on the other two days, you could perform some light resistance band exercises that function more as mobility and injury prevention training than true strength or muscle-building work.
Becoming consistent with your weight-lifting hobby will
require goal setting
and careful planning. Deciding what you want to get out of your weight-lifting routine and how much time and energy you currently have available (or can create) to be consistent also is vital to the process. To be successful, use models such as
SMART goals
and methods of behavior change such as positive psychology and self-determination (believing you are in control and can achieve what you want) to
keep up your motivation
and drive toward your goals.
How to Set and Plan Weight Loss Goals
Bottom Line
Lifting weights is an excellent way to perform self-care and improve your physical and mental health. Not only will you feel the effects of consistent weight-lifting in your present daily life, but you also will reap the rewards of your dedication for years to come.
While being active every day is a fantastic choice, spending a few of those days on less demanding activities that boost recovery and other aspects of your physical and mental health is best. Seek guidance from a personal trainer for help setting up a routine that works best for your fitness level and lifestyle. It's also wise to get clearance from a healthcare professional before starting any new activity.

The Importance of Good Posture
Common Culprits Behind Low Back Pain
How Exercise Affects Low Back Pain
Step-By-Step Guide to 9 Posture-Improving Exercises
Integrating These Exercises into Your Daily Routine
Low back pain
is the most common source of musculoskeletal complaints, with 70% to 80% of adults experiencing it in some form during their lifetime.
It's also the top reason people are unable to perform daily activities and need to miss work.
So it's no wonder many people find themselves looking for solutions to relieve and prevent low back pain.
Research shows that postural exercises have a more significant, more efficient pain-reducing effect on low back pain than pharmacological options (painkillers, NSAIDs) or instrumental approaches (heat, spinal manipulation).
What's more, exercises do a better job of improving the psychological aspects of dealing with low back pain.
Here, you can find information and instructions on how exercise can improve your posture and alleviate low back pain, according to physical therapists.
What is Posture?
Posture refers to the anatomical alignment of our body, according to Mike Masi, DPT. "Because our bodies are adaptive machines, we will likely conform to the stressors imposed upon the body to tolerate the daily living or occupational tasks of each person," he says. These adaptations can cause muscular strain and imbalances that lead to pain.
The Importance of Good Posture
"When we think about posture, we tend to think of it as "Good" or "Bad," but the reality is that there is a lot of in-between depending on what the activity might be," explains Carrie A Lamb, Doctor of Physical Therapy, Orthopedic Clinical Specialist, and
Balanced Body
Educator. According to Lamb, the posture you adopt when you're walking differs from the one you might have while driving or the one you pick when riding your bike. "What an ideal posture feels like is the important piece," she adds.
When posture is not ideal, problems can arise. For instance, sitting at a desk for eight hours a day may lead to rounding of the upper back and limited flexibility with reaching overhead. "If that person tries to paint their ceiling, a task that requires sustained overhead performance, they will be at risk for injury and poor performance," explains
Mike Masi
, Doctor of Physical Therapy and Orthopedic Specialist.
Lamb points to a saying in Pilates, "As much as necessary, as little as possible," that highlights what good posture might feel like. "Imagine all of your bones and joints being evenly supported without any sensations of fatigue or pain; you aren't overworking any one area but creating a sense of balance and ease in the body," she describes. Good posture creates efficiency, conserves energy in the body, and avoids overuse of any one area.
Lamb says there is no one perfect posture and that the effort to maintain what you may think is ideal can cause you to work too hard. "It’s not realistic to sit up tall for hours on end without allowing the body to move and fidget," she explains.
Common Culprits Behind Low Back Pain
According to Masi, low back pain can arise from many factors and affects people of all ages, backgrounds, races, and cultures. Many areas of the body can be injured in and around the trunk, leading to lower back pain and injury. Typically people who put higher physical demands on their lower back are more likely to get injured. Demands can include work or lifestyle-related lifting, rotating, or
long hours spent sitting
or standing in one position.
Lamb and Masi say that hip tightness and weakness, poor core strength, and tightness in the lower back are culprits for lower back pain. These areas need adequate strength and flexibility to help prevent stress in the lower back during everyday movements. Sitting for long periods makes these problems worse.
Traumatic injuries in the lower back usually result from lifting loads with the spine in too much flexion or rotation, according to Masi. Learning proper lifting mechanics may mitigate the chances of injury in these scenarios.
What Happens to Your Body When You Walk 30 Minutes Per Day
How Exercise Can Improve Posture and Alleviate Low Back Pain
Exercise can increase muscle strength, mobility, muscular activity, and flexibility.
Research shows that exercise therapy, such as aerobics, muscle strengthening, and
flexibility and stretching
exercises, can decrease pain and improve function.
Masi praises exercise for posture correction as a fantastic way to expose the body to novel demands under controlled circumstances. "This exposure may create more room for error with human movement before injury occurs and could improve movement efficiency," he says. This means by strengthening your postural muscles and correcting your posture overall, your body will be less inclined to feel pain during everyday activities.
Lamb suggests checking in with your body every day; noticing side-to-side differences in flexibility or strength is an excellent way to start addressing any issues you have due to your posture. "If you think of a slouched computer posture, the muscles along the back of the body can become stretched out and weak," she says. Postural muscles are endurance muscles and need to be able to function for an extended period, according to Lamb. Training these muscles to work through full ranges of motion can ensure your body is ready to adapt to any posture you ask it to get in.
Office Workout Moves You Can Do Right at Your Desk
Step-By-Step Guide to 9 Posture-Improving Exercises
Below are some exercises provided by Masi and Lamb that can improve posture and relieve low back pain. Do not perform any activity that recreates pain.
Hollow Body Holds
Hollow body holds
target the anterior chain, hip flexors, and abdominals.
Lie on your back on a firm surface with your knees bent.
Push lower back into the ground so the spine is flush with the ground.
Lift arms so they are straight, with fingers reaching up towards the ceiling.
Lift legs so they are straight with toes pointed towards the ceiling.
Slowly drift toes and fingers away from each other while simultaneously keeping the lower back in contact with the ground.
Stop and hold at a challenging position.
Hold 10-30 seconds for 3-10 sets.
Rack Slides
Rack slides target trapezius muscles and thoracic paraspinals.
Grab a wooden dowel or PVC pipe and approach your door frame or the front of a
squat rack
.
Place the dowel horizontally against the doorframe at the level of your collarbone with your hands just slightly wider than shoulder width.
Stand close to the dowel with a slightly staggered stance.
Keep your elbows under the wrists the whole time.
Slide the dowel up the rack until your arms are straight.
You can simultaneously shift weight into the front foot to help achieve an overhead position and get an added stretch.
Hold at the top for a few seconds and perform 10-30 daily.
Pass-Throughs
Pass-throughs target pec minor and major, coracobrachialis, and short head of bicep.
Standing or sitting, grab a 5-foot dowel or PVC pipe with a wide grip (typically, the wider, the easier this is).
Keep the arms straight and rotate your shoulders so the dowel moves over your head and slightly behind you.
If facing a mirror, you will see the dowel move behind your head to about eye level.
This should result in a big stretch at the front of your chest, shoulders, and arms.
Do not descend beyond that point. Instead, hold that position for 3 seconds, then return to the start position.
Repeat 10-20 times.
Move hands closer together for a more intense stretch.
Hip Hinges
Hip hinges
target the posterior chain, lower back, glutes, and hamstrings.
Stand with your feet directly under your hips, with your toes facing forward (ideally in front of a mirror).
Push your hips back and reach your hands forward as if raising them overhead.
The knees may slightly bend during this movement.
The goal is to keep the spine neutral while slowly lowering it to parallel the ground. You may also feel a stretch behind your legs.
Hold the position for 3 seconds, then return to the start position.
Repeat 10-30 times throughout the day.
Baby Swan
The
baby swan
is a great exercise to counteract the forward sitting posture and works on the spine's mobility and strength of the mid-back.
Start by lying on your belly with your arms out to your sides in a goalpost position.
Imagine (or place) a small ball under your sternum. Gently hug the ground with your arms, then roll your ball forward to lift your heart and head forward.
Try to keep the movement in your mid-back. If you don't have a ball, imagine one to get the movement going. While it may be tempting to lead with your head, remind your body that your heart is in charge.
Progress this exercise by holding the lifted position and trying to lift one or both arms without lowering your body.
Windshield Wiper Hips
This exercise increases hip mobility and control.
Sit in a "z-sit" with knees pointing opposite to feet.
Lean back slightly and change to an opposite z-sit where knees point in the other direction.
Try to keep your spine tall as you do this. If you need a modification, consider leaning back and using your hands for support or trying this lying down, to begin with. Note: sometimes full rotation is contraindicated following certain hip surgeries, so check with your medical provider before attempting.
If you can do the seated version, try to come up to kneeling from the z-sit before you switch sides as a way to add strengthening to the move.
Swimmers
Swimmers
help strengthen the lower back while boosting mobility in the spine.
Lie on your abdomen with arms stretched out in a "v" shape and legs straight.
Start by slowly lifting the right arm and left leg, then switch to the left arm and right leg. Ensure you are not holding your breath and not trying to lift the limbs from your lower back. Placing a pillow under your hips can help if you feel strained in the lower back.
Progress by picking up your pace and avoiding touching the arms and legs down to the ground as you alternate sides. Modify by starting from a hands and knees-position instead of on your belly.
Rolling Bridge
The bridge
is a great exercise to get the spine and the core talking to one another and finding support with movement.
Lie on your back with your knees bent and hip distance apart. Keep your arms at your sides as you curl your pelvis and roll up your spine one vertebra at a time into a bridge.
Hold at the top, then retrace your steps by rolling down the spine one vertebra at a time.
Progress by
using only one leg
at a time as you roll up and roll down.
Roll-Up
Roll-ups
should feel like work in the abdominal muscles and this exercise is excellent for building a resilient spine. This exercise may not be a good choice for people with osteoporosis or some acute lower back conditions, so if something is painful, stop.
Start by lying flat on your back with legs straight and pulled together. Take a breath in as you reach your arms overhead.
As you exhale, press the arms down, pick up the head, roll yourself up to sitting, and reach for your toes.
Sit tall, then roll yourself back to the starting position thinking one vertebrae at a time. If you get stuck on the way up you can roll up a towel and place it at your shoulder blades to help with roll up or you could start sitting and roll back a short distance (what you feel like you can support) and come back up.
Pilates Exercises You Can Do in Bed
Integrating These Exercises into Your Daily Routine
Which exercises you perform and when will depend on your needs and abilities. Trying to implement some movement every day, such as walking, is ideal, but make sure you wear the right
shoes for back pain
. Lamb uses the saying "motion is lotion," meaning movement and exercise help hydrate muscles and joints, eliminate waste products generated by overuse, and over time help to restore the body's balance.
Tailor the types of movements you do to your needs. "If stiffness is the issue, exercises should focus on loosening tight hips or a stiff spine. If lack of support is the issue, then exercise should be focused on strengthening and endurance-type work," she says.

Understanding the Demands of Pickleball
Benefits of Pickleball-Specific Shoes
Proper Fit and Considerations
If you’re considering joining a pickleball team, you might be wondering what equipment you’ll need to excel in the paddle sport, which is a mix between regular tennis and table tennis with a few elements of the racquet sport badminton.
Although pickleball is a relatively new sport, which came on the scene in 1965 right outside of Seattle,
it has grown in popularity, especially in recent years. In fact, it’s now considered to be one of the fastest-growing sports in the U.S., boasting more than 8 million players across the nation.
It's no wonder it has spawned a plethora of must-have accessories, from
pickleball bags
to clothing.
It’s easy to see why pickleball has become so popular—it can be played by people of all ages and abilities. There also are no boundaries as to where the game can be played (both indoors and outdoors) and the format lends itself to quick rallies and counter-attacking, explains Reda Elmardi, CSCS, a personal trainer and founder of
ActivBuilt.com
. If you have
a pickleball set
and suitable shoes, you can play on just about any pickleball court.
Understanding the Demands of Pickleball
Similar to tennis or table tennis, pickleball involves dynamic and unique fast-paced movements, including quick lateral strides, pivoting, and even sudden changes in direction. Like
tennis
, you have to move forward, backward, and side to side across the court; and you pivot to take many shots, explains
Cary Raffle
, MS, certified personal trainer and certified orthopedic exercise specialist based in New York City.
“With pickleball, not only do you need to quickly change direction in pursuit of the ball while maintaining balance and footing, but your feet, body, and shoes have to work and move together to make all of these movements, to be able to control your shots, produce power when you swing, and reduce the risk of injury,” says Raffle.
Even though pickleball is most often played at the recreational level, it still requires a proper
pickleball paddle
and the right gear, starting with a suitable pair of shoes.
When it comes to picking the right athletic footwear for your pickleball game, there are a few things to consider. One consideration, according to Elmardi, depends on where you will be playing the sport—whether it’s flat ground or a harder surface—as each type of play will require different shoes.
For flat-ground play, he recommends opting for sneakers or
tennis shoes
, as these provide supportive cushioning and shock absorption during gameplay. For harder surfaces like concrete or hardwood courts, he suggests going with specialized shoes like those designed specifically for pickleball.

Benefits of Pickleball-Specific Shoes
If you are new to pickleball, you may be wondering if purchasing specially-designed shoes is worth it. Here’s a look at some of the key benefits of investing in pickleball shoes.
Optimal Traction and Court Grip
As mentioned, traction is incredibly important when it comes to playing pickleball. This traction can help players execute quick movements, maintain stability, and prevent slips and falls. This is why pickleball-specific shoes can really come in handy.
When looking for the right pickleball shoes for you, be sure to shop for traction-specific materials like rubber, nylon, and leather. According to Elmardi, you’re most likely to find pickleball shoes made from rubber, because it’s cheaper and commonly used in other outdoor sport-specific shoes like soccer and baseball cleats.
“Nylon is a more expensive option but offers better traction than rubber and is often used in high-tech sneakers because it provides great shock absorption and long-term durability,” he says. “Leather is the most expensive option but offers the best grip of all the materials and is also becoming more popular in sneakers because of its natural look and feel.”
Lateral Stability and Support
When you’re moving from side to side in a lateral fashion, as you do during a game of pickleball, your opponent will most likely follow suit and this, Elmardi explains, often requires players to be on top of their balance and ensure that they’re steady when making shots. Pickleball shoes are designed to aid in this stability and thus can help reduce injuries such as sprains.
Cushioning and Impact Absorption
Pickleball shoes are designed similarly to those made for running. They often have cushioned comfort, with a midsole that offers shock absorption and reduces the impact felt in the joints, including knees, lower back, and, of course, the feet. You can often find pickleball shoes that utilize one of several sports technologies such as gel inserts or responsive foam, which can help cushion and reduce the impact on the joints. This cushioning is not only important during the sport itself, but also months or even years down the line, as it minimizes the risk of overuse injuries.
“When the body is cushioned, it can maintain more balance, preventing muscular fatigue and joint pain as adequate cushioning can help reduce overall stress on the body and allow a person to work harder for longer periods of time without experiencing any pain,” says Elmardi. “In addition to these long-term benefits, cushioning also helps promote positive movement habits, which in turn results in a stronger, more flexible body.”
Proper Fit and Considerations
As with the purchase of any shoes, you want to make sure that any pickleball shoes you invest in fit well and provide adequate support. To do this, you may want to take measurements of your feet using a ruler or measuring tape. Jot down these digits so you have them handy while you’re shopping.
Elmardi suggests purchasing pickleball shoes that fit snugly and don’t allow your feet to move around much while you’re walking around or playing. He also recommends paying close attention to arch support. “If your foot has high arches, look for shoes with adjustable straps or more supportive materials built into the sole of the shoe."
Lastly, if it’s possible, try your pickleball shoes on the surface on which you’ll be playing so you can get a good feel for how they’ll fit during the game. This might require you to step outside so you can walk on grass or find an area with a hardwood floor if you know you’ll be playing on a hardwood court.
Bottom Line
While you can certainly play the game of pickleball with most shoes designed for sports, such as
running shoes
or
cross-fit shoes
, there are many reasons why you would want to invest in a pair designed specifically for pickleball, such as improved traction, enhanced stability, added cushioning and increased impact absorption. All in all, investing in high-quality pickleball shoes is a worthwhile investment that can contribute to their long-term enjoyment and success in the sport.

History of Kickboxing
Benefits of Kickboxing
How to Start Kickboxing
Kickboxing and Mental Health
One huge perk of hitting the gym is sweating out stress that may have built up during your day. Whether it's office politics or an annoying leak in the ceiling, exercise has the ability to distract, relieve, and re-focus your perspective.
Sometimes changing up your usual yoga flow or running route is helpful, but other times an entirely new format of training is exactly what you need to lighten whatever stress you're feeling. Kickboxing, while not as common as Pilates, spin, or other popular fitness styles, is a fun, exciting way to spice up your sweat session—taking your stress out on a
punching bag
is a healthy way to
work stress out of your system
. You might even like it enough to incorporate the workout into your normal routine.
History of Kickboxing
Kickboxing is a full-contact martial art that originated in Thailand, in an early form called Muay Thai. Muay Thai was developed for self-defense but became a sport when unarmed combat was no longer useful in war.
Kickboxing came about as a mixture of Muay Thai and inspiration from other martial arts.
After a while, this became a full-contact sport, with timed rounds, and eventually even moved into a boxing ring. It was then the name “kickboxing” came about.
If you are interested in kickboxing, you’re not alone. Thanks to Tae Bo’s best-selling workout videos, kickboxing became popular in group fitness circles in the 1990s and early 2000s. This was eventually known as cardio kickboxing. Many other instructors then created videos and classes based on cardio kickboxing. Not only that, but there are often other variations of martial arts and boxing workouts available at group fitness centers.
Benefits of Kickboxing
Exercising can improve your energy levels, control your blood pressure, and help you sleep better.
There are many benefits to exercise and group fitness—kickboxing brings its own specific benefits to the table.
Physical Benefits
Kickboxing can target many muscles, though it partially depends on what style of kickboxing you are doing. Cardio kickboxing is more cardio-intensive and focuses on your abs. Regular kickboxing is a martial art and can target muscles all over your body. Most commonly, kickboxing targets upper body strength.
Kickboxing can improve upper body strength and improve aerobic power, anaerobic fitness, flexibility, speed, and agility.
Everyday Benefits
Due to the amount of cardio involved in kickboxing, it is excellent for improving your cardiovascular health. Your cardiovascular health refers to your heart and blood vessels. Having a healthy heart can help mitigate heart disease and other heart problems.
Kickboxing can also help you work on your coordination and balance. Kickboxing requires hand-eye coordination, spatial awareness, and a fast reaction time. Constantly working to improve these areas can also help you in your everyday life.
Tommy Dibernardo
, former MMA fighter and trainer at RockBox Fitness, says kickboxing incorporates multiple planes of motion essential for daily movement.
How to Start Kickboxing
Kickboxing is a full-contact sport that requires intensive full-body training. If you are interested in kickboxing, here are some ways important things to do
as you get started
.
Choose an Instructor and Style
Certified expert personal trainer
Corey Nelson
recommends starting with a no-contact cardio kickboxing group fitness class if you are a beginner. They are offered at most YMCAs, local health clubs, and boutique studios. Cardio kickboxing can be a non-intimidating way to begin kickboxing workouts, and group fitness is accessible and affordable compared to a personal trainer.
If you have some experience kickboxing or prefer a contact sport, competitive kickboxing is offered in smaller classes. If you eventually decide to become serious about kickboxing, you could also look into a personal trainer to work with you alongside competitions.
No matter what kind of instructor and class type you choose, you should talk to your instructor about your fitness level and overall health. Be sure to share any health complications or injuries that they should be aware of.
A Beginner’s Guide to Kickboxing
Get the Right Kickboxing Gear
According to Dibernardo, most studios will require that you have hand wraps and
boxing gloves
. These are to protect your hands from injury. Of course, you should get a nice big water bottle, too. These are the basic requirements, though you should always talk to your instructor to determine any requirements for the types of equipment you need to buy.
Nelson elaborated further that you will want grippy sneakers and a hair tie if your hair is long. Safety gear can include:
Bag gloves
Sparring gloves
Headwear
Mouthguard
Shin guards
Any clothes you wear should be comfortable but not too baggy or susceptible to being caught on anything. For instance, if you love
Athleta leggings
, choose a style that doesn't flare out at the bottom. Also, be sure to take out any jewelry—it can cause injuries or get caught on things.
Kickboxing and Mental Health
Kickboxers often perform in high-pressure environments and must be highly motivated and strong-willed. Failure is not easy for anyone, and as a kickboxer, you will not win every match. Many kickboxers have to work on their confidence to endure the competitive nature of kickboxing matches.
Kickboxing is a constant battle between brain and body to keep pushing yourself to do better, so it’s essential to have the right mindset. Continuously improve your physical fitness, don’t take losses too hard, and make sure to prioritize healing from any injuries you may face.
What to Expect Before Your First Kickboxing Class
A Word From Verywell
Kickboxing is an exciting way to switch up your routine and get a great workout. You might like it so much that it becomes a regular part of your routine. No matter how often you find yourself in a kickboxing environment, maintaining a healthy mindset and proper safety techniques are crucial.

Golf
Water Sports
Swimming
Triathlon
Basketball and Volleyball
Let’s face it, spending hours in the gym can sometimes feel like a real grind, especially if you prefer competitive or recreational sports over traditional
cardio and resistance training workouts
. But if you’re trying to get fit or maintain a certain level of health, committing to a consistent workout schedule is likely toward the top of your to-do list.
The good news is, you don’t have to set foot in the gym to get be competitive or boost your overall fitness. In fact, you can get all of that, and much more, by participating in your favorite sports several days a week. Here are some sports that will help improve your fitness.
Road Cycling and Mountain Biking
Roads or trails, fast or slow, cycling is one of the best sports you can do for overall fitness. Not only do you get a fantastic aerobic workout, but your leg muscles—more specifically the quads, glutes, and hamstrings—will also feel the burn after putting in a few miles. Plus, research has shown that for cyclists, especially those with diabetes, cycling can lower risk of premature mortality.
There are also bikes appropriate for all ages and stages. Intermediate to advanced levels can participate in road cycling and mountain biking, while beginners can start with paved trails. If you’re looking to satisfy your competitive side, consider entering a road or mountain bike race.

Squash, Racquetball or Tennis
It’s not uncommon to see squash and racquetball courts full of people of all ages and fitness levels. That’s because a game of squash or racquetball can range from an entry-level sport to a highly competitive, intense workout. The key to making these fast-paced activities approachable for a beginner is to slow down the pace of the game.
Squash, racquetball, and even tennis target the muscles in your back, shoulders, arms, chest, quads, glutes, and hamstrings, while also working your core. Racquet sports have also been shown to lower the risk of cardiovascular disease mortality.
Combine that with the endurance, speed, balance, and
agility
, required to compete and you will quickly see how these two sports can give you a phenomenal workout while also burning a ton of calories.

Contrary to what you might think, you don’t need an expensive set of clubs to head out on the course. But, what you do need is a supportive pair of shoes.

to make the list of best sports for fitness, you need to walk all 18 holes while carrying or pushing your clubs. When walking the course, golf can have multiple health benefits, including in cardiovascular and respiratory health.
Plus, golf is a sport you can participate in at any life stage.

Activities that require your upper and lower body muscles to work together rank high on the "best sports for fitness" list. Swimming is the perfect full-body workout for anyone looking for an intense and competitive outlet that requires both strength and endurance. It’s also a smart solution for anyone needing a sport or activity that is easy on the joints.
Plus, swimming is a year-round sport with various levels of competition, so you always have something to work toward. If you’re interested in signing up for organized, competitive swim events, consider joining U.S. Masters Swimming.
How to Start Swimming for Exercise
Triathlon
Whether you’re a lifelong athlete looking to
test your endurance
and strength, or an exercise beginner needing a goal to work toward, training for a triathlon is the ultimate sport for fitness.
The combination of running, biking, and swimming will challenge every muscle in your body and boost your aerobic and anaerobic fitness.
With distances ranging from the shorter
sprint
competition all the way up to a full Ironman event, there's something for every fitness level.
Sprint Triathlon Training Plan for Beginners
Basketball and Volleyball
Basketball and volleyball offer the physical benefits of a great workout while giving you the chance to let your competitive side shine. These sports require you to perform sprints, pivots, jumps, and slams, which tax the cardiovascular system and strengthen every muscle in your body. Plus, if you are playing volleyball in the sand, your muscles will have to work harder.
While both sports are appropriate for most levels, it’s important to note that beginners should start with a skills and drills class,
practicing with balls
, before moving to games or matches. There is a lot of movement required for both sports, so the risk of injury is high, especially if you have never played either sport before.

A Word From Verywell
While some of these activities require an organized team, special equipment, or a designated space to play, others just require time, energy, suitable apparel, such as
a tracksuit
, and your willingness to work hard and have fun.
You don’t need to spend a lot of money to get started in any one of these sports. Many recreational programs provide the space and the equipment, while a quick Google search can produce thousands of used items for sale. Just be sure to talk to a healthcare provider before adding a new activity to your exercise regimen.

Why Trust Verywell Fit
Verywell Fit / Reese Herrington
Best known for its
ultra-comfortable leggings
, lululemon also has a collection of comfy joggers. The best lululemon joggers are
soft, comfy, durable, and stylish
—with options for both exercise and casual wear.
When shopping for a good pair of joggers, consider what you’ll be doing in them. One pair might have design features and fabrics best suited for high-intensity workouts, while another might be better for lounging. When choosing joggers for workouts,
John Gardner
, a NASM-certified personal trainer and the CEO and Co-Founder of Kickoff, says to choose a fabric that's
breathable, fast-drying, and moisture-wicking
.
To find the best lululemon joggers, we spoke with Gardner and three other fitness experts for recommendations and buying tips. Then, we researched lululemon’s lineup to determine which pants are best for specific activities, needs, and preferences based on their
fit, materials, and features
. Finally, we had a certified personal trainer and yoga instructor from our
Review Board
review this article for accuracy surrounding what to look for in a quality pair of joggers.

Pros
Good for fitness or casual wear
Very comfortable waistband
Flattering fit
Cons
Too thin for cold weather exercise
Looking for a versatile jogger for both fitness and casual wear? These easy, comfortable joggers are perfect for sweating at the gym or dressing up for a day out. They’re made with the brand’s Swift fabric (a combination of polyester, nylon, and elastane), so they stretch and move with you while retaining their shape. The fit is relaxed but still flattering and sleek, so you can look put-together while feeling comfortable in any setting.
Lightweight and breezy, the joggers are easy to pull on over shorts for a warm-up. But it’s important to note that they may be a bit too thin for outdoor,
cold-weather workouts
. The two front hand pockets have a hidden zipper slot and card sleeve, giving you plenty of options for storing your essentials. We also love the joggers’ wide, stretchy waistband and easy drawstring that allows for a custom fit.

Best Men's Overall
lululemon ABC Jogger Warpstreme Men's

$128 at Lululemon
Pros
Wide range of colors
Wrinkle-resistant
Slim, tapered fit
Cons
May run small
Designed for everyday comfort and durable enough for workouts, the ABC Jogger Warpstreme was an easy pick for our top men’s spot. They’re made with lululemons’ Warpstreme fabric blend, which is soft, breathable, and boasts four-way stretch and shape retention properties. Plus, the pants are lightweight, durable, and heavily resistant to wrinkles, making them a smart option for travel.
The streamlined fit gives legs plenty of breathing room and then tapers at the ankle with a stretchy cuff that keeps the pants in place. They also come in three different lengths, so you don’t have to settle for pants that are a bit too short or long. Some wearers do note that the joggers run small, so you may want to size up, especially if you like a looser fit.
We also love the pants’ thoughtful storage, which includes two front pockets with media sleeves and a secure back pocket.
Available in a wide range of colors, these joggers are so comfy and versatile that you may want to purchase more than one pair.

lululemon Adapted State High-Rise Jogger

$128 at Lululemon
Pros
Sweat-wicking and quick-drying
Secure, zipped pockets
Lightweight and comfortable
Cons
Only available in one length
If you need a pair of versatile joggers for your gym workouts, check out the lightweight Adapted State High-Rise Jogger. Made of four-way stretch fabrics, these joggers move with you—whether you’re doing a
HIIT class
, hitting the treadmill, or weight training. They’re also quick-drying and sweat-wicking, so they’ll keep you comfortable no matter how hard you’re working.
The deep, zippered front pockets can securely hold your phone, wallet, keys, and more when you’re on the move. We also like the thick cuffs and elastic waistband, which help keep the pants in place as you’re moving. It’s easy to cinch the drawstring for a secure fit, and you don’t have to worry about it getting lost in the wash. Plus, the zippers at the ankles make it easy to get the joggers on and off.
While we love these pants for working out, they’re also comfy and chic enough for casual wear. They come in a wide range of sizes, but only one length, so if you’re on the taller or shorter side, it may be difficult to find the right fit.

Pros
Abrasion-resistant and water-repellent
Good storage options
Drawcord for customized fit
Cons
Cuffs may be a bit tight for some
These versatile men’s joggers are extremely functional, but their classic tapered fit also makes them a super stylish addition to your casual wardrobe. Made with abrasion-resistant and water-repellent fabrics, they’re ideal for hiking and other outdoor adventures. The durable material is lightweight, stretchy, and breathable, so these joggers also work well for gym workouts.
With three zippered pockets, including two on the front and one on the side, the pants offer plenty of storage to securely stash a phone, wallet, and other items. And the waistband drawstring lets you easily customize the fit. The cuffs at the ankles help to keep the joggers in place as you’re moving, although some wearers say they’re a bit tight.
We love that these joggers can seamlessly transition from the gym to running errands or working from home. And with six different color options, they can be easily paired with almost anything in your closet.

lululemon Surge Joggers

$118 at Lululemon
Pros
Sweat-wicking and quick-drying
Good storage options
Wide range of colors, lengths, and sizes
Cons
Waistband feels stiff to some
While some joggers are too thick and baggy for running, this pair feels lightweight, flexible, and comfortable—no matter how many miles are on the schedule. They’re ideal for runners who opt for relaxed-fit pants rather than running tights but still desire the performance and features of high-tech
running clothes and gear
. Designed specifically for running, lululemon’s Surge Joggers are made with quick-drying, four-way stretch, and sweat-wicking fabrics that will keep you dry and comfortable for miles.
We love the classic tapered fit for excellent range of motion, an essential feature to look for when searching for the
best running pants
. The smooth waistband provides a secure fit, although some wearers note that it feels a bit stiff. With zippers at the cuffs, the pants are also easy to get on and off, which is especially helpful when wearing them over another layer during
runner warm-ups, cool-downs, and stretching
.
We also appreciate the back and side pockets that offer plenty of storage space for a phone, keys, and other essentials. And the joggers come in short, average, and tall sizes, so you don’t have to worry about a short fit or bunching at the ankle.

Pros
Sweat-wicking and quick-drying

Four-way stretch
Cons
May pill over time
Comfortable and super soft, lululemon’s City Sweat Jogger is a go-to option whether you’re moving or relaxing. Made from four-way stretch materials, the lightweight joggers feel smooth against the skin and comfortably move with you. Breathable, quick-drying, and sweat-wicking, the pair will also keep you cool and dry during your sweatiest workouts.
We like that these joggers come in a wide range of colors, sizes (XS-5XL), and three different lengths. The drawstring, which can be worn inside or out, lets you customize the jogger’s fit even more. Plus, the front pockets are deep enough for stashing your phone, while a discreet zippered back pocket offers more room for other essentials.
With a tapered, flattering fit, these joggers are the perfect combination of comfort and style. But some wearers have found that they pill over time, especially in the inner thigh area.

Best Cropped
lululemon Scuba High-Rise Cropped Jogger

$108 at Lululemon
Pros
Stylish cropped look
Very soft and comfortable
High-rise waistband
Cons
Limited color options
Not moisture-wicking
For those who prefer joggers that hit right below the calf, we recommend lululemon’s Scuba High-Rise Cropped Jogger. They work well for petite wearers who find that full-length joggers always bunch at their ankles. And the high-rise waistband helps keep them in place, with a drawstring that can be worn inside or out.
Made with a cotton-blend fleece, these pants are warm, fuzzy, and comfy-cozy. They also pair perfectly with lululemon’s very popular
Scuba Hoodie
for a matching set that’s casual yet stylish. And with two front, deep pockets, the joggers have plenty of room to stash items when you’re on the go.
Since they’re made with cotton, these joggers aren’t as moisture-wicking as other options on our list, so they’re not the best pair for sweat-inducing runs or other high-intensity workouts. However, they’re perfect for low-impact activities, casual wear, and cozying up on the couch at the end of the day.

Pros
High-rise waistband
Very soft and comfortable
Drawstring can be worn inside or out
Cons
Limited color options
Only available in one length
If you prefer joggers with full coverage at the midsection, check out the Loungeful High-Rise Jogger. The elastic waistband is high and wide, providing a secure, flattering fit. Plus, it comes with a drawstring that can be displayed or hidden inside the waistband.
Made with super soft, premium fleece fabrics, the pants feature a tapered look that’s comfortable and relaxed. They’re perfect for lounging around at home, but the tailored look makes them an easy option to throw on when heading out to run errands as well.
The convenient front pockets are deep and have an interior card sleeve, so it’s easy to bring your phone, keys, and cards on the go. These joggers only come in one length, so they may be a bit too short or long, depending on your height. We love this pair so much that we wish it were available in more colors.

Best for Yoga
Lululemon Align Jogger

$118 at Lululemon
Pros
Comfy, flexible fabric
Wide range of colors and sizes
Three pockets
Cons
Only available in one length
When we tested the
best lululemon leggings
, the Align’s came out on top. And if you’re a fan of the brand’s iconic
Align leggings
, you’ll like that these Align High-Rise Joggers have many of the same features—but with a roomier fit that’s perfect for yoga. Similar to the Align leggings, the joggers feature a wide, high-rise waistband that lies flat and will stay put through any yoga flow. And the snug cuff at the ankle keeps the joggers from sliding down your leg during
inversion sequences
.
They’re constructed with lululemon’s signature Nulu fabric, a nylon and elastane blend that feels buttery-soft, smooth, and extremely lightweight. The material moves with you as you’re shifting between poses, and the relaxed fit lets your skin breathe freely. The pants also have two large side pockets and a discrete back drop-in pocket for your keys or cards.
While they’re designed for yoga, these stylish joggers are also ideal for low-impact exercise, work-from-home days, or just lounging around. They come in a wide range of colors and sizes (0-20) but only one length, so you may not get a perfect fit if you’re very petite or tall.

How We Selected the Best lululemon Joggers
To find the best lululemon joggers, we first interviewed four experts. Each expert shared tips on what to look for when selecting a pair of quality joggers. With their advice in mind, we researched the best options from lululemon’s lineup of joggers. We evaluated each pair of pants based on comfort, fit, performance, materials, durability, storage, and other features.
Our Experts
We asked four experts for advice on what to look for in a quality pair of joggers and on important features every workout pant should have.

What to Look For in lululemon Joggers
Price
Like most of lululemon’s apparel, the joggers come with a premium price tag. In general, you should expect to pay between $98 and $128 for a pair of lululemon joggers—although you can keep your eye on the brand's "
We Made Too Much
" and "
Like New
" pages for special prices. While other brands might offer cheaper options, dedicated lululemon fans swear that the products’ high-quality materials, exceptional fit and performance, and durability are well worth the investment. And after hours of testing the brand's top-quality products, we can agree.
Material
Since joggers are available in a variety of materials, it’s easy to find a pair that’s best suited for the type of activity you’ll be doing most while wearing them. Cotton joggers are great for casual wear or low-impact workouts since the material doesn’t dry quickly or wick-away sweat.
For exercise, we like the
Adapted State High-Rise Jogger
because the fabrics are lightweight, breathable, and easy to move in. “When I sweat, my pants need to be quick-drying, and the fabric shouldn’t cling to my body,” Charton says. “The fabric also needs to feel sleek and cool to the touch versus scratchy and clingy.”
Fit
Finding the best fit depends on your preferences and what you’ll be doing in the joggers. If you typically wear them for lounging, you may want a loose, more relaxed fit.
However, according to one of our experts, the ideal fit for exercising with joggers is a slim fit that isn't too tight or fitted, giving the user enough room and flexibility to easily move around. “They should also fit snugly at the waist to ensure that movement and exercising doesn't make them fall off,” Gardner says. Most joggers feature a drawstring waistband to help customize the fit.
Rise
A jogger’s rise refers to the distance between the crotch seam and the top of the waistband. In general, there are three types of rise: low, mid, and high. Many lululemon joggers are high-rise and have a wide waistband that will ideally sit at the smallest part of your waist. This provides a more secure fit, helping to keep the joggers in place as you’re moving.
Comfort
For optimal comfort, look for soft, breathable materials that feel smooth against the skin, as well as a wide waistband that’s snug but not constricting. “You want your joggers to be fitted at the waist but slightly loose throughout the thigh and calf,” Burton says. “The band at the bottom of the jogger should be fitted but not too tight.”
Frequently Asked Questions
Are lululemon joggers worth it?
While there are certainly less expensive joggers on the market, we think  the brand’s joggers are certainly worth the price due to their high quality, durability, and performance. And most options are very stylish, making them versatile enough to wear for both casual and fitness needs.
Should you size up for lululemon joggers?
Whether or not you’ll want to size up for lululemon joggers depends on your preferred fit and style. “I typically go up a size for a comfortable, relaxed look,” Burton says.
Some lululemon joggers may run small or large, so if you can’t try them on, be sure to read reviews before purchasing to more accurately predict your desired fit.
Will lululemon replace ripped joggers?
lululemon usually won’t replace ripped joggers unless the damage was caused by defective material, not regular wear and tear. But the company does offer repair services at no cost. A ripped seam, for example, could be repaired as part of lululemon’s complimentary
hemming service
.
How long should lululemon joggers last?
lululemon does not have a lifetime warranty on its products, but its high-quality, durable joggers can withstand years of regular wear if they’re cared for properly. To get the longest life out of your joggers, follow the product care instructions on the label.

Components of an Orangetheory Fitness Class
Heart-Rate Based Training
Your First Orangetheory Fitness Class
Frequently Asked Questions
Trying a new fitness class is hard. No one likes to be the new kid—or not know entirely what they're getting into—but ripping off the bandaid and jumping in is often the best way to find your new favorite workout style.
If you know anyone who's a member of Orangetheory, you've probably heard about their workouts and their Splat Points. But what exactly is Orangetheory? What is a Splat Point? We're diving into everything you need to know before taking an OTF class.
Components of an Orangetheory Fitness Class
OTF is made up of three different components. Zaria Brinkley, Head Coach of Orangetheory Fitness Canal Winchester in Ohio shares, "OTF has three components. We have the tread, rower, and weight floor, which we train in three different ways; endurance, strength, and power."
Treadmill
The
treadmill
portion of the class is where you will spend about half of your class and experience most of your cardiovascular training. Brinkley notes, "the tread has three parameters so you can either be a runner, jogger, or power walker."
If you're not a runner, don't worry! She adds, "there are also other cardio options should a client need them. In addition to treads, we have the bike or strider as an option for those that have orthopedic restrictions." One of the great things about OTF is that it's accessible to people of all fitness levels.
The treadmills at OTF have quick touch buttons that, according to Brinkley, will help your quickly navigate between speeds and inclines. This is useful as your coach takes you through different blocks of intervals working you through your Base Pace, Push Pace, and All Out Pace.
Pace Intervals
Base Pace
: a pace that should feel challenging, but doable. It should be something you can maintain for 25-35 minutes if you had to.
Push Pace
: a pace that's uncomfortable, but doable for a shorter amount of time.
All Out Pace
: a pace that reflects your maximum effort. This should have an "emptying the tank" effect.
Most OTF treadmills have the OT Connect system, which allows you to see your heart rate zones right in front of you, in addition to the large screens located throughout the studio sharing real-time results.
Rowers
Rowing
is the component of the workout that Brinkley says is an "ultimate calorie burner." She explains, "it utilizes over 80% of the muscles in the body. Rowing is also known as a hybrid exercise, using both the respiratory system and the muscular system when in use."
The rowers at OTF are water rowers, which is unique to the rowers you may find at many other fitness facilities. These machines replicate the feeling of rowing through water, to give you a more authentic experience. One of the less understood factors of rowing is that the power is mostly generated by your legs. About 65% of the power comes from your legs, another 25% from your back/core, and the final 10% from your arms.
Just like the treadmills, your coach will specify your intensity by coaching you to a Base, Push, or All Out. They may have you row for distance (by meter), time, or stroke rate (number of strokes per minute).
Strength Floor
The
strength
floor is where you will do your lifting. There are many parts that go into building this section of the workout. Brinkley states, "The strength floor focuses on fundamental movement such as the squat, lunge, hinge, push, pull, rotate and gait. We work with Bosu Balls, dumbbells, TRX, mini resistance bands, and benches."
On the wall, there is a TV with a video visual aid (VVA). The VVA has videos of all of the moves you will be performing on the floor with all of the rep counts, and any other information you will need to know. "Members can use this to see what the moves look like while the coach is moving around the room," notes Brinkley.
Heart-Rate Based Training
One of the best things about OTF is the ability to use a wearable heart rate monitor. This, in addition to your coach and the VVA, will help guide you in your class. This heart rate monitor will take you through each of your five heart rate zones. Each zone represents a percentage range of your max heart rate.
OTF Heart Rate Zones
Zone 1
: Grey, 50%-60%
Zone 2
: Blue, 61%-70%
Zone 3
: Green, 71%-83% also known as your Base Pace
Zone 4
: Orange, 84%-91% also known as your Push Pace
Zone 5
: Red, 92% and above also known as your All Out
The treadmill, rowers, and strength floor are all used to create a full-body workout designed to get you into your Orange Zone for 12 to 20 minutes. Brinkley explains, "the time spent in the Orange and/or Red Zones accumulate Splat Points."
Brinkley broke down what Splat Points do for your workout. Earning 12 or more Splat Points activates your Excess Post Exercise Oxygen Consumption (EPOC). During EPOC, oxygen exits through the muscles in your body, and to return your body to homeostasis it has to work harder, which increases your metabolism for the next 24-36 hours.
Brinkley says, "The benefits of interval training is that it helps improve glucose sensitivity, aerobic capacity, skeletal muscle capacity, circulation function, basal metabolic rate, and excess post-exercise oxygen consumption." Studies show that "aerobic capacity is well-known to be an independent predictor of all-cause mortality and cardiovascular prognosis."
Your First Orangetheory Fitness Class
Brinkley advises showing up for your first Orangetheory class about 30 minutes before your class starts. This is so that you can be onboarded by a sales associate, meet your coach, and get any questions you may have answered.
When you arrive, the sales associate will have you fill out some paperwork to get basic information from you to enter into the system so they can figure out your max heart rate. They will also talk to you about your fitness goals and your current fitness routine. This will help your coach to know you better and create a more tailored experience.
Once a sales associate gets you entered into the system, they will give you a heart rate monitor. You will either be given a monitor that is worn around your chest or one that is worn on your dominant arm, near your bicep.
From there you will be given a breakdown of all five heart rate zones, an explainer of the Base, Push, and All Out, be shown your station, and be shown how to use the treadmills.
Now it's time to meet your coach. The sales associate will introduce you to your coach and they will go over the proper row form with you, and walk you around the room to explain the layout of the class.
Once class is over, your coach will go over your workout summary with you. They will explain your Splat Points, calories burned, the average beats per minute of your heart rate, and the average percent of max heart rate. They will explain how you can use these statistics to get the most out of your training and give you a suggestion of the number of classes they believe you should attend weekly, based on your fitness goals.
A Word From Verywell
Trying new fitness classes can be intimidating, but preparation can help ease pre-class worries. That being said, you can only be so prepared—sometimes you just have to try something new to see if you like it or not. Be gentle with yourself as you try new things, and proud of yourself for jumping in.
If you have any questions or concerns about adding a new workout style to your routine, consult a healthcare physician.
Frequently Asked Questions
How many Orangetheory classes should you take a week?
This depends on your goals and what else you do for fitness. If you are using OTF as your only form of fitness and want to see visible results, you should attend 3-4 classes per week. If you are doing OTF in addition to another fitness program 2 classes per week is sufficient. If you are looking for more of a maintenance routine, you can stick to one class per week.

What a Complete Workout Schedule Looks Like
What is a good Splat Score?
You want to aim for anywhere between 12 and 20 Splat Points per class. Once you achieve 12 or more Splat Points you will activate EPOC which results in hours of calorie burn after the class has been completed.
Does Orangetheory have a dress code?
The dress code is anything you can work out in. You'll want to wear something that makes you comfortable. Tennis shoes, leggings, shorts, t-shirts, and sports bras are all acceptable. The only real rule is that there are no bare chests allowed.

Central Nervous System Actions
How to Activate Your CNS
Incorporate Explosive Movements
A proper warm-up before you begin a weight lifting session can set the stage for enhanced performance, reduce risks of injury, and help you mentally and physically transition from prior activities to your workout.
One essential factor of any well-designed warm-up is also often ignored—priming your central nervous system (CNS) for action. Your central nervous system sends messages to your muscles to prepare them for desired actions. The better you can communicate the intentions you have for your training with your body, the better you will feel and perform during your workout.
While this may seem like a high-level strategy meant for high-performing athletes, it most certainly is not. Activating your CNS is a simple process that can be done from anywhere, regardless of whether
you are a beginner
performing bodyweight exercises or an advanced lifter hoping to take your progress to the next level.
Actions of The Central Nervous System
Your CNS consists of your brain and spinal cord. This central communication system uses another part of your nervous system called the peripheral nervous system (PNS) to send and receive messages throughout your body.

When working out, it regulates our breathing, movement, and muscle contraction.
— Raquel Harris, Trainer and Gold Medal Winner
The PNS is connected to your entire body and the brain and spinal cord (CNS). Nerves run through your body, receiving signals from your CNS to your muscles, fibers, and organs and sending valuable information back to your brain.
There are two types of systems within the PNS—somatic and autonomic. Somatic nervous system actions are those you control through voluntary efforts such as deciding to pick something up. The autonomic system is involuntary and consists of actions such as breathing or your heart beating.
To properly prepare your body for the intense work of a
strength training session
, or another physical activity, sending the proper messages through your autonomic nervous system is essential. This might seem confusing because this aspect of your nervous system is involuntary, but you can still communicate your intentions so your body is prepared for work and ready to perform.
"The central nervous system is responsible for processing information and influencing bodily activity," says Raquel Harris,
FightCamp
trainer and Team USA Gold Medal World Championship winner. "When working out, it regulates our breathing, movement, and muscle contraction."
Benefits of CNS Activation
According to Harris, activating your CNS before resistance training will:
Maximize your performance by signaling the recruitment of more muscle fibers.
Aid you in breaking plateaus.
Control balance and coordination to help you work against a weight or force.
Parasympathetic and Sympathetic States
Your autonomic nervous system has two subcategories—parasympathetic and sympathetic. The sympathetic nervous system helps your body get ready to face stress including physical stress.
You have likely heard of "fight, flight, or freeze." This description of your nervous system response is the sympathetic aspect. Likewise, the parasympathetic nervous system is responsible for relaxation and
de-stressing
, also described as "rest and digest."
It is wise to perform some calming movements and actions after your workout to return your body to a parasympathetic state.
This can include
stretching
, lying with your legs elevated, relaxing
yoga poses
like corpse pose, and box breathing. You can also take a warm shower or bath, foam roll, or get a massage. Returning to a calm state will aid in recovery and reduce stress hormone production.
Why You Need Rest and Recovery After Exercise
Why Activating Your CNS Is Important
Activating your CNS can increase your performance and prevent injuries. Think of the process as a way of waking up and alerting your entire body to what you are about to do.
Before you begin a training session, communicating to your body that you are going into a physically stressful situation will help your entire body and brain prepare for the work ahead. This concept is known as post-activation potentiation (PAP).
PAP helps increase force and
power production
, which in turn enhances your weight lifting performance.
Waking up and activating your nervous system can help increase the number of
motor units
you recruit. Motor units produce the force behind any voluntary or involuntary movement in the body and provide the force necessary to lift weights.
Whenever you train, your brain is trying to adapt and learn what you are doing and the purpose for it. The term "muscle memory" describes this interaction.
If you have ever started up a new strength training routine for the first time or after an extended break, you may have felt awkward for the first few sessions, or even weeks, depending on your prior experience.
However, once you have completed a few sessions, you likely have felt more adept at performing the movements and can significantly increase your weights, repetitions, or both. This phenomenon has more to do with your neural drive and "muscle memory" than it has to do with your true potential physical abilities.
Training your CNS to wake up and pay attention can increase the likelihood that you will develop a solid mind-muscle connection and the muscle memory that will carry forward into your future training.
How to Activate Your CNS for Resistance Training
After all of the scientific background behind the central nervous system's role in training, it may seem daunting to put it into practice. However, activating your CNS before resistance training is fairly straightforward and is neither time-consuming nor difficult.
Perform a General Warm-Up
The first step is to perform a general warm-up. General
warm-ups
should use large muscle groups and be of low intensity.
You do not want to exhaust yourself before you have begun the actual work. A general
warm-up
provides the following benefits to prepare your CNS (and entire body) for work:
Increases blood flow
Enhances nerve impulse speed
Increases nutrient delivery to working muscles
Removes metabolic by-products faster
Facilitates the release of oxygen from hemoglobin and myoglobin
Warms muscles, so they contract more effectively, leading to increased force production
Lowers joints' resistance to flow via increased synovial fluid uptake (joint lubrication)
Increases joint range of motion
Improves joint resiliency
Reduces risk of injury
Performing a
general warm-up
is simple. Any aerobic activity will work, so choose anything you prefer. This can be the use of a rowing machine, elliptical trainer, stair climber, treadmill, or performing bodyweight movements such as light jumping jacks or jogging in place.
Adding some dynamic movements with bodyweight will further help you ramp up in preparation for more explosive movements. Use the
rating of perceived exertion scale
(RPE) of 1 to 10 to determine your general warm-up effort.
Stick to an exertion rating of between 5 to 6, which is akin to a moderate-paced walk or slow jog. You should be able to speak clearly without taking a pause during this amount of effort.
"Before firing up your CNS with explosive movements, lead your workout with a dynamic warm-up," says Harris. "After completing your warm-up, build up into your explosive movements to give your muscles time to get acclimated to your final movement."
Sample Dynamic Warm-Up
Here is an example of a dynamic warm-up:
30 seconds of skips
30 seconds of hops
30 seconds of squat jumps
30 seconds of right power kicks
30 seconds of left power kicks
30 seconds of plank tucks
Running Warmups, Cooldowns & Stretching
Incorporate Explosive Movements
Explosive movements can excite and prepare your CNS for lifting weights, especially if they are heavy, use
multiple muscle groups
, and therefore require a lot of neural activity and force production. These types of movements require power and speed.
Plyometric exercises
are an excellent example of this. You can streamline your warm-up by performing explosive actions that correspond with the body parts and muscle groups you will be training in that session.
For instance, before a training session involving barbell squats, you can
perform jump squats
, broad jumps, or
box jumps
. Before deadlifting, you could perform
kettlebell swings
,
cleans
, or snatches. Prior to bench pressing, try plyometric push-ups or medicine ball chest slams or presses. These movements will also serve double duty by raising your heart rate, increasing blood flow, and improving mobility before you lift.
Tips for Explosive Warm-Ups
Here are some tips to make the most of your explosive warm-up:
Choose a movement that corresponds with the main body part being trained.
Perform the exercise before your set and/or in between sets.
Keep the warm-up movement brief so that you do not fatigue the muscle.
Use maximal effort during the movement.
Try performing two sets of 3 to 5 reps per body part being worked that session.
Another way to prime your CNS for action is to approach your maximum effort on a lift. However, this method is riskier for beginners and should only be performed if you have a spotter and are an experienced lifter.
To do it, perform an exercise close to your maximum intensity such as
85% 1RM
. This is typically done by athletes prior to performing high-velocity activities such as sprints, or jumping.
Plyometric Jump Training Exercises
A Word From Verywell
Warming up your body helps prepare you for the work ahead. Activating your central nervous system will boost your performance by increasing motor neuron recruitment and engaging your sympathetic nervous system so you can better handle the physical stressors ahead.
Although this process may seem complex, priming your nervous system is as simple as warming up with some light aerobic activity before performing some explosive movements that wake up the muscles being worked. Try this strategy before your next workout to see increased performance and reduced injury risks.

Health Benefits of Pickleball
How to Get Started
Pickleball is a paddle sport that combines elements of ping pong,
tennis
, and badminton. The sport can be played on pickleball courts either indoors or outdoors.
While it was originally developed in the U.S. for children, pickleball is now enjoyed by people of all ages all over the world. Para-pickleball is also available for those who use a wheelchair. According to at least one study, pickleball is the fastest-growing sport in the U.S.
What Is Pickleball?
In 1965, three dads (all residents of Bainbridge Island, Washington) developed pickleball as a backyard game to entertain their children who had gotten bored with other activities.
There are some reports that the sport was named after "Pickles," a dog owned by one of the creators. Others say that the name actually came from the diverse nature of pickle boat rowing crews.
The sport has evolved over the years to include specialized equipment and playing spaces. In 1976, the sport was recognized by
Tennis
magazine and now there are tournaments and organizations located worldwide.
The sport is also a common activity in school physical education programs.
Pickleball is most commonly played as a doubles sport (involving two teams of two people each) but it can also be played as a singles sport (one player versus one player). The social nature of the sport has made it exceptionally popular in senior communities.
Everything You Need to Know About Pickleball: A Beginner's Guide to Gear and Equipment
Gear and Clothing
There are companies that sell pickleball-specific clothing, but you don't have to buy special clothes to play the sport. The climate and conditions (indoor or out) will determine the best pickleball outfit. Moisture-wicking shorts,
athletic skorts
, or pants can be worn with a tank or t-shirt and jacket if needed. If you're playing outside, you may also want a visor and
sport sunglasses
to protect your eyes.
You will need to have court-friendly shoes that provide lateral support—such as specialty
pickleball shoes
or
tennis shoes
. Shoes made for walking or running generally do not provide the kind of side-to-side support needed for pickleball.
You'll also need to find the right kind of court, a ball, the rackets, and the net. When you're first starting out, you can play pickleball with supplies you have on hand, that you rent, or that you pick up at a local sporting goods store. But the
USA Pickleball Association (USAPA)
also provides guidelines for approved courts, nets, paddles, and balls. There are vendors widely available that sell specific
pickleball sets
and other supplies.
How Big Is a Pickleball Court?
A pickleball court is smaller than a tennis court and most closely resembles a doubles badminton court. It is a rectangle measuring 20 feet by 44 feet. The net is placed across the center of the court, with a 7-foot non-volley zone on either side of the net (called the "kitchen"). The area behind the non-volley zone is divided between the right and left service areas.
If you don't have access to a pickleball-specific court, you can simply use a tennis court or another outdoor space and mark lines with chalk or colored masking tape. USA Pickleball provides specific instructions for marking a
do-it-yourself pickleball court
.
How Tall Is a Pickleball Net?
A pickleball net measures at least 21 feet and 9 inches across and it should be at least 30 inches high. It should be made out of a mesh fabric with a white tape binding at the top. It should measure 36 inches high at the sidelines and 34 inches in the middle.
What Do Pickleball Balls Look Like?
There are different types of pickleball, but in general, they look somewhat like whiffle balls. They are made of seamless, molded, plastic and have holes of varying sizes. The balls might be yellow, black, blue, or multicolor.
Outdoor pickleballs are usually heavier, harder, smoother, and have smaller holes (about 40 holes) so they come at the paddle faster.
Indoor pickleballs are lighter, softer, and have fewer holes (about 26 holes). Outdoor and indoor balls are not used interchangeably.
How to Choose a Pickleball Paddle?
Pickleball paddles look somewhat like ping-pong paddles. Early pickleball paddles were made out of plywood, but paddles today have gone high-tech. They can be made out of a variety of materials including wood, polymer, or aluminum. The paddle face can be made out of carbon fiber, fiberglass, or graphite.
To find the
best pickleball paddle for you
, find one that fits your grip and has a good feel in your hand.
A medium-weight paddle will weigh about 7.3 to 8.4 ounces but there are also heavier paddles and lightweight paddles.
Heavier paddles provide more power, but lightweight paddles provide more control.

Pickleball Rules
Like other similar sports (like ping pong, badminton, and tennis) the object of pickleball is to score points by lobbing a ball over the net so that your opponent cannot return it.
You can also score points if your opponent volleys in the non-volley zone or hits the ball out of bounds. Players take turns serving the ball and you can only earn points if you or your team is serving.
The first team or player to reach 11 points with a two-point advantage wins the game. If you reach a score of 11 without a 2-point advantage the game continues until one side reaches it.
Pickleball never ends in a tie.
Rules for pickleball are outlined in detail by USA Pickleball. The basic guidelines are usually referred to as "The Five Rules" but the rules of play are more extensive than five simple guidelines.
General Pickleball Rules
A very general outline of the five basic rules is as follows:
You can't hit the ball out of bounds.
The ball must be served underhand and below the waistline.
After a serve, the ball must bounce once on the other side before returning and then once again on the serving side. This is known as the two-bounce rule. After the two bounces, players may volley the ball.
A ball can't touch the no-volley zone on a serve.
A pickleball game ends at 11, 15, or 21 points. Usually, the game ends at 11 points, but 15 and 21 are also common endpoints.
Tournaments and Organizations
If you try the sport and decide that you want to get more involved, there are a number of organizations that provide resources regarding equipment, game rules, and tournaments.
USA Pickleball
Pickleball Canada
International Federation of Pickleball (IFP)
American Pickleball Association
Super Senior International Pickleball Association
You are also likely to find local organizations by searching social media or the web.
Health Benefits of Pickleball
Like all
types of physical exercise
, pickleball helps you to burn calories and stay in shape. This type of exercise can also provide benefits including better sleep, improved energy, and a reduced risk of certain diseases such as type 2 diabetes, arthritis, heart disease, and stroke.
With the surge in the popularity of pickleball, there have been some studies investigating the specific health benefits of the sport.
Burns Calories
The number of calories you burn playing pickle ball can vary substantially based on a number of factors including your age and the intensity with which you play.
Most activity-based calorie calculators don't include a category for pickleball, but you might estimate that it provides a workout similar to ping pong or tennis.
Based on estimates for other sports, a 150-pound person might burn between 286 (table tennis) and 500 calories (tennis) during a one-hour game of pickleball.
To estimate the number of calories that you might burn, use this calorie calculator.
Improved Cardiorespiratory Health
A very small study conducted at the University of Western Colorado and published in the
International Journal of Research in Exercise Physiology
involved just 15 older men and women who were tested before and after a pickleball intervention.
Researchers found that participants who played pickleball three times a week for one hour over a span of six weeks showed improved blood pressure, improved cholesterol levels, and better cardiorespiratory fitness when compared to baseline.
Improved Well-Being
Another small study published in 2017 discussed the benefits of pickleball for older adults. The study authors explored the characteristics of 153 older adult pickleball players, including lifestyles and psychosocial benefits.
The research findings suggested that pickleball is suitable for older women who feel lonely or in need of extended friendships through exercise, and also recommended for older adults who are searching for a productive and fruitful retirement. Study authors concluded that the sport "contributes to the well-being of older adults."
While tennis players made them popular, pickleballers are stepping up their games with these

.
How to Get Started
As with any new sport, it is important to make sure you are in good health before starting a program of physical activity. If you are managing any medical condition, if you are recovering from an injury, or if you have been sedentary for some time, check with a healthcare provider before starting to play.
Experts advise that if you have a functionally-limiting musculoskeletal problem (such as severe
osteoarthritis
), you should be cautious when starting to play, given the hard surface and recurrent impact with quick steps and rapid starting and stopping.
Also, there is no need to invest in expensive equipment to give the sport a try. There are many local organizations where you can rent a court and many even rent out equipment.
Once you learn the basics of the game, then seek out a local pickleball organization to learn more about the nuances of the game before you invest in equipment. As you advance is skill, you will probably want to pick up on these
eight pickleball tips to improve your game
, according to a pro.
Like every other sport, pickleball injuries can happen. A published study suggested that injuries are most likely to be
sprains or strains
of the lower extremity, followed by sprains or strains of the upper extremity and injuries of the trunk and low back. Study authors also note that injuries can result from falls after a sudden turning or pivoting movement.
To decrease your risk of injury, be sure that you are warmed up before starting a game of pickleball. Walk briskly or jog for at least five minutes before starting to play.
Also, be sure that you have proper footwear and eye protection. Experts also advise that regular cardiovascular exercise outside of pickleball can help limit fatigue associated with play.

The Effects of Anger on the Body
Types of Workouts to Manage Anger
High-Intensity Workouts
Yoga and Meditation
Walking and Hiking
Dancing
Anger is a normal, healthy emotion that everyone experiences at some time. Underlying emotions, such as sadness, fear, or guilt, may also be expressed as anger. During times of stress, we may experience anger more often than is typical.
Anger becomes problematic when it becomes unmanageable. Some people exercise to manage their emotions and frustrations.
Researchers have found that aerobic exercise, in particular, can help reduce anxiety, depression, and hostility.
Some research even suggests that a short bout of exercise may help to prevent an angry mood.
The Effects of Anger on the Body
Researchers define anger as an emotional state that consists of feelings that vary in intensity from mild irritation or annoyance to intense fury.
There are two types of anger:
Constructive anger
:
Anger that can help you to solve problems and can have a protective component
Destructive anger
:
Anger used to justify feelings or to intensify a state of anger
Even though anger can be a healthy emotion, it can take a toll on the body. Those who practice Buddhism refer to anger as one of the three poisons of the mind (along with greed and foolishness).
Through its impact on the sympathetic nervous system, anger has been shown to have a positive association with atherosclerosis or coronary heart disease. And negative emotions, including anger, have also been included as a causal factor for bulimic behavior. Anger has been associated with developing type 2 diabetes and with an increased risk of road accidents.
On the other hand, exercise has been associated with a decreased risk of many diseases, including type 2 diabetes and heart disease. Exercise has also been shown to increase one's emotional resilience to acute stress.
So when you experience anger, physical exercise may be a positive way to relieve some tension.
Types of Workouts to Manage Anger
Exercise is a great solution in theory, but some people may have difficulty giving their energy to a workout when anger is consuming them. There are different ways to approach movement when you are cross or annoyed.
Some people might prefer to release their anger with explosive movements, such as boxing, circuit training, or dancing.
Others might prefer to calm their breathing and reduce their heart rate with mind-body exercises, such as yoga, Tai Chi, or meditation.
Some may even prefer a combination of both, such as hiking in nature.
It may also be the case that what works on one occasion is less effective during another event. So try to be open-minded and try different exercises to calm your mood.
Keep in mind that the goal with exercise isn't necessarily to eliminate anger. Anger is natural and can be healthy. Exercise simply gives you an outlet for healthy expression and management.
Sweat It Out
Since aerobic activity has specifically been called out by researchers as a way to reduce anger expression in both children
and adults,
you might want to get your sweat on to calm your nerves. Activities like
rowing
and
treadmill running
have been associated with lowered anger, dejection, and anxiety.
You might want to try one of these workouts the next time you need to release frustration:
3 Rowing Workouts to Mix Up Your Routine
4 Quick and Effective Treadmill Workouts
30 Minute Treadmill Workout
Hill Workouts on the Treadmill Using Incline
You might also want to try to redirect your focus. The following types of workouts, in particular, help you to concentrate on various movement challenges so that your focus may be directed away from the source of your anger, at least temporarily.
Boxing
Verywell / Ben Goldstein
Boxing workouts force you to focus on specific punch and jab combinations. A boxing workout engages the whole body, burns calories, and builds strength, especially in the upper body. There are many boxing studios and gyms (such as Rumble or Mayweather Boxing + Fitness), and many of them also provide apps that allow you to work out at home if you can't get to one of their locations.
If you want to box at home using equipment that boxers use, consider Fightcamp. This complete boxing system includes a free-standing bag that you can hit or kick during trainer-led workouts provided on an app.
Another option is Liteboxer, a tall punch pad that is connected to a platform on which you stand. The punch pad has six targets that light up, indicating where to hit. Liteboxer syncs lights with music tempo and guides you through trainer-led workouts provided on the app. The immersive experience lets you release stress, but forces you to focus on complex combinations while having fun and burning calories.
Of course, you don't need to spend a lot of money to box at home. You can purchase
gloves and other boxing gear
, then use a boxing app on your smartphone. Apps like Precision Boxing Coach or PunchLab allow you to box wherever and whenever you have your smartphone.
At-Home Shadowboxing Workout
Jumping Rope
Another high-intensity workout that requires focus and concentration is jumping rope. The beauty of this exercise is that you'll increase your heart rate quickly and burn calories fast. It also requires very little equipment. You can
buy an inexpensive rope
for less than $15 or get a complete system (like CrossRope) that includes weighted ropes and app-based workouts.
A
jump rope workout
can include moves like the double foot jump, running step, high step, or double unders that force you to take your mind off the anger to coordinate your feet.
A 150-pound person is likely to burn about 143 calories with just ten minutes of fast jumping. Use a
calories-burned calculator
to estimate how a jump-rope workout might work for you.
Circuit Training
Verywell / Ben Goldstein
The great thing about a circuit workout is that it keeps you moving. You move from station to station and work different body parts for short segments of time, so there's little time to think about whatever is causing you to feel angry.
To do a circuit at home, you may need some basic equipment like
dumbbells
,
kettlebells
, or
resistance bands
. Or you might try a
total bodyweight circuit
and just use your own body to build strength and get your sweat on.
Circuit-Training Workout for Beginners
High-Intensity Circuit Training (HICT) Workouts
Quick and Dirty Strength and Cardio Circuit Workout
Weights and Cardio Circuit Training Program
Ohm It Out
Mind-body practices, like
Tai Chi Chuan
and yoga, have been shown to help lower blood pressure.
In fact, one study that compared
yoga
to walking found that yoga was more effective at improving mood and decreasing anxiety than hitting the pavement.
So if you are looking at a way to calm yourself when feeling angry, you might want to consider one of these practices.
Yoga
Verywell / Ben Goldstein
There are many
different styles of yoga
that you might consider trying when you feel you need some relief from anger.
Hatha yoga
tends to be slower and more gentle.
Power yoga
and
vinyasa yoga
, on the other hand, move more quickly and offer a more intense workout.
Bikram yoga
is practiced in a heated room which can challenge you to focus on specific postures for the duration of the 90-minute class.
There is even a type of yoga designed for those who want to express their anger. You can practice Rage Yoga at studios around the U.S. and Canada, or you can take a class online.
Instructors are specifically trained in this practice, and classes may include holding poses while swearing. In a
YouTube video
, founder Lindsay Istace says that she created the practice to become an "empowered badass" and help others seeking the same goal through movement.
Regardless of the practice you choose, if you're doing yoga at home, you simply need a
yoga mat
and some space. Take an
online class
, use a
yoga app
, or try one of these yoga sequences:

Tai Chi
Tai chi is actually a martial art that originated in China, but it is not the type where you are aggressive. Instead, it is a series of self-meditation and flowing movements. The slow pace of the movement may help calm your temper and bring your heart rate down if you find that you are charged up and angry.
There are different types of tai chi, but if you are just getting started, there are
online tai chi classes
and smartphone apps that can help. The Tai Chi Foundation also provides several instructional videos and can help you find a class in your area.
Meditation
While meditation is not necessarily a workout, the practice of meditation is certainly an exercise in self-healing that can help you learn to focus attention and awareness for mental clarity. Mindful meditation has been shown to reduce stress and aggression in adolescents,
adults,
and those managing chronic health conditions such as fibromyalgia.
Meditation doesn't require that you take a class, but you may want to look online, read a book, or use an app to help you get started. For example, Headspace offers guidance online and on their smartphone app. Calm is also a popular app that can guide your practice. There are also free apps like Smiling Mind and MyLife to get you started.
The Many Benefits of Meditation
Walk It Out
Walking offers a wide range of health benefits, including better cardiovascular health and a reduced risk of some chronic diseases, such as type 2 diabetes.
Walking may also be a great way to release anger.
One study found that a single bout of walking (just 10 minutes) may reduce hostility and anger in young adults, although not to a statistically significant degree.
Another study showed that reaching 10,000 steps per day resulted in lower levels of reported anger, along with reduced anxiety, depression, fatigue, confusion, and total mood distress in 35 overweight participants who took part in a 12-week walking program.
Walking Workouts
Verywell / Ben Goldstein
Grab a friend and go for a walk the next time that you feel frustrated or spent. Or take a walk and enjoy the alone time. Be sure that you are
properly outfitted
with
appropriate shoes
and
walking apparel
to
avoid blisters
or weather-related snafus.
You may also want to try one of these outdoor or treadmill walking workouts:
20-Minute Brisk Walking Workout
Interval Walking for Weight Loss
Treadmill Walking Workouts
Weekly Walking Workouts
Hiking
Getting outside and tackling rougher terrain through forests, deserts, or mountainous ridges is a great way to release stress and anger. Studies have shown that exposure to nature can have a real effect on your body.
Compared with exercising indoors, exercising in natural environments is associated with greater feelings of revitalization and positive engagement, decreases in tension, confusion, anger, and depression, and increased energy.
Groove It Out
Dance has been used for thousands of years to celebrate life, honor traditions, demonstrate joy, and sometimes express anger. The practice of dance movement therapy, while not widely studied, has been used in cancer patients successfully to address feelings of isolation, depression, anger, and fear.
There are also other ways to let your body move and groove. Whether you have a few minutes or an hour, you can move your body with breath, affirmations, or rhythm to release some anger.
Meditative Movements
Meditative Movements is a program lasting just two to four minutes where you pair simple everyday movements (like walking) with empowering affirmations like "I can." This type of exercise isn't likely to get you sweaty, so it is helpful if you find yourself needing to manage anger at work or in a setting where you only have a few moments.
In a small study of this program, 49 participants with a chronic health condition received five training sessions in Meditative Movements over a 7-week trial. At the end of the study and during a later follow-up, participants reported
improvements in symptoms of anxiety, depression, fatigue, and emotional well-being. When asked what was most beneficial about the program, a common response was "less negative attitude."
Dance It Out (DIO)
Dance It Out, sometimes just called DIO, is a class created by Billy Blanks Jr. that includes over 20 styles of dance in a non-judgmental, supportive environment. Students of all fitness levels, ages, shapes, and sizes release stress and get fit with creative and fun movement. There are also adaptive classes for dancers with disabilities or in wheelchairs.
Blanks hosts a Dance It Out show on Lifetime that includes interviews with inspirational people who have overcome challenges, but you can also find classes by certified DIO instructors in a few studios around the U.S. or in Japan. For those who can't take a class in a studio, you can also take classes online.

A Word From Verywell
Anger is a normal, natural emotion. Anger can even play a positive role in inspiring healthy change in your life. But there may also be times when anger and its effects can become problematic and even get out of control. Sometimes a workout is not enough to manage the emotion.
Anger management is a crucial issue that may need to be addressed through therapy. While exercise is one tool that many people can use to reduce their anger, some people may have trouble controlling their feelings, and this can potentially have dangerous consequences.
So it is best to be proactive before anger becomes an issue. Reach out to a mental health professional or get a referral from your healthcare provider if you feel that you are at a point where you'd like help getting anger in control.

If you have trouble staying fit at work, these office exercises are a great way to keep your body moving right at your desk. The moves here involve
stretching
and strengthening your body, all within the comfort of your workspace.
The only equipment you need are a chair and a full water bottle or dumbbells. Make sure the chair you use is stable. If it has wheels, push it against a wall to make sure it won't roll away.
This workout doesn't take the place of
traditional strength training
. But it does offer you a way to keep your body moving if you can't get away from your desk.
See your doctor before trying this workout if you have any injuries, illnesses, or other conditions.
1
Seated Stretches
Verywell / Ben Goldstein
Lower Back Stretch (pictured):
Sit tall and place the left arm behind the left hip. Gently twist to the left, using the right hand to deepen the stretch. Hold for 20 to 30 seconds, then repeat on the other side.
Wrist Stretch:
Extend an arm in front, palm up, and grab the fingers with your other hand. Gently pull the fingers towards you to stretch the forearm, holding for 20 to 30 seconds. Repeat on the other side.
Wrist and Forearm Stretch:
Press hands together in front of the chest, elbows bent and forearms parallel to the floor. Gently bend wrists to the right and left for 10 reps.
2
Upper Body Exercises
Ben Goldstein
Triceps Dips
(pictured):
Using a stable chair, place hands on the seat next to your hips. Move hips in front of the chair and bend the elbows, lowering the body until the elbows are at 90-degree angles. Push back up and repeat for 16 reps.
Biceps Curl
:
Hold a water bottle in your right hand and, with abs in and spine straight, curl the bottle towards the shoulder for 16 reps. Repeat on the other side.
Front Raise to Triceps Press:
Sit tall with your abs in and hold a full water bottle in the left hand. Lift the bottle up to shoulder level, pause, and then continue lifting all the way up over your head. When your arm is next to the ear, bend the elbow, taking the water bottle behind you and contracting the triceps. Straighten the arm and lower down, repeating for 12 reps on each arm.​
3
Lower Body Exercises
Pulsing Chair Squats.
Ben Goldstein
Chair Squat (pictured):
While sitting, lift up until your hips are just hovering over the chair. Extend your arms in front of you for balance. Hold for 2 to 3 seconds, stand all the way up, and repeat for 16 reps.
One-Legged Squat
:
Using a stable chair, place one foot slightly in front of the other. Use the chair's arms for leverage as you push up into a one-legged squat. Hover just over the chair, keeping the other leg on the floor for balance. Lower and repeat, only coming a few inches off the chair for 12 reps. Repeat on the other side.
Hip Flexion:
Sit tall with your abs in. Lift the left foot off the floor a few inches, knee bent. Hold for 2 seconds, lower, and repeat for 16 reps. Repeat on the other side.
Leg Extension
:
Sit tall with your abs in. Extend the left leg until it's level with the hip, squeezing the quadriceps. Hold for 2 seconds, lower, and repeat for 16 reps. Repeat on the other side.
Inner Thigh:
Place a towel, firm water bottle, or empty coffee cup between the knees as you sit up tall with the abs in. Squeeze the object, release halfway, and squeeze again. Complete 16 reps of slow pulses.
4
Ab Exercises
Verywell / Ben Goldstein
Side Bends
(pictured in a standing position, but it can also be performed while sitting down):
Hold a water bottle with your right hand and stretch it up over the head, arm straight. Gently bend towards the left as far as you can, contracting the abs. Come back to center and repeat on the other side. Complete 10 reps (bending to the right and left is one rep).
Ab Twists
:
Hold the water bottle at chest level and, keeping the knees and hips forward, gently twist to the left as far as you comfortably can, feeling the abs contract. Twist back to center and then to the right for a total of 10 reps. Don't force it or you may end up with a back injury.
Move More Throughout the Workday
Beyond working out at your desk, there are a few tricks for staying active at work.
Taking the stairs
, parking further away from the door, and walking around the office when you can are good places to start. Beyond that, there are a few other options to keep you moving:
If it's allowed, sit on an
exercise ball
instead of a chair. This will strengthen your abs and back and you'll work on your posture without even trying.
Set an alarm to go off every hour to remind you to stand up, stretch, and move around. Even if you just swing your arms or take a deep breath, you'll feel more alert.
Use the restroom on another floor, and take the stairs to get there.
Use a
pedometer
or activity monitor and keep track of how many steps you take. Aim for 6,000 to 10,000 steps a day.
Leave something important in your car (your lunch, your briefcase, etc.) so you have to run out to get it. Take the stairs when you go.
Deliver documents or messages to co-workers in person rather than by email or text.
Walk around the parking lot or local mall on your lunch hour.
Get a headset for your phone so you can move around while you talk.
Get a
standing desk
that allows you to change your position throughout the workday. Start the day sitting until you feel stiff or ready to move, then take a short walk. When you come back, set your desk in a standing position. Work standing for as long as you'd like, then switch back to sitting. You can even use a
balance board
under your desk to help you build strength.
Remember that any movement is better than none. So, don't feel like you have to do sprints all day long. Adding short bouts of exercise throughout the workday can help you
burn more calories
and
reduce stress
.
Make Your Office More Fitness-Friendly
Your boss may not have considered how much more productive employees would be with a little exercise. If you can, encourage them to:
Work with local gyms to provide membership discounts for employees.
Ask local personal trainers to provide monthly seminars or free
body-fat testing
for employees. Some trainers will even do this for free.
Set up daily or weekly walks during lunch or after work.
Give extra breaks during the day to take quick walks.
Be active themselves. If the boss exercises, employees will take their own health more seriously.
Even if your boss could care less about exercise, you can do a lot to get others involved in working out. Install
a portable hoop
at the office for pickup basketball games. Plan lunches where co-workers get together and talk about ways to exercise at work. Get a group together and join a local gym (see if they'll give you a group discount). Or, if space allows, install one piece of exercise equipment, such as an
air walker or glider
, that's versatile enough to accommodate different fitness levels.
Another option is to
hire a personal trainer
to come and work with you and your co-workers during lunch. Many trainers offer discounts for group training sessions. There are a number of ways to encourage fitness in the workplace, so be creative.

Why People Are Training Barefoot
Benefits of Barefoot Training
Where You Should Not Train Barefoot
Frequently Asked Questions
Stretching and exercising barefoot are commonplace in a yoga or pilates studio. Yet in more traditional settings, like gyms and weight rooms, entering without shoes is far from the norm. In fact, many gyms have dress codes that require sneakers to be worn for safety concerns.
Yet in other spaces, there are other ideas for proper workout footwear. You might have seen photos and videos of your favorite social media personalities talking about training barefoot. Many personal trainers and fitness experts are exercising sans shoes or using barefoot shoes instead of traditional sneakers for potential health benefits.
Why People Are Training Barefoot
Training barefoot is rising in popularity within the wellness space. “Barefoot training has become more prevalent in recent years due to the prevalence of barefoot shoes, online influencers, and literature supporting the benefits,” explains Dave Mace, founder and head coach at
Maximum Potential Calisthenics
.
Exercising barefoot can offer benefits for the feet as well as the body. “Training barefoot may improve agility, ankle stability, and the positioning of the joint, if done correctly,” Mace notes.
“For some, this may relieve minor niggles, such as a low arch or pain from repetitive movements like running.”
But before you decide to ditch your shoes, there are some things to consider. According to Mace, people who aren’t accustomed to walking or training barefoot may get tired faster or could be more prone to injury.
He offers up advice for anyone who is curious about
exercising
barefoot. “Newbies to barefoot training should start by walking barefoot for 5 minutes a day—this can just be around the house, to begin with,” he suggests. “Then, slowly introduce barefoot training by doing shorter workouts, warming up the feet before starting, and thinking about correct form and foot positioning throughout.”
And if you prefer to literally have a bit more cushion before making a sudden change or transition, he suggests using minimalist shoes to adjust. “Some people find transitioning to barefoot shoes helps to prepare the body for barefoot training,” he explains.
Preparing for Your First Pilates Class
Benefits of Barefoot Training
There are several benefits of barefoot training.
Stability
Training without shoes can help increase stability in your feet and in your body.
“When you work out barefoot, you have the ability to spread your toes (unlike in sneakers where they are often compressed), which creates a bigger contact surface with the ground that allows for greater stability,” explains Eva Peña, CPT and founder and director of Wellness+ Studio.
“Also, barefoot exercise can help to readjust feet that have changed shape over time because of footwear, something that greatly impacts stability.”
Increases Coordination
Being barefoot is a natural part of being human. “Getting back to your nature, re-learning your movement patterns, and improving muscle engagement increases the activation of
proprioceptors
, unequivocally bringing your coordination, stability, and balance to the next level,” says Peña. “This in turn leads to healthier joints and a significant reduction to the risk of injury, making you more biomechanically efficient.”
Strengthens Feet
“When you workout barefoot, you engage all your feet muscles in a way that is not always possible because of the ‘accommodations’ your shoes provide,” says Peña. “For example, most
running shoes
are designed to help propel you forward, not to provide balance, so as a result, your feet don’t engage the right way, which leads to tighter muscles, increased pressure on
joints
, and weaker feet.”
According to Mace, “Training barefoot can reduce or remove
foot pronation
; this is because it strengthens the feet and improves muscle tone allowing the arch to rise.”
One study with fifty-seven runners showed that wearing minimalist shoes could help strengthen the feet. Results showed that barefoot shoes could be as effective as doing foot exercises to strengthen the feet.

Increased Foot Mobility
Working out barefoot helps increase foot movement and mobility. “Training barefoot improves ankle mobility by connecting tissues from the toes, plantar fascia to the ankle,” explains Peña.
Although it’s common to wear shoes to exercise, there can be some not-so-great influences on the feet and body. “While there are certainly benefits to wearing shoes, our bodies also change to accommodate the footwear which can lead to various consequences including weaker feet and unnatural weight distribution,” she says.
“When you are barefoot, you’re engaging all your muscles in the proper manner which allows you to create the necessary connection between your tissues and ligaments because your body is not shifting in order to try to find balance," Peña concludes.

Sensory Awareness
“One of the benefits of training barefoot is the sensory feedback you get when your feet connect directly with the ground,” says Mace. “Our brain then tells the body how to land our foot on the ground, including how much pressure to exert.”
Deja Riley
, wellness expert and Lululemon studio trainer, adds, “Your connection to the ground allows you direct access to know where you are moving in space at all times.”
Mace explains that when we wear shoes, it’s more difficult to feel the surface and get sensory input making it easy to overcompensate. “This can cause us to exert more force than we need to and, over time, results in damage to the joints,” he says.
Where You Should Not Train Barefoot
Some gyms may not permit working out without shoes based on their dress code as well as for safety reasons. Considering hygiene and cleanliness is also important. “If there is an irregular surface or potentially poor hygiene conditions, it’s important to be cautious and carefully consider if this is the right environment in which to exercise barefoot,” explains Peña.
Checking out the space where you plan to train is important before you ditch your sneakers. “You shouldn’t train anywhere barefoot that could be a safety hazard,” warns Riley. “Ensure the space around you is clean—you have to watch out for your soles.”
Working Out Barefoot
Yes
Workout surface is flat
Surfaces are clean
No required dress code
No
Workout surface is sharp or uneven
Surfaces are dirty
Dress code requires shoes
Deciding whether to exercise barefoot is also personal. “It depends on each individual’s training level and experience with any particular activity,” notes Peña. “I recommend avoiding high-impact workouts until you are very comfortable and confident with that exercise.”
The type of workout is also important to consider whether you do it barefoot or with sneakers. “When doing exercises such as jumping, it may be safer to train with shoes on to cushion the joints from the force of landing,” explains Mace. “Equally, if you are climbing or walking on sharp uneven surfaces, it's best to refrain from training barefoot.”
A Word From Verywell
Working out barefoot may lead to certain health benefits, but ultimately it should only be done in safe, clean environments. Additionally, individuals should only work out barefoot if it's within their comfort level—speak to a healthcare professional if you have any questions or hesitations about your workout footwear.
Frequently Asked Questions
Is it OK to lift weights barefoot?
Lifting weights barefoot can be done and in fact, may help with stability since your feet will have more contact with the ground. This helps your body and feet have more sensory input. Make sure when lifting barefoot that not only is the floor safe and clean but it's also permitted.  Some personal trainers recommend getting familiar with exercising and training barefoot first before starting to lift weights.
Is it OK to workout barefoot on carpet?
Whether it’s ok to work out barefoot on the carpet, depends on the intensity of the workout. Carpet is an option for low-impact exercise without shoes.
The
American Academy of Podiatric Sports Medicine
recommends only doing low- to moderate-impact exercises on the carpet.
Does working out barefoot strengthen feet?
Yes, working out barefoot strengthens feet by using all the muscles in the feet. This helps make the feet more mobile, and increases flexibility.

Finding credible fitness and health information on the Internet can be difficult, but know how to decipher information and sites, plus knowing the best fitness and health websites can help. Instead of being overwhelmed with the hundreds of thousands of results that you receive from your search engine, you will be able to target good information quickly.
Become an Internet Sleuth
There are ways to figure out if the site you're on is a reputable one. First, look at the domain name and the extension. Ever notice that most sites have '.com' or '.org' at the end? These actually mean something.
Below is a list of the most common domain name extensions and their meanings:
.com stands for a commercial site. So, if you land on a .com page, that site may have an agenda beyond providing you with information, such as selling a product.
.net stands for Internet source. Again, these sites can be excellent resources, but they can also be unreliable.
.edu stands for university or school. These are usually reliable resources.
.gov this stands for the government. These are also usually reliable resources.
.org this stands for nonprofit organization. These sites are also generally reliable.
It should be noted that no one polices the above suffixes. So you can't judge a site by whether it is a .net or a .org. There are plenty of .com sites that have incredible information. In fact, most news sites carry the .com moniker.
There are a few steps to figuring out if a site is reliable. First, look at the domain name (above). Next, search for information about the site. Who created it? What are their credentials? When was the site last updated? Is there a list of available resources you can check out? Finally, read the information carefully and see if it gels with what you already know. For example, if you know that safe
weight loss
happens with exercise and a
healthy diet
, be wary of a site that offers a magical pill guaranteeing weight loss.
Now that you have some basic tools under your belt, here are some great health and fitness websites.
Comprehensive Health and Fitness Sites

How to Get Started
Where to Play
Injury Prevention
If you’re looking to try a new sport, tennis is a fantastic option. Not only does it burn substantial calories and
improve overall health
(including improved cardiovascular health, weight loss, and increased range of motion), but it’s a great way to learn a new skill, develop camaraderie and a competitive spirit with others, and enjoy the outdoors—or the warmth of an indoor court during chilly weather.
Gary Kushnirovich
is a former professional player with a world ranking who has taken his passion for the sport into coaching. “Players who are just starting out with tennis should really become familiar with terminology and the scoring so that they can compete,” the USPTA Certified Elite Professional, USPTR Performance Professional, ITPA Tennis Performance Trainer says.
But, let's say that you'd like to take a less competitive, more casual approach to trying tennis for the first time. It's completely fine if you'd prefer to simply volley the ball back and forth with a friend. You'll still get exercise and enjoy those associated health benefits. In fact, Kushnirovich believes that as a beginner, you should have "no expectations" when it comes to your ability.
"Tennis should be fun," he says. "I am a strong believer that expectations at any level of play can be crippling."
It's the kind of sport in which you can dial up or dial down the intensity, resulting in people of all ages being able to play. Let's take a look at what you should know or do before you head out to the court.
Basic Rules and Terms
Tennis is a game that's played and scored from right to left on the court, with goal of staying within the lines of the court, which is split in half by a net. One person serves a ball either over or underhand diagonally across the court.
You'll get two chances to hit the ball, staying behind the baseline when it's your turn to serve. Tennis can be played as singles (one person on each side) or doubles (two people on each side).
Matches are typically played best two out of three sets. A set is played as the first of six games, and the winner is required to win by two games. Scoring is defined as the following: 15, 30, 40, GAME. If the scores go to 40-40, this is called a "deuce." When the game reaches a deuce, a player must win by two points. If a score is zero, it's called "love."
A rally is a mix of forehand and backhand strokes. A return of serve is a stroke that's either a forehand or a backhand.
Clothing and Gear
For beginners, start with a tennis racquet that is appropriate to your age. Younger players will naturally play with smaller racquets and lighter balls. As an adult, Kushnirovich specifically recommends starting with a “rec-friendly racquet” like the Wilson Clash. As your skill level increases, one of these
best coach-recommended tennis racquets
might be for you.
You’ll of course need some tennis balls to get playing, too. Kushnirovich’s preferred tennis ball is the Wilson US Open tennis ball.
“New players should also wear appropriate tennis shoes that have good ankle support,” he says. Look to these recommendations for
men's
and
women's tennis shoes
.
When shopping for tennis-ready clothing, shorts, skorts, shirts, and dresses should be of a dry-fit material so that they are light and comfortable to wear. Remember to find attire that has pockets that can comfortably hold two tennis balls. And don't forget
water bottles
and a small towel.
10 Best Sports Glasses
How to Get Started
“The United States Tennis Association (USTA) is trying extremely hard to make tennis more accessible as well as safe,” Kushnirovich says. That’s why he recommends
USTA Net Generation
, a search engine that will help you find a certified professional in your area who has undergone
SafePlay
training, USTA’s
athlete safety program.
Lessons can be a fantastic way to build a foundation if you'd like to pursue tennis further. An instructor can help you avoid bad habits and
injuries
in the long run as well. It's also an effective way to master the rules of the game.
Where to Play
No matter where you live, the chances are good that you’ll find a place to play tennis. It's fairly easy to locate local clubs, public courts, or even a high school or middle school where you can play.
You also have the option to practice solo, without a court. You can hit a tennis ball against a wall to get a feel for rallying, or head to a
handball
court to prevent running after the ball.
Stretches and Injury Prevention
As with any sport, it's imperative to warm up properly before hitting the tennis court, or, it can be beneficial to spend time in the weight room. Some of these
stretches and movements
can include:
Quad stretches
Romanian deadlifts
Spine twists
Leg raises
Lunge and twists
Side lunges
Reverse flies
YouTube can also be a good resource for learning how to do these stretches and movements. Kushnirovich even has a
YouTube video
that goes through dynamic warm-up exercises for tennis.
In addition to warming up, if you want to prevent injuries, be sure to start slow and stretch after you play.
“The most common reason players get injured is from rushing the warm up, moving and swinging too aggressively as they begin play, or allowing their body to get super stiff after they finish playing by failing to properly stretch afterwards,” Kushnirovich says. Besides your muscles and joints, a pair of these
best sports sunglasses
can protect your eyes in style.
A Word From Verywell
Tennis can be a great hobby to pick up with a friend or partner and an excellent form of lifelong exercise. Just remember to start slow, practice good safety, and most importantly, have fun! If you're enjoying yourself, consider taking some lessons to really start to understand how to improve your game, perfect your form, and start keeping score.

Frequently Asked Questions
Why Trust Verywell Fit
Verywell Fit / Phoebe Sklansky
Even if you exercise regularly, standing or sitting all day can cause tightness and cramping in your legs and feet. The best compression socks help promote better blood flow and circulation in your lower body, keeping that discomfort at bay. Some athletes and active people may also experience less muscle fatigue and
soreness
after wearing compression socks, especially when recovering from intense workouts.
When shopping, look for
soft, breathable fabrics
and
comfortable pressure
to get the most out of your socks.
To find the best compression socks, we first asked experts
what to look for
when shopping, how they work, and who should wear them. Then, we
wear-tested 25 pairs
from top, trusted brands at home. We wore them during our workouts and daily routines. We assessed each pair on
fit, support, feel, and overall value.
We also had a physical therapist from our
Review Board
review the claims in this article for accuracy.

Who They're For
Best for wearers who need all-day support for working out, traveling, and daily wear.
Why We Love Them
Ultra-comfortable and supportive,
LEVSOX’s Compression Socks
are our top overall pick. Thanks to a higher pressure rating of 20 to 30 millimeters of mercury (mmHg), they feel
snug without being too tight
—it’s like a massage for our feet. They’re easy to put on, and we noticed our
legs felt significantly less tired
after hours of sitting, standing, and walking in them.
We especially appreciate the material, a blend of nylon and spandex that gives these socks a
silky smooth, breathable, and flexible feel
—almost like
high-quality compression leggings
. We didn’t experience any irritation while wearing them, even behind our knees, where many sock bands can cause chafing. Plus, they still looked like new after multiple washes. Best of all, they’re
budget-friendly:
Sets of three pairs start around $20, while a set of six pairs costs only a few dollars more.
Potential Flaws
We love the fun prints these socks come in, but wish there were more neutral, solid options available.
Meet Our Testers
Our tester has experienced both extremes: sitting for hours at a computer or standing for hours in a studio for work. They also have a toddler they're trying to keep up with and often deal with fatigue and leg tension at the end of the day. They have previous experience with compression socks during pregnancy.
These compression socks are snug but not too tight and made from high-quality material.

Pros
Band won’t slip or roll down
Moisture-wicking
Gentle support
Cons

Compression:
15-20 mmHg |
Material:
Nylon, spandex |
Length:
Knee-high |
Best For:
Walking, standing, sitting, traveling, recovery |
Our Overall Rating:
4.9/5
Who They're For
Best for wearers who need light to moderate daily support at a budget-friendly pirce.
Why We Love Them
If you’re shopping on a budget,
CHARMKING’s Compression Socks
have our vote. You can pick up a set of eight for a fraction of what other individual pairs on our list cost. And since the sets are so large, you’ll get plenty of wear between laundry loads. We found that they provided
plenty of support,
whether we were walking, sitting, or working out. And they feel comfortable, offering 15 to 20 mmHg of
moderate pressure.
The band stays in place, never rolling down or bunching up, even after wearing them for 12 hours straight. Plus, the
reinforced heel
features thick cushioning for a softer feel underfoot. With a
wide variety of colors and styles
available—from basic black and beige to bright patterns and neons—you can easily find the perfect pair. At their budget-friendly price, you can choose several sets, making these compression socks incredibly versatile.
Potential Flaws
While we appreciate that these socks are moisture-wicking, we found them less breathable than other options on our list, since our feet occasionally felt hot.
Meet Our Testers
Our tester walks two to three hours daily and participates in total body conditioning classes three to five times a week, so they're on their feet a lot. They also recently had foot surgery that resulted in some swelling, so they hope wearing compression socks regularly will help reduce the pain associated with the swelling.
If you're on a budget, you can't go wrong with these colorful compression socks.

Cons
May be hard to put on
Key Specs
Compression:
20-30 mmHg |
Material:
Merino wool, rayon, nylon, spandex |
Length:

Best For:
Walking, standing, sitting, traveling, recovery |
Our Overall Rating:
4.9/5
Who They're For
Best for wearers who need high compression for conditions related to or that cause poor circulation.
Why We Love Them
For low circulation, we recommend compression socks made from high-quality materials that offer firm support. While testing, we found
SockWell’s Elevation Firm Graduated Compression Socks
checked all of these boxes and then some. We immediately noticed how well they fit, with a secure band that didn’t bunch up or roll down. When we took them off, our legs and feet weren’t tired at all—we felt our
circulation improve after day one.
If your feet tend to sweat, you’ll appreciate that the material includes Merino wool for a
soft feel
and improved breathability. The addition of rayon, nylon, and spandex enhances durability, with
no pilling or shrinking,
even after repeated washes. We also appreciated
additional support under the arches
for all-day comfort. Plus, you can save a few dollars by purchasing a three-pack.
Potential Flaws
The higher compression level made these socks a bit challenging to put on, but the excellent support made it worth the effort.
Meet Our Testers
Our tester has a condition that causes low circulation in their hands and feet and was advised by a doctor to wear compression socks as often as possible. But they have found it hard to find high compression socks that are comfortable to wear, until these.
These socks offer just the right amount of compression to help improve circulation.

Who They're For
Best for wearers that need moderate support for long periods of time.
Why We Love Them
During our test, we found that
SB SOX’s Compression Socks
were breathable and easy to wear for hours on end. We liked how they fit, with supportive fabric that provided a snug feel without being difficult to put on. The
band stayed put
while we went about our day and didn’t bunch up, dig in, or slide down. Like others on our list, this pair has a reinforced heel with extra cushioning, adding to the
supportive, comfortable feel.
We noticed these socks were effective, too, relieving our tight,
tired calf muscles
. After a full day of wearing them, we
felt less cramping and fatigue.
We also loved their flexibility and breathability, enabling our full range of motion without growing sticky or damp. Plus, they showed
no signs of wear or tear,
even after multiple washes throughout testing.
Potential Flaws
Some wearers find the toe seam fabric uncomfortable over long periods, but we didn’t notice this when testing.
Meet Our Testers
Our tester participates in hot yoga and then sits or stands for the majority of the day. They experience stiffness and tightness in their feet and calves by the end of the day and have been noticing some poor circulation.
These socks are low-profile and easy to wear, making them great for everyday wear.

Who They're For
Best for wearers who need light, moisture-wicking support.
Why We Love Them
Bluemaple’s Copper Compression Socks
fit seamlessly into our daily routines. Made from a lightweight, breathable blend of nylon and polyester, these socks
kept our feet cool and dry.
If
sweaty feet
are your pet peeve, you’ll appreciate the performance fabric’s moisture-wicking capabilities. With an easy-on, easy-off design, we were impressed that the
band stayed in place
while we sat down and stood up throughout the day.
During testing, we found that the
light, comfy compression
made a difference from our first wear. Our feet and legs
felt less tired and heavy,
and when we chose not to wear the socks the next day, our fatigue came right back. The socks washed well, too, without pilling or stretching out. We also love that they’re one of the more
budget-friendly
options on our list, with plenty of bright colors and patterns to choose from.
Potential Flaws
These socks offered comfortable compression, but we did notice that the material started to feel itchy after eight hours of wear.

Our tester spends long stretches of time sitting or standing at a desk and is looking for compression socks that will improve circulation when paired with movement breaks. They also have previous experience with compression socks while training for a half marathon.
The Bluemaple Copper Compression Socks are super easy to slip on, plus, they feel lightweight and very breathable during wear.

These more affordable socks stay in place well, helping to reduce leg and foot fatigue, however, some may find the fabric to be a bit itchy.

Who They're For
Best for wearers who need support during pregnancy, particularly the second and third trimesters.
Why We Love Them
When combined with regular exercise, compression socks can help relieve swelling and other symptoms in your lower body, both during pregnancy and postpartum.
Our tester found that
Bombas’ Strong Compression Socks
successfully
prevented swelling
in her legs and feet on long flights during her second and third trimesters. She also noted that, while supportive, the socks were so comfortable that she frequently forgot she was wearing them.
We like that the
secure band doesn’t slide down or bunch up
. And the fabric contains a breathable blend of cotton, spandex, polyester, and nylon to keep your feet cool and dry. Unlike other socks with rough toe seams that can cause irritation,
Bombas socks
feature a
seamless toe
for additional comfort. We also love the sock arch, which targets
extra support
right where your feet need it the most.
Potential Flaws
These might run a bit small, so consider sizing up if you're in between sizes.
Meet Our Testers
Our tester was pregnant during our testing period and wore compression socks on doctors' recommendations, particularly during air travel. Our tester also has experience with the Bombas brand and was excited to learn they offered compression socks.
The compression of these socks helped our tester prevent foot swelling on long flights during her third trimester of pregnancy.

Who They're For
Best if you have wider calves or prefer extra room, but still want firm compression that stays put.
Why We Love Them
If you’ve had issues with compression socks being too tight or rolling down, you may need a pair with extra room at the calves. When testing,
Physix Gear Sport's Compression Socks
fit our tester (who has larger calves) perfectly. She noted how easy they were to put on and take off, even though she usually struggles to pull compression socks all the way up. Even so, the
band stayed in place
and the 20 to 30 mmHg of pressure
visibly reduced swelling
in her feet and lower legs.
We also love the fabric, which is
soft, breathable, and
moisture-wicking
to keep you comfortable. The socks held up well after washing and didn’t feel itchy after hours of wear. We like the double-stitched seams, which are strategically placed
to
prevent chafing
.
And we appreciate that Physix provides a detailed size chart and a money-back guarantee so you can shop confidently.
Potential Flaws
We noticed that these socks bunched up at our knees, so they may be too long if you have shorter legs.
Meet Our Testers
Our tester has experience with compression socks, especially while traveling on long flights. They use compression socks to help avoid swelling and improve circulation.
These compression socks comfortably fit those with wider calves.

Who They're For
Best if
walking
is a part of your fitness routine, especially if you want extra support and warmth from your socks.
Why We Love Them
Do you daydream about putting your feet up after a long day of crushing your
step count
? We recommend
SockWell’s Winterland Compression Socks
for combatting pain and fatigue from walking all day. When testing, we noticed that they provided
moderate, comfortable support
with 15 to 20 mmHg of pressure. We love the range of colors and patterns, many of which are more subtle and neutral than other pairs on our list.
The
band was secure
, staying put even after hours of walking. But our favorite feature was the fabric: One tester, who often gets cold feet in the winter, noted the socks kept her
warm and comfortable
whether she was working out or trekking three
miles in the snow
. We also found the lightweight material successfully
wicked away sweat
in our
walking boots
.
Potential Flaws
Some wearers note that these socks tend to run small. While compression socks should feel snug, they should never feel uncomfortably tight, so you may want to consider ordering the larger size.
Meet Our Testers
Our tester has not used compression socks before but does walk a lot and sit for long periods of time during the day. They also experience cold feet that could be due to poor circulation and are hopeful that compression socks can help improve both.
These compression socks feature a secure band that won't fall down as you walk.

Material:

Who They're For
Best for wearers who need light to moderate compression while
sitting at their desk
all day.
Why We Love Them
With a pressure rating of 18 to 25 mmHg,
Wellow’s Compression Socks
have a unique level of support
ideal for preventing pins and needles
after long days of sitting at a desk. Most socks fall between 15 to 20 or 20 to 30 mmHg, so if you’ve had problems in the past with compression socks feeling too tight or too loose, this pair could be a happy medium. When we wore them while sitting, our
feet and legs felt noticeably less tired.
The material is warm and washed well, keeping its shape with
no signs of pilling.
We found these socks to be very
breathable and moisture-wicking,
and we like that they also have
antimicrobial properties.
Plus, we think they're a solid buy with a wide range of jewel tones and additional savings when you purchase a three- or five-pack.
Potential Flaws
These socks started to feel itchy after wearing them for eight hours.
We had to roll the band to keep the socks at knee height, so they may be too long for some shorter wearers. However, we appreciated that the band remained comfortable even when doubled up.
Meet Our Testers
Our tester is not generally very active right now and spends a lot of the day sitting. They are hoping that compression socks will help boost circulation and support
exercise on a spin bike
.
If you experience pins and needles after a long day sitting at your desk, these compression socks can help with circulation.

Material:

Length:

Best For:
Walking, standing, sitting, traveling, recovery |
Our Overall Rating:
4.7/5
Who They're For
Best for wearers who need mild compression, particularly around the foot, ankle, and lower leg.
Why We Love Them
A gradient compression sock delivers varying levels of pressure throughout your lower leg.
Dr. Scholl’s Graduated Compression Socks
provide more compression around the feet and ankles, gradually reducing pressure as they move up the leg. In our testing, we found they
effectively relieved fatigue and swelling
at one of the most budget-friendly prices on our list.
After wearing these socks for a full day, our tester reported that normal leg fatigue was alleviated, and there was a noticeable reduction in swelling from a recent ankle injury. With a pressure rating of 10 to 15 mmHg, these socks offer
mild compression that still yields results.
They are an excellent choice if you’ve struggled to find compression socks that aren’t too tight or are new to wearing them. The socks also washed well, making them a reliable addition to your sock drawer.
Potential Flaws
Since these socks are on the lighter side, we found they may not offer enough compression around the ankles for some wearers.
Meet Our Testers
Our tester experiences
lower leg pain
after long workouts or long hours of sitting or standing. They have never tried compression socks before but are hopeful that these can help with swelling, pain, and discomfort in their feet and legs.
Dr. Scholl’s Compression Knee-High Socks offer mild compression around the feet, with even less compression up the leg, working well for those who prefer different levels of support.

These budget-friendly compression socks feel really comfortable, thanks to their smooth toe seams, and they stand up well to laundering.

Who They're For
Best for wear in cold climates or while participating in

.
Why We Love Them
Compression socks designed to retain heat can be a lifesaver in winter (or when your office’s air conditioning is cranked up). We recommend
Bombas’ Everyday Compression Socks
, which are made from a thick blend of cotton, polyester, nylon, and elastane. They fit well and
keep your feet warm
but still remain breathable. We didn't experience any foot sweat, even after a full day of running around and working out.
With 15 to 20 mmHg of compression, these socks comfortably sit in the middle of the pressure range. We also appreciate the simple, sporty design, making them ideal for everyday wear. We found that they allow unrestricted movement, providing a
full range of motion
for our feet and legs. And we appreciate that they feature Bombas’ signature
seamless toe for added comfort,
whether worn alone or with
sneakers
.
Potential Flaws
While we loved how supportive these socks were, we weren’t a fan of how tight the band felt. You may want to size up for more room.
Meet Our Testers
Our tester has a condition affecting their nervous system and was advised by a doctor to wear compression socks to support circulation and combat fatigue. They have used compression socks previously while working from home where they sit most of the day.
These compression socks will keep your feet warm when temperatures start to drop.

Length:

Best For:

Our Overall Rating:
4.5/5
Who They're For
Best for intermediate to advanced athletes who need moderate to high support for long workouts.
Why We Love Them
Although they’re the most expensive pair of compression socks on our list,
CEP's Run 4.0 Compression Socks
are our top pick for athletes looking to add to their workout or
recovery routines
. With a solid 20 to 30 mmHg of pressure, these are one of the
more compressive pairs
on our list. Still, we found they were
comfortable for hours on end.
With additional cushioning and plenty of room in the toe box, they provide even support for your arches, heels, and calves.
We like the stylish design, which comes in various modern colors. We also appreciate the
moisture-wicking
and
quick-drying
properties that add to our comfort during workouts. If you’re looking to save some money while still reaping the benefits of CEP’s unique design, the brand also makes ankle compression socks for around a third of the price (however, we didn’t test these).
Potential Flaws
These socks are the priciest pair on our list, so if you need many pairs for everyday wear, you might want to consider other options.
Meet Our Testers
Our tester sits for much of the day and experiences swelling and tingling in their feet. They also cycle and go for long walks where they can experience tiredness and strain in their legs. They have used compression socks in the past for exercise.
These compression socks are one of the most compressive pair on our list and work great for athletes.
Verywell Fit / Ashley Craiger
Compression Socks We Also Tested
Although we tested 25 pairs of compression socks, only 12 made it onto our final list. While we didn’t love these pairs, we still think they have some features worth mentioning.
Copper Fit’s Energy Easy-On/Easy-Off Knee High Compression Socks
fit well and offer a comfortable level of support. But the band hits right where our knees bent, which was uncomfortable and sometimes annoying.
We liked that
Figs’ Compression Socks
successfully prevent swelling. However, the fabric was so thick that our feet started to sweat almost immediately, and we found them difficult to put on.
Zensah’s Tech+ Compression Socks
have padding underfoot and decent support. We liked that they were breathable, but at around $50 per pair, they didn’t perform as well as the less expensive socks on our list.
Verywell Fit / Stephanie Petit
What to Look for When Shopping for Compression Socks
Materials:
Most socks are made with a blend of synthetic materials that wick away moisture and stretch comfortably, says podiatrist
Ernest L. Isaacson, DPM, FACFAS
. The socks on our list are made from cotton, polyester, Lycra, nylon, elastane, spandex, rayon, bamboo, and Merino wool, among other materials. Look for socks made with warm, breathable, lightweight, and sweat-wicking fabric. They should also be soft but durable enough to hold up after repeated washes.
Pressure Rating:
The pressure rating is the amount of compression a sock provides to help circulate blood in your legs and feet. How much pressure you need depends on how and when you plan to wear your socks.
Isaacson recommends looking for socks in the 7 to 21 mmHg range because they provide gentle pressure for moderate help with your circulation. Some socks go all the way up to 40 mmHg, which is recommended for anyone recovering from surgery or suffering from chronic illness. Consult a healthcare professional to find the right pressure rating for you.
Fit:
A compression sock should feel tight, but not so tight that it becomes uncomfortable, Isaacson says. Most sock manufacturers offer a size chart to help you find the right fit. Often, you’ll need to measure the circumference of your calves to decide which size is best. Further guidance from a healthcare professional may be necessary if you’re dealing with recovery or illness.
Comfort:
Look for a pair of comfortable compression socks, with just enough pressure to relieve tension and swelling in your legs and feet. They should feel tight but not so tight that they’re painful to wear. Also, consider the material your socks are made from; moisture-wicking fabric can prevent uncomfortable
chafing and blisters
.
Benefits of wearing high-quality socks.

How We Tested the Compression Socks
To find the best compression socks,
we tested 25 pairs
in the real world during our workouts, daily routines, and travel. While testing, we evaluated each pair based on the following criteria.
Fit:
Compression socks should fit snugly but not be so tight that they cause pain or cut into your legs. The first time we put the socks on, we note if they fit as expected according to our normal size. We ask things like: Are the socks too long? Too short? Do they bunch up or slide down? Does the band stay put? We also consider how easy it is to pull them on and remove them.
Support:
To evaluate the support of each pair of socks, we wear them for a week while standing, walking, or sitting for hours at a time, as well as during our
exercise sessions
. We assess whether we feel a difference in our legs and feet, noting if any previous swelling and fatigue have been reduced. We also pay attention to whether our legs feel energized and refreshed.
Feel:
While wearing the socks, we assess their feel by considering whether our legs get sweaty and sticky or if the socks feel breathable and wick away moisture. We also ask ourselves if we can move freely in the socks or if they cut into our skin or limit our range of motion. After we wash them, we check if they feel the same as they did when they were new.
Overall Value:
We wait to check the price until after the testing period when we've evaluated all the other criteria. We then note if the price reflects the value based on the socks' performance. We also determine if we would pay full price or wait for them to go on sale. Lastly, we consider whether we would recommend the socks to friends and family.

Our Experts
We consulted experts at each stage of producing this story to get their input on what to look for in compression socks. They advised us on specific features to consider, how to decide what amount of compression is appropriate, and how compression socks can be helpful. We choose and test products independently, but expert input helps influence our choices.

Frequently Asked Questions
How do compression socks work?
Compression socks help your veins circulate blood back to your heart, Isaacson says. Research has shown wearing compression socks can protect your muscles from excessive forces while you move, reducing muscle fatigue and soreness after intense, high-impact activities. They can also help you exercise more efficiently by improving your proprioception (the sense that tells your brain where your body is moving in space).
How tight should compression socks be?
Some socks are more compressive than others. Most socks provide pressure that’s between 12 and 30 mmHg. Studies show that compression socks are most effective between 20 and 30 mmHg.
As far as feel goes, your socks should be tight but not so tight that they’re unbearable or painful to wear. They also shouldn’t dig into your calves, especially at the top of the band.
Is it okay to wear compression socks every day?
For most people, it's safe to wear compression socks every day as long as you’re wearing the correct size. Just make sure to take them off every once in a while since it’s not a good idea to leave the same pair on for multiple days in a row, Prestipino says.
Who should not wear compression socks?
Although our experts confirmed that most people can wear compression socks regularly, they aren’t for everyone. Avoid compression socks if you have severe peripheral artery disease (PAD) since they may overly restrict your blood flow.
If you’re unsure whether compression socks are right for you, consult with your healthcare provider before purchasing a pair.

Why We Love It
Vuori’s Halo Performance Skirt
excels in both functionality and style, making it a versatile choice for various activities. When we first tried it on, we immediately appreciated the
soft and stretchy fabric,
which feels nice and fits well. The performance blend of recycled polyester and elastane is not only super soft but also
moisture-wicking,
keeping you comfortable even when you work up a sweat.
The
high-rise fit
and
built-in shorts
offer coverage, ensuring comfort and confidence. Plus, we appreciate that the material is completely opaque. We also love the
functional pockets,
including one ball pocket and two side pockets, perfect for holding a tennis ball, wallet, keys, and other small essentials. And the
pleated back
side adds a touch of stylish flair.
Potential Flaws
While the mini skirt may be short for some, we found that it still offers enough coverage for short to average height wearers.
Most Valuable Insight
“Honestly I was expecting it to be over $100, so yes I definitely think this price is super reasonable for the quality of the skort.”

Available in sizes XXS to 6XL,
Girlfriend Collective’s FLOAT Ultralight Split Skort
offers one of the most inclusive ranges on the market. We found that it provides a custom-like fit and
runs true to size.
The fabric is soft, sustainable,
slightly compressive,
and super lightweight, making it a great choice for sweaty,
intense activities
.
The
built-in shorts
and high-rise design offer ample coverage. During testing, we appreciated the
side slit
not only for its stylish look but also for the increased range of motion it provides. The fabric is moisture-wicking, so sweat dries quickly. Additionally, the
two large and deep side pockets
are spacious enough to hold a phone, which is always a plus.
Potential Flaws
We wish that this skort came in more than two color options.
Most Valuable Insight
“The fabric is silky and smooth. It moves with my body in every direction, and I never felt squeezed in. I wore this all day while running errands and moving into my new apartment, and I was comfortable for hours!” —

For swift movements on the court, you need a lightweight skort that ensures an unrestricted range of motion. Our top choice is

moisture-wicking and breathability

pleating at the back
adds a touch of style. Available in a wide array of
30 colors and two inseam lengths,

Hikers need a skort that offers both comfort and durability to maintain focus on the trail. Enter
The North Face’s Never Stop Wear Skort,
a lightweight,
sweat-wicking
solution perfectly engineered for extended outdoor adventures. We appreciate its structured design and secure
zippered side pockets,

compressive shorts
offered both coverage and confidence, which we found particularly valuable during climbing excursions.

Why We Love It
If you're on a budget, consider
BALEAF's Women's Tennis Skort for
its excellent value. Despite its lower price point, we discovered it boasts
high quality with full opacity,
even in the white version we tested. Crafted from performance materials, it also offers
breathability
and a smooth feel.
We've comfortably worn this skort for long walks, errands, and even running, thanks to its
versatile, flowy fit
that allows for full range of motion. Plus, it's equipped with a convenient
back zippered pocket
for secure storage, along with a
side ball pocket
for court sports enthusiasts. With a dozen colors to choose from, you might find yourself tempted to grab more than one at this price.
Potential Flaws
When walking fast or running, we had to stop occasionally to adjust our shorts because they tended to roll up.
Most Valuable Insight
“I think the price point for this skort is great! The material is comparable to lululemon. And for the price, I would buy these in multiple colors.” —

Looking for a skort to tackle sweaty outdoor adventures? Look no further than
Spanx’s Booty Boost Skort.
During testing in warm weather, we were impressed by its super
sweat-wicking and breathable fabric,
which kept us cool, dry, and comfortable throughout. Not only does this skort excel in moisture management, but it also boasts a UPF 50+ rating, ensuring
reliable

for prolonged outdoor exposure.
From the moment we slipped it on, the

side pocket
proved to be a convenient feature for stashing tennis balls and other small essentials.
Potential Flaws

is our new trusty trail companion. It's crafted with a
water-resistant rip-stop
nylon skirt, as well as
UPF 50+ sun protection
so we're always prepared for rugged conditions.
During testing, we found the interior waistband buttons to be a game-changer, allowing for a
snug, personalized fit.
Plus,
five handy pockets,
including a cargo-style zippered one, let us haul small gear. Say goodbye to juggling your wallet, phone, and keys—this skort lets you hike hands-free. And with the
longer shorts inseam,
you can kiss chafing goodbye, even on those sweaty marathon treks.
Potential Flaws
With only two-way stretch fabric, it doesn’t have the give that many performance skorts offer, making it less functional for high impact workouts.

We found it to be perfect for various activities, wearing it while camping, rafting, walking, and hiking, thanks to its

What to Look for When Shopping for Athletic Skorts
Materials:
Most athletic skorts are made from performance fabrics like polyester, spandex, nylon, and more (or a blend of a few). When shopping, look for materials that are lightweight, stretchy, and moisture-wicking.
Style:
There are a few things to keep in mind when it comes to skort style, all of which are up to your personal preference. First, look at the shape and cut—do you prefer contoured, compressive, flowy, mini? Then, consider any additional features like pockets or reflective detailing. Finally, make sure the skort comes in the right colors for your style.
Care:
As with all activewear, it’s important to pay attention to the manufacturer's care instructions to get the most wear out of your skort. While most activewear is machine washable, you should still pay attention to water temperature, cycle levels, and drying instructions. You may also want to consider options for activewear-specific detergents.
Price:
Athletic skorts typically range from $20 to almost $100 depending on quality and brand name. When making a purchase, consider your preferred style, activity level, and budget. It’s possible to find high-quality options at any price point, but for the most wear value you might consider investing.
Verywell Fit / Kristen Geil
How We Tested the Athletic Skorts
To find the best athletic skorts, we tested 17 options from top, trusted activewear brands. When testing, we evaluated each option for the following seven critical criteria:
Fit:
If your skort doesn’t fit right you’ll be uncomfortable and distracted during your workouts and other wear, so we make sure each one fits well. When we first try the skorts on, we consider whether they fit true to size and if the described length and rise are accurate. Then, we wear and work out in the skort, paying close attention to any digging, pinching, or irritating seams. We also note if the shorts under the skirt fit comfortably.
Opacity:
It’s important that your skort is completely opaque to ensure comfort and confidence (and avoid unwanted sheering over time and underwear lines). During wear-testing, we pay attention to whether you can see through the skorts at all—whether underwear or skin. Over time, we also consider if the material thinned out with each wear and wash. We only recommend skorts that are completely opaque and remain that way throughout testing.
Performance:
Next, we make sure each skort is comfortable, secure, moisture-wicking, and suitable for all types of activities (from lounging to high-intensity exercise). As we move around, we ask: Does the skort stay in place or require adjustments? Is there any sagging, bunching, or rolling? Are we able to exercise without feeling discomfort or distraction? Is the fabric lightweight and does it handle sweat?
Overall Value:
Once wear-testing is complete, we check each skort’s price to assess whether it’s worth the purchase. Considering each of the above-tested categories, we determine if the skort is worth its listed price. We only recommend products that we’d purchase ourselves or recommend to a friend.

We consulted experts at each phase of our research, testing, and reporting for this story. They helped us determine which key features to look for in athletic skorts and provided brand recommendations to check out. While we choose products independently, these insights help inform our decisions.

Frequently Asked Questions
Can you work out in skorts?
Yes, most athletic skorts are made with performance materials and features that are suitable for working out. Some skorts are even designed for specific activities, like running, tennis, hiking, and more.
How long should a skort be?
The length of the skort you purchase will vary based on your activity and personal preferences. Shorter skorts (12 to 14 inches) are ideal for high-intensity activities, like running and court sports, since they won’t affect your range of motion. For slower sports like golf and hiking, you may prefer longer lengths (16 to 18 inches) or even an
exercise dress
for more coverage.
Do athletic skorts contain BPA?
Bisphenol A (BPA) is a chemical found in some types of plastic. Research has shown that exposure to high levels of BPA can lead to obesity, endocrine disorders such as infertility, and cancers of the breast and prostate, among other health complications.
In May 2023, the Center for Environmental Health (CEH) announced that, after testing, it found high levels of BPA in certain activewear pieces containing blends of polyester and spandex, including sports bras from Sweaty Betty; leggings from Nike, Athleta, Champion, Patagonia, and Kohl’s; shorts from Champion, Nike, and Adidas; and athletic shirts from Fabletics.
We may recommend some of these products or similar items from these brands in this list, as these products have not been recalled, and the science on transdermal absorption of BPA is still not settled.
According to Joshua Zeichner, MD, associate professor of dermatology and director of cosmetic and clinical research in dermatology at Mount Sinai Hospital, the best way to prevent BPA exposure is to make educated decisions in choosing your personal care products. As a precaution, it is best to limit the amount of time you spend in activewear by changing out of it when you are finished working out.

The best squat-proof leggings are completely opaque and breathable, keeping you covered and comfortable all day. When shopping, look for

key features
to look for when shopping for a high-quality pair. Then, we
tested 100+ pairs
in
The Verywell Testing Lab
and at home, wearing them while
performing squats

Who They're For
Best for those who want a comfy, high-rise squat-proof legging for light to moderate exercise and daily wear.
Why We Love Them
lululemon's
Align High Rise Pants with Pockets
quickly nabbed our top spot thanks to their super soft, breathable feel and multiple convenient pockets. During testing, we appreciated how smooth, lightweight, and stretchy they felt, which allowed us to get them on and off easily. As we worked out, nothing moved, including the waistband, crotch, and ankles. They
stayed in place
during our
bending and stretching
, and we felt
fully supported
, even during more intense
cardio workouts
.
We tested one of the bright color options, and there was
no sheering
when we performed squats and moved around, so you can feel secure knowing nothing will show through. We appreciate that the color holds up beautifully and the pockets don't stretch out, even after multiple washes. We especially love the deep side pockets and the hidden waistband pocket, which gives us more storage than we
need. We also like that they come in
four lengths and a wide range of colors
.
Potential Flaws
While these leggings are not see-through, they're not thick enough to fully hide underwear lines.
These leggings tend to run small, so consider sizing up.
Most Valuable Insight
"These leggings fit me perfectly. They're compressive but still comfortable, and I love the support they give me while working out." —

Who They're For
Best for wearers who want a budget-friendly boot-cut style legging for low-intensity activities and lounging.
Why We Love Them
Copyleaf's Flare Yoga Pants
impressed us with their fit, many color options, and budget-friendly price. We like how well they stretch to
conform to our body
without feeling too compressive. We also love their V-shaped waist detailing and flared ankle, which looks very flattering. And they're
thick
enough not to see through them at all while performing squats,
squat variations
, lunges, and more.
We found them perfect for low-key activities, like wearing them around the house and for
walks outside
. We also love the drop-in
pockets on both sides
, which are a good size for comfortably holding our phone. They're made with four-way stretch material, so they easily move when we move. Their compression is just enough to feel supportive, especially around the waistband, and we love how
comfortable
they are to wear, whether we're working out or relaxing.
Potential Flaws
While these leggings are made of thicker material and are completely opaque, they may show underwear lines.
During test wears, we noticed that the crotch would sometimes bunch and occasionally need to be readjusted.
Most Valuable Insight
"My favorite things about these leggings are the super deep pockets and the waistband, which is flattering and supportive." —

Who They're For
Best for wearers with sensitive skin who want a seamless, breathable legging to minimize irritation.
Why We Love Them
Gymshark's Vital Seamless 2.0 Leggings
wowed us with their comfortable,
smooth, seam-free fit,
making for a
flattering and sleek silhouette
. We can move easily without feeling constricted when we wear these during our nightly workout routines, where we primarily focus on various
leg exercises
. Their material strikes a great balance between stretch and compression, and we loved how
comfortable
they felt when we ran errands, like getting our nails and hair done.
We also found that most of the compression in these leggings is around the ribbed waistband, so there's no shifting or slipping during movements. Plus, they feel
supportive and breathable
, thanks to mesh detailing throughout the waistband and leg. Because they’re seamless, they don’t dig into or irritate our skin, which we appreciate.
Potential Flaws
While these leggings are completely secure around the waistband, they did roll up at the ankles during
high-intensity workouts
.
Most Valuable Insight
"These leggings are very opaque and pass the squat test without me seeing any skin or my undergarments. They also don't feel like they're ever at risk of ripping or thinning with any movement. I feel very comfortable wearing these at the gym without feeling exposed or like I have to limit my movements." —

Who They're For
Best for those who prefer leggings with mid-level compression for moderate to intense exercise.
Why We Love Them
If you like the feel of solid compression during your workouts, you'll love
lululemon's Wunder Train High Rise Tights
. During testing, we were impressed with their compression level. They
felt nice and snug
, keeping us supported without squeezing us. We wore these leggings for strength training, including squats and deadlifts, as well as Pilates and
barre workouts
, and they
stayed completely opaque
regardless of the moves we performed.
Their
fast-drying fabric
wicked sweat away extremely well, so we never felt overheated. We especially like that they come in
four inseam lengths
, allowing them to work well for many individuals, including tall and petite wearers. We love that their hidden internal drawstring helps keep them firmly in place as we work out. Plus, being able to toss them in the dryer after washing makes them a cinch to take care of.
Potential Flaws
These only have a small hidden waistband pocket, which may not be ideal for some.
Most Valuable Insight
"For a
strength training
legging, you expect full opacity, and that's what you get with these. They didn't sheer out during squats or deadlifts. They also wicked sweat away really well, so I didn't get overheated or feel sweaty and clammy during any of my workouts." —

Who They're For
Best for wearers who want a buttery soft, high-rise squat-proof legging with mild compression for light to moderate activities.
Why We Love Them
lululemon's Align High Rise Pant
provides great coverage, support, and comfort, plus has enough compression for light to moderate activities, including yoga. We wore these while strength training and on several 20-minute runs and we loved how well they held us in and supported us. We appreciate that their fabric is
super stretchy and breathable
but still holds its shape nicely. And the wide waistband stays put
and doesn't dig in, even when we performed deeper squats.
We love that these leggings are made of
lightweight, sweat-wicking material
that keeps us
dry and comfortable, no matter how intense our workouts are. We appreciate that their lighter color options are a bit thicker and lined for added opacity. They have a
hidden waistband pocket
for small items, and we like that they're available in four lengths and many color options, all of which are truly squat-proof.
Potential Flaws
The only pocket on these leggings is a hidden waistband pocket, which may not provide enough storage for some.
Most Valuable Insight
"Their fabric is buttery soft, and these are definitely the coziest pair of leggings I own. They're stretchy, yet compressive enough for me to comfortably perform squats or go on a run." —

Who They're For
Best for wearers who want a flattering, curve-hugging squat-proof legging for moderate to intense exercise routines.
Why We Love Them
We love that
lululemon's Wunder Train Contour Fit High Rise Leggings
have a narrow waistband and a roomier cut through the hip and thigh that hugs your body for a comfortable, flattering fit. Their
mid-level compression
provides the support you need for cardio, HIIT, and strength training workouts—and they're opaque enough to be completely squat-proof.
When we wore these leggings, it was hot—over 90 degrees—but their
breathable, sweat-wicking material
kept us comfortable and dry. We love that they're stretchy enough to complete various workouts, but stay put, never sliding down or riding up. We also like that they come in
three inseam lengths
, and their hidden drawstring in the waistband keeps them cinched in. Overall, we found these leggings to be versatile and flattering.
Potential Flaws
While these leggings have a small waistband pocket, we wish they had additional pockets so we could carry more.
They aren't offered in as many sizes as some other options on our list.
Most Valuable Insight
"They fit really nicely in terms of width and around my legs. I especially like their contouring feeling. They never feel tight, and they don't move at all during my workouts." —

Who They're For
Best for wearers who prefer a more relaxed, flared squat-proof legging that can be worn for light to moderate exercise.
Why We Love Them
We recommend
lululemon's Groove Super High Rise Flared Pants
for anyone looking for extremely soft comfort with a flattering style. They fit and feel like a dream, thanks to their
buttery soft fabric
, which is so lightweight
it's almost weightless. We like wearing these during long walks and
yoga classes
and love the flattering look of their flared leg.
These
sweat-wicking, breathable
leggings stayed perfectly in place throughout the day without needing any readjustment. Their high, wide waistband offers great support and doesn't roll or slip down. Plus, it also has a hidden pocket in the back to stash small items. We love how
durable
these leggings are. We've washed them frequently, and they've shown no sign of pilling, discoloration, or becoming misshapen.
Potential Flaws
These leggings only come in one inseam length, so they may not be suitable for petite or very tall individuals.
They don't have side pockets for larger items like a phone.
Most Valuable Insight
"These feel like a literal dream. Their fabric is soft, silky, and smooth and never makes me feel itchy or trapped. They're high-waisted and come up to a comfortable spot just above my belly button, which makes my lower tummy feel supported, and they don't roll down when I'm moving a lot. I never have to readjust these. They always stay perfectly situated on my body." —

Who They're For
Best for wearers who want a more budget-friendly flared squat-proof legging for light to moderate activities, lounging, or casual wear.
Why We Love Them
Athleta's Elation Flare Pants
are a comparable alternative to lululemon's Groove Flare Pants at a more
budget-friendly
price point. They come in
three inseam lengths
, and we felt comfy wearing them for low-impact workouts like yoga, Pilates,
light cardio
, and strength training. We like that their super high waistband is breathable, mesh-lined, and features a back drop-in pocket large enough for a phone.
We love that their
soft, supportive fabric
is sweat-wicking, quick-drying, and
rated UPF 50+
, keeping us dry, comfortable, and protected when running errands or exercising outdoors. We also like how well they hold up to laundering. We noted no noticeable wear and tear during testing, like pilling, even after multiple wears and washes.
Potential Flaws
While these leggings have one pocket that can hold a phone, we wouldn't mind a couple more for other small belongings.
Most Valuable Insight
"These leggings are super comfortable. The thick material feels supportive, looks flattering, and gives the coverage I want in a good pair of leggings. I didn't experience any thinning of the material after multiple wears and washes." —

Who They're For
Best for wearers who want leggings with an above-the-ankle cut and a moderately compressive fit.
Why We Love Them
Beyond Yoga's Spacedye Out of Pocket High Waisted Leggings
have the broadest range of available sizes of any leggings on our list, which is why we love them. They're available in many color options, and their length is perfect, hitting just between our calves and ankles. We also like their fabric's
four-way stretch and UV protection
.
When we tested these leggings, we wore patterned underwear and found that nothing showed through, regardless of our activity. They fit true to size and were compressive enough to provide
plenty of support
during our workouts. Their thick waistband provides added support, and we appreciate the
two hip pockets
that make
toting our phone
and other small items easy.
Potential Flaws
While we liked the fit, we wish there were a drawstring in the waistband to keep them perfectly in place.

Who They're For
Best for wearers who want very lightweight, quick-drying squat-proof leggings for low-impact activities.
Why We Love Them
For a super lightweight pair of leggings that easily move with you, we recommend
Athleta's Transcend Stash High Rise Leggings
. We love their
silky soft fabric
and found them so comfortable that we almost forgot we were wearing them. Even though the fabric feels barely there, it still provides
full, opaque coverage
, making these leggings lightweight but squat-proof. Thanks to their stretchiness, they moved amazingly well, and we comfortably wore them for yoga, meditation, running errands, and more.
We appreciate their
deep, secure side pockets
and that they come in three inseam lengths, working well for petite and tall wearers. Their fabric is sweat-wicking and quick-drying, keeping us dry and comfortable, even during more intense exercise and in warmer weather. They're also
rated UPF 50+
, a nice touch for anyone who prefers to exercise outdoors. And, despite how lightweight the fabric feels, underwear lines completely disappear.
Potential Flaws
During testing, we noted some fraying on the leg and ankle seams. Because of this, it may be best to skip the dryer and air dry them instead.
Most Valuable Insight
"The material is extremely stretchy, with light compression. I was surprised by how much these leggings moved with me—I never ever had to stop and adjust them." —

Who They're For
Best for wearers who want a lightly compressive, stretchy, and breathable squat-proof legging for yoga.
Why We Love Them
For a comfortable yoga flow, you need leggings that move with you.
Carbon38's High Rise Melt Leggings
are made of
buttery soft fabric
that fits like a second skin. Made for yoga and other
low-impact activities
, we felt comfortable and confident wearing them all day. They move freely with our body without pinching or binding, regardless of our yoga pose.
We especially love that they have a
smoothing effect
without being super compressive. They're also
breathable and moisture-wicking
enough to handle 60-minute heated yoga classes easily. And they're a breeze to put on, thanks to their soft, stretchy fabric.
Potential Flaws
These leggings are completely opaque, but underwear lines may still be visible.
These don't have any pockets, which may not be ideal for some.

Who They're For
Best for wearers who want a sleek, highly compressive legging for moderate to high-intensity exercise.
Why We Love Them
Alo Yoga's High-Waist Airlift Leggings
nabbed the spot for our most flattering pick, thanks to their
subtle sheen and sleek style
. We love that they're completely opaque and hide underwear lines incredibly well. They also feature
high
compression levels
for a snug but flattering fit and a double-layered high waistband that smooths and supports, making them ideal for
high-intensity workouts
.
Even though they're compressive, we think they're
comfortable
enough for everyday wear. They stayed perfectly in place while we wore them, and we never had to readjust or pull them up. Their soft fabric is
durable
and easily withstood plenty of wearing and washing, a feature we look for in a truly high-quality pair of leggings.
Potential Flaws
These leggings only come in one inseam length, so they may not be suitable for
petite wearers
.
They're one of the pricier options on our list, but we think their quality exceeds their cost.

Who They're For
Best for exercisers who want a legging with plenty of comfortable support for running and other
high-intensity workouts
.
Why We Love Them
If you like to do lots of high-intensity exercise, you need leggings that can keep up.
Sweaty Betty's Power Leggings
do just that. During testing, they felt
comfortable enough to wear for hours
, and we often wore them all day. We like that they make us feel held in and
supported but not constrained, with plenty of compression and stretch for intense activity.
We wore these during workouts, around the house, on
long walks
, and even kayaking. They felt great during all our activities with
no sheering or show-through
at all. We loved that the seams felt very smooth and didn't cause any irritation or marks on our skin. There was also no waistband gaping in the back, which we've experienced with other leggings. We also appreciate the
secure back zip pocket
and the hidden drawstring in the waistband, which keeps everything in place.
Potential Flaws
While we appreciate the back zip pocket in the waistband, the triangular-shaped side pocket isn't very deep and doesn't feel secure enough to hold our phone.
Most Valuable Insight
"I like the feel of their fabric and could wear these for hours. Plus, there wasn't any sheering or even that pre-sheering shininess that sometimes happens when the elastic material is stretched too much—these leggings are completely opaque." —

Who They're For
Best for wearers who want a super comfy, opaque legging for lounging and working out.
Why We Love Them
Vuori's Daily Leggings
are the pair you'll want to live in, whether relaxing or working out. While these are perfect for running errands, walking the dog, or lounging around, we also found that they work just as well in the gym. They’re completely
opaque and squat-proof
—with no signs of sheering or underwear lines at all. We also love the cuffed ankle look, which is super flattering and doesn't roll or bunch up.
One of our favorite features, the drawstring waistband, allows you to completely customize the fit. During test wears, we found that this helped prevent the waistband from slipping or rolling down as we ran or rode our
exercise bike
. Plus, the
moisture-wicking
, silky-soft fabric offers a barely-there feel. We found them so soft and dreamy that wearing them was almost like wearing nothing at all.
Potential Flaws
The inseam on these leggings may be too short for taller wearers.
Most Valuable Insight
"I love these! They're absolutely the unicorn of leggings! The fit is great, and they're so soft and dreamy. The waist hits above the belly button and doesn't roll down. I would wear them all day, every day, in every color." —

Squat-Proof Leggings We Also Tested
We tested over 100 pairs of squat-proof leggings, but only 14 impressed us enough to make our final list of recommendations. Although we liked some of these leggings' features, they ultimately didn't meet our rigorous standards.
Gymshark's GS Power Original Leggings
are high-rise, supportive, and feature ruching detailing on the backside, which we thought was flattering. But while we found them to be squat-proof and opaque, these leggings didn't stay put during workouts, making them uncomfortable.
What We've Updated
Since publishing our initial tested roundup of the best squat-proof leggings, we've
re-evaluated our previous picks
and
hands-on tested the newest iterations
of leggings from trusted brands. Through our testing, we've evaluated each pair for fit, opacity, performance, quality, and value and included these new insights in our article.
Based on our testing insights, we've
reworked most of our superlatives and product picks
, including Best Overall, Best Budget, Best Compression, and more.
We
consulted an additional expert
, a dermatologist, to better understand fabric safety and ensure that all of the information in our roundup is up to date.
What to Look for When Shopping for Squat-Proof Leggings
Material:
Material or fabric blends can greatly impact opacity. Common fabric blends in opaque leggings may include elastane, Lycra, nylon, and spandex. In general, when shopping for squat-proof leggings, look for a thick, compressive fabric that still feels soft and breathable, says certified personal trainer
Claudette Sariya, NASM-CPT
.
Fit:
Leggings come in various fits, and choosing the right one for you is up to personal preference and what types of activities you’ll be doing. Rise, length, and compression are important factors when choosing a pair of leggings. For high-impact workouts, you may want a high-rise waistband and a more compressive fit, whereas for lounging, a mid- or low-rise with a less compressive fit may be more comfortable. As for length, capri leggings may be a great choice for warmer months and petite wearers, while 7/8-length or full-length may be best for
cold weather workouts
and taller wearers, says Sariya.
Durability:
Squat-proof leggings should be flexible enough to move with you yet durable enough to withstand any type of workout. Material blends that include stretch fabrics, like nylon or Lycra, are a great option because they will move with your body while still holding up to the wear and tear that comes with exercise and daily wear.
Design:
Legging brands
may include design elements to make leggings more functional or comfortable for the wearer. Pockets are a great example of this, says Sariya. Leggings with pockets allow you to take your keys, phone, or a
post-workout snack
on the go, adding convenience to your workout. Other features may include breathable mesh detailing, a non-slip waistband, key ring clips, and a comfy, seamless design for those with more sensitive skin.
Five key features to look for in leggings.
Verywell Fit / Michelle Parente
How We Tested the Squat-Proof Leggings
To find the best squat-proof leggings, we tested over 100 options in our Lab and at home, wearing them while we performed squats, ran, practiced yoga, and more. When testing squat-proof leggings, we evaluate each pair based on the following key criteria.
Fit:
The first time we try on each pair of leggings, we note whether they fit true to size or feel too tight or loose. We ask things like: Does the waistband fit as described? Is it too tight or gaping? Do the leggings go on smoothly, or are they difficult to get into? Is there any bunching or pinching anywhere? We prioritize leggings that fit comfortably without the need for readjusting.
Opacity:
To gauge opacity, we stand in front of a mirror while squatting and bending down to ensure the fabric isn't sheering or thinning. We also note if opacity changes in different settings, like outside or in a workout studio. After wearing and washing each pair of leggings several times, we note whether the fabric is thinning or the opacity has changed. We prioritize leggings that remain completely opaque regardless of setting, lighting, and how many times we launder them.
Performance:
To test performance, we note whether the leggings feel suitably compressive for the activity they're designed for, whether we feel supported the whole time we're wearing them, and whether the support fades over time. We also evaluate how well the leggings wick moisture and control our temperature.
Quality:
To evaluate the quality of each pair of leggings, we first note how the fabric feels against our skin. Is it itchy and irritating, or soft and smooth? We also note how well the material holds up over time. Do we see any signs of wear and tear? Does washing alter the shape or opacity? Are the seams fraying, and do the leggings hold on to odor? We only choose leggings that feature high-quality materials and construction and are made to last.
Value:
To determine the value of each pair of squat-proof leggings, we wait to look at the price until we evaluate all other key criteria. Then, we determine if the leggings are worth their price. We only include leggings we would buy or recommend to a friend or family member.
Our Experts
We consulted experts at each stage of our research, testing, and reporting process. The following experts helped us better understand what key features to look for when shopping for a high-quality pair of squat-proof leggings. Although we choose products independently, expert input influences our choices.

Frequently Asked Questions
How do you know if leggings are squat-proof?
The best way to test if your leggings are squat-proof is to gently stretch the fabric with your hands or try them on and squat down to see if they become transparent or sheer. It's also a good idea to look at them in different settings, including indoors and outdoors, to see if the fabric remains opaque.
When should you wear squat-proof leggings?
Bennett says that in addition to squatting, squat-proof leggings are good for any exercises where the hips are in motion, like deadlifts, lunges, and
using the Stairmaster
. They may also provide good coverage and keep you comfortable during your daily routine and outdoor workouts.
What materials make leggings squat-proof?
Material blends with nylon, spandex, and Lycra are best for opacity, moisture-wicking, and stretch. Thicker cotton blends may also work well, although they won't be as moisture-wicking as performance fabrics.
Do squat-proof leggings cost more than other leggings?
Squat-proof leggings don't necessarily cost more than other leggings. Like all leggings, their price can be impacted by fabric blends, features, and more.
Do squat-proof leggings contain BPA?
Bisphenol A (BPA) is a chemical found in some types of plastic. In May 2023, the Center for Environmental Health (CEH) announced that, after testing, it found high levels of BPA in certain activewear pieces containing blends of polyester and spandex.
Zeichner says it's best to limit how much time you spend in activewear and to change post-workout. Keep in mind that the science of BPA's transdermal absorption is still not settled, and none of the products on this list have been recalled or deemed unsafe for use.

How to Find the Right One
Evaluating Fit
Care and Maintenance
Whether you’re an avid exerciser or a newbie to sweat sessions, you probably know to make sure you’re dressed in the right gear for a workout. For many people, this includes a top-notch sports bra—a bra that’s specifically designed for physical activity, as it supports breast tissue and helps prevent discomfort and irritation.
When you are doing repetitive movements or moving at a fast pace, your breasts can move around a great deal. But a sports bra can help reduce this movement, cut down on friction, limit irritation, and ultimately, support you against gravity.
Understanding the Importance of a Sports Bra
A sports bra isn’t just for comfort—it is also to protect the safety and integrity of your breast tissue during exercise. When you leave the breasts unsupported during physical activity, it can lead to sagging, warns
Amie Dworecki
, BS, MA, MBA, a running coach.
“Although breasts have no muscle, the skin and ligaments that give them their size and shape can break down, which can happen no matter what size breasts you have,” she says. “Also, wearing the wrong bra during activity can cause you to become distracted with adjustments, making a workout less enjoyable and potentially decreasing the quality of your training and even increasing your chance of injury when your focus is lost.”
Unlike a regular bra, a sports bra has unique design features that provide increased support, stability, and reduced breast movement during exercise. Some sports bras even have cups that include specific structures to minimize movement and ensure that the breast tissue remains inside the bra at all times. This can be especially beneficial for those with larger breasts.
“The enhanced compression and fit of the materials add support compared to just an everyday bra, and the wider, adjustable, or connected styles of the straps allow for less movement with the support that can help reduce or eliminate pain,” says Dworecki.
Determining Your Size and Support Level
Shopping for a sports bra size is similar to shopping for the bra you wear on a daily basis. However, there are a few things to consider that will ensure the bra keeps up with your chosen exercise routine. Here is what you need to know.
Don’t Size Up or Down
Because a sports bra is meant to fit snugly, it’s a good idea to buy the size that fits you well and, potentially even a size smaller than you’d purchase for a bra you’d wear daily. Dworecki also suggests regularly recalculating your bra size, as it’s common, especially for women, to
change sizes due to aging
, pregnancy, hormonal shifts, or weight gain.
Measure Correctly
To measure for your correct sizing, Dworecki recommends using a soft tape measure, and measuring without a bra on or wearing a non-padded bra that doesn’t change the shape of your breasts.
“First, measure just under your breasts around your rib cage and round the number down to the nearest inch,” she says. “Next measure around your chest, just under your arms and above your bust, while exhaling and relaxing your shoulders.” This can help you decide whether you need a
sports bra for smaller breasts
over a regular sports bra.
For your cup size, she recommends measuring from the fullest point of your breasts, also known as your “bust.” If your breasts are different sizes, she suggests sizing up or opting for an adjustable sports bra that can provide an even more exact fit.
Consider Type of Support Needed
Not all sports bras are created equal, especially when it comes to support. That’s why Dworecki recommends figuring out which type of support you’ll need based on your breast size as well as your chosen physical activity.
Sports bras tend to come in low, medium, and high-impact varieties. Low impact is best for gentle workouts like yoga,
pilates
, barre, walking, or stretching while high impact is better for more vigorous workouts like running, kickboxing, dance, or HIIT. Medium impact sports bras can work for high-impact exercises if you have small breasts, but may be better for medium-impact workouts like weight training or hiking regardless of your breast size.
To match sports bras with specific activities, Giulini Wever, certified trainer and fitness director at
28
, suggests considering the level of impact and breast movement involved. "Opt for a low-impact sports bra for low-intensity activities, a medium-impact sports bra for moderate-intensity exercises, and a high-impact sports bra for high-intensity and high-impact activities. Choosing the right sports bra for the activity ensures proper support, reduces breast discomfort, and minimizes the risk of long-term damage."
Key Features to Look for in a Sports Bra
You also need to consider which features are important to you when shopping for a sports bra. Here are a few important things to look for when making your decision.
Adjustable Straps
If you’re in between sizes, have breasts that are different sizes, or simply want the most customized fit possible, it can be helpful to purchase a sports bra that has adjustable straps. When shopping for a sports bra with adjustable straps, Dworecki recommends making sure that the straps hold your adjustments securely. Otherwise, the straps may slip down when you don’t want them to, like during a run or a fitness class.
Underwire
While not all sports bras have an underwire, this feature can be quite helpful. An underwire helps support each breast separately, which helps cut down on unnecessary movement.
Dworecki recommends making sure that any underwire sports bra you purchase feels comfortable. “It should lay flat against your ribcage and stay below your breasts without poking or pinching you.”
Padding
While it sounds like padding would be a feature added for comfort, it’s often for aesthetic reasons to reduce the appearance of nipple protrusion and to make the breasts look fuller. If you’re looking for either of these benefits, you should consider a sports bra that offers padding.
Encapsulation vs. Compression Styles
Some sports bras feature a compression style, which holds both breasts together firmly against your body while others, known as encapsulation styles, have a cup for each breast, often with an underwire in place.
Compression styles tend to work better for A, B, and C cups, according to Dworecki while encapsulation sports bras are better for
larger breasts
as well as anyone performing high-impact exercises. These bras are better at reducing bounce and strain and can reduce sagging in the long term.
“Encapsulation-compression sports bras represent a combo of the two,” she says. “They fix your breasts in place with individual cups, press them against your body, and tend to use underwires and can work well for all bust sizes, especially DD+.”
Moisture-Wicking Fabric
Moisture-wicking technology is a plus for any type of exercise gear you invest in, but especially when it comes to sports bras since this area of your body tends to get the most sweaty during a workout. Meanwhile, fabrics like cotton tend to retain moisture.
Dworecki recommends opting for sports bras that contain moisture-wicking fabrics like polyester, which doesn’t soak up water as other materials can. “Nylon is another moisture-wicking and water-repellent fabric that can absorb more water than polyester. However, it is more durable than polyester, so it can last longer."
Back Enclosures
While some sports bras are designed to be put on directly over your head, others have back enclosures that are similar to regular-use bras. Many people find that those with back enclosures are easier to put on, since sports bras tend to be snug.
Back enclosures also come in handy post-workout when you’re dripping with sweat and can further customize your fit, says Dworecki. “It also can be helpful to get a sports bra that fits with the loosest hook so that as the bra stretches out over time, you can tighten it up to last longer.”
The three types of sports bras.
Verywell Fit / Sarah Felbin
How to Find the Right Sports Bra
If you’re a
runner
, you’ll want a sports bra designed for the sport, meaning one that’s high-impact so that it’s supportive and limits motion to keep you secure and comfortable, says Dworecki. “Running sports bras are also made of technical, wicking material to keep you cool and allow your skin to breathe."
Look for high-impact sports bras and choose wider straps, especially if you have a larger bust. Clasps can also be helpful as long as they are secure in a running motion and will not come undone.
For lower-impact exercises like yoga or pilates, you can opt for lower-impact sports bras that offer less support, since you’ll likely be doing less intense movements. Comfort is key with bras for low-impact, so you should be able to move freely. Moisture-wicking fabrics will still come in handy since you will likely still sweat.
For weightlifting, Wever recommends choosing a medium to
high-impact sports bra
that provides stability and support. Other features she recommends include encapsulation or compression style, adjustable straps, a wide elastic band as well as moisture-wicking and quick-drying fabrics to manage sweat during intense weightlifting sessions.
As far as the style goes, racerback can also be nice for high to low-intensity workouts, since they provide greater mobility, notes Dworecki. “Because the straps are not adjustable, ensuring your fit is right from the start is crucial. Racerback styles also benefit those who get annoyed when a strap can fall to the side while working out, especially as the sports bra stretches and ages.”
Zip-front sports bras
can also take the struggle of pulling a bra over your head out of the equation while offering comfortable support.
Evaluating Fit
Just like with any other type of clothing, it’s a good idea to try on various sizes and styles until you find the one that feels best on your body and for your chosen physical activity.
“The sports bra should be snug but not tight and should not restrict your breathing—two fingers between the straps and your shoulders can indicate a good fit—and the cup should be smooth, without wrinkles, which could mean the cup is too big,” says Dworecki. “If there is an underwire, it should lay flat against your rib cage without pinching or gapping.”
While a snug fit is optimal, it also shouldn’t be too restricting or, worse, dig into your skin. You may want to move and perform typical exercise motions while trying on sports bras to assess its support and comfort.
Care and Maintenance
Because sports bras are often washed more frequently than other undergarments you wear, try to ensure that you’re not compromising quality or longevity when caring for your product. Dworecki offers these tips for how to prolong the life of your sports bras.
Wash After Every Workout
: Washing your sports bras after every workout, especially the super sweaty ones, can cut down on unpleasant odors and help prevent bacteria, fungi, and yeast build-up. Wearing a bra more than once can cause the material to retain odor even after it has been washed.
Wash By Hand
: While you certainly can throw your sports bras in the washing machine, washing them by hand helps enhance their longevity. Dworecki recommends avoiding the use of regular detergent and instead opting for a gentle hand or laundry soap or shampoo. “Pre-soak the sports bra in soapy water for 20-30 minutes, then lightly scrub the fabric with your hands,” she says. “Drain the dirty water and rinse with cold water until you’ve rinsed out all the soap.”
Use a Lingerie Bag
: If you do wash your sports bras in the machine, she recommends using a lingerie bag so that they don’t get twisted up with your other laundry. Also, she suggests washing them on a delicate-cycle setting and using cold water.
Air Dry
: If you have the time, it’s best to air dry your sports bras. This helps reduce shrinkage since hot air can cause the elastic to degrade faster. Dworecki recommends against hang drying since it can stretch out the straps.
Replace When It Loses Its Integrity
: Typically, it’s time to replace a sports bra if you notice back or breast pain, chafing, the band moving up, or the straps moving around too much or digging in, says Dworecki. “If it has lost its supportiveness or feels stretched out, it’s time to start shopping for a new one."
Bottom Line
Choosing the right sports bra for any activity ensures optimal support, comfort, and breast health. While shopping for a sports bra is not always easy, with a little bit of patience and know-how you can find the right fit, style, and features for you.

Verywell Fit / Marcus Millan
Comfortable, reliable leggings
can be a functional staple and a fashion statement all in one. The right pair of leggings will keep you comfortable and focused on your workout, whether you’re headed to yoga class or out for a run. To find the best legging brands,
we researched and tested
dozens of pairs
from top brands like
lululemon
,
Gymshark
,
Athleta
, and more to see how they hold up to exercise and regular, everyday wear. Whether we’re testing leggings in
The Verywell Testing Lab
or at home, we pay close attention to
opacity, fit, value, durability, hold,
and
style
.
In addition to testing and thorough research to compile the top legging brands, we asked a certified personal trainer and a yoga teacher for expert opinions on where to shop for high-quality leggings. We then had a certified personal trainer from our
Review Board
review this story for accuracy and how to find the best leggings at the best prices.

lululemon

Pros
Free standard shipping and returns
Lightweight, durable leggings
Emphasizes sustainability and community
Cons
Limited plus-size options
lululemon is known for making ultra-comfortable, elevated leggings that are just as stylish as they are functional. Building on the popularity of their viral Align Pant, they now offer five lines of leggings, each designed for different workouts.
We’ve tested lululemon leggings
from the Align, Wunder Train, Fast and Free, Swift Speed, and Base Pace collections and found that they all live up to the hype.
If you’re looking for compressive leggings with support for weightlifting or core work, the
Wunder Train High-Rise Tight
is our pick. We’ve found that they pass the squat test, meaning they stay completely opaque while we move through squats and other exercises.
The
Align High-Rise Pant
, another fan (and Verywell Fit) favorite, isn’t as compressive but performs just as well during our tests. And if you’re looking for lightweight leggings that are extra sweat-wicking, we recommend the
Fast and Free High-Rise Crop
, which has seven pockets and a drawstring that runners will appreciate. However, most of the brand’s leggings are only available up to a size 14, with select styles ranging up to a size 20.
The price of lululemon leggings ranges from around $79 to $138, which is similar to other high-end brands on our list. But with your investment comes longevity: Less expensive leggings may need to be replaced more often. (It’s also worth noting that many styles and colors often end up in lululemon’s
We Made Too Much
section for up to $70 off.)
In addition to selling high-quality leggings (and other activewear), we also like that lululemon is committed to
product sustainability
and
bringing people together
through fitness. So you can shop confidently, knowing you’re supporting a brand that’s dedicated to reducing its environmental impact and supporting local communities.

Pros
Free worldwide shipping and returns
Sleek, stylish leggings
Fabrics for high- and low-intensity workouts
Cons
Limited sizing
Many styles require gentle care
Alo Yoga leggings
have long been a go-to for yoga enthusiasts looking for stylish staples that hold up to lots of wear. Now, the brand has extended its offerings to include leggings for all workouts.
We like the
7/8 High-Waist Airlift Legging
, which is designed to lift and sculpt and comes in over 20 colors. When testing them, we love that we can wear them to almost any kind of workout, and the waistband still stays in place. We also like that they’re the perfect balance of compression and comfort.
Alo Yoga is also known for its Airbrush fabric, which is the most compressive, making it ideal for high-intensity workouts. Or, try Alosoft, which is less compressive and is known for its super soft feel—perfect for yoga. Because they offer free shipping and returns, you can try different styles to figure out which is best for you. (We recommend starting with the
7/8 High-Waist Airbrush Legging
and the
Alosoft Low-Rise Foldover Bootcut Legging
.)
Alo Yoga leggings come at a premium price, but we think they’re worth it for their durability, comfort, and elevated style. To maintain your leggings’ quality over time, the brand offers specific care instructions, so be sure to review the recommendations for each pair before purchasing. We only wish their best-selling styles came in a wider range of sizes.

Pros
Free shipping and returns
Founded and owned by women
Also makes maternity leggings
Cons
Limited sizing
If you love soft, buttery leggings that you can wear all day long, we highly recommend Beyond Yoga. This female-founded, woman-owned company offers thick, opaque leggings that—as the name suggests—are great on and off the mat.
We like their signature Spacedye fabric, an ultra-soft blend of polyester and elastane that’s moisture-wicking and provides UV sun protection. When we tested the
Spacedye Caught in the Midi High Waisted Legging
, we were impressed by how well they stayed in place during workouts and throughout the day.
We also love that the wide, high-rise waistband lays flat without rolling or pinching. But we’ve found that they’re best for lounging and light activity, as they don’t have the same sweat-wicking and supportive features as some of our other picks from brands like lululemon and Athleta. For a new twist on the brand’s classic Spacedye fabric, try the
Spacedye Outlines High Waisted Midi Legging
or the
Spacedye At Your Leisure High Waisted Midi Legging
.
Although we appreciate that Beyond Yoga has free shipping and returns, they only offer their full size range in a few legging styles. But we like that they make
maternity leggings
, unlike other brands on our list. Prices generally range from $97 to $110, which reflects the leggings’ top-notch design and construction.

Athleta

View on Gap.com
Pros
Emphasizes sustainability and women’s empowerment
Lightweight, quick-drying leggings
Inclusive sizing
Cons
Free shipping only for rewards members
Athleta’s expansive collection of leggings provides dozens of styles to choose from. We’ve found that their leggings are not only flattering, but also incredibly functional. They use materials that wick sweat, dry quickly, and are rated UPF 50 to keep you cool and protected. Plus, some pairs are lined for cold weather.
Their leggings come in a variety of compression levels and lengths, and many have side pockets and reflective elements. With sizes ranging from XXS to 3X, there are options for all kinds of bodies and workout routines.
One of our favorites for yoga and lounging is the
Transcend Tight
, which we noticed has the perfect balance of stretch and compression. It kept us comfortable all day long, moving with us without rolling down or sagging. The
Ultimate Stash Capri
is another top seller for high-impact workouts. In testing, we found these to be very breathable and opaque, and they even resisted pilling after multiple workouts.
Many Athleta leggings are also made from recycled materials, which is a reflection of the company’s commitment to
sustainability
. Athleta is a
Certified B Corp
, meaning it has met the B Corp’s environmental standards and shares information about its sustainability goals publicly. We also like that Athleta has created many programs that empower women and girls and support female wellbeing, like
The Power of She Fund
.
Athleta leggings usually cost between $79 to $119, which is on par with other top leggings brands. They do feature fairly regular sales—however,
free shipping
is only available for Rewards Members spending at least $50.

Outdoor Voices

Pros
Emphasizes sustainability
High-tech, durable leggings
Offers student discounts
Cons
Must spend $75 to get free shipping
Limited sizing
If you’re looking for durable leggings from an eco-friendly brand, Outdoor Voices is our top pick. One of their missions is to create leggings with longevity, to reduce the amount of clothing that ends up in landfills. They make simple, versatile styles for all your workouts.
We’ve tested one of their top leggings, the
FrostKnit Flare Pant
, while running, strength training, and doing yoga. We’re impressed by how well they wash—no sheering, pilling, or post-workout odors in sight. Soft and comfortable, with an inseam that’s perfect for taller wearers, these have quickly become one of our favorites.
We also recommend Outdoor Voices’
FreeForm 7/8 Contour Legging
for its moderate compression and super soft feel. Stretchy and supportive, they can take you from spin class to the hiking trails. Both leggings are available in sizes up to 3X, although other styles only go up to XL.
Most Outdoor Voices leggings cost between $78 and $98, which is slightly less than some other brands on our list. (Some styles are a little pricier, at around $118.) They also offer students a 20% discount—and if you’re post-grad, you can keep things in your cart until one of their regular sales pops up. Just note that free shipping is only available for orders of $75 or more.

Founded by Zara Terez Tisch, Terez is on a mission to spread positivity, joy, and creativity—and its leggings speak to that. Terez leggings come in bright, cheerful colors and patterns that will motivate you to get moving. But the brand doesn’t skimp on quality: Each pair is made with functional materials to support workouts, recovery days, and lounging at home.
With medium compression and sweat wicking capabilities, the
Hi-Shine Leggings
are ideal for high-impact activities and running errands. For even more support, we love the
DuoKnit 7/8 Leggings
. Looking for something for lounging or yoga? Try the
TLC Leggings
.
Many of their styles are available in up to 3X. They also have a matching girls line, for twinning with your little one. Terez leggings are more expensive than many brands on our list, with prices ranging from $94 to $135.
They do also charge for shipping, unless you spend $200, and there is a $6 shipping and handling fee for all returns. Even so, we think their unique patterns and designs are well worth the investment.

Vuori

Pros
Emphasizes sustainability and community
High-tech, versatile leggings
Many styles provide UPF sun protection
Cons
Must spend $75 to get free shipping
Vuori is a California-based activewear brand that makes casual styles in high-performance fabric that can be worn from the gym to almost anywhere. Their leggings are soft and comfortable enough to lounge in, while also being tough enough to hold up to daily workouts.
Their
Daily Legging
lives up to the name—with a high-rise waistband and an exterior drawstring, they’re designed for all-day wear. (Plus, there’s
a version with pockets
.) For high-impact workouts, reach for the
Studio Pocket Legging
, which has more support and can quickly wick away sweat.
Still haven’t been able to find
the best flare leggings
? We recommend the
Mid Rise Elevation Slim Bootcut
, which would fit right in at the barre studio or the office. All of Vuori’s leggings are made with four-way stretch, and many also have UPF sun protection for outdoor runs or hikes.
With prices ranging from $89 to $109, Vuori ranks among many of our other top picks in terms of cost. But you do need to spend at least $75 per order to get free shipping. If you’ve been meaning to branch out and
try some new athleisure brands
, this is a great place to start.

Pros
Emphasizes sustainability
Sculpting, compressive leggings
Inclusive sizing
Cons
Must spend $100 to get free shipping
Fee for returns
Girlfriend Collective makes high-quality, comfortable, and functional activewear that’s also eco-friendly. Their products, including leggings, are made from recycled plastic bottles, fishing nets, fabric scraps, and other waste. We also like that they recycle old Girlfriend Collective items in exchange for store credit through their
ReGirlfriend
program. Their packaging is 100% recyclable, too.
One of the reasons why we love this brand is because of their inclusive size range—every style is available in sizes XXS to 6XL. If you’re new to Girlfriend Collective, start with their best-selling
Compressive Pocket Legging
. We like that it comes in two inseams and has three pockets for stashing your phone, keys, and more.
For yoga flows or lounging on a recovery day, we recommend the brand’s
FLOAT Ultralight Legging
. With a brushed matte finish and UPF 50+ sun protection, they’re a great low-compression option. Girlfriend Collective also offers a
Seamless Maternity Legging
in their signature jewel-tone colors.
Girlfriend Collective leggings are moderately priced between $68 to $88 per pair, making them more affordable than other brands on our list. However, you’ll have to spend $100 per order to get free shipping, and there is a $7 restock fee for returns by mail.

FP Movement

Pros
Emphasizes community
Stylish, unique leggings
Free shipping when you order on the app
Cons
Fee for returns
Limited sizing
Originally known for their bohemian-style women’s clothing, Free People has ventured into the activewear space with a stylish bang. Their FP Movement label offers plenty of leggings in bright colors and unique styles, all with different levels of compression for your favorite workouts.
The
High-Rise 7/8 Length Good Karma Leggings
are our favorite for their barely-there feel that’s paired with superior sweat-wicking capabilities. If you prefer more support, the compressive
High-Rise 7/8 You’re a Peach Leggings
feature pockets and reflective details, making them ideal for running. For leggings with striking details, we love the
High-Rise Full-Length Running Through My Mind Leggings
and the
Mid-Rise Full Length Low And Flow Legging
. While we wish FP Movement’s leggings were available in more sizes, we like that their signature fabrics are all lightweight and silky smooth to the touch.
Community support is a top priority for FP Movement. The brand has
donated
over $1.5 million to its partner, Girls Inc., and is committed to
funding
arts programs in public schools with the help of Americans for the Arts. They also regularly host
fitness classes
in major cities around the country.
Free People Movement leggings cost around $70 to $128, and some items ship free. Free express shipping is also available for orders over $150 placed in the Free People app. There is a return fee for mail-in returns, but returns in-store are free.

Gymshark

Pros
Budget-friendly
High-tech, seamless leggings
Free returns
Cons
Must spend $75 to get free shipping
Limited sizing
We love Gymshark for their high-quality, functional leggings that come at a budget-friendly price point. While the name may sound like the brand is just for gym-goers, they make a variety of leggings for everything from yoga classes to outdoor hikes.
One of our favorites is Gymshark’s
Elevate Leggings
, which we’ve worn while walking, doing yoga, taking a Pilates class, and strength training. After wearing and washing them regularly, we found they held up just as well as more expensive pairs from Athleta and lululemon. We like that they’re available in a range of dusty hues and patterns to match the rest of your activewear.
Other Gymshark leggings we’ve tested
include the
Vital Seamless 2.0 Leggings
, the
Adapt Camo Seamless Leggings
, and the
Adapt Animal Seamless Leggings
. None of these pairs have any seams, cutting down on potential irritation, and they’re all made from breathable, sweat-wicking fabrics. We’re also fans of Gymshark’s wide, high-rise waistbands, which we’ve found provide the ideal level of support. While we wish their leggings were available in more sizes, we have noticed that they fit a variety of body types well.
Accessibility is a top priority for Gymshark, and that shows in their pricing model. Their leggings cost between $50 and $64 per pair—plus, the brand offers discounts for students and veterans. While returns are free, you do need to spend at least $75 per order to get free shipping.

Carbon38

View on Carbon38.com
Pros
Woman-owned
High-fashion, lightweight leggings
Free returns
Cons
Expensive
Leggings don’t have pockets
Carbon 38 is a
female-owned brand
known for its high-fashion activewear, including chic leggings. In addition to their own label, they also sell select styles from many other brands on our list, like Beyond Yoga and Terez.
We recommend starting with Carbon 38’s
High Rise Full-Length Legging in Melt
, which has a smoothing effect and a soft, buttery feel. When we tested them, we found that they were comfortable enough to wear all day, but still wicked away sweat during our workouts. We love that they fit like a glove, with light compression that’s ideal for low-impact workouts.
For medium-impact exercise, try the
Ribbed 7/8 Legging
. And when doing high-impact activities like running, reach for the
High Rise Full-Length Legging in Diamond Compression
. However, it’s worth noting that their leggings don’t have pockets.
Carbon 38 leggings are on the pricier side, most styles priced between $108 and $228. In our tests, they proved to be very durable, making them worth the investment. Plus, you’ll get free shipping when you spend $199 or more—and returns are always free.

Aerie

Pros
Budget-friendly
Classic, colorful leggings
Multiple flattering waistband styles
Cons
Must spend $75 to get free shipping
Some returns have a fee
Aerie makes stylish leggings for nearly every budget and activity, from walking and lounging to running and
HIIT classes
. One of our favorites is the
OFFLINE by Aerie Real Me High Waisted Crossover Flare Legging
for its flattering design and comfortable material.
As we tested this pair, we noticed the V-shaped crossover waistband felt supportive and smoothing. We also like that it didn’t roll or slide down while we ran. Although it’s available in three inseam lengths, we found it tends to run long. If you prefer a standard waistband with more compression, we recommend the
OFFLINE by Aerie Goals High Waisted Legging
, which is made to move. And for a pair with an unexpected twist, try the
OFFLINE by Aerie Goals Crochet Insert Legging
.
We like that
Aerie
doesn’t retouch any photos, promoting positivity and body confidence in its campaigns. They’re also working towards making a more sustainable clothing industry—many Aerie leggings are made with sustainable materials as part of the brand’s REAL GOOD program.
Aerie’s classic, colorful styles are priced between $25 and $65, but they often go on sale for less. Just note that you’ll need to spend $75 to get free shipping, and some returns will have a $5 fee attached.

Sweaty Betty

Pros
Emphasizes sustainability
Unique styles and patterns
Free returns
Cons
Must spend $75 to get free shipping
Sweaty Betty is a British brand that’s committed to taking care of the planet. They use sustainable and recycled materials to make many of their leggings. They’ve also
made other commitments
to reduce waste and their carbon footprint, including packaging their clothing in 100% recycled plastic bags.
Their leggings combine fashion and function in unique styles you won’t find anywhere else.
We’ve tried on Sweaty Betty’s best sellers
to determine which pairs come out on top. Our favorite are the
Power Workout Leggings
: Available in dozens of colors, we love that they’re soft, lightweight, and supportive. The seams gently shape your figure to provide a flattering silhouette, while an internal drawstring ensures the waistband won’t slip or roll down throughout the day.
Runners will love the sleek
Zero Gravity High-Waisted 7/8 Running Leggings
, with UPF 40+ protection and two pockets. For yoga and Pilates, try the
Super Soft 7/8 Yoga Leggings
. Breathable and sweat-wicking, they even have a side pocket that’s deep enough to hold your phone.
Sweaty Betty prices range from $100 to $128, which is similar to brands like Alo Yoga and Beyond Yoga. While you need to spend $75 for free shipping, returns are free.

Spanx

Pros
Woman-owned
Supportive, compressive leggings
Free shipping and returns
Cons
No low-compression styles
Founded by Sara Blakely, Spanx is known for its sculpting, lifting, and smoothing clothing, including stylish, best-selling leggings. Every pair offers a high level of compression that supports and flatters every body. We also like that they make maternity leggings, like Beyond Yoga and Girlfriend Collective—plenty of options to take you from prenatal to
postpartum workouts
.
Spanx’s extensive legging line will take you from the studio to brunch and beyond, with dozens of colors, styles, and features to choose from. Perhaps the most popular for workouts, the
Booty Boost Active Leggings
are sweat-wicking and breathable, to keep you comfortable and dry. Their compressive, high-rise design supports your midsection while lifting your bum, so you feel supported and confident.
We also like the
Soft Stretch Seamless Leggings
because they lack a center seam, meaning you’ll never have to worry about uncomfortable camel toe. For a subtle pattern, try the
Booty Boost Active Micro Dot 7/8 Leggings
or the
Booty Boost Active Floral Squiggle 7/8 Leggings
.
Spanx leggings cost anywhere from $68 to $128. We love that they offer free shipping and free returns on all orders. But there aren’t any low-compression options for lounging or gentle yoga.

Beach Riot

Pros
Woman-owned
Fun, bright leggings
Matching girls’ styles available
Cons
Must spend $150 to get free shipping
Fee for returns
If you're looking for bright colors and elevated style, we recommend Beach Riot leggings. Available in two lengths—7/8- and full-length—many feature pockets and a high, wide waistband that stays in place all day long. They’re ideal if you prioritize fashion and comfort, but don’t need high-tech features or reflective details for outdoor workouts.
A California-based brand, Beach Riot was founded to bridge the beach and the gym. We like that all of their pieces can be worn in the gym and the water, which we think makes them totally worth the investment.
The
Ayla Legging
is one of our favorites, with an ultra-high-rise waistband and thick, ribbed material. It’s also available in
girls’ sizes
, so you can match your little one in style. Made from the same fabric, the
Colorblock Legging
is a fun upgrade from your usual go-to black pair. We also like the
Summer 7/8 Legging
, which comes in a range of rich colors and has two deep side pockets.
Beach Riot’s prices range from $88 to $128, which is on par with most other brands on our list. But you’ll need to spend at least $150 for free shipping, and there is a fee for online returns.

How We Selected and Tested the Best Legging Brands
With so many legging brands to choose from, we used a few key methods and standards to narrow down our selections.
First, we researched the current leggings market, looking for brands that offer a wide variety of styles, designs, inseam lengths, and price points. We also prioritized brands with wide size ranges, including plus and petite sizes. Convenience and a positive shopping experience are important, too, so we considered shipping fees, return fees, and other customer service policies—including how long it takes for the leggings to show up at your door after you order them.
Then, we analyzed insights from our leggings tests. We’re continually trying on the latest pairs in The Verywell Testing Lab and in the real world to find out which brand’s leggings actually hold up to intense exercise and regular wear. In testing, we pay attention to how the leggings fit, whether they’re comfortable, and if they show any signs of wear and tear after multiple washes. We also note whether the leggings are opaque and how much the waistband moves during long periods of wear.
Our Experts
For more insight into the best legging brands, we asked two experts which features they look for when shopping for high-quality leggings. We spoke with:
Wan Na Chun, MPH, RD, CPT
, a registered dietitian and certified personal trainer
Caroline Young, MS, RD, LD
, a yoga teacher and owner of Whole Self Nutrition
What to Look For in Legging Brands
Five key features to look for in leggings.
Verywell Fit / Michelle Parente
Price
Leggings at any price point can still be comfortable and durable. The leggings on our list range from around $25 to $140, with most pairs costing about $100. Less expensive brands, like
Aerie
, make it easy to stock up on your favorite pairs. However, they may make up for their lower prices by charging you a fee to return your leggings if you change your mind. More expensive brands, like
Alo Yoga
and
lululemon
, tend to offer free standard shipping and free returns. But they may have more limited size ranges, especially when it comes to plus sizes.
If the pair you’re eyeing is outside of your budget, keep checking the brand’s website—many offer seasonal sales that can save you some extra cash.
Fit
Your leggings should be snug, while still allowing you to move comfortably. If they feel constricting, they’re too tight, Young says. Other signs that they’re too small include sheering at the knees (especially when you bend over or squat) and red marks from the waistband digging in. But if they start bunching up, or you find yourself constantly readjusting them, then they’re probably too big, she adds.
Length
The right inseam length depends on your size, height, and personal preference. However, for most activities, you’ll probably want something that hits you at the ankle or above, so it doesn’t or get in the way of your workout. Most top brands offer leggings in a variety of lengths—some also have petite and long inseams, like Athleta. Consider which styles and inseam lengths you’re most comfortable wearing, whether that’s ankle length, 7/8 length, or cropped.
Fabric
“The best leggings for exercise are made from moisture-wicking fabrics that help keep you dry and comfortable during workouts. Breathable materials allow air circulation, preventing overheating,” says Chun. Look for pairs made from a blend of lightweight performance materials, like Lycra, polyester, nylon, elastane, and Spandex. Avoid cotton, which isn’t as good at wicking away sweat.
Rise
Many people prefer a wide, high-rise waistband because it adds support and helps the leggings stay in place as you move. Young recommends high-waisted leggings for yoga, so you can focus on balancing instead of readjusting your outfit during class. Thinner, mid- or low-rise waistbands can be solid options for running, hiking, or spinning, as long as they stay in place and don’t pinch you. Some leggings have an adjustable drawstring either on the outside or inside of the band for additional support as needed. For the most comfort, choose a waistband that sits flush to your skin without feeling too compressive.
Frequently Asked Questions
What is the best brand of leggings?
The best brand of leggings depends on your budget, your workout routine, and personal preference. Some of our favorite leggings that we’ve tested are from
lululemon
,
Athleta
,
Alo Yoga
, and
Beyond Yoga
. If you’re looking to branch out from your usual brands, we recommend researching shipping and return policies, price points, and care instructions before buying.
How do I find high-quality leggings?
“Quality leggings are made from high-quality materials that are durable, stretchy, and have good recovery,” Chun says. She recommends looking for fabric that feels smooth against your skin. The leggings shouldn’t lose their shape over time or sheer out when you stretch them. She adds that the waistband should also provide a secure fit and stay in place, without digging in or rolling down as you move. The best way to check for these features is to try leggings on in person, whenever possible. Or, shop from a brand that makes it easy to return your leggings, so you can try a few different types and styles to find pairs you like.
What are the best legging brands to work out in?
Many brands make leggings that are great for working out in. We picked all of the brands on our list because they have a reputation for making reliable exercise leggings. We strongly feel that you can’t go wrong with leggings from any brand on this list, but we especially recommend
lululemon
,
Athleta
,
Alo Yoga
,
Beyond Yoga
,
Outdoor Voices
,
Gymshark
,
Carbon 38
, and
Aerie
because we’ve tested their leggings ourselves. We find that these pairs hold up to regular wear, wick away sweat effectively, and wash well.
How much do leggings usually cost?
The leggings on our list cost between $25 and $140. The average price of full-length leggings from popular brands is between $90-$100 per pair. But you can find stylish, functional leggings at almost any price point. Also, keep in mind that leggings go on sale often—brands like
lululemon
and
Athleta
refresh their sale sections with new picks regularly.

Frequently Asked Questions
Age-old advice recommends never buying a book based on its cover. The same goes for
the best sneakers
. At least initially, look beyond the color and design because the features such as support and fit can influence your comfort and protect against injury. Shopping for sneakers can be stressful, but we've gathered all the things that you might want to consider when finding the perfect pair for your needs.
Guide to Sneaker Terminology
If shoe terminology has your head spinning, be sure to check out our
running shoe terminology guide
.
Price
You can expect to spend between $75 and $200 on a high-quality pair of sneakers. Less expensive shoes, like
Asics’ Gel-Excite 9
, are a low-risk investment for new or casual runners. But they may not have enough stability or support for runners with flat feet or plantar fasciitis. More expensive shoes, like
Hoka’s Bondi 8
, tend to have features that target specific conditions like these. However, for people with neutral arches who only walk or run occasionally, a pricier shoe’s over-the-top support features may feel uncomfortable.
Consider your individual budget and find sneakers within your price range. There are plenty of options that are high quality and affordable.
Fit
Finding the right fit can be difficult, but it’s a crucial step in purchasing sneakers that you’ll love wearing. We spoke with podiatrist
Saylee Tulpule, DPM
to get expert advice on finding the perfect fit.
Tulpule recommends getting fitted by an expert in person first. Then, once you’ve found sneakers that feel comfortable, it’s easy to order replacement pairs later online. She says athletic shoes should always be a half or a full size up from your regular (or dress) shoe size. To make sure you have enough room in the toe box, check that there’s a half-thumb distance between the front of the shoe and the tip of your longest toe, adds Tulpule. These guidelines should help you find a sneaker that feels as good as it looks.
Note that the term 'fit' is subtly different than 'size.' Fit infers the personal comfort of a shoe, whereas size is the standardized measurement of a shoe. Note that different brands may have slight variations in size, so it's always important to try shoes on, consult with a knowledgeable shoe salesperson, and read up on the brand's sizing chart or reviews.
Materials
Walking and running sneakers have three main parts: the upper, the midsole, and the outsole. A shoe’s upper should be breathable, to help air circulate and prevent sweat or odors from building up. Most uppers on our list are made from lightweight mesh or knit fabric, and some contain recycled materials. Midsoles need to be thick and well-cushioned, without feeling too heavy or bulky. They’re usually made from layers of soft foam or gel, sometimes with air pockets in between. Midsoles can range in thickness from less than 0.5 inches all the way up to 1.5 inches, like in
New Balance’s Fresh Foam X More v4
. And most outsoles are made from durable rubber that provides good traction on a variety of surfaces, from treadmill belts to rocky trails.
Support
Over- or underpronation, flat feet,
plantar fasciitis
,
high arches
, and wide or narrow feet can all determine what kind of support you need in a sneaker. There are also
shoes for back pain
that provide support, cushioning, and shock absorption. Having the right kind of support doesn’t just change how comfortable a shoe is—it also affects your ankles, your knees, and your stride. For instance, overpronators need
motion control shoes
to help stop their feet from rolling inward. When assessing how supportive a sneaker is, look for these key features:
Arch support:
Does the sneaker have extra support underneath the arch, or supports built into the sides of the shoe?
Collar:
Is there extra padding around the shoe’s collar, to protect your ankles?
Heel cushioning:
Does the heel have cushioning both underneath your foot and around your Achilles tendon, for better stability?
Drop:
How big is the shoe’s drop (i.e. the difference between the height of the front of the shoe and the back of the shoes)? Does it feel comfortable to wear, or does it place too much pressure on your feet and knees?
It’s also important to replace your sneakers regularly to make sure they continue to support your feet for many miles to come. Tulpule suggests investing in a new pair every 300 to 400 miles for avid, long-distance runners, or between every six months and one year for walkers and casual runners.
How Often Should You Replace Your Sneakers?
Note that sneakers, particularly
running shoes, need to be replaced every 400 miles
. Keep an eye on your shoes and how you feel after your activity, but approximately mileage is also a good indicator.
Comfort
It doesn’t matter how stylish or supportive your sneakers are—if they aren’t comfortable, you won’t want to wear them. Look for shoes with thick, plush padding and a breathable upper that will keep your feet cool and dry. Certain sneakers, like
New Balance’s 990v5
, even have removable insoles, so you can add your own if there’s a pair you already own and like.
It’s also worth noting that the best sneakers don’t need to be broken in. If they aren’t comfortable the first time you try them on, they might be the wrong size. Or, they may have support in an area where your feet just don’t need it. Either way, aim for a pair that feels soft and springy the moment you slip them on.
Choosing
sneakers that are comfortable
is key, as it reduces the risk of injuries and discomfort.
Verywell Fit / Tamara Staples
Purpose
The sneaker industry is a $72 billion business,
and there are different types of sneakers to fit a variety of purposes. There are everyday sneakers, fashion sneakers,
walking shoes
,
running shoes
,
trail running shoes
,
gym shoes
, you name it. Consider your intended use of the sneaker, and then refine the products you look at based on that. For example, you would want to invest in a different
sneaker for playing tennis
or
pickleball
versus marathon training.
Durability
It's important to consider the overall construction and durability of your shoe. This relates back to the point about purpose, but a trail running shoe will likely be more durable than a super light track shoe due to its intended purpose. If you're looking for a super durable shoe, check out the toe box and heel to ensure they are reinforced, as well as the outsoles to double-check they will provide good traction.
How to Care for Sneakers
How you care for your sneakers can extend the life of your shoes. Check out these
expert tips on how to best care for your shoes
.
Style
While the design and color of a shoe should not be the primary focus, these days, there are lots of options when it comes to sneakers. Once you find a shoe that checks all the boxes in terms of fit and function, consider your personal style preferences and find a color or design that makes you feel confident. For instance, do you prefer the convenience of
slip-on sneakers
? After all, you have to feel good in the shoe.
Frequently Asked Questions
What are the best sneakers?
Our team at the Dotdash Meredith tested hundreds of sneakers to find the best options for every type of exercise. We then took the top 24 sneakers into our Commerce Testing Lab and tested them extensively by walking and running on a treadmill, assessing fit with a podiatrist, and slicing each shoe in half to compare the layers of foam and padding.
Best Sneakers for Women
: Hoka Women's Clifton 8
Best Sneakers for Men
: Brooks Adrenaline GTS 22
Are more expensive sneakers always better?
Ultimately, the best sneaker is one that fits both your budget and your feet. If you have a condition like plantar fasciitis, we recommend investing in a sneaker with specific features that provide support where your feet need it the most, like
Hoka’s Bondi 8
. But if you have neutral arches and no underlying conditions, a less expensive sneaker like
Asics’ Gel-Excite 9
is still a reliable and comfortable option.
Which sneakers do podiatrists recommend?
One way to check if a sneaker is recommended by podiatrists is to look for the APMA Seal of Approval or Acceptance. Sneakers with these awards (like
Hoka’s Clifton 8
) have already been reviewed and endorsed by a board of podiatrists. But in general, some brands of sneakers are preferred by podiatrists over others. Tulpule usually recommends Brooks, New Balance, Hoka, and Asics shoes to her patients because these brands make shoes with good midfoot support, cushioning, and shock absorption. She tends to avoid Puma, Adidas, and Skechers since she says their sneakers are too flat and flexible, with little support.
Is it okay to walk in running sneakers?
Each pair of sneakers on our list is designed for a specific purpose, whether it’s walking, running, training, or a combination of the three. For the most part, it’s okay to walk in running sneakers. But Tulpule says that if you’re not a runner, it's a good idea to purchase a pair of sneakers that are designed for walking, like
Rykä’s Devotion Plus 4 Walking Shoe
. This shoe’s lightweight, flexible midsole bends with the arch of your foot to offer support that’s targeted for walkers, unlike many of the stiffer running shoes on our list. If you plan to walk outside in all weather, be sure to opt for
waterproof sneakers
.

Limitations
You are probably familiar with moisture-wicking clothing that promises to keep you both dry and cool. Maybe you have even wondered how a shirt or a pair of pants with evaporative cooling technology can help keep you from overheating on a hot day or during physical activity.
After all, maintaining an optimal body temperature is essential when you are in hot conditions or participating in activities that can raise your body’s core temperature. But is cooling clothing the answer?
Experts claim these garments—which are sought after by athletes and outdoor enthusiasts alike—not only prevent
overheating
but also may be able to improve comfort and performance. To help you make sense of these claims on what cooling garments can (and cannot) do, we explore the details of how they work below.
The Best Reflective Running Gear to Keep You Safe and Seen on Your Route
Evaporative Cooling Technology
Evaporative cooling clothing, commonly seen in vests or towels, uses the fundamental scientific property of 'phase change' to keep your temperature from rising. Evaporation takes place when liquid (like sweat) turns into a vapor or evaporates. Because heat energy is used to change the water to vapor, a cooling sensation occurs.
Clothing, like shorts and
exercise dresses
, that use evaporative technology relies on this 'phase change' process. First, you wet the vest or towel, wring it out, and then wear it over your other clothing. The fabric remains slightly damp, allowing the water particles to slowly evaporate as air passes over them. During the evaporation process, you'll experience cooling as heat dissipates from your body.
"The fabric releases moisture through evaporation on the top face of the fabric, which results in the skin being kept dry," says
Lara Smith
, founder of cooling sleepwear and sheets companies Lusomé and SOMÉ.
Moisture-Wicking Fabrics
Fabrics that wick moisture from the body work in a similar fashion. However, instead of getting them wet first, like with
cooling towels
, they use your sweat to go through the cooling evaporative process. When you get warm and begin to perspire, these special highly-absorbent fabrics draw moisture away from your body as quickly as possible.
As the heat is drawn away from your body, they pull moisture from your skin into the fabric, where it can be turned into a vapor. Most
moisture-wicking fabrics
strive to pull as much moisture and humidity away from the skin as possible and then disperse it across the largest surface area of the fabric to maximize evaporation.
Smith says two types of fabric are used. These include hydrophilic and hydrophobic fibers. Hydrophilic fabrics absorb and draw moisture in, she says. Meanwhile, hydrophobic fabrics repel moisture, so the fabric and skin won't stay wet.
Activewear
Breathability and Ventilation
Some clothing may incorporate breathability and ventilation, while others rely solely on these features, such as a vented rain jacket. Breathable fabrics, also known as fabrics with air permeability, help to prevent heat,
sweat
, and humidity from being trapped against your body.
These fabrics are better at allowing airflow, unlike polyester, which holds it against your skin. Added ventilation, usually seen as strategic cuts or holes in the clothing, can increase airflow.
Smith notes that although these features can influence the thermal comfort factor of a garment, it is still important to have a mechanism to eliminate sweat and bacteria, like a wicking fabric.

Phase Change Materials (PCM)
Phase change materials (PCM) were largely developed by NASA when they were working on temperature control for space suits. PCMs rely on materials that change states at various temperatures, similar to the wax of a candle as it liquefies and solidifies.
Sometimes, when used in textiles, these materials are called 'thermocules.' The molecules within the fabric change state depending on temperature fluctuations, so they either absorb or release heat, helping to adjust your body temperature quickly. Think of it as built-in temperature control, also known as thermoregulation.
Thermoregulation is the name for maintaining a steady internal body temperature. It's a biological mechanism that all mammals possess, which is why we sweat when we are hot or shiver when we are cold.
During phase changes, PCMs absorb excess heat from your body and then release it as they phase change again when the ambient temperature drops. In other words, they cool you when you get hot and offer warmth when you get cold.
In turn, this can
aid performance
and comfort. Since early NASA development, PCMs have found their way into various products, like bedding, medical supplies, and athletic clothing, as a method of thermoregulation.

Fabric Innovations for Cooling Clothing
There have been other cooling clothing innovations too, such as cool-touch fabrics. These textiles often have a special finish, though some possess it in their natural state, that allows them to feel cool to the touch. The scientific term is 'thermal effusivity,' and it's the reason why some fabrics feel cool when they touch your skin.
The heat from your body is transferred to the textile and a high thermal effusivity makes it feel very cool to the touch. Products like jade powder or polyethylene (PE), which have high thermal effusivity, can be added to fabrics to help them feel cooler and promote heat transfer away from your body.
To embed these cooling agents, a method called micro-encapsulation is often used. This technique captures small quantities of agents into tiny packages, known as microspheres, which can then be embedded into the fabric.
Microspheres are also helpful because most only release or activate their agents under certain conditions.
"It is a mechanism to envelop substances [by coating them with] extremely small capsules," says Smith. "Think aloe-infused socks."
Finally, reflective coatings may also help to cool the wearer. Using reflective surfaces to deflect the sunlight and reduce heat absorption, maximizing coolness, isn't new. However, reflective coatings have advanced since their inception, and many can now be added to fabrics without drastically changing their other properties.
Another benefit Smith notes is increased visibility, which is ideal for people like runners, cyclists, or outdoor construction workers who need to have the safety element.

Applications and Benefits of Cooling Clothing
Cooling fabric has expanded into a variety of clothing options and gear, such as
high-performance compression leggings
. It's excellent for athletes who want to enhance their performance during strenuous workouts. Cooling textiles with the added benefit of antimicrobial agents or reflective coatings can also keep athletes safe while drawing heat away from the body. This ultimately aids their comfort by reducing heat stress and preventing overheating during exercise.
Outdoor enthusiasts can particularly benefit from cooling clothing, especially in hot and sunny conditions. Hikers, campers, and home gardeners can use cooling textiles to help regulate their body temperature outdoors and prevent heat-related illnesses like heat stroke. Similarly, those living in hot climates may turn to cooling clothing to promote evaporation and reduce heat build-up for comfort and relief during relentless humidity and warmth.
When Is It Too Hot to Exercise?
Limitations and Considerations
Although moisture-wicking and cool sensation clothing can provide relief and comfort, it does have its limitations. In high-humidity environments, its effectiveness may be decreased as evaporation is typically slower. Additionally, evaporative clothing is only helpful as long as it stays damp. When the fabric dries out, it will need to be remoistened.
When choosing cooling clothing, getting the proper fit and design for your activity is imperative. Most moisture-wicking fabrics must be in direct contact with your skin to remove moisture and disperse it into the fabric. If you wear these textiles as an outer layer or a very loose base layer, they may not work as effectively.
Many clothing items also will be geared toward a certain activity, and following these recommendations is wise. For example,
a hiker
might want a thermal regulating shirt with a reflective coating for UV protection. A cyclist will use a moisture wicking base layer under their jersey in the summer months to not only aid in the cooling process but also to collect much of the sweat produced on a long, hot bike ride and perhaps save the expensive jersey from ultimately getting sweat stains. At the same time, a runner may choose a lighter, moisture-wicking fabric with enhanced breathability. After you've selected the right cooling fabric for your intended purpose, proper care and maintenance are required to keep the garment functioning at optimal levels.
"In general, gently wash and dry and do not use any type of softener or bleach," says Smith. However, she cautions that fabrics vary, making it important to follow the specific item's care instructions. Following the instructions will extend the life of your clothing and help it maintain optimal cooling performance.
11 Tips for Running in the Heat, According to Experts
Bottom Line
Cooling clothing can use various techniques to draw heat and moisture away from your skin for a cooling sensation. It can be beneficial for all types of users, including athletes, those who enjoy the outdoors, or hot climate dwellers.
However, choosing the appropriate type and fit is key for optimal comfort, performance, and prevention of overheating. Before committing to a brand or type, explore your options while considering your individual needs, activity levels, and environmental conditions.

What Are Compression Socks?
Health Benefits
Who May Benefit
How to Choose
Tips for Use
Considerations and Precautions
Compression socks have become increasingly popular in the past 15 years among runners, triathletes, and walkers for their ability to enhance performance and encourage quick recovery. These
specialized garments
provide targeted pressure to your feet and legs, which helps alleviate delayed-onset muscle soreness. The socks also provide varying degrees of relief for certain health conditions.
Another reason for their popularity is that these socks can benefit any number of people. Whether you are constantly on the go or sitting for extended periods, compression socks enhance leg and muscle health. To decide if compression socks are right for you, understanding the science behind them can shed light on their applicability to your physical activities and health issues. Here's what you need to know.
What Are Compression Socks?
Compression socks are elastic, tight garments designed to apply graduated pressure to your lower legs. Graduated pressure occurs when pressure from the socks is highest at the ankles and decreases as it moves up the leg.
This design is engineered to create an upward flow of blood from the leg toward the heart as opposed to blood pooling in the lower extremities. This can reduce
lactic acid
buildup after
intense workouts
and in periods when you do not move as much, such as during air or car travel.
For those with damaged veins, compression socks apply graduated pressure to the surface veins and arteries, reducing their size. This can increase blood flow as well and is especially beneficial for anyone who stands or sits for extended periods.
Benefits of Compression Socks
Compression socks offer benefits for both athletic endeavors and to combat specific health conditions. As always, talk with a healthcare provider if you have underlying health issues or a chronic condition, as compression socks are not meant for everyone. That said, compression socks often work in tandem with some treatment plans. Here are some of the benefits of compression socks.
Helps to Prevent Deep Vein Thrombosis
Those prone to deep vein thrombosis might consider investing in compression socks. Researchers conducted a comprehensive systematic review of graduated compression stockings on the prevention of deep vein thrombosis in patients admitted to the hospital.
They found that 13% of patients who received graduated compression stockings developed deep vein thrombosis versus 26% of those with no stockings. The researchers concluded that compression socks could prevent deep vein thrombosis.
Decreasing Travel Venous Thromboembolism
If you travel cross country or overseas, compression socks can decrease incidence of leg edema and asymptomatic deep vein thrombosis.
In a meta-analysis, researchers reported that the risk of venous thromboembolism is three-fold higher on long-haul flights.
In a study of 116 airline passengers with no history of thromboembolism, none of the passengers who wore compression stockings during the flight got deep vein thrombosis. However, 12 who did not wear stockings were identified with deep calf vein thrombosis.
Reducing Lymphedema
Graduated compression stockings can maintain long-term lymphedema reduction, especially socks with the highest level of compression you can tolerate. Lower compression stockings can be used for mild lymphedema and leg edema.
Alleviating Pregnancy Swelling
If you experience leg pain during
pregnancy
, such as swelling and leg exhaustion, a randomized control trial found that graduated compression stockings improved these symptoms. However, the stockings did fail to prevent any pregnancy-related varicose veins.
Elevating Performance
Runners
, triathletes, and walkers could have positive performance effects because of compression socks. Researchers found that they can improve a person's running economy with their built-in support of muscle performance, thereby creating a higher
running
efficiency and lower metabolic costs. They also reduced muscular trauma and improved proprioception.
Exercise recovery time could also be faster. Because graduated compression socks can increase oxygen delivery, this helps to reduce lactic acid build-up and lowers muscle undulation.
Increasing Blood Circulation
Compression socks can help circulate blood, which reduces blood clotting, blood pooling, and the creation of varicose veins. This occurs because the increased blood flow allows for a higher delivery of oxygen and nutrient delivery to the body’s tissues.
Who May Benefit from Compression Socks
Any number of individuals can benefit from wearing compression socks, including those who sit or stand for extended periods, travelers who are on flights for at least six hours, and athletes looking for improved performance and recovery. Pregnant people and anyone prone to deep vein thrombosis, blood clotting, and varicose veins also may benefit from compression socks.
These socks also can be used for both therapeutic and preventive purposes. When used for therapeutic purposes, the socks increase blood flow and circulation, especially in
athletes
after a
long workout
and in pregnant women who have leg pain. When used for preventive purposes, compression stockings can reduce the development of deep vein thrombosis, blood pooling on a flight, and muscular trauma.
Choosing the Right Compression Socks
Selecting the proper fit and the right level of compression is important for optimal function. Loose socks do not provide sufficient compression and can even create friction, leading to painful blistering. Meanwhile, if the socks are too tight, your legs will not receive proper blood circulation and can feel uncomfortable (which you do not want while
running a race
).
To help you with proper fit, you can look at the varying compression levels and how they correlate with your choice of activities or specific health conditions. Here is an explanation of the levels with their measurements in millimeters of mercury (mmHg):
Mild (8 to 15 mmHg)
: This is for people who have mild pain, fatigue, or swelling in the legs. This level is preventive against varicose veins and blood pooling for those sitting or standing too long.
Moderate (15 to 20 mmHg)
: This level provides more support for those with varicose veins and mild leg swelling. This level is also commonly used in pregnant women and surgical patients.
Firm (20 to 30 mmHg)
: Anyone diagnosed with deep vein thrombosis, serious leg swelling, and major venous insufficiency could benefit from firm compression, as can athletes during and after intense workouts.
Extra firm (30 to 40 mmHg)
: This level is for serious medical conditions and is typically used with medical care.
Tips for Proper Compression Sock Sizing
You can ensure a proper fit by considering the following factors:
Consider the measurements of your legs, including the thigh, calf, and ankle. Manufacturers will often provide a sizing chart on the product itself. Because these sizes can vary, do not assume your size. Pay attention to the labels and sizing charts when making a choice.
Look for certain material types, such as spandex, nylon, and elastane. If you can, try the product on before you purchase it, noting its breathability and ability range of motion.
Determine which types of socks you want. Some socks cover the legs between the knee and ankle while others cover the entire foot and leg below the knee. Other socks will cover the
entire leg up to your waist
. You can choose whichever is most comfortable for you.
Consult with a healthcare provider to determine what level of compression is best for your health condition or goal.
How to Use Compression Socks
To wear
compression
socks appropriately, you may need to take some time getting used to them. Doing so will help you prevent discomfort or chafing. For instance, start by wearing the socks for a few hours each day and gradually increase the wear time. Once you build up tolerance, you can wear them throughout the day, especially if you stand or sit for long periods.
You also should care for the material properly by closely adhering to the washing instructions. Often, manufacturers will ask you to avoid using fabric softener because of the way it can impact the integrity of the fabric. If you have owned a pair of compression socks for a while, check their condition from time to time. If they look worn or stretched out, it might be time to replace them.
Other Considerations and Precautions
Be cautious of potential negative reactions to compression socks. If you are allergic to the stocking material, you could develop contact dermatitis, blistering, or discoloration. Compression socks may also not be appropriate for all people. In a study on clots in the legs when wearing stockings after a stroke, researchers found that skin breaks, ulcers, necrosis, and blisters were among the most common health issues of those who wore compression stockings. Also, textile fabrics, thermoregulation, and dye caused skin reactions.
Bottom Line
Compression socks
can improve leg health, blood circulation, and overall well-being. To get used to wearing them, consider incorporating compression socks into your daily routine (especially if you fall into one of the identified groups that could benefit from them).
For those with
allergies
, reading labels can help you identify any allergens and potential skin sensitivities. As always, consult with a healthcare provider for personalized recommendations and to ensure the proper usage of compression socks for your specific needs.

Why Trust Verywell Fit
Verywell Fit / Jhett Thompson
Gymshark is a popular activewear brand that carries
high-quality men’s and women’s workout apparel
at a competitive price. The brand has generated a massive cult following of influencers, athletes, and fitness enthusiasts everywhere. Gymshark carries various activewear styles, but they’re most known for their top-quality leggings that are
functional
,
flattering
, and pretty
affordable
—with styles averaging around $60. When you think of Gymshark, you might envision athletes vigorously lifting weights in the gym or training for marathons. But the brand offers styles for all types of wearers—we should know,
we tested
12 different pairs.
To find the best Gymshark leggings for every activity, we spent hours in
The Verywell Testing Lab
trying on and working out in
12 different styles
. We then took each pair home to wear-test for a month during our regular fitness routines and leisure activities. After
30 days of wear-testing
, we rated each pair for
quality
,
opacity
,
fit
,
performance
, and
overall value
. To ensure our recommendations are accurate, we also had a certified personal trainer from our
Review Board
review this story. She helped us confirm the best ways to shop and care for your Gymshark leggings.

Gymshark Seamless Leggings

Pros
Snug and supportive
Versatile
Comes in many colors
Cons
Waistband may dig in a bit when seated
One of the brand’s most popular styles, Gymshark’s Vital Seamless 2.0 Leggings impressed us across the board. Functional enough for high-intensity workouts and comfortable enough for daily wear, we can see why most wearers love this versatile pair.
The fabric feels smooth, supportive, and compressive against the skin, and we didn’t have to adjust the leggings at all when working out in these during our testing period. We love that the high-rise waistband is comfortable and flattering, but we did find that it dug into our skin a little bit when seated. We also had to use a bit of effort to pull on the leggings, but you can easily size up if you want a less compressive fit.
When lunging and squatting in front of a mirror, we were pleasantly surprised with how opaque the leggings were: No signs of underwear lines, even with lighter-colored fabric. And after multiple wears and washes throughout testing, the high-quality leggings held up—making them well worth their already competitive price.

Best for Running
Gymshark Seamless Leggings

$42 at Gymshark.com
Pros
Thick and durable
Full coverage
Snug and supportive
Cons
Too thick for warm weather
When choosing
what to wear running
, a pair of leggings that stays in place is essential to avoid distracting mid-run adjustments. Enter the Adapt Camo Seamless Leggings: they stay put while moving flexibly with your body as you stride, step, and sprint. We love that they are stretchy, supportive, and compressive (but not too restrictive).
If running is not your forte, you can still wear these squat-proof leggings for all activities. We love that the thick fabric offers complete opacity and even some warmth during cool-weather workouts. But if you run outside in the summer or attend heated studio classes, we recommend the option for the more breathable Warp Knit Leggings instead.
This pair slides on smoothly and fits true to size. And we love the supportive compression that starts at the high-rise waistband and runs down the leg. After several wears and washes, we found that the leggings held up with no signs of wear and tear—making them well worth their standard price.

View on Gymshark.com
Pros
Soft and stretchy
Breathable
Versatile
Cons
Too thin for cold weather
Fabric thinned out in thigh area after many wears
Gymshark’s Legacy Leggings are a comfortable, breathable option for spin classes, sessions on your
indoor cycling bike
, or for pedaling on the road. In the Lab, we found the leggings to be completely opaque when sitting up and down on a plyometric box—making them a solid choice for all types of activities.
We also love the high-rise waistband that stays in place and offers support without any uncomfortable pinching when seated—which is a huge plus for cycling. This pair is ideal for activities indoors or outside in mild weather, thanks to its thin, breathable, sweat-wicking material. But for cooler weather, we recommend the Sweat Seamless leggings as a warmer alternative.
We found that the leggings fit true to size, offering moderate compression. But the thinner material did wear down in the thigh area after one month of wear and multiple washes. Still, we love this versatile pair that comes at a lower price compared to alternatives from many brand competitors.

Pros
Best Budget
Full coverage
Comes in many colors
Cons
Waistband may roll down
Run slightly small
Soft and comfortable enough for lounging but compressive and structured enough for workouts, Gymshark’s Training Leggings are a versatile (and affordable) option for most wearers. We love the fabric that feels like a second skin and moves with you while offering the support you need for various activities—from
low-impact HIIT workouts
to Pilates.
After testing, we could not believe how budget-friendly these were when we looked at the price. And given the price, you might expect to lose out on quality—but not with this pair! The material is completely opaque and does not sheer out (even when squatting). And it held up throughout testing with no signs of wear and tear after one month of wear and washes.
We found that the leggings run somewhat small, but they provide great support and a smoothing effect, so we would not recommend purchasing a full size up from your normal size—just note they’ll feel snug. You should also know that one of our testers noticed the waistband slipping during some exercises, but another tester said it remained perfectly in place—this may depend on body type and sizing.

We Found the 12 Best Leggings on Amazon, After Wear-Testing Dozens of Pairs
Best for Yoga
Gymshark Elevate Leggings
PHOTO: Gymshark
$20 at Gymshark.com
Pros
Sweat-wicking
Snug and supportive
Versatile
Cons
Some visible underwear lines
Waistband may roll down
A newer Gymshark find, the Elevate Leggings are functional and flattering for exercise and daily wear. One of our testers, a certified yoga instructor, wears this pair for hours at a time in a heated yoga studio—she also
tested other pieces from the Elevate Collection
, which she highly recommends. She loves how sweat-wicking, supportive, and stretchy the fabric is, making the leggings a comfortable choice for any
yoga practice
.
Although we found this pair particularly great for yoga, the Elevate Leggings are also a solid choice for strength training, lounging, daily wear, and more. They offer a sleek look and all-day comfort—perfect for studio-to-street wear. We love the slick and buttery-soft fabric that’s supportive but less compressive than other Gymshark picks we tested.
We found the pair completely opaque, but one of our testers noticed some underwear lines while wearing the Rose Brown color. And while one tester had to adjust the waistband throughout workouts, another tester highlighted a super secure waistband—but both said the pair fit true to size. All testers agreed that the leggings held up without signs of wear and tear throughout our testing period.

Pros
Sweat-wicking

Great for high-impact workouts
Cons
Not as versatile
Runs slightly small
The
best compression leggings
balance support with comfort, and Gymshark’s Adapt Animal Seamless Leggings do just that. They are moisture-wicking and super compressive, making them a great choice for sweaty, high-impact workouts. And we love the flattering butt-scrunch accent that adds a boost of confidence to any workout.
When testing these in the Lab, we found them completely opaque during each exercise in front of a mirror. And we loved that the waistband did not roll down during even the most high-intensity activities, like
plyometrics
. But while the compression leggings are functional for high-impact workouts, we found the fabric a bit too restrictive for comfortable lounging or daily wear.
After one month of testing at home and multiple wears and washes, these leggings showed no signs of wear and tear. If you’re considering this high-quality pair of leggings, note that they run slightly small—we recommend sizing up.

Gymshark Apex Seamless Leggings

$64 at Gymshark.com
Pros
Full coverage
Sweat-wicking
Solid compression
Cons
Run slightly small
The Apex Seamless Leggings are sweat-wicking, compressive, and completely opaque—a great choice for strength training and weightlifting. The design features muscle-contouring jacquard lines that run along the entire leg to accentuate your leg muscles and backside.
Similar to the Adapt Animal Seamless and Adapt Camo Seamless Leggings, this pair is made from a blend of polyester, nylon, and elastane that’s sweat-wicking, breathable, stretchy, and ultra-compressive. We love the Apex leggings for gym workouts but did not find them comfortable enough for everyday wear.
As is the case with many of the brand's most compressive leggings, this pair runs slightly small. We recommend sizing up for a more comfortable (but still supportive) fit. After one month of testing, we were impressed with how well these leggings held up, even after taking a beating at the gym.

Pros
High-quality and durable
Compressive and comfortable
Full coverage
Cons
Too thick for warm weather,
Waistband may roll down
Whether you walk, cycle, or
run in cold weather
, Gymshark’s Sweat Seamless Leggings are a great base or outer layer when the temperature drops. The material is thick and compressive yet stretchy and flexible, moving with you whichever way you stride, cycle, or squat. It’s also super durable—looking as good as new after one month of testing.
During our test, we found the leggings to be completely opaque and full coverage—except for the mesh detailing on the inside and outside of the leg that adds breathability and style. But although the leggings are breathable, we would not recommend them for warm weather or heated workouts because of the thicker material.
One of our testers found a true-to-size fit, while another noticed some bunching in certain areas like the crotch and hips. This also led her to have to hike up the waistband during several exercises—but the fit of these leggings will depend on your body type. If you’re interested in this pair, we recommend trying your normal size first and sizing up if necessary.

Gymshark Flex High-Waisted Leggings

Pros
Solid compression
Smoothing style

Cons
Not comfortable enough for lounging
Run slightly small
Smoothing, flattering, and ultra-compressive, the Flex High Waisted Leggings may be your next favorite pair for working out. We love that you don’t have to worry about sheering or underwear lines because the thick fabric offers full coverage—allowing you to feel confident no matter what
squat variation
you’re doing.
Similar to the two Adapt Leggings on our list, these offer maximum compression and a snug, high-rise waistband—great for working out but uncomfortable for lounging. Because the leggings are so compressive, they felt slightly small when we first put them on. If you prefer a less compressive fit, we recommend sizing up.
We love the jacquard pattern and branding on the backside of the waistband, as well as the neutral and pastel color options. And the price isn’t bad either! The Flex Leggings are a great option for squatting in style.

Pros
Soft and stretchy

Cons
Not completely opaque
If you’re looking for a soft, stretchy, second-skin feel, Gymshark’s Warp Knit Leggings are for you. Mesh paneling runs down the entire leg offering lightweight breathability, while a high-rise waistband keeps you secure and supported.
We love that the leggings are comfortable enough for all-day wear and fit true to size. And during testing in our Lab, we appreciated that the waistband stayed in place during lunges and squats. We felt held in and supported, with the freedom to move about comfortably.
After one month of testing, we were happy to note that the quality held up—no pulls, rips, or pills here. But from the first wear to the last, we did find the leggings to be somewhat see-through. The thin, breathable fabric makes this pair great for activities like running and lounging, but we don’t recommend it for yoga, Pilates, or strength training because the leggings don’t offer full coverage and aren’t squat-proof.

We Also Tested
We tested 12 pairs of leggings but only included 10 in our final list of recommendations. What happened to the final one? While we did find some noteworthy features, we don’t think this pair stacked up to the competition:
Gymshark’s Sport Running Leggings
have a helpful zipper pocket for storing small valuables and breathable mesh detailing for warm-weather workouts. But we found the leggings unbearably uncomfortable and not worth the purchase during testing.
How We Tested the Best Gymshark Leggings
To find the best Gymshark leggings on the market, we first spoke with
Rani Vance
, Pilates instructor at SLT, and
Megan Roup
, fitness expert and founder of The Sculpt Society, for their expert advice on what fabrics, fit, and styles to look for in a pair of leggings.
Then, we researched Gymshark’s different leggings styles and selected 12 best-selling pairs to test in The Verywell Testing Lab. Our team of 12 testers had different prior experiences wearing Gymshark leggings: testers included first-time wearers, brand super fans, and some in between. Each person tested two pairs of leggings, ensuring two different people evaluated each pair we tested.

The Verywell Fit Team Tests Gymshark Leggings
To begin testing, we tried on each pant, noting how well it fit: Too snug? Too loose? Just right? We assessed how comfortable each pair felt as we walked around the Lab. We also closely examined how the fabric felt on our skin: Was it lightweight and breathable? Thick and constrictive? Soft and supportive? As we continued walking around, we noted if the leggings stayed in place well or required a lot of adjusting.
We then completed a short circuit workout to test the leggings’ performance and opacity. While performing ten lunges, ten squats, and sitting down on a plyometric box, we looked at ourselves in a mirror to ensure the leggings were opaque and thick enough to cover underwear lines. We also noted whether or not the waistband stayed up during each movement without bunching, sagging, or pinching.
After our thorough test in the Lab, we took the leggings home to see how well they held up in our regular routines: Working out, running errands, lounging, and more. We also washed them several times, according to Gymshark’s care instructions. After four weeks of wear and washes, we rated each pair of leggings on a scale of 1 (would not recommend) to 5 (highly recommended) for quality, opacity, fit, performance, and value. We used these scores to create our final list of recommendations.
What to Look for in Gymshark Leggings
Fabric
“For me, fabric is everything,” says Roup. You want a pair of
workout leggings
that’s supportive, breathable, and (most importantly) comfortable.
Gymshark has several collections, including the Vital, Adapt, Sweat, Seamless, Elevate, Legacy, and GS Power Collections that we tested. Every line has its own blend of fabrics, but each of them includes some combination of nylon, polyester, and elastane.
You often find these synthetic performance fabrics in activewear because of their sweat-wicking, breathable properties. For high-impact workouts, we recommend the
Adapt Camo Seamless Leggings
, and for lounging or low-impact activities, we like the
Warp Knit Leggings,
Length
All of the Gymshark leggings we tested have a 30.5-inch inseam. The length hit our taller testers above the ankle and our shorter testers at or below the ankle. In some cases, the 30.5-inch inseam was too long for testers below 5 feet, 2. inches
Fit
Leggings should fit the curve of your legs with no excess fabric, says Vance. They should feel snug but not overly tight or constrictive and (most importantly) comfortable. “It's important that leggings fit your body, so you're not distracted by the length or the waist falling down while working out,” she says.
Most of the leggings we tested fit true to size, but there are several pairs in which you could size up for a less compressive fit. We found Gymshark’s
Training
,
Adapt Animal Seamless
,
Apex Seamless
, and
Flex High-Waisted
Leggings to run super compressive, or meant to fit snugly against the skin. But if you don’t like maximum compression, you can easily size up for a more comfortable fit.
Activity
What you’ll be doing in your leggings is one of the most important things to consider before purchasing. For instance, runners should look for the best
leggings for running
. Some Gymshark leggings are made for high-impact workouts, like HIIT, running, and cycling, while others are made for low-impact activities, like yoga, walking, or lounging.
We recommend a compressive, sweat-wicking legging, like the
Adapt Animal Seamless
legging,  for high-impact activities and a buttery soft, breathable legging, like the
Elevate Leggings
, for low-impact activities.
Rise
All Gymshark leggings we tested feature a high-rise waistband that sits right above the belly button for average-height wearers. Our taller testers often noted that the band sat right below the belly button, while some taller wearers appreciated a higher-rise fit. Our best high-rise pair, the
GS Power Original Leggings
, offer the highest waistband—a great option for taller wearers.
Frequently Asked Questions
Is it better to size up or down in Gymshark leggings?
During testing, we found that most Gymshark leggings run super compressive, meaning they feel tight against the skin. We found the leggings to run a bit small in some cases. We recommend sizing up for the perfect fit if you're deciding between two sizes.
Can you machine wash and dry Gymshark leggings?
According to
Gymshark’s clothing care guide
, you should machine wash your leggings on cold and hang them to air dry. The brand also recommends washing your clothing inside out to thoroughly clean out all sweat, dead skin cells, and bacteria. To best preserve your leggings, we recommend that you follow these instructions.
Which Gymshark leggings are the most squat-proof?
Gymshark’s
Flex High Waisted Leggings
are the most opaque and full-coverage pair we tested. And many Gymshark wearers agree that the
Vital Seamless 2.0 Leggings
are another solid squat-proof option.
Why are Gymshark leggings popular?
Gymshark has cultivated a cult following through its social-forward marketing strategy. The brand takes a customer-first approach, incentivizing wearers to post in their Gymshark fits to become a
Gymshark Athlete or Ambassador
. They also rely heavily on influencer marketing, with many popular influencers in the fitness community constantly sharing the brand.
But marketing strategies can only get a brand so far. Gymshark, especially its leggings, are popular because the brand produces a high-quality product at a competitive price. Compared to other big-name brands in the activewear space, Gymshark’s prices are more affordable, and its products are well-made, durable, functional, and stylish.

Maintenance and Care Tips
As part of your getting-ready routine in the morning, chances are slipping into socks falls somewhere in the mix—and this is especially true if you’re an avid exerciser. Working out without socks can be super uncomfortable for most activities, as bare feet in sneakers can exacerbate sweating, chafing, and even lead to the formation of pesky blisters that can hinder your future workouts. Socks also make your feet feel more comfortable while you’re working out, which can motivate you to exercise harder and for longer periods of time.
“The feet have the second-most concentration of nerve endings in the body aside from the hands, which means that the feedback of information from the feet to the nervous system is essential in determining how we move,” explains
Marvin Nixon
, MS, NBC-HWC, CPT, certified nutrition consultant, and health and wellness coach. “Wearing socks allows more information to flow from the ground to the brain and helps create powerful movement decisions and better balance and stability while providing protection to the feet.” While you may think being barefoot provides optimal sensory feedback, there is some research that shows compression socks have a similar effect.
Here is what you need to know about different types of socks, their benefits, and how to select the right socks for your workout.
Different Types of Socks and Their Benefits
Of course, socks come in all shapes, sizes, fabrics, and styles. Just like it’s important to choose the right shoe for your specific workout, it can pay to be smart about which type of sock you wear. Here’s a look at the different types of socks out there—and the benefit they offer for your workout.
Moisture-Wicking Socks
This type of sock is one of the most popular socks for workouts, as they help wick away moisture, keeping your feet comfortable and dry during exercise. This characteristic also can help reduce the risk of blisters and other pesky foot problems.
Cushioned Socks
If you’re performing a workout that involves walking, running, or jumping, a cushioned sock may be your best bet. These socks are lined with a thick layer of padding in the heel and toe that provides extra comfort and support, especially in the midfoot and forefoot, which experiences the most impact during exercise.
Compression Socks
Compression socks
are designed to apply gentle pressure to certain areas of your feet, thus improving circulation and even reducing swelling. This type of sock is often recommended to pregnant people as well as individuals with certain medical conditions to help reduce the risk of blood clots. It can also be helpful for people who have
foot pain
or who are at risk of developing foot problems. They are also used frequently to speed recovery post-workout.
No-Show Socks
As their name suggests, no-show socks are very short and tend to be invisible above the shoe line. These are a great choice for anyone looking to conceal their socks or with low-cut shoes like sandals or sneakers.
Toe Socks
While a less popular choice for exercisers wearing shoes, since they can reduce the moving room within the shoe itself and tend to be slightly less comfortable, these socks have separate compartments for each toe. This type of sock can be more comfortable for people with sensitive feet. Another key benefit is the fact that toe socks allow the toes to splay more and help to avoid skin to skin rubbing.
How to Choose Your Socks Based on the Workout Activity
Choosing the best sock for you will depend on your personal preference as well as the activity you are participating in. But, no matter your workout, we’ve got your feet covered with these expert-recommended sock suggestions that’ll improve your comfort and performance.
Running
The best type of
sock for running
is one that is designed to keep your feet dry, provide extra support, and prevent blisters, according to personal trainer Roger E. Adams, PhD, CISSN, owner of
eatrightfitness
. He recommends opting for those made of synthetic materials, as they tend to wick away moisture from your feet the best. Additionally, dual-layered socks made with extra padding in the heel and toe areas can help absorb shock, prevent blisters, and reduce friction.
One of the most common complaints when it comes to socks for runners (and walkers) is when socks slip down your feet into your shoes. Selecting a non-slip sock that grips your feet well, while remaining comfortable, is important. You'll want to test out a few options before investing in the perfect pair. If walking or hiking is more your thing, try a pair of these
best tested and reviewed socks for walking
.
Weightlifting
Dr. Adams recommends wearing calf or mid-calf height socks during
weightlifting and resistance training
because they can help prevent scrapes and cuts from picking up barbells or other pieces of equipment. While you might think a padded sock could help enhance your comfort while you’re lifting weights, Dr. Adams recommends against them, as many lifts, like
squats
, require you to really feel your feet on the floor to properly perform the lift. He suggests that weightlifters opt for flat socks and shoes.

Yoga
Most yoga instructors recommend performing this type of workout barefoot, which allows for maximum grip and helps prevent injury. If you do prefer to keep your feet covered for comfort or sanitary purposes, definitely make sure they have grips on the bottom to keep you stable and grounded while you’re performing different poses. As far as material,  certified strength and conditioning specialist, Reda Elmardi, founder of
The Gym Goat
, suggests opting for a breathable material that’s sweat-wicking like cotton. A good pair of grip socks also makes for a nice, affordable
yoga gift
.
Pilates
When it comes to pilates, you’ll want to choose socks that are low on the ankle area and that have grips to help keep you firmly grounded.
“The whole point is that you're using all of the little muscles in your feet, [so] you need to be able to move your toes freely in order to be able to strengthen the bottom of your feet in order to reduce your risk of
plantar fasciitis
,” explains
Alicia Jones
, national coach of Canada (NCCP), advanced sport nutrition-certified group fitness instructor, and personal training specialist. While you can typically opt for grippy socks or bare feet in a pilates class, grippy socks can help you to gain extra traction on a reformer, particularly if your feet are sweaty. Plus, some studios require them for sanitary purposes.
Barre
Barre is also very similar to pilates. You're doing basic dance movements where your feet for the most part would not have socks on them at all, explains Jones. She recommends low-cut socks that have grip pads on the bottom to help reduce the risk of slipping and injury. Higher cut socks are coming into fashion, particularly in the barre world, but low-cut grippy socks tend to be required in most barre classes. Jones also suggests opting for cotton socks because the material tends to be more breathable.

Cross Training
Similar to running, if you are a frequent cross trainer, you’ll want a good cotton blend sock that will stay put and provide a cushion against impact and weights, according to Rachel Welch, certified health coach, yoga instructor, and founder of
Revolution Motherhood
. It’s also important that your sock is lightweight enough to allow your feet to articulate (or move freely) within your shoes. Various styles of
Bombas socks
, for example, combine moisture control with arch support, fit, and cushioning.
Cycling
When cycling, you tend to sweat a great deal, especially in the foot area, which is why Jones recommends opting for a sock that is sweat-wicking as well as lower on your ankle. Other cyclists prefer a higher sock to avoid getting bike grease and gravel on their skin.
Comfort is also key, as you’ll be able to feel your sock fully while cycling and if you’re uncomfortable it may throw you off track. A compression sock may also be helpful because it hugs your feet tightly and can extend your ride by providing relief from minor aches and pain.
Sock Maintenance and Care Tips
Taking care of your socks by washing and storing them appropriately may seem like a minute step, however, it is an important step to maintain your foot health and overall performance.
How to Wash (And Dry) Your Workout Socks
To increase the longevity of your workout socks, wash them in hot water with a natural, fragrance-free soap to wash out sweat and germs without chemicals and additives. To preserve the elasticity of your socks, Welch recommends either hanging or air drying instead of putting them in the dryer.
Resist Folding, Roll Instead
“When folding, resist the urge to stretch them over each other into a ball," she says. Instead, experts recommend placing one sock on top of the other on a flat surface and then rolling them like a jelly roll and placing them in a drawer.
Replace Often
These tips should help enhance the quality and promote the longevity of your socks. However it’s important to replace your workout socks every so often—ideally every six months to a year, according to Dr. Adams.
“The materials and fibers of the socks can break down and lose their elasticity, which can cause them to lose their shape and support,” he says. “If your socks are no longer staying in place while wearing, it is time to replace them.”
Choosing the right workout sock can not only make your workout more comfortable and promote healthier feet, but it can also enhance your athletic performance. Just as you would when purchasing a shoe or clothing for exercise, consider purchasing one pair before buying in bulk so you can test them out and see if they help or harm your workout. Trust your gut, as you know what feels right and what type of sock you’ll be most inclined to reach for in your drawer before working out.

Frequently Asked Questions
Why Trust Verywell Fit
Verywell Fit/Anna Knief
Many people turn to Bombas for high-quality socks that are comfortable, sweat-wicking, and supportive. And the brand even has a generous one-for-one charitable
donation program
. But popularity and philanthropy aside, are Bombas socks really worth the hype and higher price tag?
When shopping for any pair of socks, podiatrist
Jacqueline Prevete, DPM, FACFAS, FACPM
, suggests looking for
soft materials, arch support, and moisture control.
The best Bombas socks check all these boxes (and more), making them a worthy investment for daily wear. To find which pairs stand out, we consulted experts to learn more about what key features to look for. Then, we tested dozens of options in
The Verywell Testing Lab
and in our day-to-day routines at home. We evaluated them based on
fit, comfort, cushioning, blister protection, and overall value
. A certified personal trainer from our
Review Board
also checked this article to ensure our recommendations are accurate and well-informed.
What’s the big deal with Bombas socks?
Bombas specializes in high-quality socks designed for a variety of activities. The quality speaks for itself, says personal trainer
Mike Hamlin, NSCA, CSCS
. Bombas socks use a luxe blend of moisture-wicking materials and Supima, a type of cotton with extra-long fibers that are thinner, stronger, and softer than other cotton.
The socks even feature targeted arch support and stay-up technology, enhancing their comfort. A combination of consistent comfort and commitment to philanthropy sets Bombas apart from other brands.
Are Bombas socks worth it?
With a higher price tag ranging from $10 to $28 per pair, Bombas is definitely more of an investment compared to most other sock brands. However, we found that the increased cost translates to a better experience, including
fewer blisters
, more breathability, and long-lasting durability. Bombas also offers a one-year replacement guarantee on their socks, which is a nice bonus. If comfort and giving back are important to you, then Bombas may be the better choice, Hamlin says.

Who They're For
Best if you need socks for daily wear and light exercise, like running errands or taking a long walk outside.
Why We Love Them
Bombas' Merino Wool Blend Ankle Socks
are
soft and cozy
yet still moisture-wicking, making them a solid choice for any wearer. When we first slipped them on, we noticed that the socks
fit like a glove.
The combination of
stretch and arch support makes
them ideal for daily wear, long walks, and light workouts. They're super comfy—like little blankets for your feet, one tester said.
During testing, we found that the cushioned heel tab on the back of the ankle reaches high enough to prevent blisters. And the footbed is slightly
cushioned for even more support.
We like that the wool fibers are sleek and smooth so the socks
don't itch or irritate
our feet. And the Y-stitched heel keeps them secure and in place.
Also available in men's sizes at
Bombas
.
Potential Flaws
We found these socks were not quite as breathable as others, so we don't recommend wearing them for high-intensity workouts in the heat.

Who They're For
Best for wearers who want a daily wear sock with a bit more coverage.
Why We Love Them
Higher than an ankle sock but lower than calf socks,
Bombas' Quarter Socks
are the perfect height for a variety of shoes, styles, and activities. With a fitted, quarter-height cuff and a seamless toe, these socks stay in place and don’t irritate the skin, regardless of the shoe style you're wearing. During testing, we found that the
light compression
in the toe area provides a comfy feel.
The
cushioned footbed
helps our feet feel supported, whether wearing sneakers or
walking sandals
. We never felt sweaty or itchy and had no issues with blisters, even in hot weather. These socks are
durable enough for daily wear
, and we think they're a good value if you like a mid-height sock for a bit more coverage.
Also available in men's sizes at
Bombas
.
Potential Flaws
These socks were a tiny bit snug during our test but never felt uncomfortable or restrictive.

Who They're For
Best for wearers who need a versatile sock for everyday activities and light workouts.
Why We Love Them
Bombas' Marl Ankle Socks
are ideal for daily wear and light exercise. During testing, we immediately noticed how well they fit—feeling substantial but not overly thick and
lightly compressive
but not too tight. The heel tab hits the right spot to prevent blisters and keep the socks in place while we're on the move. And some extra compression at the arch delivers
gentle support
without feeling irritating.
On test walks, we noticed that light padding throughout midfoot, heel, and toes provides a
soft landing.
And we love how luxurious the blend of cotton, polyester, and elastane feels. It's also
breathable and moisture-wicking,
preventing sweat and trapped heat. These make the perfect everyday sock for lasting comfort and support.
Also available in men’s sizes at
Dick’s Sporting Goods
and
Bombas
.
Potential Flaws
We noticed the socks moved around during intense exercise, so we recommend these for more casual wear.
Most Valuable Insight
"They are really comfortable to wear, striking a good balance of feeling substantial but not overly thick. They properly hug my feet and provide good support with that middle band, but they never feel too tight."—

Who They're For
Best if you want a versatile calf sock to wear with sandals, sneakers, or
walking boots
.
Why We Love Them
Bombas' Marl Calf Sock
is ultra comfortable and stays put all day long. The seamless design provides a smooth fit while the non-slip ankle keeps the calf-height sock up. Plus, we noticed that a Y-stitched heel offers support and a locked-in feel. Our try-on tests proved that these
fit true to size
without rubbing, friction, or blisters.
As we walked and worked out, the
mild compression
helped us feel supported (especially at the ankle). And the
soft material
has the perfect level of thickness to be versatile enough to wear alone, with sneakers, or under boots. Still, they're light enough to prevent our feet from getting overly sweaty in mild conditions.
Also available in women’s sizes at

Potential Flaws
May not be breathable enough for heavy exercise in warm weather.

Who They're For
Best if you want an ultra-light, thin sock that doesn't show under your shoes.
Why We Love Them
In warm weather, no-show socks are handy for keeping your feet comfy in shoes without sacrificing style.
Bombas' Performance No-Show
Socks
are thinner than the brand's other socks,
stopping sweat and stink
from building up in your summer walking sneakers. We loved wearing these on outdoor walks, coffee dates, and errand runs. The perforations throughout add even
more airflow.
Silicone grips help
prevent unwanted bunching
as we walk and keep the socks securely in place. Meanwhile, we found the minimal cushioning just enough to
prevent blisters
and overheating inside the sock. We think these are the perfect option for hiding inside your shoes without the bulk.
Also available in men’s sizes at
Bombas
.
Potential Flaws
For being so thin, we think these socks are a little pricey for a single pair.
Most Valuable Insight
"These are very, very thin socks, so by their very nature, they are breathable. They're great for warmer weather, or to wear under boots because they provide just enough cushioning that you don't get blisters without making your feet sweaty and gross."—

Who They're For
Best if you need
compression socks
for running, traveling, prolonged sitting, and more.
Why We Love Them
High-quality compression socks can be helpful during or after workouts, while sitting or standing for long periods, and even during pregnancy. Studies have shown that compression socks can
improve blood flow
,
speed muscle recovery
, and
relieve muscle soreness
.
One of our testers wore
Bombas' Everyday Compression Socks
after an injury to help keep swelling down and support their ankle—they worked great.
In testing, we found that these offer
medium compression
(15 to 20 mmHg) without cutting off circulation. They felt great for everyday wear, while working at our desks, or for long walks—no bunching, wrinkling, or moving around. We also like that they are
strategically cushioned
to provide support where your feet need it most. And the material is
well-padded for more comfort.
Also available in women’s sizes at
Bombas
.
Potential Flaws
These socks don't wick sweat very well during hot and intense workouts.
As with many compression socks, we found these a bit challenging to get on.
Most Valuable Insight
"The socks provide a snug and comfortable fit without being too tight or loose. They are compressive without being constrictive."—

Who They're For
Best for wearers who live and exercise in warmer climates or sweat easily.
Why We Love Them
While Merino wool might seem like an odd choice for sweaty feet,
Bombas' Running Ankle Socks
made from this material are actually
moisture-wicking
and
dry extremely quickly.
Plus, the addition of nylon and elastane delivers a breathable four-way stretch that kept our feet comfy (and blister-free) throughout testing. And light, strategic cushioning adds comfort without the bulk.
We ran, jumped, and walked in these socks to test breathability. They never slid down or bunched up, making them functional for any activity. We also found a
true-to-size fit,
feeling comfortable in all types of shoes, including sneakers and boots. The
thinner cushioning
adds breathability while still keeping our feet and shoes completely dry.
Also available in men’s sizes at

.
Potential Flaws
These socks don't have as much cushioning as other options, but we still found them comfy and supportive.

"These are probably one of my favorite pairs of socks. They fit perfectly, with no digging around the toes or sliding around the heels. They were comfortable with all of the shoes I tried them with."—
Jaylyn Pruitt, Verywell Fit product tester

Who They're For
Best for beginner to advanced runners, especially those who run outdoors.
Why We Love Them
When it comes to running, you need a well-fitting sock for optimal comfort and performance. We found
Bombas' Performance Running Quarter Socks
super soft and well-cushioned, keeping us focused for miles. They're made with
extra padding in the toe, ball of the foot, and heel
—all the high-impact areas of running—for more support. And we also like that each sock is contoured to fit your right and left foot specifically.
The ankle cuff on these quarter socks keeps them in place and keeps dirt out when
running on trails
. It is tight enough to
fit snuggly
but not cut into our skin or pinch. These socks also didn't slide down or bunch up. We wore them in hot, humid, and cold weather to find that our
feet stayed completely dry
in every condition. Our feet felt happy in these socks and we think they're a great value.
Also available in men’s sizes at
Bombas
.
Potential Flaws
These socks were very comfortable but we wish they were just a bit more breathable.
Most Valuable Insight
"I wore these socks in very hot weather, in very humid weather, and in cooler weather. My feet never once felt sweaty, itchy, in any way wet. And the socks fit perfectly."—

Who They're For
Best if you need a pair of supportive socks to fit seamlessly into your
hiking shoes
.
Why We Love Them
If you’re an avid hiker, we recommend
Bombas' Quarter Hiking Socks
for their
performance material
and
cozy comfort
. For this pair, Bombas utilized the impressive
moisture-wicking
and
quick-drying
qualities of natural Merino wool to keep you dry on trails and through the brush. On our test hikes, we also appreciated the taller cuff, which helps
prevent friction
that hiking boots can cause while also blocking debris and cold.
Hamlin wears Bombas while hiking because they keep foot fatigue and sticky sweat at bay. He also notes that they actually stay up and don't shift around, and we agree. Plus,
padding at the toe and heel
in this specific pair strikes the right balance of comfort and support (
without feeling bulky
). Along with hiking shoes, we enjoyed wearing these socks to cozy up around the house.
Also available in men’s sizes at
Bombas
.
Potential Flaws
While these socks are quarter-length, they may not be long enough for taller hiking boots.
Most Valuable Insight
"I switched between wearing these to work, wearing them with running shoes and boots, and just casually around my apartment. The comfort comes from the thickness, but not in the sense that you feel like you can't wear certain shoes with them. It's a balance that Bombas strikes very well and why I'm a fan of their socks." —

Who They're For
Best if you're looking for a plush, cashmere calf sock for cool weather wear.
Why We Love Them
For a stylish, luxurious pair of socks, you can't go wrong with
Bombas' Cashmere Blend Calf Socks
. They're made with a blend of Merino wool and cashmere that feels
buttery soft
yet still quite breathable. They glide on smoothly, offering a cozy, warm hug to our feet. And there's just enough stretch to
keep them in place
without being too tight or restrictive.
While these socks do not have a lot of cushioning, the fabric is
thick and soft
. The seamless toe keeps any irritation at bay, and the Merino wool
wicks moisture
, keeping our feet at the perfect temperature. These socks are perfect for daily activities like running errands or
walking the dog
in cool weather.
Potential Flaws
These are a bit too thick for warm weather and intense workouts.
Most Valuable Insight
"These are perfect winter socks. Absolutely perfect. I would wear these for long walks, to the store, to walk the dog, etc." —

What To Look for When Shopping for Bombas Socks
Materials:
From casual and dress socks to athletic performance pairs, Bombas makes socks using lightweight cotton and ultra-soft Merino wool. They may also use breathable polyester, nylon, or elastane to add moisture-wicking and antimicrobial properties. Fabric that wicks away sweat is particularly important for helping a sock stay in place without rubbing or chafing, Prevete says.
Fit:
The fit of a sock is more important than you might think. Feet are the first point of contact with the ground, and if your toes can't move well, you won't receive proper signals from your feet, Hamlin says. It can also impede your performance and increase your
risk of injury
. Socks that are too large can move around, slide down, or bunch up in your shoes. Our experts recommend choosing the Bombas size that corresponds with your shoe size.
Height:
Bombas socks come in various height options, including no-show, ankle, quarter, calf, and knee-high. Socks that are ankle-height or taller tend to stay above the heel counter of your shoes better, preventing rubbing and blisters around the collar, Prevete says. Shorter socks may feel cooler, making them convenient and comfortable in warm weather. Taller socks can protect against cold weather, dirt, debris, or pests (like ticks) while hiking or trail running. They can also help prevent irritation by putting a barrier between your skin and any sports gear.
Comfort and Support:
According to RRCA- and USATF-certified running coach
John Honerkamp
, socks are imperative to ensure your comfort and safety. We like the compressive arch support in all Bombas socks, which hugs your foot to keep the socks in place. A heel tab in most ankle socks prevents blisters from forming. Our experts aren’t fans of seams because shoes can press directly on a sock’s seams, causing irritation. But Bombas socks have seamless toes and a Y-stitched heel, unlike other socks’ straight stitch designs.
Activity and Purpose:
Our experts agree that you should choose socks designed for your typical activities, climate, and personal preferences. Walking, running, hiking, and other cross-training athletic activities often require highly breathable, moisture-wicking socks, Prevete says. Runners should look for additional cushioning at the ball and heel of the foot. And for recovery, compression socks can help provide relief from sore feet.
How We Tested the Best Bombas Socks
To create our list of the best Bombas socks, we tested 17 pairs in our Verywell Testing Lab and at home in our daily routines. While testing socks, we consider each of the following key attributes.
Fit:
To evaluate fit, we put the socks on and see if the toe and heel align properly. We also consider whether the socks bunch up, slide, or pinch. Does the cuff fit snugly without being too tight? Does the height of the sock match the description?
Comfort:
We pay special attention to how comfortable the socks are. How does the material feel? Is it soft or scratchy? Are there any seams or stitching that cause irritation?
Cushioning:
Socks designed for workouts should have more cushioning in high-impact areas, like the ball of the foot and heel. We consider how the cushioning level effectively absorbs impact. We also note how our feet feel after wearing the socks: Are they tired and achy? Or do they feel refreshed?
Blister Protection:
Protection from blisters is important with any sock. First, we note any specific blister protection features, like tabs on the heel or moisture-wicking fabric. Then, while wearing the socks, we note if there is any rubbing or chafing that causes hot spots or moisture accumulation.
Support:
Socks have varying levels of compression and arch support. Those with more compression and arch support are better for more active activities, like workouts, running, and long walks. You can choose a looser sock with less targeted support for daily wear and lounging.
Breathability:
Next, we assess how effectively the socks wick away moisture and keep our feet dry. We also evaluate their ability to regulate foot temperature—do our feet feel too cold or too hot? Finally, we check for any noticeable odors after washing and wearing the socks.
Overall Value:
Bombas are high-quality socks, and they can get expensive. To determine the overall value rating, we look at the cost of each pair of socks after we evaluate them for all the other features. We determine if the cost reflects the quality, performance, and personal experience with the socks.
Our Experts
We consulted experts at every stage of research, testing, and reporting for this story. Our experts provided insight and guidance on how high-quality socks should fit and function. We also asked them which Bombas socks they recommend for different needs and activities.

Frequently Asked Questions
How much should you expect to spend on Bombas socks?
Depending on the material and style, a pair of Bombas socks costs between $10 and $28. Sets are more expensive, ranging from $50 to $175, although the cost per pair is often cheaper.
Should you size up or down in Bombas socks?
According to expert feedback and results from our tests, most Bombas socks run true to size. We’ve also found that they tend to be stretchy and forgiving, offering a comfortable fit even if you’re between sizes.
How long should a pair of Bombas socks last?
We agree with experts that Bombas socks truly are made to last, depending on the amount of wear and care. To prolong the life of your Bombas socks, always follow the manufacturer’s care instructions, washing and drying as directed.

Why Trust Verywell Fit
Verywell Fit / Alena Kharlamenko
Petite leggings are typically designed for wearers 5 feet, 4 inches or shorter. However, if you're taller, with a longer torso and shorter legs, you may also notice that petite leggings fit you better than standard sizes. While countless options are available, few are high-quality, comfortable, and opaque enough to withstand long-term use,
intense workout sessions
, and frequent laundering.
To find the best petite leggings, we extensively
researched and tested dozens of pairs
from top trusted brands in
The Verywell Testing Lab
and at home, wearing them while lounging, running errands, working out, and more. We also spoke with a NASM-certified women’s fitness specialist and a dermatologist about what
key features
to look for and what to avoid when shopping for a quality pair. We then evaluated each pair of petite leggings for their
comfort, performance, care, quality, opacity, and value
to find the top options on the market. A certified personal trainer from our
Review Board
also reviewed this article to verify that our research and recommendations are thoroughly supported.

Who They're For
Best for those who want high-quality petite leggings that will hold their shape regardless of activity or how many times they're laundered.
Why We Love Them
We love Athleta gear for its true-to-size fit and high-performance materials, and
Athleta's Salutation Legging
is one of our all-time favorites for petite wearers. We love that these leggings move comfortably during
vinyasa yoga
, barre class, and when we lounge around the house. We also love that the
waistband stays firmly in place
during more intense yoga sessions. They fit so well that we never felt overly constricted while wearing them—an important feature in a versatile pair of leggings.
We didn't notice any bunching or bagging while wearing them as we ran errands. We also appreciate their thickness and durability and never worry about them ripping. Even after multiple washes, they still held their shape and showed no wear or thinning. We also love that they're flattering, proportionate, and contour nicely to our bodies. Plus, they have a
nice
balance of stretch and compression
, allowing us to feel supported whether wearing them to work or at the gym.
Potential Flaws
While these leggings are comfortable and supportive, the waist area is slightly more compressive, which we especially notice when sitting down. While they can be worn comfortably while lounging, they may work best for those who don't mind a compressive fit in the waist.
Our patterned underwear was slightly visible when we tested these while performing squats. We recommend wearing nude or black underwear if you plan to perform similar moves.
Most Valuable Insight
"I like that these seem dual purpose. They can stand up to more intensive workouts, but aren’t too athletic to feel out of place lounging around at home or while running errands."

Who They're For
Best for runners or intermediate to advanced exercisers who want a compressive petite legging that isn't overly tight and won't cause chafing.
Why We Love Them
Athleta's Ultimate Stash High Rise 7/8 Leggings
are comfortable and compressive, allowing them to work well for more intense workouts. We found them
supportive
on runs and during workouts without being too tight. They're also thick, and we felt confident wearing them to the gym while we performed squats. Plus, they're
incredibly durable and high-quality
without any thinning despite numerous washes and wears.
Whether we're working out at the gym or
running on roads
, we love that they stay put, never sagging, bunching, chafing, or pinching. We also appreciate that despite how thick and compressive they are, they still feel
extremely
breathable
and dry quickly after we work up a sweat. And they never show sweat marks, even after sweatier workout sessions.
Potential Flaws
These leggings are pricier than other options on our list, but we think their price point is well-matched by their quality.
Most Valuable Insight
"As someone who is 5'1, I love that these come in petite sizes! The length was perfect for me, and they're truly high-rise. They go on smoothly and are easy to put on. They don't dig into my belly, and they don't sag anywhere."

Who They're For
Best for those who want a flexible pair of petite leggings for practicing yoga or lounging at home in comfort.
Why We Love Them
The best yoga leggings are comfortable and flexible enough that they won't hinder your movements or distract you by rolling down or bunching up—
Beyond Yoga's Spacedye Walk And Talk High Waisted Capri Leggings
do just that. We love that they are
ultra soft and smooth
and mold to our body perfectly. Plus, we appreciate how
supportive
the high-waisted band feels without being restrictive.
From the minute we put these leggings on, we never felt like we needed—or wanted—to take them off. They were
comfortable
throughout our day and transitioned easily from yoga class to lounging in the evening. Plus, we love that these leggings offer UV protection and are
extremely breathable
, keeping us cool and comfortable during longer walks in warm weather. They never seem to sag or bunch up, and they stay comfortably in place and don't require adjusting throughout the day.
Potential Flaws
Although you can't see anything through the fabric of these leggings, underwear lines may be visible.
Most Valuable Insight
"These leggings are exceptionally comfortable. The fabric is ultra-soft and smooth. They molded to my body perfectly. They were comfortable throughout the day, whether I was doing yoga or lounging on the couch. The fabric never feels like it's cutting into my skin, no matter how I bend or twist, and I never feel or notice the seams."

Who They're For
Best for those who want a stylish pair of petite leggings that are comfortable enough to wear around the house or to a yoga class and sleek enough to wear to run errands.
Why We Love Them
The beauty of flared leggings is that they can easily transition from running errands to the yoga studio, and
Yogipace's Bootcut Yoga Pants
don't disappoint. During testing, they held up well, showing no signs of wear and tear despite how many times we laundered them. We love how
comfortable
they are, that they're
sweatproof
, and that they don't retain odors.
We like that they
retain their shape
, including in the waistband, whether we're
doing yoga
, going for a walk, completing tasks around the house, or running errands. We appreciate that they never sagged or pilled, which is a testament to their high quality. We also loved that the
wide waistband
didn't dig into our skin, while the slight fare of the leg gave a casual yet pulled-together look.
Potential Flaws
These leggings hold their shape well, but one of our testers felt they were a little tight in the crotch area, which may not work well for some.
Due to the risk of catching your foot in the flared leg, they may be better suited for lounging, yoga, walking, or running errands instead of strenuous or
high-intensity workouts.
Most Valuable Insight
"These leggings are not see-through, whether I wear them indoors or outdoors, and are very comfortable. Despite how many times I laundered them, they didn't thin out anywhere, nor pill or rip. They also don't seem to hold onto odor and are sweat-proof." —

Best for those who want a supportive, compressive pair of petite leggings with plenty of size and inseam options.
Why We Love Them
Girlfriend Collective’s Compressive High-Rise Legging
is our recommendation for petite
compression leggings
that offer
ideal support
for high-impact activities, including running,
jumping rope
, squat jumps, and more. We love that they come in a wide range of sizes and two petite inseam options, allowing you to pick a full-length or ankle-skimming fit.
Made from recycled water bottles, this garment is
squat-proof, breathable, and sweat-wicking
. It also has a
four-way stretch
that won’t lose shape, even after a long day of wear. We like that the ultra-high-rise waistband (with a hidden pocket for your keys or cards) won’t roll down, regardless of activity.
Potential Flaws
Some wearers have noticed that the fabric is on the thinner side, so your underwear lines may show.

soft and comfortable
but doesn’t skimp on high-performance features. We love that these durable, lightweight leggings are ideal for everything from CrossFit and cardio to
yoga classes

Who They're For
Best for those who want a flattering pair of petite leggings that are durable, compressive, and comfy.
Why We Love Them
For petite leggings that
contour to your body
, we recommend
Knix’s HiTouch High Rise Legging
. A wide high-rise waistband, seams in the back, and
light compression
help support your body for a flattering, comfortable fit. Plus, its thick, non-slip waistband won't roll down whether you're running, jumping, hiking, or squatting.
Made from a blend of high-performance materials, these leggings are
super
soft and breathable
. They’re also anti-chafe and have
bonded seams for extra durability
, so you can count on them not to fray or fall apart over time. We also appreciate that they come in various sizes and many color options.
Potential Flaws
These leggings don’t have pockets, which may not be ideal for some.
What to Look for When Shopping for Petite Leggings
Inseam Length:
The main feature that separates petite leggings from other pairs is the inseam length, or how long the legs are. To make sure you’re getting the right fit, we recommend measuring your own inseam so you’ll have an idea of where leggings will fall on you. In addition to petite leggings, look for leggings that come in 7/8 length, as these are ideal for petite individuals who don't want capris.
Fit:
Petite refers to height, not size. When shopping for petite leggings, first start with your typical size. You may want to size down if you want leggings with more support and compression for high-impact exercise. Consider sizing up for a looser, more relaxed fit better suited for walking and lounging. Check the brand’s size or fit guide for more details.
Materials:
Leggings are usually made from a blend of performance materials, like nylon, spandex, polyester, and elastane. These stretchy fabrics move with you and help wick away sweat to keep you dry. Material can also affect how opaque leggings are. If you’re concerned about your underwear lines or pattern showing through, look for thicker, squat-proof leggings.
Price:
The price point can vary when shopping for high-quality petite leggings. More expensive pairs may have added features, including UPF protection, multiple pockets, and four-way stretch. In contrast, more budget-friendly options may not have as many features, including pockets, moisture-wicking fabric, and more. However, price doesn’t always indicate how well each pair will perform.
Use:
Consider what activities you'll be doing while wearing your leggings. If you plan on performing high-intensity exercises, you may want to opt for a pair that's moisture-wicking and compressive. If you plan on walking, lounging, or performing lower-intensity exercises, you can choose a less compressive pair that doesn't feature as many moisture-wicking fabrics.
How We Selected and Tested the Petite Leggings
To find the best petite leggings, we extensively researched dozens of top options and carefully reviewed product specifications. We also tested some options in our Lab and at home while running, doing yoga, lounging, walking, and more. When testing petite leggings, we evaluate each pair based on the following key criteria.
Comfort:
When we evaluate the leggings, we consider how they feel against our skin, including after we've worked up a sweat. Do they keep us dry? Do they feel soft and comfortable for all-day wear? Are they overly tight? Do they roll down, pinch, or bunch up? Do we constantly have to adjust them, or do they stay in place?
Performance:
When evaluating performance, we think about how well each pair does during various activities. Are they stretchy enough to handle various workouts? Do they offer any sun protection? How much compression do they have? Are they moisture-wicking?
Care:
When we launder the leggings, we look for any signs of shrinkage and discoloration. We also note if any threads or seams unravel and if any holes form. We prioritize leggings that are easy to care for and maintain their shape and quality, no matter how many times they're laundered.
Quality:
When we evaluate quality, we note how well the leggings hold up and whether they show any signs of wear and tear. Do they perform as well as they did when we first got them? Can they be laundered without any change to their performance or appearance? Do they maintain their shape? Do they retain odor over time? We prioritize leggings that maintain their quality after continuous wear and multiple washes.
Opacity:
When evaluating for opacity, we look at to what extent the leggings are see-through when we're indoors, outdoors, running, squatting, and more. We prioritize completely opaque or nearly opaque leggings that we can comfortably wear in multiple settings and while doing various exercises.
Value:
After assessing all other key criteria, we check the price of each pair of leggings. We consider whether the price appropriately matches the quality of the legging. Would we buy them at full price? Would we only buy them on sale? We prioritize leggings with quality that exceeds their value.
Our Experts
We consulted experts at each stage of our research, testing, selection, and reporting process. The following experts helped us identify which key features to look for when shopping for high-quality petite leggings, including safe materials. While we select products independently, expert input influences our decisions.

Frequently Asked Questions
What is the length of petite leggings?
Petite leggings usually have inseams between 19.5 and 27 inches. Full-length petite leggings are often 26 inches long. Or, you can opt for a 7/8 length, which is usually 25 inches.
What is the difference between petite and regular leggings?
The only difference between petite and regular leggings is the inseam length. Regular leggings may be too long for petite wearers, but petite leggings are shorter and can prevent any bunching around your knees and ankles.
Who should wear petite leggings?
You may prefer petite leggings if regular leggings are too long for you. Petite leggings may also fit you better if you have shorter legs and a longer torso, even if you don’t normally wear petite clothing. We recommend measuring your inseam to decide which length of leggings will fit you best.
Do leggings contain BPA?
Bisphenol A (BPA) is a chemical found in some types of plastic.
In 2023, the Center for Environmental Health (CEH) announced that, after testing, it found high levels of BPA in certain activewear pieces containing polyester and spandex blends.
Dermatologist Joshua Zeichner notes that the best way to prevent BPA exposure is to make educated decisions when choosing activewear and not to wear leggings made with polyester and spandex blends for an extended period. These products have not been recalled, and the science on transdermal absorption of BPA is still not settled.

Why Trust Verywell Fit
Verywell Fit / Stella Yu
If you have naturally wide feet or they tend to
swell a lot while running
, finding the right running shoe is key to staying comfortable and pain-free. Running shoes that are too tight could lead to blisters, corns,
bruised toenails
, ingrown toenails,
toe numbness
, and an improper gait, according to podiatrist
Michelle Castiello, DPM
. Fortunately, many of the top running shoe manufacturers offer models with wide and extra-wide sizes to accommodate those who need the extra space.
To find the best running shoes for wide feet, we researched dozens of options and relied on guidance from board-certified podiatrists to learn about
what key features to look for
. We then
tested 100-plus pairs
of running shoes
on treadmills in
The Verywell Testing Lab
and during our day-to-day running routines on trails and pavement. We wore each shoe for multiple runs a week over a four-week testing period, evaluating each pair based on
fit, cushioning, comfort, responsiveness, stability,
and
value.
We also had a certified running coach from our
Review Board
review the claims in this article for accuracy.

How Do You Know If You Need Wide Running Shoes?
If you have a wide foot, you may get frequent
foot blisters
or experience discomfort, numbness, tingling, or pain when wearing a standard-width shoe. Additionally, if you feel like your toes are cramped or if you have
bunions
, hammertoes, or other foot deformities, you may need a wide-width shoe, says podiatrist
Janine Ferrigno-Taddeo, DPM
.

Our Overall Rating:
4.8/5
Who They’re For
Best for runners with neutral arches who like to run on a variety of surfaces, including pavement, concrete, track, and treadmill.
Why We Love Them
With impressive shock absorption, a wide toe box, and a responsive midsole,
New Balance’s Fresh Foam X 1080v13
stood out during our testing as a favorite for runners and walkers with wide feet. During testing, we found the shoe offered the
perfect balance of soft comfort and springiness.
The
roomy forefoot
allowed plenty of space to accommodate our tester’s bunion and didn’t lead to any tightness, rubbing, or numbness.
Additionally, the rubber outsole delivered
good traction
and
stability
when
running on roads
, sidewalks, and trails, as well as in all types of weather conditions. Plus, the plush foam padding around the collar, heel, and tongue boosted the shoe’s
ankle support.
Despite the shoe’s ample cushioning, it still felt very
lightweight and breathable.
Also available in women's sizes at
Amazon
,
Zappos
, and
Dick’s Sporting Goods
.
Potential Flaws
During testing, we noticed that the outsole was yellowing and seemed to be wearing down quickly, meaning you may need to replace these shoes more often than other pairs.
Most Valuable Insight
“I love how it fits to your feet like a glove and gives you a secure feeling while running. When my foot hits the ground, I can tell that cushioning absorbs the impact because I don't feel that pressure in the middle of my foot that I usually feel with less supportive shoes.” —

Who They’re For
Best for runners who want a lightweight, responsive shoe for short, fast runs.
Why We Love Them
If you need a reliable, everyday running shoe with a wide toe box, we recommend
Topo’s Athletic Cyclone 2
. During test runs, we immediately noticed the shoe’s
responsive cushioning
, which offered excellent shock absorption. The shoes felt
lightweight and bouncy,
making them a great option for our tempo runs and speedwork.
Meanwhile, the forefoot had plenty of room for our toes to splay, while the heel delivered a
secure, locked-in fit
. We never felt foot fatigue or discomfort when wearing them to exercise, for running errands, or when walking the dog. Additionally, we were impressed with the shoe’s
solid arch support
and durability.
Also available in women's sizes at
Amazon
,
Topo Athletic
, and
Zappos
.
Potential Flaws
We’d love to see more than just two color options.
The shoe’s lightweight feel and responsiveness make it ideal for short runs, but it may not be the best choice for
long distances
.
Most Valuable Insight
“I typically wear a standard width shoe and wearing these shoes was noticeably more comfortable. The wide toe box truly exceeded my expectations in accommodating the natural width of my feet. It will be hard to go back to my prior pair of running shoes after using these.” —

Who They’re For
Best for runners who
overpronate
, which is when the ankle rolls too far downward and inward with each step, and want a lightweight stability shoe that can do it all.
Why We Love Them
If you have wide feet and also overpronate, you can benefit from wearing a shoe with extra support, like
Asics’ GT-2000 12.
During test runs and walks, the shoe’s
firm but comfy cushioning
gently supported our arches and ankles, keeping us steady on various surfaces, including pavement, sidewalks, and packed sand. It also
effectively reduced impact,
helping to prevent pain in our knees, ankles, and shins both during and after our runs.
Available in
three widths,
this pair features a
spacious toe box
that provides plenty of room for our toes to splay during test runs and walks. The soft, breathable upper gently hugs our feet for a
snug, just-right fit.
We love these shoes for running, but their
lightweight feel and versatile style
also make them our go-to favorite for running errands.
Also available in women's sizes at
Amazon
,
Asics
, and
Zappos
.
Potential Flaws
While we loved the shoe’s shock absorption, the cushioning didn’t feel super responsive during testing.
Most Valuable Insight
“This is a well-constructed shoe with plenty of support that fits just right. It absorbed impact really well without feeling too bouncy.”
—Billy Pennant, Verywell Fit product tester
The ASICS Men’s GT-2000 12 Running Shoes offer firm arch support and help keep the feet properly aligned, thanks to their foam midsole.

These comfortable shoes have grippy rubber outsoles that can handle indoor and outdoor terrain, including sand, concrete, and more.

Who They’re For
Best for neutral runners who need a supportive shoe with good impact protection for daily training.
Why We Love Them
If you have wide feet and need a supportive, well-cushioned shoe to help
manage plantar fasciitis symptoms
, which are characterized by painful inflammation of the plantar fascia—a band of tissue that runs from your heel to your toes,
Saucony’s Ride 17
is our top pick. When testing this pair, we were impressed by its solid arch support and responsive cushioning, which felt
springy
and
soft
without being too squishy. One of our testers, who has a history of plantar fasciitis, didn’t experience any pain or discomfort both during and after runs.
The shoe comes in wide sizes, and we found its
roomy fit
allowed for good lateral stability and helped prevent cramping and rubbing. Even with its substantial cushioning and sole, we were pleased that this pair felt
breathable
and
not
overly heavy or bulky.
Although they’re designed for running, these shoes also proved very comfortable and supportive for fitness walks and studio workout classes.
Also available in men's sizes at
Amazon
,
Zappos
, and
Saucony
.
Potential Flaws
During testing, we found the tread was low and very smooth, so this pair may not be the best option for running in wet conditions.
Most Valuable Insight
“The cushioning gives you a feeling of being propelled forward, and I was surprised by how good I felt after a longer run in these. I found myself also reaching for these on my daily walks. The springy soles made my two- to three-mile route a pleasure.”

Who They’re For
Best if you need a walking or running stability shoe that’s comfortable enough for all-day wear.
Why We Love Them
If you need a shoe that suits flat, wide feet,
Hoka’s Gaviota 5 Running Shoe
is a standout choice for its well-cushioned midsole that excels in comfort and shock absorption. During testing, we observed an
impressively stable base,
thanks to the
wide toe box
and
deep heel support.
Hoka’s stabilizing H-frame design, a stability feature designed to prevent excessive inward rolling of the foot when it strikes the ground, is particularly beneficial for individuals who overpronate.
The shoe's snug and secure fit also stood out during testing, providing a
locked-in feel
without any slipping, sliding, or rubbing. We felt like we were
running on clouds
as we transitioned between a variety of terrain, including pavement, concrete, and grass. Plus, the plush, padded collar and tongue
enhanced the overall support and comfort.
Also available in women’s sizes at
Hoka
,
Dick’s Sporting Goods
, and
REI
.
Potential Flaws
All the stability and support come with a heavier weight, so this pick isn’t the best option for speedwork.
Most Valuable Insight
“Stability is one of the many places this shoe excels. The support is unparalleled, with excellent heel support and a great curve to the bottom of the shoe. I always feel like I'm running in the shoe, not on it. This is exactly why the Gaviotas are going to be my training shoe of choice from now on.”
—Ryan Savini, Verywell Fit product tester
This supportive shoe features H-Frame technology, which helps prevent the ankles from rolling inward.

Who They’re For
Best for neutral runners who want a comfy, lightweight shoe with good shock absorption for pounding the pavement.
Why We Love Them
Altra’s Experience Flow
offers plush cushioning and reliable impact protection that make it an excellent choice
for road running. During testing, we were impressed with the shoe’s
wide, foot-shaped toe box,
which offered plenty of room and didn’t cramp our wide feet at all, offering a secure, comfy fit. The
soft but responsive cushioning
delivered comfortable support and impact protection for runs and walks on pavement or sidewalks.
The shoes felt
extremely lightweight,
so we were able to run in and wear them for extended periods without any pain or fatigue in our joints or feet. We also liked that the
rocker shape helped propel us forward,
allowing for a springy, efficient stride that felt easier than our usual runs. Plus, the shoe’s
soft,
breathable mesh
kept our feet cool and odor-free.

We liked that the shoe’s rocker sole encouraged a smooth running stride, but the design might not be stable enough for gym workouts like weightlifting (opt for a pair of
weightlifting shoes
instead).
This pair is designed for neutral runners, so it may not be supportive enough if you have flat feet.
Most Valuable Insight
“These shoes are extremely comfortable, had a great fit that accommodated my wide feet, and are lightweight, which helps you move more efficiently and takes the strain off of the body. I would definitely recommend these to anyone with a wide foot who runs, walks a lot, and is on their feet all day.” —

Who They’re For
Best for overpronators who want a supportive, responsive running shoe.
Why We Love Them
If you need a wide running shoe that also offers supportive cushioning and good stability,
Brooks’ Glycerin GTS 21
is an excellent choice. During testing, the shoe’s
stable design
cradled our feet and
helped keep excess movement in check.
Meanwhile, the plush midsole offered a pillow-like feel that
significantly reduced impact
and spared our feet and joints from pain.
The shoe’s responsiveness allowed for a
springy stride
and
quick transitions,
keeping our legs feeling fresh during runs. We also liked that the
breathable mesh upper
conformed to the shape of our feet and provided structure, while also offering enough flexibility to move with it. And our toes didn’t feel cramped or jammed up front, thanks to the
wide forefoot.

Potential Flaws
These shoes seem to run small in length, so you may want to size up if you’re in between sizes.
Most Valuable Insight
“These shoes are incredibly supportive and also propel you. I think they're a great shoe for people with a wider foot or those looking for something incredibly stable.” —

Who They’re For
Best for trail runners who want a secure, comfortable shoe that’s also versatile for road running or hiking.
Why We Love Them
Trail runners with wide feet
need shoes with a secure, accurate fit, so they can stay steady while tackling rough terrain and hills.
Inov8’s TrailFly Trail Running Shoes
comes in wide sizes and feature a wide toe box, providing plenty of room for toes to react and splay for a more stable ride. During testing, we noted that the shoes felt snug throughout the heel and midfoot, but wide around the toes, which resulted in a
locked-in, comfy fit.
We also found that this pair helped keep our heel pain at bay, thanks to its
plush but supportive
cushioning.
The shoe’s grippy outsole kept us stable and confident when running on uneven and rocky surfaces. We love how this pair has the right support and traction for trail running but is also versatile for road running or light hiking.
Also available in women's sizes at
Inov8
and
Zappos
.
Potential Flaws
While we like the TrailFly’s comfort and performance, this pair isn’t very stylish or suitable for casual wear.
Most Valuable Insight
“I wore the shoes nearly every day during the testing period because they became my favorite shoes. The wide toe boxes have plenty of room for my bunions, and I didn't experience heel pain while walking or standing like I often do with other shoes.” —

Who They’re For
Best for runners and walkers who want a soft, springy shoe that works for all distances.
Why We Love Them
Altra’s Via Olympus 2
offers the perfect combination of plush cushioning and lightweight support—making it a great option for avid runners and walkers. The shoe’s foot-shaped design offered lots of room for toes to spread out, with a
snug, comfortable
fit
that didn’t cause any sliding. We also like that the Via Olympus 2, like other Altra shoes, has a zero heel-to-toe drop, so the
comfort and support are balanced
through your entire foot.
We noticed that the
soft yet supportive midsole
combined with the gentle rocker shape effectively propelled us forward with each stride. Even though it’s a maximum cushioned shoe, running in this pair felt
easy and effortless.
We didn’t notice any pain in our knees, hips, or back during or after runs.
Also available in women's sizes at
Amazon
,
Altra
, and

Potential Flaws
If you are used to a high heel-to-toe drop, the Via Olympus 2’s
zero drop may take some getting used to.
Most Valuable Insight
“These shoes are comfortable, pillow-like, and supportive. There is plenty of room at the front of the shoes to prevent my toes from slamming into the end with each stride or change of direction.” —

Who They’re For
Best for
neutral runners
who want a well-cushioned shoe that can withstand the pounding of long runs on pavement or sidewalks.
Why We Love Them
Brooks’ Ghost 16 running shoes
offer soft cushioning and a smooth ride that make them a fan favorite for distance running. When testing this shoe, we were impressed by its
exceptional support
and
shock absorption,
which kept our feet and joints protected and pain-free. Our legs didn’t feel tired or overwhelmed with fatigue after runs.
This pair also features
a spacious toe box
and wide sizes that help prevent blisters, bunions, and other foot issues common among distance runners with wide feet. We also like the
soft, breathable,
and
stretchy upper
that conformed to the shape of our feet, keeping our feet comfortable and cool during long runs. Although this shoe is ideal for road running, we also found it to be stable when running on other terrain, including grass or sand.
Also available in men's sizes at
Amazon
,
Brooks
, and
Dick’s Sporting Goods
.
Potential Flaws
While we liked the shoe’s cushioning for its impact protection, it didn’t feel as responsive as some other shoes we tested.
Most Valuable Insight
“I finally feel like I found a shoe that's true to size for my foot shape, so I have maximum support and comfort. The toe box is accommodating to wide feet without looking like clown shoes, and my heel is secure in place, so I never felt like my feet were flying around in my shoe.” —

What We’ve Updated
We consulted
two new experts
(a podiatrist and physical therapist) to make sure our advice on choosing the best running shoes for wide feet is up to date.
We’ve updated our product picks based on
new shoe models
that have been released. We’ve tested updated versions for three of our shoes and tested seven additional pairs that are new to our list.
Based on our most recent testing and observations on shoe design and performance, we’ve
reworked all of our superlatives.
What to Look for in Running Shoes for Wide Feet
Width Options:
Running shoes are typically described as narrow, medium, wide, or extra-wide widths. You may also see shoe widths represented as letters, such as DD (wide for women), E (extra-wide for women, wide for men), and EE (extra-wide for men). When shopping, keep in mind that shoe companies often cut their shoes differently, so don’t assume that sizes and widths will be the same across various brands, says Castiello.
Proper Fit:
When
trying on running shoes
, be sure to measure not just the length of your foot but also the width, says Ferrigno-Taddeo. You should have enough space in the toe box, about a half-inch, so your toes don’t hit the front of the shoe. Most runners, especially those with wide feet, need to go up at least a half-size since your feet swell while running. Additionally, the heel should fit snugly without any slipping or rubbing.
Toe Box Shape:
It’s important that the shoe toe box is wide enough to accommodate your foot, but the toe box’s shape is also crucial for getting the best fit. Look for a toe box that matches the natural shape of your foot. You should also opt for shoes with a mesh or soft leather upper so they will stretch over the increased width of your forefoot, recommends podiatrist
Julie Schottenstein, DPM
.
Running Style:
Your running style or gait is another important consideration when choosing the right running shoe. Runners with flat feet or low arches are more likely to overpronate, and stability shoes can offer stiff
arch support
to lightly control the inward rolling of their feet.
High-arched runners tend to underpronate, or roll outward, so they’ll want a neutral running shoe with supportive cushioning (especially in the arch area) for improved shock absorption. Those with regular arches typically have a neutral gait and can choose a neutral running shoe.
Terrain:
You’ll definitely want to consider what surfaces you’ll be running on to choose the right running shoes for you. If you typically run on the treadmill, look for running shoes that are lightweight, breathable, and responsive. For running on pavement, you’ll want a pair that’s light and flexible but also well-cushioned for impact protection. Meanwhile, trail running requires soles with rugged traction and lugs, or cleats, to grip the uneven surfaces, says Castiello.
How We Tested the Running Shoes for Wide Feet
To find the best running shoes for wide feet,
we tested over 100 pairs
from top, trusted footwear brands on treadmills, roads, trails, and more. When testing running shoes, we evaluate each pair based on the following key criteria.
Fit:
When first trying on the shoes, we assess whether the toe box is wide enough to accommodate the natural shape and width of our feet. During test runs or walks, do we notice any rubbing, tingling, numbness, or irritation? We also determine whether the shoe feels secure and if our feet feel like they’re sliding around.
Comfort:
We assess how the shoe’s width contributes to the overall comfort of the shoes and note if our toes feel jammed or crowded. Are we able to run or walk in the shoes without any foot fatigue or discomfort? How does the upper material feel? Is it breathable, and do we notice any pressure points, rubbing, or irritating seams? We also note if the shoe’s cushioning and support meet our expectations for all-day comfort.
Cushioning
: During our test walks and runs,
we assess how the cushioning feels. Is it plush or firm? How well does it absorb impact when our feet hit the ground? Do we notice any pain, discomfort, or fatigue in our joints, legs, and feet? If there’s any extra padding underneath the heel, in the tongue, or around the ankle collar, we note that, too.
Responsiveness:
During test walks and runs, we pay attention to each shoe’s level of responsiveness, or how well it propels us forward. Does the shoe feel springy when pushing off? Does it feel like a quick or slow transition to the next stride? Shoes earn high scores if they leave our feet and legs refreshed, instead of tired, after running in them.
Stability:
To assess for stability, we run and walk on a variety of surfaces (treadmills, pavement, trails, and more) and note whether we feel any knee or ankle instability. Is the arch support adequate, and does it help promote a natural gait? How deep is the heel cup—is there enough support and shock absorption in that area? We prioritize shoes that help us feel steady and balanced on varied terrain.
Value:
To fairly and accurately assess each pair’s value, we don't check the price until our testing is complete and we’ve evaluated it in all other areas. We determine whether we’d pay the shoes’ price or possibly more for them. Would we only buy them at a discounted price? We also consider how likely we are to use the shoes regularly and if we’d recommend them to others.
Our Experts
We consulted podiatrists and other foot experts to help us identify which key features to look for in running shoes for runners with wide feet and which to avoid. We also noted specific brands of shoes they recommend for runners with wide feet. Read on for more about our experts.

Frequently Asked Questions
What happens if your running shoe is too wide?
If your running shoe is too wide, your feet will slide around inside the shoe, which can lead to painful irritation and blisters. Too much movement may also lead to an increased risk of ankle or
foot injuries
, so it’s important to make sure your running shoes offer a snug and secure fit.
Which brand of running shoe is best for wide feet?
While most major running shoe brands offer some options for wide feet, New Balance and Brooks are well-known for their extensive range of sizes and widths. If you have wide feet and are looking for high-quality, durable shoes for running or walking, both brands are an excellent place to start your search.

It wasn't too far in the distant past when the options for athleticwear were fairly limited — cotton t-shirts, mesh athletic shorts, and heavy sweats were the typical options. And while certainly, many people still choose these items when hitting the gym or the streets for a quick workout, the availability of performance activewear has expanded exponentially. In fact, there's a wealth of science to back the improved cuts, styles, and high-tech fabrics
that fill stores like Nike, Lululemon, and even Amazon.
Of course, with more athleticwear options to choose between, deciding which products are best for which activities can be a little confusing. That said, there are legitimate reasons to opt for joggers over yoga pants or tights over sweatpants. Part of this comes down to exercise location and weather conditions — you don't want to be caught wearing heavy cotton sweatpants for an outdoor run in a downpour or a heatwave, after all.
And part of it comes down to activity. Looser, more "comfy" athletic wear tends to be more appropriate for lower-intensity exercise, while form-fitting gear with performance features like four-way stretch, odor-resistance, and sweat-wicking material is ideal for higher-intensity workouts.
So if you've ever wondered what the differences are between joggers, sweatpants, yoga pants, leggings, and tights ... and when you should use each one ... this is the explainer you've been waiting for.
Terminology Cheat Sheet
Jogger:
Typically made of a thicker fabric and have an elastic band at the ankles, giving them a tapered look.
Sweatpants:
Made of thicker fabric, but have a looser, relaxed fit, with or without elastic bands at the ankles and waist.
Yoga pants:
Feature a high waistband for comfort and are made of stretchy, moisture-wicking fabric.
Leggings:
Similar to yoga pants, but more form-fitting and thinner. Typically made of spandex or similar material.
Tights:
The thinnest material and most form-fitting.
Joggers
Getty Images / DGBULBUL
Joggers
are like a modern update to old-school sweatpants, straddling the divide between activewear and leisure wear. These pants tend to be looser at the hips and thighs, tapering to the ankles. Sometimes they're heavier, made of cotton or cotton blends for colder temperatures, and sometimes they're constructed of lighter-weight fabrics and performance fabric blends that are more suitable for moderate temperatures and indoor activities.
Joggers almost always have pockets, which is a handy feature for carrying phones, keys, and credit cards when out for a walk, although they frequently don't zip up. This makes the pockets' functionality less helpful during higher-intensity exercises like jogging or workouts that involve jumping or changing direction. They also usually have an elastic waistband that may or may not be equipped with a drawstring for a better fit.
Best Suited for:
Joggers can be used for a wide range of activities
, particularly when they're constructed with fabrics that offer high-performance features like breathability, odor resistance, and quick-drying materials. That said, they tend to be best suited for lighter forms of exercise, like walking or jogging, simple gym workouts, or even casual wear to run errands or lounge around the house. You may not want to use joggers during activities that require a wider range of motion, like yoga, or
high-intensity interval training (HIIT) routines
that require quick changes of direction. This is because joggers' looser fit and sometimes heavy fabrics can make these movements and exercises harder and less comfortable to perform.
Sweatpants

Sweatpants
are one of the OGs of athletic apparel, and chances are you have a few pairs already in your closet. While they can be comfortable and helpful during colder weather conditions, they're actually not one of the best options when it comes to high-performance activities. While there are various styles out there, most have a loose fit from the hips to the ankles, and may or may not feature elastic ankle cuffs.
The waistbands on sweatpants are almost always elastic with a drawstring to help keep them in place, and they're typically made of a heavier fabric that's soft and comfortable — like a cotton or cotton blend. They tend to have fewer performance-focused features, and due to their heavier construction, may not offer the breathability or sweat-wicking, quick-drying materials that are useful during high-intensity workouts.
Best Suited for:
Generally speaking, you should reserve sweatpants for outdoor, cold weather exercise or instances where you need an extra layer to help you get and stay warm during the warm-up and cool-down portions of your workout. They're not ideal for workouts where you'll be sweating heavily or need to move freely, as they can be bulky and hot.
You can also wear sweatpants for casual wear as they're typically very comfortable.
Yoga Pants
Verywell / Nick Kova
Yoga pants are incredibly popular for exercise and casual activities, and what may not be common knowledge, they're widely available in
men's yoga pants
and
women's yoga pants styles
. These pants are almost always fitted, featuring a wide waistband that may cut at the hips or be "high," cutting above the belly button. In some cases, the waistband is a "fold over" style that allows the user to choose a higher or lower fit. The stand-out features of yoga pants are their stretchy material (four-way stretch is a common descriptor, typically made of an elastane or spandex blend
), and their breathability. This enables you to move easily between
different stretches or poses
without feeling restricted and helps keep you dry and odor-free during your workouts.
Yoga pants can come in different lengths and cuts, but most typically are sold as full-length pants with a straight leg or a
flared fit
through the calves and ankles.
Best Suited for:
The most common use of yoga pants is right there in the name — yoga classes. That said, they're appropriate for other similar routines, like Pilates, stretching classes, or barre workouts. And there's no reason you shouldn't throw on a pair of yoga pants for lower-impact exercises like walking, weight machine circuits, or hula hooping.
One other common use for yoga pants is as casual athleisure wear. Yoga pants come in a wide variety of styles and colors, so stocking up your wardrobe to use yoga pants on the weekend or while traveling is a great idea. This is especially true if your after-hours activities tend to keep you on your feet and moving. Yoga pants can move with you while still giving you the chance to show off your personal style.
Leggings
Verywell / Jessica Juliao
Yoga pants,
leggings
, and tights are words frequently used interchangeably to describe longer, fitted athletic pants, but there are some legitimate differences between the styles. Leggings, like yoga pants, tend to feature a fitted, wide waistband that may sit high or low through the hips and waist. That said, the waistband on leggings typically isn't a "fold over" style.
Also like yoga pants, leggings are fitted and made of stretchy, breathable materials, so they're also a good
gift option for yoga
and workout enthusiasts. These are often made from spandex-cotton blends, or other blended materials like silk, bamboo, or merino wool to naturally maximize odor-resistance and sweat-wicking performance.
Lululemon leggings
, for example, are well-known for their proprietary moisture-wicking fabrics. They may also offer additional features like hidden pockets to carry a phone or keys, mesh inlays to improve airflow, and various levels of compression to maximize blood flow.
Many of these features are available in other
quality leggings on Amazon
, often at more affordable prices.
One thing to note about leggings is they often come in different lengths — they may be full-length (intended to reach all the way to the ankles), 7/8 length (intended to reach 7/8 of the way down the leg, typically ending just above the ankles), or cropped (typically cutting at or above the calf). They also tend to be moderately weighted (not too thin), which makes them a good choice for a wide range of activities—great to wear under
ankle weights
. That said, some versions are heavier, making them a great option for outdoor workouts or a base layer during winter activities. The
best legging brands
offer a wide range of options. For wearers 5 feet, 4 inches and under, or who have a long torso and short legs,
petite leggings
are a great option.
Best Suited for:
Leggings are ideal for a wide variety of activities thanks to their varied lengths, varied weights, and varied performance features. For this reason, they are an excellent option if you want to give someone
a good wellness gift
. They're ideal for indoor and outdoor workouts, particularly those that will make you break a sweat, like running, cardio, cycling, or general gym-based routines.
Alo leggings
, for instance, can take you from the studio and gym to the street. Heavier versions, or those constructed from fabrics like merino wool, are ideal for maintaining warmth while providing sweat-wicking, quick-drying features.
Like yoga pants, leggings come in many different colors, designs, and styles, so they're also perfect to use as casual athleisure attire.
Tights
Verywell / Jessica Juliao
Tights, once again, are often confused with yoga pants and leggings, but if you're looking for a phrase to differentiate tights from the other categories, "high-intensity performance" just might be it. Interestingly, some of
the best running leggings
are actually tights. Like the other categories, tights tend to be fitted with a wide waistband, but their material is often much thinner, which lends itself to being particularly stretchy, too. Tights are also often used as a base layer for cold weather workouts, so they tend to be 7/8-length or full-length, reaching to the ankles or even lower. This is different from leggings, which are frequently found in shorter calf- or knee-length options.
Tights also tend to be constructed of high-performance fabric blends with features ideal for higher-intensity workouts like zippable hidden pockets, cell phone sleeves, and sometimes a drawstring waistband to prevent the waist from falling during higher-intensity exercise.
Best Suited for:
Tights are ideal for high-intensity workouts like HIIT, CrossFit, outdoor running, or cycling. You can also layer them under shorts or sweatpants during cold, outdoor exercise to help improve warmth while wicking sweat and reducing the likelihood of chafing.
Tights tend to be less suitable for casual wear due to their thinner construction. It's best to save them for your tougher workouts and turn to leggings or yoga pants for errand-running Saturday mornings.
The Bottom Line
Given the wide availability of athletic attire, features, and styles, it's important to be well-versed in the different options so you can purchase the workout pants best suited for your needs. That said, many options are interchangeable or can double as exercise apparel and leisure attire. As such, it's best to choose the styles you like most with the performance features you most need. This will give you the most flexibility when it comes to choosing specific pants for each of your exercise routines.

Frequently Asked Questions
Why Trust Verywell Fit
Verywell Fit / Joy Kim
Finding
a reliable pair of walking shoes
is only half the battle. Without high-quality socks, moisture starts to build up in your shoes while you walk, causing athlete's foot and unwanted odors, says podiatric surgeon
Diana Valencia, DPM
. Add friction, and you're left with
painful blisters
, too. The best walking socks are comfortable, supportive, and sweat-wicking to keep your feet cool and dry.
Valencia says that when choosing walking socks, it's important to consider which materials they're made of. Other key features include a snug fit and a budget-friendly price tag. To find the top walking socks, we first asked experts like Valencia for tips on
what to look for
when shopping. Then, we
tested 27 expert-approved pairs of walking socks
in the
Verywell Testing Lab
and the real world. Our favorite pairs earned high scores for their impressive
fit, comfort, cushioning, blister protection, and value.
We also had a certified personal trainer from our
Review Board
review this story for accuracy and the best way to evaluate walking socks.

Who They're For
Best if you prefer a thick, well-cushioned sock for cozy comfort, especially if you live in a colder climate.
Why We Love Them
Given their
high-quality
and
budget-friendly price,
Asics' Cushion Socks
could have doubled as our best budget pick. But the socks earned a perfect score of 5 out of 5 in all of the key categories we tested for, making them an obvious choice for our best overall slot. The socks
excelled compared to all other socks
we tested—even their more expensive counterparts.
We also loved the socks’
comfy cushion
and
moisture-wicking materials,
great for added support and blister protection. They kept our feet
warm and cozy
without any overheating or excess sweating. This pair is also super budget-friendly, making it an even better value.
Snug but not too tight,
the pair provided the perfect fit.

Who They're For
People who have issues with sweaty feet will appreciate the cool comfort of these walking socks.
Why We Love Them
These
Saucony Women's Performance Heel and Tab Performance Socks
are not only
budget-friendly,
but we found that these socks helped us
say goodbye to
sweaty feet
.
Our feet remained
cool and comfortable
with each step and stride in these
delightfully comfortable
walking socks.
We also appreciated that these socks provided enough
cushioning to keep our feet stress-free,
but did not bunch or feel bulky in our shoes. Plus, we were pleasantly surprised that we remained
blister-free
even after long walks in these socks.
Available in an eight-pack, the Saucony Heel Tab Socks come out to less than $2 per sock—an amazing overall value. And they also excel in quality and comfort.
Potential Flaws
Although we found the socks to be generally comfortable, the heel tab did hit at an awkward spot on the ankle, so it might not be the perfect fit for everyone.

Who They're For
Best if you have sweaty feet, prefer a thin and lightweight sock, or live in warm weather.
Why We Love Them
lululemon’s Power Stride Socks
are
super lightweight,
making them the perfect choice for those with sweaty feet. Plus, they’re made from
breathable, moisture-wicking materials
for added
odor and blister prevention.
They’ll keep you cool and comfortable, even in the hottest summer months. The socks are
supportive but not overly thick
or padded. And we appreciate the
added support in the ankle
and heel areas.
In fact, these lululemon socks are one of the most
comfortable
pairs of socks we have ever worn—so comfortable that they felt
like a second skin
during
long, sweaty strolls
. With a perfect fit, these socks offer
solid stretch and comfortable compression.
The lightweight, versatile socks are great for gym and everyday wear—similar to the
leggings the brand is known for
—in addition to walking.
Potential Flaws
These socks are on the higher end of the price spectrum.
While these socks keep your feet cool and comfortable, they may not be suited for winter months or cold weather.

Who They're For
People who spend a lot of time walking or tend to log a lot of miles will appreciate these cushioned and supportive socks that protect against blisters.
Why We Love Them
When you’re walking for miles, comfort, support, and blister protection are essential. That’s why
Wrightsock’s Endurance Crew
is
perfect for long-distance walks.
Impressed by its
fit and comfort
, we found the socks to have
plenty of arch support and cushioning
without any uncomfortable bunching in the shoe.
On a long-distance trek, you need support in all the right places—this pair delivers just that. The socks are also
double-layered,
which provides extra padding and
protection against blisters.
Potential Flaws
The one downside of this feature is that it may lead to hot spots, especially for those with sweaty feet or when walking in warmer climates.

Who They're For
Avid walkers, runners, or weightlifters looking for a high-quality sock that will last will fall in love with these comfy and breathable versatile socks.
Why We Love Them
Great for walking, running, working out, and even all-day wear,
Balega’s Hidden Comfort No-Show Socks
were an
easy choice for our most versatile pick.
The socks are
cushioned yet breathable
(which is a balance that can be hard to find). We appreciate that the socks
can tolerate most activities
and outdoor weather conditions.
The socks’
contoured fit
provided comfort, while the heel tab helped with
blister protection.
Delivering
support in all the right places
, these socks felt
comfy and cushy.
And the top mesh construction allowed for
optimal ventilation and breathability,
regardless of climate.
Potential Flaws
The price per pair is rather high, but for a versatile, high-quality sock, we think these socks are worth the investment.

Who They're For
Anyone planning to travel or a walking adventure would be wise to snag a pair of these comfortable and supportive walking socks.
Why We Love Them
We appreciated how
comfortable and supported
we felt walking miles in
Bombas’ Ankle Socks
. We found these socks to be the
perfect companion for all of our adventures.
We found them to be
comfortable, durable, and top-notch quality.
The socks
deliver cushioning
to areas of the foot that often require additional support, like the heels and toes. It’s important to have this kind of foot support while traveling because you never know how long or far your journey will take you.
Soft enough to wear to sleep
, we found these socks to feel like
mini blankets for the feet.
Potential Flaws
Although the socks are extremely cozy and comfortable, they don’t offer great breathability or ventilation, making them less suitable for warmer weather.

Who They're For
People who enjoy the outdoors—especially in colder weather—will fall in love with these wool performance socks that work double-time to keep feet warm and dry.
Why We Love Them
Whether you’re traveling to the mountains, hiking the backcountry, or living in a cooler climate, a quality pair of
wool socks
is essential when dressing for
cold weather walking
.
Darn Tough’s Light Hiker Micro Crew Socks
feature a combination of wool and
performance materials
that kept us
warm and dry
on all of our chilly outdoor adventures.
Snug but not too tight,
these socks provided
cozy comfort without excess overheating.
We also appreciate that while not super cushioned, the socks
deliver enough support for long, hilly walks.
Potential Flaws
These socks are undeniably expensive, but we think it's worth it because of the socks' long-lasting durability and lifetime warranty.
It is important to note that Darn Tough’s socks may be too thick for hot climates—when worn in warmer weather, our feet did overheat.

Who They're For
These socks are ideal for anyone who wants cozy comfort combined with good shock absorption from their cushioned walking socks.
Why We Love Them
Socks with
extra cushion
often
provide additional protection
for high-impact areas,
good shock absorption,
plush comfort, and
welcoming warmth.
Thorlos’ Max Cushion Distance Walking Socks
feature
thick padding in the heel,
forefoot, and top of the arch—helping to
reduce blisters, pain, and pressure.
During test walks, we felt
secure and supported
in these socks because of their
extreme cushioning.
The heel part especially had a very thick and supportive cushion which was really comfortable. Ideal for outdoor walking during cold winter months, we like these socks for
snug warmth and cozy comfort.
Potential Flaws
Because these socks are thicker than other options, we did find that they felt a little bulky and may not be suited for warmer weather.
These socks are expensive, but we think they're well worth it for their heavy-duty, durable design.

Who They're For
Those who frequently hike or take long walking adventures will fall in love with these comfortable and warm socks the help prevent blisters, keep the feet dry, and stay in place.
Why We Love Them
Whether your next outdoor adventure includes hiking or backpacking, choose a pair of socks that will
prevent blisters and hot spots
and
won’t slip down or bunch up
.
Darn Tough’s Coolmax Socks
do just that; they’re also super
cozy, comfortable, and cushioned.
We found this pair of socks to be a perfect fit for any hiking boot—added thickness
provides light warmth,
and the crew height
prevents uncomfortable chafing.
While insulated, these socks will still
keep your feet dry and temperature-regulated.
The thickness and cushion are also great for additional support while hiking on rocky trails and
hilly terrains
.
Potential Flaws
While the price per pair is high, we still think the durable, protective, and supportive socks are worth every penny.

Who They're For
These socks are ideal for people who wear low-cut hiking boots or do a lot of walking and are looking for a wool sock that stays in place.
Why We Love Them
From the moment we donned these walking
Smartwool Hike Light Cushion Socks
, we fell in love with the
fabulous fit,
with no
extra fabric bunching up or uncomfortable seams.
We also love that this sock comes in so
many different sizes,
which is probably why it
fits so well.
Too many times, walking socks come in limited sizes.
We also appreciate that these socks
stay in place
no matter whether we were wearing sneakers or boots, or just wearing the socks by themselves around the house. And, the
noticeable arch support
comforted our feet while keeping them
warm and cozy.
Potential Flaws
There was some pilling on the bottom of the sock, but not enough to affect our passion for these walking socks.

Who They're For
Anyone looking for waterproof socks that not only wick away moisture but also repel water will appreciate these cozy yet durable socks.
Why We Love Them
Waterproof socks have dual action—they
wick away excess moisture
from the inside and
repel water from the outside
environment. So whether you deal with sweaty feet or walk in damp areas,
Sealskinz’s Mid-Length Socks
are a great option.
We love that these socks feature a
unique three-layer construction
for
optimal insulation, durability, and moisture control
. We also appreciated that these socks
conformed to our feet
and provided just the
right amount of cushioning
during test walks. But, these socks are best for cold weather, providing an
extra layer of warmth and coziness
to the feet.
Potential Flaws
Used in warm weather, these socks may generate some excess heat inside the shoe. But because of their thick three-layered construction and waterproofing design, your feet will remain dry and blister-free.

Who They're For
People who are looking for a breathable, versatile pair of walking socks that prevent odor and stay in place will appreciate these comfy socks.
Why We Love Them
We appreciate the
great fit
these
Nike Everyday Socks
provide. They are
not overly tight
and yet still
stay in place.
While testing these socks, they kept our feet warm even during the colder months, and the
heel lines up perfectly with the toes
without any uncomfortable seams—a rare find in some walking socks.
We appreciate the
heel support and extra cushioning
these socks provide as well as how they
kept our feet as dry as possible
when running or doing any heavy-duty activities. Plus, the band around the arch provided just the
right amount of compression
and gave us
great stability
during our long runs and squat workouts. We also loved that the knit pattern helped with
ventilation and odor prevention.
Potential Flaws
There is not much to dislike about these socks, but we would like to see more colorways, especially since the white can get dirty more easily.

Who They're For
Anyone who prioritizes the fit of their socks and wants to avoid loose or baggy socks will find these Alo socks the perfect pick.
Why We Love Them
These
Alo Yoga Halfcrew Throwback Socks
are a dream—the
fit is soft and close,
but not so much that they leave marks or hurt our feet. We especially liked that these socks
fit like fluffy gloves
for our feet that
kept them free of blisters.
Plus, the toe-through-the-heel fit cupped around the contours of our feet perfectly.
As a bonus, these socks
offer great padding
on the bottom of the foot and all around. We also appreciated the height of the sock, too—it's a
perfect half-crew length
that hits above our ankle for warmth without going all the way up the calf. And the socks
hold their shape
well without becoming loose or baggy.
Potential Flaws
If you need a sock for stability while walking, these probably aren't the ones for you. But if you have a neutral foot and a neutral gait and your shoes are supportive, then these are great socks.
These socks also lack a compressive arch. They do function well without it, but if this kind of support is a priority for you, you may want to pick a more supportive one on our list.
Walking Socks We Also Tested
We tested 32 pairs of walking socks, but we only included 13 in our final list of recommendations. While these didn’t make our top picks list, our testers did highlight some valuable features.
We love the contoured fit of
Under Armour’s Women’s Essential No Show Socks
, but when compared to other socks from the brand, this pair felt thin—lacking comfort and cushion for support and long-term blister protection.
We fell in love with the well-designed heel of the
Allbirds Anytime Crew Sock
. They stayed on the heel of our feet and never shifted around or off our foot—which is a fantastic feature for a walking sock. But these socks aren't particularly soft and did start to show some wear after a few washes.
Uniqlo's Colorful Socks
performed well when it came to moisture-wicking capabilities, but they fell short in every other category and started to fray as soon as we put them on.
The right walking socks can provide cushioning, prevent blisters, and absorb sweat.
Verywell Fit / Sarah Felbin
What to Look for When Shopping for Walking Socks
Fit:
More often than not, walking socks have an anatomical fit—meaning they have a left and a right sock. Each one is stitched to perfectly fit the shape of each foot so that it doesn’t slide around and provides support in the right areas. Choose a walking sock thin enough to fit in your shoe comfortably. And, if you’re on the cusp of a size recommendation, our experts suggest sizing up.
Support:
Finding support for your feet when walking goes beyond the shoes you wear. Socks can also provide moderate support to minimize pain or discomfort when engaging in physical activity. Check for padding on the instep, heel, and sole before buying a pair. Look for socks with varying degrees of compression in the mid-foot that leave your arch feeling supported.
Material:
The material of your walking socks plays a major role in how well they breathe, their moisture-wicking properties, and how they feel in your shoes. Select a pair made with synthetic materials that draw moisture away from your skin and help fight against blisters. Look for blends of polyester, nylon, and spandex, as they’re lightweight and breathable. You also should avoid cotton socks because they can lock in and absorb moisture—making them generally uncomfortable.
Price:
A pair of high-quality walking socks will likely cost you more than your average pair of cotton socks. The performance fabric, in addition to the longevity, typically correlates with the price tag.
Verywell Fit / Ashleigh Morley
How We Tested the Walking Socks
The Verywell Fit team tests many products in The Verywell Testing Lab, but some products better lend themselves to
at-home testing
. This type of testing allows us to evaluate products long-term through consistent, real-world use to get the most accurate insights. Walking socks fall into this category, so 11 of our fitness editors tested each pair of socks. Here is what we consider when testing walking socks.
Fit:
When evaluating the socks in our test, we consider the fit of each pair. We note where the seams are, how they feel on our feet, and whether they slip when we're walking. We also consider whether they fit true to size.
Comfort:
Nothing is worse than an uncomfortable sock, so we pay special attention to the comfort level of each pair of socks. We consider how our feet feel when we first put them on and when we complete our walks. We expect the socks to maintain their comfort level throughout the entire testing process.
Cushioning:
The amount of cushioning and support a walking sock provides while wearing it is a crucial part of its overall performance, especially since walking puts so much stress on the feet. We look for socks that provide just the right amount of cushion without being too thin or too bulky. Only the socks that provide cushiony support make our list.
Blister Protection:
When evaluating the walking socks on our list, we consider how well they defend against blisters. This involves evaluating the socks' material, their moisture-wicking capabilities, and how secure they are on our feet.
Value:
Walking socks are performance socks, so a high-quality pair can get expensive. For this reason, we evaluate the price of the sock in comparison to the quality and performance it provides. We want to ensure that every pair of socks on our list provides good overall value.

Our Experts
We asked four experts for advice on which key features to consider when selecting the best walking socks. Some experts also recommended brands that make quality walking socks and told us what features to avoid in a sock.

Saylee Tulpule, DPM
, podiatrist in Maryland and Washington, DC

, clinical director of Therapeutics Unlimited in Sparta, New Jersey
Frequently Asked Questions
Should you wear socks while walking?
Tulpule recommends wearing socks while walking. Socks cushion the bottoms of feet, absorb moisture and sweat, and can act as a barrier between the foot and shoe to prevent blister formation. They can also help prevent fungal infections and odor, says Spielfogel.
What's the best material for walking socks?
Socks made from blends of polyester, nylon, and spandex are ideal because they’re lightweight and breathable. These materials draw moisture away from your skin and help fight blisters—the socks will also feel more comfortable.
Are thick socks better for walking?
Thick walking socks generally have more cushioning than thin socks, so they may feel more comfortable when you’re walking. However, thick socks may cause your feet to overheat and sweat in warmer weather, so very cushioned socks may not be a good choice for summer walking. They also may not work for
people with wide feet
who won’t have a lot of extra room in their walking shoes.
Should you wear compression socks while walking?
Compression socks
promote vein circulation and blood flow in the legs and feet back to the heart, says Prestipino. Wearing them while walking and standing can help to prevent blood clots, swelling, and varicose veins.
But if you don’t have these issues, you probably don’t need to wear compression socks while walking. Talk to a healthcare provider for advice on when to use compression socks and how long you can safely keep them on.
How much do high-quality walking socks cost?
You can expect to pay between $10 to $60 for quality walking socks. Less expensive options may lack support and durability, both of which are important when choosing a pair of socks for walking. Higher-priced items are great when you're looking for a more specific type (like compression) or a name brand.

Why Trust Verywell Fit
Verywell Fit / Joy Kim
If you have a larger chest, finding a sports bra that’s supportive, comfortable, and stylish can feel difficult. Generally speaking, “large breasts” refers to anyone with a D cup size or larger. When shopping for a sports bra, look for a comfortable and functional one
with a thick, soft band. Certified personal trainer
Lauren Leavell, NASM-CPT
, says it's also important to look for one with wide, adjustable straps.
To find the best sports bras for large breasts, we consulted experts, including a sports bra researcher and a dermatologist, to learn which
key features
to look for in a high-quality option. Then, we spent 113 days
testing 19 expert-approved options
, wearing them at home while we performed jumping jacks, ran, walked,
lifted weights
, and in our daily routines. We evaluated each one for its
fit, support, comfort, adjustability, quality, durability, and value
to find the top options on the market.
We also had a certified yoga, Pilates, personal trainer, and meditation teacher from our
Review Board
review this article for accuracy surrounding what to look for in sports bras and how they should fit.
What to Know Before You Get Started
Before you start shopping, it's a good idea to measure yourself or get measured at a lingerie store before buying a new sports bra to ensure you're wearing the right size. Working out in a sports bra with a band that's too tight can prevent you from breathing properly, influencing your
metabolic rate
.
Opt for sports bras with molded, encapsulated, or contoured cups. Encapsulated cups offer support and separation, and help each breast stay where it’s supposed to be, says certified bra fit expert
Laura Burke
. Some styles also have flexible underwires to lift each breast individually and help limit movement.
Most sports bras provide support through compression. But if you have larger breasts,
Jenette Goldstein
, founder and CEO of Jenette Bras, says each breast should be completely encased to control movement from all angles. Bras with built-in padding or removable cups have better coverage and create a smooth, rounded shape.

Who It's For
Best for those looking for a comfy, breathable, and supportive sports bra that can be worn for both low- and high-intensity workouts.
Why We Love It
Champion’s Spot Comfort Sports Bra
is our top overall pick because it has plenty of support and adjustability in a simple design that’s easy to wear. It’s also the only sports bra on our list that earned
a perfect score
in every category. We love how comfortable it is, with a smooth band
that's supportive and sturdy. Molded cups keep our breasts lifted and separated, while
soft, breathable mesh
layered with sweat-wicking material boosts airflow, keeping us cool on our 5-mile runs.
This
budget-friendly
bra is also incredibly durable: Three months after our initial test, it still holds up and hasn't shown any signs of wear or tear despite many washes, which we really appreciate. We also like the hooks on both the comfy gel-padded straps and band, which make getting into and adjusting this bra simple. Wireless,
highly adjustable
, and a great value—this bra truly has it all.
Potential Flaws
The straps have a tendency to show underneath tank tops since they curve inward. However, we found this flaw very minor and still love wearing this sports bra.
Meet Our Tester
Our tester is a runner who, in the past, has had a difficult time finding a sports bra that feels comfortable and supportive. She loves that this bra is a breeze to get into, thanks to its hook-and-eye closure, and feels comfortably snug, supportive, and breathable on her 5-mile runs.
This bra outperformed all others during our tests, thanks to its padded straps and smooth, secure band.

Who It's For
Best for those looking for a budget-friendly sports bra that's durable and provides a locked-in feel when performing high-intensity exercises.
Why We Love It
We recommend
Glamorise's No-Bounce Cami Wire-Free Sports Bra
if you’re searching for a supportive sports bra on a budget. Unlike many other sports bras, this one has no spandex—this means it will hold your chest in place throughout your entire workout without stretching or losing its shape over time. The wide hook-and-eye closure in the back provides a
locked-in feel
we loved while running and lifting weights.
The full-coverage neckline and
wide, adjustable straps
make this bra just as comfortable as it is effective, and we like that it comes in a range of bright and neutral colors with contrast trim. And after four months of weekly use, it continues to be just as supportive as the first day of wear. Plus, it's
very durable
, and isn't showing any visible signs of wear or tear, which we appreciate.
Potential Flaws
While we love this bra's support, we found the fabric a bit itchy and less soft than we prefer.
The seam down the middle of this bra is visible under tighter workout tops. While this didn't bother us, others may not like this.
Meet Our Tester
Our tester wears sports bras while running and
lifting weights
. She loves that this one keeps her breasts securely in place throughout her entire workout, eliminating the pain she typically feels when she jogs in less supportive bras and allowing her to move more freely while lifting weights.
Breathable mesh panels on the back of this bra help prevent sweat from building up while you work out.

Who It's For
Best for exercisers who want a super-supportive, sweat-wicking sports bra that's a breeze to adjust.
Why We Love It
Made from thick, durable, and opaque fabric,
Wacoal’s Underwire Sports Bra
is built to wick away sweat quickly during
high-impact workouts
.
Sleek but functional
, this sports bra combines three performance fabrics and a hidden exterior underwire for extra shaping and support. The design sets it apart—its
cups are soft and unstructured, with two thick layers of
soft fabric
that mold to your chest between your ribcage and the hidden underwire.
This sports bra is
super supportive
, and we love the way it lifts, separates, and keeps our chest securely in place, even during high-impact workouts. And while many sports bras tend to flatten or minimize, we love that this one doesn't. With plenty of ways to customize the fit, it's also
easy to adjust
. Another bonus? The straps are convertible and can be crossed in the back for a seamless silhouette underneath racerback tops.
Potential Flaws
While the bra didn't dig into our shoulders, we did notice that the band felt a little tight, so consider sizing up.
Meet Our Tester
Our tester likes to wear sports bras during high-impact workouts. She loves that this sports bra molds to her chest and offers a secure fit that evenly distributes her weight.
We love that this bra has convertible straps—you can cross them in the back for easy wearing. Plus, the band has four rows of hook-and-eye closures.

Who It's For
Best for exercisers who want a structured, highly-supportive sports bra to wear during high-intensity exercises.
Why We Love It
Panache’s Underwired Sports Bra
combines
high-impact support
with a durable, well-made design. We like that the cups lift and separate while the
wide straps
distribute the weight of our chest evenly. During testing, we noticed that this bra effectively cut down on excess movement and didn’t ride up in the back when we performed jumps, ran, and went on
fitness walks
.
A hook-and-eye closure with three columns and rows makes it
easy to tighten or loosen
the band as needed. We also like that its straps are adjustable and that the size range extends up to a J cup, unlike many other options. Overall, this bra's quality, design, and performance make it a
great value
for anyone who needs extra support.
Potential Flaws
This bra is not as comfortable to wear for longer periods because it is so incredibly supportive and structured. However, this makes it a great option for high-impact workouts.
Meet Our Tester
Our tester wears this sports bra when going on fitness walks, jogging, and performing various
jumping exercises
. She loves that it keeps her chest securely in place, with no movement whatsoever, and that it's very well-made and will last a long time.
The cups provide plenty of coverage, and the wide straps won't dig into your shoulders.

Who It's For
Best for those who want a lightweight, breathable sports bra that can handle high-intensity exercises but is also comfortable enough for all-day wear.
Why We Love It
We recommend
Syrokan's Underwire Molded Cup High Impact Sports Bra
for anyone looking for a super comfortable, well-made sports bra. We appreciate that this bra
has a low profile
and lays flat against our body.
It's so
lightweight and breathable
that we easily wore it for ten hours straight during testing.
We love that it slips on and off like a traditional bra for easy wearing.
Plus, its straps can be converted into a racerback, which we love. It also
stands up well to laundering
and never moves or causes any irritation as we run and perform jumping jacks.
Potential Flaws
This bra's padded straps are only adjustable in the back, which means it can be difficult to adjust while you’re wearing it.
Meet Our Tester
Our tester has a smaller frame and appreciates that this sports bra doesn't take up as much space on her body compared to other options she's tried in the past. She loves that she can comfortably wear this bra for up to 10 hours and that it feels light and airy.
Lightweight and low-profile, this sports bra is easy to wear during long, tough workouts.

Who It's For
Best for those who want an easily adjustable and highly-customizable sports bra that's also durable and stylish.
Why We Love It
SheFit’s Ultimate Sports Bra
is our favorite adjustable option because it's wire-free, durable, and
ultra-customizable
. We're not alone in our love for this bra—Leavell is also a fan and says that this bra really keeps your chest in place and offers a secure fit. We love that this bra has
convertible straps
that are easy to shorten and lengthen, as well as removable pads so you can adjust the coverage and support.
Instead of a traditional hook-and-loop closure system, this high-quality bra features one long strap to tighten or loosen the band. This design also means you can
adjust its compression level
—a feature others don’t typically offer. We did multiple cross-training sessions in this bra, including running, weightlifting,
agility drills
, and more, and it stayed securely in place without us having to make any adjustments. Available in a wide range of colors and sizes, it’s a
stylish option
for people who like a supportive
zip-front sports bra
that can be easily adjusted.
Potential Flaws
While this bra was very comfortable to wear while working out, we wouldn't want to keep it on all day long.
Meet Our Tester
Our tester typically runs, lifts weights, and performs agility drills as part of her workout routine. She loves that this sports bra is highly-adjustable, supportive, and stands up well to laundering, exceeding all of her expectations in terms of its performance.
We like that this sports bra has convertible straps that are easy to adjust.

Who It's For
Best for those who want a stylish, lightweight, and breathable sports bra for low-impact activities.
Why We Love It
For
low-impact activities
like walking, stability training on balance boards, yoga, or Pilates, we recommend
Natori’s Gravity Contour Underwire Sports Bra
. Made from
breathable mesh
, this bra is durable and comfy, with a two-row hook-and-eye closure that’s easy to adjust. Lightweight foam cups with a hidden underwire offer extra support, which we especially appreciate while lifting weights and strength training.
We love how well-made this bra feels, with
high-quality materials
that won't wear out quickly. Its
modern, stylish dual-layer design
is a great way to add some color to your workout wardrobe. It's also flattering, with a low back and mesh panels
on either side. Plus, it stands up well to laundering and doesn't retain odors, which we really like.
Potential Flaws
We noticed the band runs a bit small—you may want to size up.
While we like the look of the thin straps, they started to slightly dig into our shoulders after three hours of high-intensity exercise, including running. Because of this, we recommend wearing this bra only for low-intensity exercise.
Meet Our Tester
Our tester wore this bra on walks, while jogging, and for weight and strength training. She loves how cute, stylish, and supportive this sports bra is, especially considering that other options she's worn in the past have been thick with unflattering material or unsupportive. She also notes that it's incredibly high-quality and comfortable to wear, and a breeze to adjust.

Who It's For
Best for those who want a lightweight, ultra-supportive, and smoothing sports bra for high-impact exercises.
Why We Love It
While some sports bras can’t stand up to the demands of high-impact exercise,
Knix's Catalyst Sports Bra
provides the ideal combination of style
and function.
This ultra-supportive
sports bra is made from
soft, opaque fabric
, providing a flattering silhouette that lifts, separates, and creates smooth lines. Unlike many other sports bras, we also appreciate its wide hook-and-eye closure with five columns, which makes it
easy to adjust
and get the right fit.
We love that its
molded cups
offer structure without an uncomfortable underwire. During high-intensity workouts, our chest doesn't move and stays comfortably in place. And it's
very lightweight
, making it easy to pack in a suitcase or
gym bag
. Plus, it’s easy to adjust the straps using the bra’s buckles. We also like that its high V-neck design
provides coverage without compromising aesthetics.
Potential Flaws
This sports bra feels tight initially, then loosens up a bit over time. However, if you prefer a less compressive fit, you may want to consider sizing up.
Meet Our Tester
Our tester likes wearing this bra while performing high-impact exercises. She loves that her chest stays in place, and her back and shoulders don't hurt at all while wearing it. She also loves that it's easy to get the right fit and that her chest never spills out of it.
This lightweight sports bra has soft, molded cups and a high V-neck for the right amount of coverage.

Who It's For
Best for those looking for a super comfortable sports bra for low-impact activities that's easy to wear all day long and comes in a wide range of sizes.
Why We Love It
Girlfriend Collective’s Paloma Bra
is our top pick for the sports bra with the widest size range, as it fits busts ranging from 29 to 60.5 inches. We love its
comfortable, supportive material
, which quickly wicked away the sweat we worked up during our workout routines. And we love that the darker color we tested doesn't show sweat or deodorant marks.
It's so comfy that when we wear it to work, we forget we have it on, making it ideal for anyone looking for a sports bra that is comfortable enough for all-day wear. We also like that it's available in a wide range of neutral and seasonal colors. Plus, it's
made from recycled plastic bottles
, and even after many washes and four months of regular wear, its soft, thick material
still feels as
high-quality
as it did when we first tried it.
Potential Flaws
While we like the amount of compression this bra offers, we noticed that it runs large.
Keep in mind that this bra doesn’t have an adjustable band or straps, so it may not work well for everyone.
Meet Our Tester
Our tester likes wearing this bra for low-impact activities and casual wear. She was surprised by this sports bra's comfort and loved wearing it during her workouts and at work. She thinks it has the perfect balance of support and compression.
The Paloma Bra is easy to pull on and comfortable to wear, with wide straps and a racerback silhouette.

Who It's For
Best for those who want a supportive and smoothing sports bra for everyday wear that feels like a t-shirt bra.
Why We Love It
For everyday wear, we recommend
Playtex's Fits 18 Hour Cooling Comfort Wire-Free Sports Bra
. We like how
supportive, smoothing, and low-profile
it is—during testing, we realized it's
virtually undetectable underneath our workout shirts and reminds us more of a high-quality t-shirt bra instead of a typical sports bra.
Made with
sweat-wicking fabric
in the cups and the band, we could really feel a difference when we wore this bra, making this a great option for anyone who tends to run warm. We also like that the hooks in the back are reinforced to prevent them from poking through to our skin. Although
budget-friendly
, it doesn't skimp on quality—this bra showed no signs of wear or tear after weeks of regular washes.
Potential Flaws
This sports bra's size range is smaller than other options on this list, so it may not work well for some.
Meet Our Tester
Our tester loves that this sports bra feels like a very pricey, high-quality option but is budget-friendly. She also appreciates that it feels supportive, fits well, and has cooling technology that actually works, keeping her comfortable as she exercises.

Who It's For
Best for runners who want a compressive sports bra that's supportive, soft, and breathable.
Why We Love It
Whether
running on a treadmill
or outdoors, look for a sports bra with enough compression to prevent uncomfortable bouncing—like
Natori's Yogi Sports Bra
. Its
soft, silky material
feels breathable and super supportive. During runs and jumping exercises, this bra kept our chest lifted and in place without any chafing or rubbing.
It's also
durable
, built to last, and
can handle repeated washes and wears. And we love that it doesn't hold onto odors, stretch, or pill over time. Its convertible straps and triple hook-and-loop closure add to its functionality, while
encapsulated cups
work to lift and separate our breasts.
Potential Flaws
Since it’s so compressive, this bra isn't the most comfortable to wear for a full day. However, it's extremely comfy to wear while we work out.
On tighter settings, the excess strap material tends to move around while we exercise, which we found somewhat annoying.
Meet Our Tester
Our tester wears this sports bra while performing medium- and high-intensity exercises, including running. She loves that it feels supportive and lightweight without ever feeling overly constrictive.

Sports Bras for Large Breasts We Also Tested
We tested 19 sports bras for large breasts, but only 11 impressed us enough to make our final list of recommendations. Although we liked some of these sports bras' features, they didn't meet our rigorous testing requirements to be selected as top picks.
lululemon’s Enlite Weave-Back Bra
is comfortable, but we noticed it didn't fit well enough to provide the right level of support. The cups gapped, and we wish the straps were adjustable.
Although we wore
lululemon’s Energy Bra
in our usual size, it felt very small. The straps were too tight, and we spilled out of the cups.
Anita’s High Impact Wire-Free Sports Bra
is adjustable, lightweight, and breathable. We like that it comes in a wide range of sizes, but it runs small, especially in the band, causing our breasts to spill out of the cups.
What to Look for When Shopping for Sports Bras for Large Breasts
Activity:
Sports bras are designed to support your chest based on how intensely you exercise. High-impact bras have the most support and compression, and they're ideal for
cardio workouts
. Medium-impact bras are best for hiking or cycling. Low-impact sports bras aren’t recommended for most people with large breasts, but they may work for walking or everyday wear. Many
exercise dresses
have low-impact bras built-in that may give slightly more support.
Design:
Consider the bra's shape: Is the neckline high enough to provide coverage? Are the sides wide enough to support you from all angles? A lack of coverage may lead to spillage and rubbing that could be uncomfortable, says Leavell.
Closure:
Sports bras come in pull-on, front closure, and back closure styles. Goldstein recommends avoiding pull-on styles because they only provide compression. Instead, opt for front- or back-closure bras, which offer maximum hold and stress distribution, she says.
Straps:
Avoid bras with narrow, fixed straps. Goldstein recommends thicker straps that you can adjust to fit your build and evenly distribute your weight. Straps with cushioning also help prevent chafing.
Material:
Sports bras that aren’t breathable will trap sweat and moisture, which can lead to irritation. Bras made with sweat-wicking fabric will pull moisture away from your skin while keeping you comfortable. Goldstein recommends looking into performance textiles that resist odor and repel moisture, including mesh, polyester, and nylon.
Care:
Each sports bra comes with a different set of care instructions. Some are machine washable, while others are hand wash only—and not all can go in the dryer. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions to prolong the life of your sports bra.

How We Tested the Sports Bras for Large Breasts
To find the best sports bras for large breasts, we spent 113 days testing 19 expert-approved options from top brands, wearing them while performing jumping jacks, running, walking, lifting weights, and in our daily routines. When testing sports bras for large breasts, we evaluate each option based on the following key criteria.
Fit:
When we first try the bra on, we note whether the straps evenly distribute our weight without digging into our shoulders. We also check to see if there's any gapping or spillage.
Support:
We test each bra's impact level by performing various exercises, including jumping jacks, jogging, weight lifting, fitness walks, and more. How much do our chests bounce? Is the bra comfortably compressive, or is it so tight we can't breathe?
Comfort:
To test a bra's comfort, we wear it to the gym or around the house for at least three hours. Does the bra stay in place? Do the straps dig into our backs or shoulders? We also note whether the bra leaves any red marks, irritation, or sweat buildup behind after we take it off.
Adjustability:
How easy is it to adjust the bra—can we tweak the fit while wearing it? We prioritize bras with easily adjustable bands and straps.
Quality:
When we first receive the bra, we examine its construction. Does it seem well-made, or do we spot fraying, loose threads, or other manufacturing defects? At the end of the testing period, does the bra still feel as high-quality as it did when we first tried it on?
Durability:
We wash the bras after every wear to test their durability. If we notice any fading, pilling, loss of elasticity, or other signs of wear and tear, the bra receives a lower durability score.
Value:
To accurately assess each bra's value, we wait to check the price until the end of the testing period, after we've evaluated it in all other categories. Based on its performance, would we buy this bra at full price or only if it went on sale? We also consider whether we'd recommend it to our family and friends.
Our Experts
We consulted experts at each stage of research, testing, and reporting process. The following experts explained how to ensure a sports bra fits correctly and helped us develop and refine our testing process. Although we choose products independently, expert input influences our decisions.
Laura Burke, certified bra fit expert and intimate apparel stylist at Fit X Burke
Jenette Goldstein, founder and CEO of Jenette Bras
Lauren Leavell, NASM-CPT, certified personal trainer, group fitness instructor, and founder of Lauren Leavell Fitness
Marissa Renelt
, bra fit expert and assistant buyer at Burlington Stores
LaJean Lawson, PhD
, sports bra researcher and breast motion expert
Joshua Zeichner, MD
, associate professor of dermatology and director of cosmetic and clinical research in dermatology at Mount Sinai Hospital
Frequently Asked Questions
How are sports bras supposed to fit?
Burke says that most of the support for sports bras comes from the band, so a snug band that anchors to your body and doesn’t ride up is key. She adds that you need a firmer band if you can reach around your back and pull out the band more than an inch. Ensure all your breast tissue fits comfortably in the cup, and it's best not to rely on overly tightened straps for lift.
Can sports bras flatten your breasts?
A tight-fitting sports bra may flatten or compress your breasts temporarily, but that also helps keep them out of the way and restrict movement. However, some sports bras aren't designed to flatten—they're shaped more like regular bras and actually encase and support each individual breast.
Is it okay to wear a sports bra as an everyday bra?
Yes, it's okay to wear a sports bra as an everyday bra. Look for one that’s medium- to low-impact, so it will be comfortable to wear all day long.
How much does a high-quality sports bra for large breasts cost?
A high-quality sports bra for large breasts may cost anywhere from $20 to over $100. Pricier bras may be more adjustable and have other features that may work better for your needs.
Do sports bras contain BPA?
Bisphenol A (BPA) is a chemical found in some types of plastic.
Research has shown that exposure to high levels of BPA can lead to obesity, hormonal imbalances, and uterine cancer, among other health complications.
In May 2023, the Center for Environmental Health (CEH) announced that, after testing, it found high levels of BPA in certain activewear pieces containing polyester and spandex blends. Zeichner says that the best way to prevent BPA exposure is to make educated decisions when purchasing products. As a precaution, it's best to limit the time you spend in activewear by changing out of it when you are finished working out. Keep in mind that the science of transdermal absorption of BPA is still not settled.

Why Trust Verywell Fit
Verywell Fit / Jessica Murtaugh
Carrying your
water bottle
, change of clothes, and other essentials between your workout space and workplace can be a hassle. The best gym backpacks provide a hands-free solution for storing and organizing your gear wherever you need to go. Certified yoga teacher
Tamara Teragawa
prefers backpacks over single-shoulder duffels since they evenly distribute the weight of your items, placing less strain on one shoulder. Gym backpacks should be
comfortable, durable, and spacious,
equipped with ample compartments to accommodate all your gear. They should also have an
adjustable design
that can be tailored to your body size to ensure minimal back strain when fully loaded.
To find the best gym backpacks, we first consulted experts to learn which
key features
to look for. We then
tested 12 gym backpacks
in the real world during our daily routines. We evaluated each backpack based on
storage, comfort, stability, fit and adjustability, chafing protection, and value
. We had a certified personal trainer from our
Review Board
review the contents of this article for accuracy around the benefits of gym backpacks and how to safely wear them.

Who It's For
Best for exercisers of all fitness levels who need lots of storage and sturdy straps for carrying.
Why We Love It
Nike's Utility Speed Training Backpack
is our top overall men’s pick because it’s comfortable, spacious, and durable. The bag opens flat, so you can easily access your essentials from the
roomy main compartment
. It also has
multiple pockets
throughout to keep you organized. Thanks to the large size and
organized interior,
we were even able to use it as a weekend bag. Although it’s roomy, it didn’t feel bulky, oversized, or uncomfortable (even when fully stuffed).
During testing, we noticed that the air-cushioned straps helped relieve pressure on our shoulders, making the pack
comfortable to carry.
The haul handle on top is easy to pick up, and the sternum strap feels balanced and secure, even when the bag is full. An
interior mesh sleeve
can store items like books,
resistance bands
, or a 15-inch laptop. We also like the cargo loops across the top, which are handy for clipping additional gear like keys, shoes, bottles, or gloves.
Potential Flaws
The interior mesh sleeve is convenient for holding several items, but it's not very secure during rigorous movement.
Most Valuable Insight
“This backpack is nice and has lots of sections for all the various equipment that is needed to work out. It gives a sporty vibe and seems to fit a lot of stuff inside.” —

Who It's For
Best if you need a versatile backpack for gym sessions, travel adventures, and daily commutes.
Why We Love It
Our top women’s pick is
The North Face’s Never Stop Utility Pack
because it has
impressive storage,
a
sleek design,
and plenty of thoughtful features. Lined interior pockets, large exterior pockets, and an included accessory bag let us easily store all of our gym bag essentials. The pack also has a designated
shoe compartment
to store
workout sneakers
and a
sunglass pocket
to keep shades safe.
Adding even more versatility,
two tech storage spots
—exterior and interior laptop sleeves—make it convenient to go straight to the office from the gym. We found the
adjustable shoulder straps
to be soft and supportive, and we appreciate the top carry straps that allow you to carry the pack like a tote. Additionally, the bag features exterior loops and snaps for attaching items like keys, water bottles, or a
yoga mat
. It's also crafted from recycled materials that are
water- and sweat-resistant.
Potential Flaws
We felt the sternum strap was not as supportive as the ones on some other backpacks we tested.
Most Valuable Insight
“I love the top handles that can be used to carry it like a tote, the felt-lined electronics and sunglasses pockets, and the bottom shoe compartment, something that I found is rarer than you’d think in a gym backpack. It looks and feels great, too—I get so many compliments on this bag!” —

Who It's For
Best if you need a lightweight, versatile backpack at a budget-friendly price point.
Why We Love It
If you're in search of a budget-friendly gym backpack, we recommend
Under Armour's Adult Hustle 5.0 Backpack.
It has
ample storage space
and designated compartments for shoes, clothes, electronics, and more. It also includes a protective,
felt-lined interior sleeve
for a laptop
and a
waterproof front pocket
for your phone, sunglasses, or wallet. Plus, it comes in tons of fun colors and patterns.
Multiple attachment points on the front of the pack let us easily secure additional gear, like
lifting gloves or straps
. And we found that the
ergonomic shoulder straps
are comfortably padded and feature attachment loops, keeping items within easy reach. We also appreciate the
abrasion-resistant fabric
on the bottom of the backpack that makes it tear- and snag-free regardless of where you place it.
Potential Flaws
The straps are wide, which distributes weight well but may not be comfortable for smaller-framed wearers.
Most Valuable Insight
“I would recommend this bag as a good basic gym bag on a budget. It’s solidly constructed and great for carrying a good amount of bulky stuff, including boxing gloves, gym shoes, and large towels.”

Who It's For
Best if you want a gym backpack that doubles as a duffle bag for travel.
Why We Love It
Looking for a gym backpack that doubles as a travel duffle?
Beis' The Sport Duffle
easily converts between the two: Just slide the straps out of the bottom zipper compartment and buckle them into two concealed clips. We found both the backpack and duffle straps to be plush, padded, and comfy. Plus, a
luggage trolley sleeve,
which can be zipped up to become an exterior pocket when not in use, adds to its convenience for travel.
In addition to its versatility, this bag offers
ample storage.
The interior boasts a total of five large pockets, allowing us to organize all of our essentials, along with a small
garment bag to store sweaty clothes
after a tough workout. We also appreciate the multiple zippered exterior pockets for easy access to items. But our favorite feature is the
interior key fob clip,
which eliminates the hassle of rummaging through our bag to find keys.
Potential Flaws
We recommend removing your items before converting the bag so they don't spill out.
Most Valuable Insight
“This is a really lovely bag that is so versatile. It has way more storage than I expected and even came with a garment bag for a clean or dirty clothes change. The material feels soft and elegant. This would make a great overnight bag!” —

Who It's For
Best for yogis who need designated space for a yoga mat, yoga clothes, and other
yoga accessories
.
Why We Love It
Designed with yogis in mind,
Aurorae Yoga's Multi-Purpose Yoga Backpack
offers a convenient way to store your yoga gear (no need for
yoga slings
here). Unlike traditional yoga mat bags, this one
carries your mat vertically
in a separate pocket with straps, so it’s easier for you to move around. During testing, our 6-millimeter mat slid in effortlessly. A
spacious main compartment
can hold a block,
yoga towel
, and more. There's also a
padded laptop sleeve
designed to accommodate a 17-inch computer.
Two
padded, adjustable shoulder straps
help evenly distribute the weight of your gear, letting us stuff the bag without causing discomfort. We love using the
two zippered pockets,
one on the inside and one on the outside, for storing keys, a wallet, a phone, and more. Side mesh pockets also
hold two
water bottles
,
while exterior attachment loops offer even more ways to carry your essentials.
Potential Flaws
To maintain balance while wearing the bag with a mat, make sure to fully tighten the outer straps.
If you have a smaller frame, this backpack may not tighten enough to be comfortable to wear.
Most Valuable Insight
“Unlike many bags for yoga mats, which are usually duffel-style, totes, or cross-body slings, I like that this backpack has two shoulder straps to balance weight upon your body. It also holds the mat vertically, so you can walk through doors easier.”

Who It's For
Best for exercisers who have bulky gear to carry to and from the gym.
Why We Love It
Looking for a spacious backpack to carry hefty or bulky gear? Look no further than
Elite Sports' Convertible Bag.
With its
generous storage capacity,
versatile two-in-one design, and
heavy-duty construction,
it's a reliable choice. The padded, quick-release backpack straps can easily be stowed away to seamlessly transition this pack to a duffel. And despite stuffing it full, our petite tester found it
comfortable to wear.
Great for a variety of activities, like
mixed martial arts
, boxing, field and court sports, and more, this durable backpack boasts a
water-resistant
coating to protect belongings. During our test, it kept our items completely dry. We also appreciate the bag's
multiple entry points
and
drop-out bottom,
which expands to hold even more stuff. Exterior pockets help us stay organized: An insulated cooler slot keeps our
protein shakes
cold, while a
laptop sleeve
keeps our tech protected.
Potential Flaws
This backpack has several versatile features but it only comes in black.
Most Valuable Insight
“This is a clever, versatile bag that would make a great pick for anyone who wants options. It’s so easy to expand or switch from duffel to backpack. And the insulated pocket is really handy, too.” —

Who It's For
Best for petite users who don't need a ton of storage.
Why We Love It
While compact,
The North Face’s Borealis Mini Backpack
still holds an impressive amount of stuff. We love using this bag to store small essentials on
walks
, hikes, and trips to the gym. During testing, we noticed that while tiny, this pack is quite mighty, with a
spacious interior
and
reliable durability.
We also like that it's made with
recycled materials
and is available in a wide range of bright colors.
The
ergonomic, adjustable straps
are comfortable to wear. And external loops and compression bungees make it easy to carry all of your must-haves with you. The pack also has
two external water bottle pockets
and one internal pocket large enough to fit a tablet, in case you need to bring your tech with you. If you like the design but aren’t sure about the size, the brand also makes a
larger version
.
Potential Flaws
The water bottle pockets are small and can only hold 12-ounce drinks.
Most Valuable Insight
“I really like this mini backpack for light trips to the gym, when all I need is a pair of gym shoes or minimal essentials. It’s great for walks, hikes, or other times you don’t want to be weighed down with a full-on pack.” —

Who It's For
Best for on-the-go users who want one backpack to store essentials for their busy days.
Why We Love It
Transitioning seamlessly from the gym to the office (or vice versa) is a breeze with
Aer's Fit Pack 3.
It offers a sleek solution for organizing your change of clothes, shoes, and other essentials. Plus, we think its
aesthetic blends effortlessly
into most settings. For comfy and convenient commuting, the bag also boasts
ergonomic straps
and a
durable, water-resistant
outer shell.
As for storage, the front zipper opens vertically to reveal a spacious interior. We used the rear compartment to store a laptop and the top
quick-access, felt-lined pocket
for our phone and sunglasses. The shoe compartment has an
antimicrobial-coated lining
that keeps dirty or wet items separate while preventing odors.
Potential Flaws
The shoe compartment is a nice feature, but when it's full, it takes up a lot of room.
Most Valuable Insight
“Not only is it a solid bag with great storage, but it also doesn’t look like your typical gym bag. It’s a stylish, cool, and clean look. I love the forest green color, and the quality of the material, as well as the storage space and unexpected pockets.”

Who It's For
Best for swimmers and athletes who need to air out sweaty, wet gear.
Why We Love It
For swimmers or athletes who frequently carry sweaty or wet gear, we recommend
TYR’s Big Mesh Mummy Backpack
. This lightweight bag’s
breathable meshing
allows wet items, like swim goggles or caps, to air out and dry quickly. During our test, we found that the bag's
spacious interior
holds an impressive amount of equipment.
With handy features like a mesh zippered front pocket and
mesh water bottle holder,
staying organized is a breeze. We found adjusting the shoulder straps to be easy, and the
convenient drawstring closure
makes accessing items a snap. This pack offers a mess-free way to take your wet gear on the go, all at a
wallet-friendly price
and in various
vibrant hues.
Potential Flaws
The straps on this backpack aren't padded, so it's not as comfortable as other options on our list (especially for carrying heavy items).
Most Valuable Insight
“This bag was so spacious! It kept gear aired out for quicker drying. It would be great for activities with large gear that gets wet and needs extra ventilation, like swimming, martial arts, or sweaty gym workouts.” —

Who It's For
Best if you live in wet weather zones, hike on soggy terrain, or travel to diverse destinations.
Why We Love It
REI Co-op’s Ruckpack
is a multi-functional pick for rainy commutes,
outdoor activities in wet weather
, and more. Made from
recycled, heavy-duty nylon
and treated with a
durable water-repellent finish,
the bag also comes with a rain cover in case conditions get torrential. We appreciate the ventilated mesh back panel that keeps us comfy and dry. The sternum strap is also
easy to use and adjust,
and we like that the buckle even doubles as a whistle (a unique safety feature).
Inside, the bag has a
large main compartment
with a deep mesh pocket for storing small items. There’s also a
tall waterproof sleeve
for your laptop or a hydration reservoir. The exterior features a tiny top pocket and
several side pockets
(one large enough to
hold our 32-ounce water bottle). Plus, you can lock the zippers to
keep your gear safe when you can’t be next to your bag.
Potential Flaws
To prevent the foam back panel from warping over time, we found we had to store the bag either completely flat or hanging vertically.
Most Valuable Insight
“I’ve taken my REI Ruckpack everywhere from the gym to camping trips. It has a ton of storage without being too huge to manage, and it doesn’t look out of place in the office or the gym. It does a fantastic job keeping the contents dry and protected.”

Who It's For
Best for active kids who need a versatile backpack for sports and school.
Why We Love It
Whether it's for soccer games,
karate class
, or gymnastics meets, active kids (and their parents) will love
REI Co-op's Tarn 18 Pack
for its lightweight yet durable construction. Crafted from
water-resistant materials,
it effortlessly withstands wet weather and offers
easy cleaning
with a simple wipe-down. This pack boasts
seven pockets,
which include easy-access hip belt pockets, space for a water bottle, and plenty of zippered compartments.
During testing, the nylon material proved resilient against water bottle spills and outdoor excursions. The
padded shoulder straps
were
easy to adjust
, while the waist belt ensured the pack stayed securely in place. Noteworthy for its durability and contemporary design, this backpack is an investment that can be passed down to siblings or friends for years to come.
Potential Flaws
During testing, we found the sternum strap to be uncomfortable and unnecessary.

Who It's For
Best if you participate in court sports like basketball, volleyball, and more.
Why We Love It
If court sports dominate your workout routine, consider
Mier's Large Sports Backpack
for its ample space and organization. One of the first things we noticed was how large the
40-liter main compartment
is, with a separate mesh section perfectly sized for a
basketball
or volleyball. The bag boasts
numerous pockets
for stashing smaller essentials: a plush velvet-lined pocket for your phone or sunglasses, an insulated side pocket for
healthy snacks
, and a dedicated slot for your water bottle.
During testing, this backpack proved to be comfortable, thanks to its
wide, supportive, and adjustable straps
that ensure stability. The breathable mesh details and
water-resistant bottom
are particularly appreciated for use during outdoor games or on wet locker room floors. We also found that it's
easy to access the ball
compartment without needing to rummage through the bag or remove other items.
Potential Flaws
The straps are very wide, which distributes weight well, but they may be too wide for smaller users.
Most Valuable Insight
“It's spacious and well thought out, with great, clever storage. I was also impressed by the huge capacity!”

What to Look for When Shopping for a Gym Backpack
Material:
Gym backpacks can be made from a variety of materials, but no matter what, you'll want to make sure the bag is comfortable
(to prevent chafing)
and that it’s durable and easy to maintain. Nylon and polyester are durable, easy to clean, and water-resistant. Leather is stylish and stands up to wear and tear over time, but can fall apart when exposed to water. While canvas is often water-resistant, it can shrink when it’s not washed properly.
Size:
Choose an appropriately sized backpack for your body to avoid overloading, which can harm your back. To
avoid back pain
, weight should always be evenly distributed, never overloaded, and adjusted properly, says chiropractor
Brad Hochstein
, DC, ART. For most wearers, a medium-sized backpack (around 30 liters or less) is large enough to hold your gym essentials. Also, consider how big your gym lockers are to ensure your bag will fit.
Fit:
Your gym backpack should feel comfortable but snug. Adjustability is key, says Hochstein. When adjusted correctly, the best gym backpack should be form-fitting, without feeling too tight or painful, and it should never restrict your range of motion. The shoulder straps should also have enough padding and support for the weight you plan to carry, adds Hochstein.
Storage:
A gym backpack with plenty of storage can help you stay organized. Smaller pockets for things like a phone, keys, wallet, or headphones are important so you don't lose them inside your bag, Teragawa says. Larger pockets help separate your
workout clothes
and accessories from the rest of your essentials. And don’t forget storage that supports your hydration goals: you'll definitely want at least one water bottle holder, Teragawa adds.
Additional Features:
You might need a pack with special features, like a shoe compartment, multiple interior slots, exterior ties or bungees, or a padded electronics sleeve. Teragawa prefers a backpack that has a designated area for dirty clothes or
workout towels
, and a separate area for clean items.
How We Tested the Gym Backpacks
To choose the best gym backpacks, we first consulted a chiropractor and fitness professional to find out which features set good bags apart. Then,
we tested 12 backpacks
during our daily routines around town, to the gym, and to the office over several weeks. When testing, we evaluate the backpacks based on the following criteria:
Storage:
To evaluate the storage capacity, we first stuff the bag with all of our
gym bag essentials
. We then consider: Is there enough room for everything we need? How many zippered pockets are there? How many exterior pockets are there? Are there specialized compartments for shoes or dirty clothes? Are there easy-access pockets for things like phones or keys? We also note if the weight is evenly distributed and if our items stay dry in rainy conditions.
Comfort:
We wear the stuffed backpacks for at least two walks of 30 minutes each to evaluate comfort. We note whether the straps are adequately padded, how breathable the pack is, and if the weight stays evenly distributed. We also consider if the backpack feels bulky or awkward to carry.
Stability/Bounce Prevention:
A backpack that bounces or shifts can be uncomfortable and cause strain. To determine how stable each full backpack is, we note how snug and secure it feels on our walks and commutes. Are there extra straps, like a waist or chest strap, to keep it in place? Do the pockets keep items from bouncing or shifting while we move?
Fit/Adjustability:
The more adjustability a backpack has, the better it will fit and prevent bouncing and discomfort. We prioritize backpacks that have adjustable shoulder, waist, and sternum straps. We also consider how easy or difficult it is to adjust the straps and if they come loose or stay snug while wearing the backpack.
Chafing Protection:
While wearing the full backpacks, we pay attention to whether we feel any irritation or rubbing from the straps or the back of the pack. We also carefully check for any rough seams or scratchy fabric that can cause chafing. Finally, we consider how breathable the fabric feels.
Overall Value:
To give each backpack a value rating, we look at its cost after we're done evaluating each of the other key attributes. We consider whether the price is fair based on the performance of the backpack. We only include backpacks we would recommend to a friend.
Our Experts
To curate our list of the best gym backpacks, we also consulted two experts for their input on what to look for when shopping. A chiropractor helped us understand features that support stability and reduce strain, and a fitness professional suggested specific, helpful features to look for. Although we choose and test products independently, advice from experts influences our decisions.

Frequently Asked Questions
What is the benefit of having a gym backpack?
Besides the convenience of hands-free hauling, a gym backpack can be better for you than a cross-body or duffel bag, Hochstein says. Backpacks distribute the weight of your items evenly across your shoulders, decreasing the pressure on one side that an over-the-shoulder bag creates.
How big should a gym backpack be?
The size of your gym backpack largely depends on how much you’ll be carrying around. Most packs have a capacity of 30 to 40 liters, but you should always make sure the bag you purchase isn’t too big for your frame.
How much should a gym backpack cost?
The price range for gym backpacks generally falls between $25 and $100. Larger, more feature-packed, and branded options typically cost more. As you shop, it's important to align your purchase with your specific needs, preferences, and budget.

Frequently Asked Questions
Why Trust Verywell Fit
Verywell Fit / Jessica Juliao
Best known for its ultra-comfortable leggings, lululemon has cultivated a fiercely loyal community around its fashionable and functional activewear. From sports bras to
joggers
and even socks, lululemon offers a range of products that blend style with performance. But the best lululemon leggings are what truly set the brand apart. While lower-cost options exist, they often fall short in durability and need to be replaced more frequently. The premium price tag on lululemon leggings comes with a commitment to comfort, performance, quality, and value. (Plus, we have some
tricks for navigating the lululemon "We Made Too Much" section
.)
To find the best lululemon leggings, we first spoke with certified personal trainers to learn more about what features they look for and avoid while shopping. Then, we
tested 23 pairs of leggings
while running, working out, lounging, and more. Our top picks earned high scores for their
material, opacity, fit, hold, durability, and value.
We also had a certified personal trainer, yoga instructor, and Pilates teacher from our
Review Board
review this article for accuracy and how to shop for lululemon leggings that last.

Who They’re For
Best for lounging, everyday wear, and medium-impact workouts.
Why We Love Them
lululemon’s Align High-Rise Pants with Pockets
have long been a favorite of many lululemon customers, and it’s easy to see why. They’re the most comfortable, versatile, and functional pair we tested. The Nulu fabric
feels breathable
and
offers light compression,
making these suitable for both lounging and medium-impact workouts alike.
During sweaty
cardio workouts
, we found that the
high-rise waistband provides support and stays securely in place
—no distracting adjustments required. Plus, the leggings remain
completely squat-proof
even after numerous washes, which is a huge plus if you wear leggings daily. With three
spacious pockets,
the Align Pant offers ample storage for your essentials while on the move.
Potential Flaws
Underwear lines did show through, so you may want to wear a seamless pair underneath.
Most Valuable Insight
“They are comfortable and functional, plus they have more pockets than I knew what to do with. The wide color selection makes it easy to find a pair you'll love.”

Who They’re For
Best for
yoga
and other low-impact activities.
Why We Love Them
Breathable and buttery soft, we recommend the
Align High-Rise Pants
for anyone who regularly practices yoga or other low-impact activities. Brushed fibers make this pair
feel smooth to the touch
and almost weightless, delivering easy movement without friction. And the Nulu fabric offers breathability and
light compression.
Transitioning seamlessly from
Downward Facing Dog
to
Mountain pose
was effortless in these leggings, thanks to their supportive and
secure high-rise waistband.
Even in a light color, we found this pair to be
completely opaque.
We also appreciate their comfort and durability, as we found that they easily withstand multiple wears and washes for
everyday use.
Potential Flaws
These only have one hidden pocket in the waistband, so we recommend grabbing a gym bag for toting the rest of your
gym essentials
.
Most Valuable Insight
“I love how the high-rise waistband comes up to my belly button without squeezing too hard—it stays in place throughout my workout class. A lot of leggings I own will pull down around the waist if I bend my legs, but these stay in place.”
—Christina Oehler, Verywell Fit product tester

Length:

Fabric:
Everlux (nylon and Lycra elastane) |
Sizes:

Our Overall Rating:
5/5
Who They’re For
Best for maximum support and sweat-wicking during high-impact workouts.
Why We Love Them
If you prefer leggings with snug compression, we recommend
Wunder Train High-Rise Tights.
They’re
thicker
than other options, for more
structured support
from your belly to your ankles, says yoga sculpt instructor
Anna Whalen
. Still, the Everlux fabric
feels lightweight and sweat-wicking,
which we found ideal for high-impact workouts.
During testing, we noticed that these leggings have a
sleek exterior
and
feel cooling on the inside.
Despite the snug, compressive fit, they still maintain their true size. And the interior drawstring ensures they stay securely in place (even when running). We also appreciate that these leggings
can be machine washed and dried,
unlike many other pairs from lululemon on our list.
Potential Flaws
Since there's only one pocket, you might find it convenient to use a
phone holder
to carry your small essentials more easily.
Most Valuable Insight
“So far they've washed beautifully and maintained their shape, fit, and hold. The material is sturdy, which makes them incredibly durable.” —
Ashleigh Morley
, Verywell Fit product tester
Although they're compressive, we can still easily move in this pair without feeling constricted.

Made from lululemon’s compressive Everlux fabric, these leggings are great for high-intensity workouts.

0 to 20 |
Our Overall Rating:
4.8/5
Who They’re For
Best for individuals who like full control over the waistband to prevent slips during exercise.
Why We Love Them
Many lululemon leggings have pockets for convenient storage, but when you need extra room, we recommend the
Swift Speed High-Rise Tight.
This pair has
two side drop-in pockets
and a
zippered back pocket,
so you can exercise with your phone (and keys, and cards) confidently. A major plus: Even when fully stocked, these leggings
stay securely in place.
The Luxtreme fabric, with its seamless design and smoothing quality, proved exceptionally comfortable and flattering. And we appreciate its
complete opacity
and reflective detailing, which enhance confidence and
safety during
nighttime workouts
.
However, our favorite feature is the interior drawstring, enabling
easy adjustments
for a snug fit during exercise.
Potential Flaws
Without the interior drawstring, these leggings would fall down, so having it is crucial for keeping them in place.
Most Valuable Insight
“These have a drawstring! Genius. Whenever I feel that they might slide down, I tighten the drawstring and it works like magic.” —

Who They’re For
Best for high-intensity workouts where you want to feel held in and comfortable.
Why We Love Them
lululemon’s Contour Fit style offers a unique hip-to-waist ratio compared to its other leggings. The waistband is narrower, eliminating any gapping, while providing more room in the hips and thighs for a
sculpted fit.
Among the various Contour Fit options, our favorite is the
Wunder Train Contour Fit High-Rise Tight.
We love this pair because of its supportive feel that
stays put without being overly tight.
The fabric efficiently
wicks away sweat,
and its smooth material and snug fit create a
flattering silhouette
that we love. It's also
opaque,
though not quite as much as the Align leggings.
Potential Flaws
These leggings, like a few others on our list, only have one pocket. If you need more storage, we recommend purchasing a
gym backpack
for hands-free carrying.
Most Valuable Insight
“The fabric holds me in all of the right areas, and I can use it for a variety of workouts—from lifting to HIIT.” —

lululemon Fabrics, Explained
Luon:
A comfy, cottony soft fabric with four-way stretch and sweat-wicking breathability. It has a soft, lightly brushed feel and is best suited for lower-impact studio classes like yoga, Pilates, barre, and casual wear.
Luxtreme:
A compressive fabric that feels silky smooth and cool to the touch, fitting like a second skin. This supportive, sweat-wicking fabric features four-way stretch with excellent shape retention. The lightweight fabric is highly resistant to pilling and is a strong choice for high-impact workouts.
Everlux:
lululemon’s fastest-drying fabric, best for hot and sweaty studio classes and high-intensity workouts. The sleek and cool sensation on the inside wicks away sweat with a comfortable, buttery soft exterior. Everlux is super lightweight, stretchy, durable, and provides squat-proof coverage.
Nulu:
Known for its "naked sensation," the weightless, buttery-soft Nulu fabric fits like a glove and is ultra-lightweight and breathable. It also offers unbelievable stretch and shape retention. Nulu is not a compressive fabric and is best for lower-impact workouts and casual wear.
Nulux:
Engineered for running with a weightless, ultra-soft feel. The stretchy, quick-drying fabric is soft and smooth against the skin with light compression and support. It's also durable, flexible, and supportive so you can run your best race with comfort and ease.
SmoothCover:
A soft, supportive, matte fabric that effortlessly contours to your body. Its four-way stretch and sweat-wicking properties ensure you’ll stay dry and comfortable, even during the toughest workouts.
SenseKnit:
Features targeted support right where you need it the most. Meant for running, this fabric is sweat-wicking and quick-drying. It’s lightweight enough to keep you cool and will perform well, no matter how many miles you take on.
So, Are lululemon Leggings Worth It?
A pair of lululemon leggings typically costs between $98 and $158. They are by no means the cheapest leggings on the market, but we think they're worth the price given the high-quality materials and superior fit. After testing dozens of pairs of lululemon leggings, we confidently recommend the options on this list.
What to Look for When Shopping for lululemon Leggings
Five key features to look for in leggings.
Verywell Fit / Michelle Parente
Rise:
lululemon leggings come in mid-rise, high-rise, and super-high-rise. The rise refers to how far up the waistband comes when you put the leggings on. The higher the rise, the higher up the waistband will sit. Higher rise leggings will also offer more support, since the waistband comes up farther. Choose the rise that reflects the style and level of support you like the most.
Length:
The inseam length determines how long the leggings will be. lululemon offers a range of inseam lengths, to help you find the right fit. Cropped styles range from 17- to 23-inch inseams. Ankle to full-length styles range from 25- to 31-inch inseams, depending on your height.
Fit:
Most of the brand’s leggings fit true to size. Leggings should be fitted, but not so tight that you can’t move easily in them. Make sure the waistband doesn’t dig into your skin and stays up during wear with no gapping. Look for high-waisted leggings if you want a better fit so you won’t have to worry about pulling your pants up, says certified personal trainer
Holly Roser, CPT
.
Compression:
Many of lululemon’s leggings offer compression, or the snug-fitting feel that provides a held-in sensation and a more streamlined fit. You might choose compression leggings if you plan to participate in sports or high-intensity workouts (like running or HIIT). Leggings made from the brand’s Luxtreme fabric will usually offer this type of compression, but you can find it in other options as well.
Pockets:
Plenty of lululemon leggings come with one or more pockets, so you can choose the pair that meets your needs for whatever you need to carry. Waistband pockets are typically for small items, like a key or credit card. Drop-in pockets on the sides or back are often large enough to hold your phone. Some leggings have zippered or fold-over pockets for added security.

How We Tested the lululemon Leggings
To find the best lululemon leggings, we tested 23 different pairs both in The Verywell Testing Lab and at home in the real world. We wore each pair of leggings for low- and high-impact workouts and everyday wear. During testing, we evaluate each pair of leggings based on the following criteria:
Material:
When we first try on the leggings, we pay attention to how the material feels: Is it soft? Smoothing? Compressive? Stretchy? As we work out in the leggings, we also note whether they’re breathable and sweat-wicking. We prioritize leggings that combine comfortable and functional materials.
Opacity:
To test the opacity, we look for sheer spots prior to putting the leggings on. Then, we complete different variations of bends and squats to see if there is any sheering at the knee and glutes. Finally, a month after consistent use, we do the same opacity to test to ensure the quality holds up over time.
Fit:
Leggings are supposed to feel like a second skin and should be snug in the right places—like the butt, thighs, and calves—without causing discomfort. When trying each pair on, we consider if they fit true to size: Do they bunch up or pinch anywhere? We also note if the seams are discreet and whether the cut is proportionate in size.
Hold:
Hold is arguably one of the most important factors to keep in mind when looking for a pair of leggings—you want them to stay in place, especially for workouts. To test the hold, we draw a line with a pen where the top of the waistband sits on our stomach. Then, we set a timer for 60 seconds to jog in place, do some squats, lunges, jumping jacks, and more. When time is up, we check to see if the waistband slid down.
Durability:
lululemon leggings are not cheap, which means you’ll want them to withstand frequent workouts and wash cycles. Throughout testing, we follow the brand’s wash and dry guidelines. After each wear and wash, we evaluate the legging to check for any changes in overall quality: Have they maintained their shape, color, opacity, seams? We only recommend leggings that show little to no signs of wear.
Value:
Finally, to determine the value of each lululemon legging, we wait to look at its price until after testing. Then, taking into consideration each of the above-tested categories, we determine if they’re worth the price. We only include leggings that we would personally purchase or recommend to a friend.
Our Experts
To ensure the best recommendations, we consulted experts during our research, testing, and reporting for this story. Some experts helped us determine how lululemon leggings should fit and feel, while others explained which features to look for and how to find a pair that’ll work for your needs. Although we choose the products independently, we use expert input to influence our choices.

Why Trust Verywell Fit
Verywell Fit / Zackary Angeline
It's no secret that pushing through tough
strength training workouts
can be hard on your hands. Beyond pesky calluses, lifting weights can result in scratched rings and trapped sweat—that's where silicone rings come in. These
flexible, breathable
alternatives have plenty of benefits:
Gerry Bernstone
, health and fitness officer at Marketplace Fairness, loves his because it prevents him from worrying about scratching or damaging his metal band. "They are
comfortable and lightweight,
" he adds. "Perfect for people who are active and need a ring that won't get in the way."
To find the best silicone rings, we first spoke with experts to understand which
key features
are most important to consider as you shop. Then,
we compared dozens of rings
from top brands at different price points. To create our final list of recommendations, we considered each ring's
silhouette, size, comfort, and price.
We also had a certified personal trainer from our
Review Board
review this article for accuracy, including how silicone rings can protect your fingers and who should consider wearing one.

Why We Love It
Groove Life’s Original Solid Colored Ring
is our top overall pick because its
unique design,
complete with breathable inner channels, comes in a
wide variety of colors.
We also like that it’s protected by a
lifetime warranty,
so you can feel confident whether you’re hitting the gym, the slopes, or the waves.
Made from medical-grade silicone, the Original Solid Ring is meant to feel tight at first. But after a few days of wear, it will relax to create a
snug, custom-like fit.
Stretchy and flexible, the structure of the ring also protects your fingers—it’s made with
breaking points
that will snap before the ring puts too much pressure on your finger, should you accidentally snag it on something.
Potential Flaws
This ring is pricier than others on our list, but we like that your investment is protected by a lifetime warranty.
We wish it was available in half sizes.

Why We Love It
With an unprecedented selection of designs,
Groove Life’s Aspire Ring
is our other top pick because it’s noticeably beautiful—without being flashy. The ring’s elastomer blend lends itself to both
durability and safety.
Just like Groove Life’s Solid Colored Ring, the Aspire Ring features
breathable channels
that make it easy to wear the ring from the gym to the office. What makes it different is that
the silicone is pre-relaxed,
so there’s no break-in time needed.
The rounded design cuts down on how much silicone is actually touching your finger
to help minimize sweat
. Plus, the company’s
lifetime warranty
even covers a lost ring for more forgetful wearers.
Potential Flaws
This ring doesn’t come in half sizes, so finding the right fit might be difficult.

With a sleek, metallic finish,
ROQ’s Silicone Wedding Rings
are our favorite budget-friendly pick. Sold as a single ring or in packs of four and seven, there’s an option for everyone. We recommend these rings for those who work in jobs where safety is a concern—the ring is
designed to break when it's overstretched.
ROQ also offers a
lifetime warranty,
so you can give it a try with full peace of mind.
Potential Flaws
We like that these rings come in several colors, styles, and sizes. But they don’t have a breathable interior pattern, like other rings on our list do.

Why We Love It
Enso’s Dualtone Ring
is our top pick for an engravable silicone ring because it’s
soft to the touch, comfortable to wear, and customizable.
With a unisex design, this smooth, lightweight ring comes in a range of
two-tone options,
so it’s easy to choose one that matches your wardrobe and personality.
You can engrave the outside of the ring for an extra fee—a great way to add a special message for your partner. The Dualtone Ring also comes with a
lifetime warranty,
so you can be confident that you’ll get a fast replacement if anything happens.
Potential Flaws
While this ring isn’t available in half sizes, Enso does offer a wider variety of ring sizes than many other silicone ring brands do, from 3 to 14.

Why We Love It
With a
lightweight, durable design, Groove Life’s Zeus Edge Ring
is our recommendation for a silicone ring that’s worth investing in. Some silicone rings can stretch out over time, making them tough to comfortably wear without finding a replacement. But the Zeus Edge is
extra-wide,
with
anti-stretch nylon
inside that can stand up to tough workouts and everyday wear.
Made with
breathable channels,
this ring is intended to promote airflow for a
barely-there feel.
All of these features add up to a ring that’s both tough and stylish.
Potential Flaws
This ring doesn’t come in half sizes—and the anti-stretch layer means it won’t loosen to create a custom-like fit over time.

Some are matte, while others offer a touch of shimmer to blend in with the rest of your jewelry—and we love the

Wear one at a time or layer several rings for a more modern look. Partners may want to split the pack—the variety of bright and understated options make these rings
a perfect fit for couples,
no matter what your individual styles are.

Why We Love It
Qalo’s Classic Silicone Ring
is our pick for a silicone ring with a classic, timeless design. With
44 pounds of tensile strength,
this ring can stand up to large amounts of pressure, making it a great fit for tough workouts in or out of the gym. We also like that it
has
enough
grip
to stay put, but is soft enough to easily slip on and off (even after
a hot yoga class
).
This ring is an expert favorite:
Kelli Peters
, nutritional therapy practitioner and program director at Noom, loves hers because it
doesn't create calluses
when she lifts weights. It's also
engravable
and
durable
enough to withstand temperatures up to 575 degrees.
Potential Flaws
This ring is thicker than other options on our list, meaning it's not as lightweight. But we like that this design makes it stronger.
It also comes in a smaller size range.

Why We Love It
Want the look of a traditional metal wedding ring with the flexibility and safety of a silicone ring? We recommend
Enso’s Elements Classic Silicone Ring.
Tons of shimmery color options
infused with precious metals
make this ring ideal for those who want to build their own set to match every mood and outfit.
Plus,
breathable channels
help air flow between your fingers and the inside of the ring for all-day, wearable comfort. We also like that Enso offers a
lifetime warranty
to back up your purchase.
Potential Flaws
There are no half sizes—if you're between sizes, size down, as the ring will likely adjust to the size of your finger after a few weeks.
This ring is one of our pricier picks, although we think the realistic finish is worth the additional cost.
What to Look for When Shopping for Silicone Rings
Silhouette:
Silicone rings come in three styles: wedding bands, engagement rings, and stackable bands. Silicone wedding bands look similar to traditional wedding rings, while silicone engagement bands have more intricate designs. Stackable bands are thin, so you can mix and match different colors and finishes. Each style of silicone ring can have its own tensile strength, so check to make sure the ring you're purchasing can stand up to the workouts and other activities you like to do.
Size:
Silicone and metal ring sizes are the same: Most silicone rings come in women's sizes 3 to 14 and men's sizes 7 to 15. Some may stretch to fit your finger over time, creating a custom-like fit. Not all silicone rings come in half sizes—but in this case, the manufacturer will usually recommend whether to size up or down.
Comfort:
A silicone ring's comfort lies in its breathability. Look for options with patterns etched inside to promote airflow while you work out. Copeland likes Groove Life’s rings because they have small holes that prevent sweat from building up, for all-day comfort.
Price:
You can expect to spend between $10 and $60 on a high-quality silicone ring. Less expensive rings may be more likely to stretch out over time and probably won’t offer engraving options. More expensive rings can be engraved and might contain additional materials (beyond silicone) that improve their durability.
How We Selected the Best Silicone Rings
To find the best silicone rings,
we've
researched dozens of options
from the most popular and trusted fitness brands. First,
we speak with experts
to find out which features set high-quality silicone rings apart from the rest. Then, we review each ring's
key specs
and
price point
to find the best options on the market. As we continue to evaluate more silicone rings, we consider each model's
silhouette, size, comfort, and price.
Our Experts
We spoke to experts at every stage of researching and reporting this story.

Frequently Asked Questions
Why do people wear silicone rings?
Compared to traditional metal rings, silicone rings are more durable and easier to replace. They're also safer: Research has shown that people who work with their hands can reduce their risk of finger injuries by wearing silicone rings.
Many are engineered to break under a certain amount of pressure, which protects your fingers.
How long do silicone rings last?
Most silicone rings last between one and three years. Look for information from the manufacturer about what conditions your rings can handle—many are designed to break under large amounts of pressure, and some can only withstand a certain amount of heat or cold. However, many silicone ring brands offer warranties or replacement policies just in case you break (or lose) your ring.
Can you wear silicone rings in the water?
Yes—water shouldn’t damage a silicone ring, so it’s safe to wear yours in the shower, the pool, or the ocean.

Why Trust Verywell Fit
Verywell Fit / Alexander Huang
Shielding your eyes from the sun’s harmful rays while you're
outside being active
is important year-round. A good pair of sports sunglasses will also keep your eyes safe from impact and shield them from wind, dust, and other debris. When shopping for sports sunglasses, choose a pair that's
durable, lightweight, and comfortable to wear,
says
Nicole Lord
,
vice president of merchandising for Now Optics. Consider how and when you’ll be using them—
polarization
will reduce glare, for instance, while
different lens colors
can help you see better in sunny or
low-light conditions
.
To find the best sports sunglasses, we first spoke with running coaches and cycling coaches to learn which key features every pair should have. Then
we tested a dozen frames in the real world,
wearing them for around
70 hours total
during various outdoor activities. We evaluated each pair's
fit, performance, quality, features, and overall value.
We also had an RRCA- and USATF-certified running coach from our
Review Board
review this article for accuracy, including what to look for in sports sunglasses, how they should fit, and whether they can boost your athletic performance.
Tip From the Pros
Never wipe your sunnies off with the hem of your shirt—this can cause scratches or smudges that may affect your visibility, says Lease.

Why We Love Them
Oakley's Flak 2.0 XL Polarized Sunglasses
are one of our clear overall winners. We love that the lenses are built to
enhance contrast and color
for better views—plus, they're
polarized
to cut glare, reduce haze, and eliminate distortion. During our test, the lenses offered
exceptional protection and clarity.
The frames felt lightweight and comfortable, while
grips on the nosepiece and at the temples
kept them in place during sweaty runs (no sliding or bouncing here).
While they have a
lightweight, flexible feel,
these shades are
very sturdy
and performed well in our durability test. They also come with a
hard zippered case
to protect them when not in use. Overall, these sleek, sporty shades are ideal for golf and tennis, but they also work extremely well for walking, running, cycling, water sports, and other activities.
Potential Flaws
These sunnies are pricier than most of our other picks, but we think the additional cost is worth it based on how well they performed in our test.
Most Valuable Insight
“These sunglasses are very lightweight, and the contact points are made from a rubber-like material that does not slip when sweating. They have a snug fit, and, despite the smaller lens size, the glasses have great eye coverage.”

Why We Love Them
Our other best overall pick,
Tifosi's Tyrant 2.0 Sunglasses,
are a lightweight and sturdy option that's ideal for most of your outdoor pursuits. We love that they have a
durable nylon frame, shatterproof lenses,
and nose and ear pieces made from a comfortable hydrophilic rubber that
increases grip as you sweat.
As for features, the
polarized lenses
provide 100% UVA and UVB protection from the sun's harmful rays and get lighter or darker, depending on the amount of sunlight you’re exposed to. These sunnies performed well during our sweat test, staying in place even on wet skin.
Vents
at the top of the lenses
help increase airflow
and
prevent fogging.
The glasses also come with a
zippered shell case and cleaning bag,
to protect your purchase.
Potential Flaws
These lenses aren't as wide, meaning they aren't as protective as some other pairs on our list.
Most Valuable Insight
“I really like the fit and lightweight feel of these glasses. They don't pinch my nose, and the arms don't feel too tight on my head, yet they stay in place and are bounce-free.”

Why We Love Them
Runners need sunglasses that offer excellent protection, but that can also go the distance without slipping, bouncing, or feeling too heavy. Designed for running,
Rudy Project's Propulse Sports Sunglasses
are our top pick whether you enjoy jogging around your neighborhood or
long-distance running
. During our test, they were
easy to wear,
even underneath a running visor. The
soft, rubber nose piece
and
pliable arms
provided a
snug fit
while keeping the shades in place.
We love that the
wide, wrap-around lenses
provide plenty of protection—more than some others we tested.
Ventilation on the lenses and temples
also helps prevent fogging and overheating, so you can run uninterrupted longer.
Triathletes
and
marathon runners
alike will appreciate their thoughtful design and high-quality construction.
Potential Flaws
These sunnies are pricier than some of our other top picks, although we think their runner-friendly features make them worth the investment.
Unlike other sunglasses on our list, these don't come with a protective case.
Most Valuable Insight
“These sunglasses are very lightweight and comfortable and provide excellent protection, especially on the periphery. They really block out the sun and wind but are also well ventilated to allow for cooling and to prevent fogging.”

Why We Love Them
Our top pick for cyclists, we love
Oakley's Sutro Lite Sunglasses
because they're versatile, durable, and comfortable for long rides. They’re wide and tall enough to provide
good protection from the sun and wind,
but still streamlined enough to
fit under a bike helmet.
During testing, we noticed that the soft rubber nose piece, flexible arms, and lightweight feel makes these shades comfortable enough to wear
during daily rides
.
The lenses provide
exceptional clarity, impact protection, and an unobstructed view
—which is critical for riding. They also didn’t fog up during our sweat test. Like other Oakley sunglasses we tested, these shades are clearly
built to last
and can definitely take a beating. We recommend them for cyclists who value
excellent performance and protection.
Potential Flaws
These are pricier than most of our other picks. But for avid cyclists, we think their safety features are tough to beat, making them well worth the additional cost.
Most Valuable Insight
“I was really impressed with the lenses and the contrast and clarity they produced. Plus, these sunglasses are really lightweight and comfortable, which is important for long bike rides.”

Why We Love Them
If you have trouble finding sports sunglasses that aren’t too wide for your face, we recommend
goodr's Circle GS Polarized Sunglasses.
We love that they have
polarized lenses
that block 100 percent of harmful UVA and UVB rays, at a
budget-friendly price.
In testing, they never bounced, pinched, or felt too tight—a
grippy coating keeps them in place,
even as sweat drips down during a sweltering run.
We also found that the lenses provided a
crisp, vibrant view
and
cut down on glare.
If you frequently misplace your sports shades and like to have multiple pairs on hand, these sunglasses are a great option for stocking up. They’re also pretty
sleek
and can serve double-duty for casual wear.
Potential Flaws
We wish these came with a hard-shell case, instead of just a soft microfiber pouch.
Most Valuable Insight
“I have a small face, so I really appreciated the shape and size of these sunglasses. The size felt ‘just right’ for me, and I didn’t notice any bouncing, slipping, or uncomfortable tightness when I wore them.”
—Christine Luff, ACE-CPT, certified personal trainer and Verywell Fit product tester

Torege's Polarized Sports Sunglasses
are
budget-friendly
and built to last. During testing, we immediately noticed that the frame felt lightweight and comfortable, and the rubber nose pads kept them in place even during long periods of wear. We love that the
scratch-resistant and shatterproof lenses
provide crystal-clear views with no distortion. They also
repel water and oils,
which make them a solid choice for water sports or sweat-inducing activities.
Plus, these glasses are
durable:
We didn't find any scratches or signs of damage after we dropped them, and we noticed that the spring hinges on each arm are strong and flexible. With a
lifetime warranty
on the frames and lenses, you can be confident you're purchasing shades that are just as tough as they are effective. We're also impressed that they come with a
hard, zippered case,
which is unexpected at such a budget-friendly price point. If you’re looking for a versatile pair of high-performance shades, these are a great value.
Potential Flaws
These glasses don't have a ton of features that other running sunglasses do—but they come at a budget-friendly price point, which we think is a decent trade-off.
Most Valuable Insight

We love that these glasses boast
durable, shatterproof, and scratch-resistant lenses,
as well as
100% UVA/UVB protection.
They also sailed through our durability test, and they're
super stylish.
We also found that they
lay very flat when folded,
a plus for those who like to stash their shades in a pocket or pouch during runs, hikes, or bike rides.
Potential Flaws
We wish these sunglasses came with a hard-shell case, so we could toss them in
our go-to gym bags
.
Most Valuable Insight

Why We Love Them
For a durable option that pairs well with
your go-to hiking shoes
, we recommend
Smith's Parallel 2 Unisex Polarized Sunglasses.
During our test, the
polarized lenses
offered
exceptional visibility and clarity,
which proved to be a huge asset when hiking on technical trails. We also love that these frames come with
two sets of impact-resistant, interchangeable lenses,
so you can switch them out based on conditions and terrain.
We appreciated the sunglasses’ lightweight feel and snug, comfortable fit in testing, making these a nice choice for all-day wear. They're also
resistant to fogging
and performed well during our sweat test. As for durability, the glasses made it through our drop test without a scratch and feel like they would hold up for long-term use. They also come with a
hard zippered case
and a
soft microfiber pouch
to keep them protected when you're not wearing them.
Potential Flaws
Since the lenses are interchangeable, some wearers have found that they can feel a little loose in the frames.
Most Valuable Insight
“I really like the lightweight feel and sleek, modern look of these sunglasses. They’re also extremely comfortable and come with two sets of interchangeable lenses, so they’re a nice choice for all-day activities such as hiking, where you may be dealing with changing conditions.”

Why We Love Them
Tennis players
need sunglasses that have good protection and clarity, but will also stay securely in place. Bounce-free and lightweight,
Duduma's TR8116 Sports Polarized Sunglasses
are an asset on the court, and we love their
budget-friendly
price tag. During our test, the sunglasses’
polarized lenses
cut down on glare while also
enhancing colors,
making it easy to spot a tennis ball soaring over the net.
We were also impressed by the shades’
comfortable fit and grip,
noting that they stayed put during a sweaty tennis session. Although we noticed that the lenses did fog up a little from moisture, they cleared up fairly quickly. In general, these
versatile
shades are a
good value
and deserve a spot in your courtside arsenal.
Potential Flaws
The budget-friendly price means that these shades lack some extra features, like an anti-fog coating.
We noticed that they're on a smaller side, so they may be too narrow for people with wide faces.
Most Valuable Insight
“For such an affordable price, I was impressed by the quality and durability of these sunglasses. The polarization is top-notch, and the lenses offer good clarity and protection for playing tennis.”

Why We Love Them
If you prefer to wear shades for skiing and other snow sports, Sunski's Treeline Polarized Sunglasses are our top pick. The minute we opened the box, we were impressed by their
cool design.
What sets them apart from other shades on our list are Sunski’s Magni-Snap Sidekicks—
plastic side shades
that shield your eyes from glare, wind, and snow without blocking your peripheral vision. These side screens are
perforated
with tiny holes for ventilation, and they
detach easily
when you want to wear the glasses casually.
During our test, the Treeline's
rubber nose pads
felt comfortable and really kept the sunglasses in place. They also fit nicely under a helmet, hat, or visor—making them a great alternative to goggles, which can be bulky. With a
sleek silhouette,
these sunnies can easily go from the slopes to après ski drinks at the lodge. We also like that they
come with a zippered case
to protect them when you need to stash them in your pocket or bag.
Potential Flaws
We noted that the Forest lenses are very dark, so they might not be ideal for wearing in cloudy conditions.
For the price, we wish these sunnies had an anti-fog coating.
Most Valuable Insight
“I like that they aren’t flimsy and feel very durable. The side screens are a really effective feature and helped to block out light and debris, but they didn’t affect my peripheral vision at all.”

Why We Love Them
When you’re fishing, a high-quality pair of sunglasses can protect your eyes and cut down on the glare. During our test,
Knockaround's Torrey Pines Polarized Sunglasses
proved to be a comfortable, high-performance option for
all-day wear on the water. The
extra-wide, impact-resistant lenses
provide plenty of coverage without being too bulky. We also like that the arms have spring hinges, for a little give.
The glasses offered a
comfortable, snug fit
without feeling constricting. During our test, these glasses did an excellent job of blocking bright sunlight and
reducing glare.
Overall, we like them for fishing, boating, or a day at the beach—and, with a
budget-friendly price,
you won’t feel too guilty if you accidentally drop them in the water.
Potential Flaws
These sunglasses are a bit heavier than some others we tested, so we don't recommend them for running or cycling.
Most Valuable Insight
"I was impressed with the clarity and quality of the lenses. I wouldn’t expect polarization at such an inexpensive price."
—Brad Luff, Verywell Fit product tester

Why We Love Them
Whether your kids are playing at the beach or on the baseball field,
Duco's Kids Sunglasses
can protect their eyes from harmful rays, as well as from sand, dirt, and other debris. The polarized lenses
block 100% of UVA, UVB, and UVC rays
and did an excellent job of
reducing glare
during our test.
The sunglasses are
impact- and scratch-resistant,
with a flexible rubber frame that's perfect for
active kids
who can be rough on their gear. Our 13-year-old tester was impressed by how well the glasses fit and held up during testing. The
arms are flexible
enough to hold up to bending and pulling, and we love that you get a
hard, zippered case
with your purchase for better storage and protection.
Potential Flaws
During testing, we noticed that these sunnies slipped a little when they got wet.
Most Valuable Insight
“I thought they did a good job in bright sunlight. I could see clearly, and they felt comfortable.”
—Brendan Luff, Verywell Fit product tester
What to Look for When Shopping for Sports Sunglasses
Fit:
Lord notes that well-fitting sunnies won't move, slide down, or leave marks on your face when you take them off. And the lenses shouldn’t have contact with your cheeks—this can be uncomfortable and may lead to fogging.
Shape:
Sports sunglasses come in wraparound, full-frame, half-frame, and rimless styles. Some pairs are better-suited for certain faces, notes
Stephen Lease
, CEO and co-founder of goodr sunglasses. Also, consider how your sunglasses will pair with your other equipment, says Lord: "Straight temples allow a seamless fit with a helmet."
Material:
For all-day wear, you’ll want sunnies that are lightweight and comfortable. If you plan to wear your shades during intense activities, opt for durable materials, like shatterproof plastic. Pro tip: Non-slip rubber on the nosepiece will prevent them from sliding down.
Coating:
Your sunglasses should provide 100% protection from harmful UV radiation, to prevent eye diseases and other kinds of damage.
Polarized lenses help reduce glare and haze, making them a good choice for water sports, golf, and tennis. Anti-fog and water-resistant coatings are also nice to have.
Lenses:
Different-colored can improve visibility under certain conditions. Gray lenses are ideal for bright, sunny days. Yellow and orange tints enhance contrast in low-light or overcast conditions. Brown lenses reduce glare while improving your visual acuity and depth perception, making them a great choice for cycling and golf, according to Lord.

To find the best sports sunglasses, we've tested a dozen options from popular, trusted brands for around 70 hours. As we wear them during our workouts and daily routines, we evaluate each pair based on the following criteria:
Fit:
When we first try the sunglasses on, we note which style they are and how well they fit. Are they comfortable, and do they fit our faces well? Do they need adjusting, or do they sit straight on our noses?
Performance:
We wear the sunnies casually and during workouts that match their recommended use (like runs and outdoor bike rides). Do they effectively shade our eyes from the sun and reduce glare? Do they block wind, dust, and debris? We also spritz our faces with water to simulate sweat—this helps us test the sunglasses' grip and comfort.
Quality:
Throughout the testing period, we consider how high-quality the sunglasses feel. We also perform a durability test by dropping the sunglasses from waist height onto pavement, examining each pair for any scratches or cracks. We take points off if the sunglasses show significant signs of wear and tear by the end of the testing period.
Features:
Are the sunglasses polarized? Does the brand claim they have any other special features, like an anti-fog or water-resistant coating? If so, we make sure to test these claims.
Overall Value:
To rate each pair's value, we don't check the price until the end of the testing period, after we've evaluated it in all other categories. Based on how well the sunglasses performed, do we think they're priced fairly? We also consider whether we'd recommend them to a friend or family member.
Our Experts
We spoke to experts at every stage while researching and reporting this story. Some, like Lord, explained why wearing sports sunglasses can be beneficial and taught us how they should fit. Although we choose products independently, advice from experts influences our decisions.

Why Trust Verywell Fit
Verywell Fit / Sara Michael
Investing in a high-quality, comfortable, and weather-resistant running jacket is essential for blocking the cold, rain, wind, and snow. While all running jackets should keep you warm and protected, some have reflective details for running safely in the dark, while others feature pockets for stashing small essentials,
energizing snacks
, or
extra gear
.
To find the best running jackets for women, we first asked running experts for their advice on which
key features
to look for when shopping for a high-quality option. Then, we zipped up and hit the trails, beaches, and roads to
test
26 expert-approved jackets
from top brands. We wore them on extremely windy, rainy, and cold runs, evaluating each option for
fit, comfort, design, durability, and value
. We also had a Doctor of Physical Therapy and RRCA-certified run coach from our
Review Board
review this article for accuracy.

Overall Rating:

Who It’s For
Best for those who want a durable, high-quality running jacket for daily runs and hikes in cool to cold weather.
Why We Love It
Athleta’s Run With It Jacket
is versatile, durable, and
packed with cool features
,
making it our top overall pick. During testing, it kept us
comfortable and protected
during extreme wind running on the beach, long hikes, beach walks, and everyday errands. We love its breathability, which prevents us from overheating, especially on long hikes and runs. And when conditions heat up, it’s light enough for us to tie around our waist easily.
We love its smart design, which features four zippered pockets, reflective details, thumb holes, and a high neckline that can be worn up or rolled down. Its fabric is
water-repellent, abrasion-resistant,
and
rated UPF 50+
, meaning it blocks at least 98% of the sun’s rays.
We were also impressed by how well it kept its shape after multiple washes, with
no pilling or fraying
in sight.
Potential Flaws
This jacket runs a bit large. This can be helpful if you like to layer up for your runs. If you prefer not to layer, we recommend sizing down.
Most Valuable Insight
"This is a quality running jacket you'll have for years. It's great on its own or layered. Plus, it's very breathable and keeps me comfortable on my runs. I love its design—two pockets to zip my phone and other items in, thumb holes, and a high-zip neck that can be cuffed or rolled up."

Who It’s For
Best for
beginner runners
or for those running in mild weather who want a stylish, budget-friendly running jacket.
Why We Love It
With a flattering style and thoughtful details,
90 Degree By Reflex’s Running Track Jacket
looks and performs like a high-end jacket at a
budget-friendly price
. We love its contoured fit and
soft, stretchy material
that moves with us as we run. And, even though it’s sleek, it doesn’t ride up or feel clingy, no matter how long our runs are.
During testing, we liked that this jacket kept us warm but was still
breathable
enough to prevent us from overheating. We like wearing ours in mild to moderate weather since it’s not too thick, and we can easily wear a thin layer underneath. With a
full-zip design
,
zippered front pockets
(perfect for storing our keys and energy gels),
and
thumb holes
, this jacket’s features set it apart from others in the same price range—making it an even better value.
Potential Flaws
This jacket may run small, so we recommend sizing up for a roomier fit.
Although this jacket held up nicely in the wash, its material doesn’t feel as durable as other pricier options we tested. Still, considering its price, we think this is a fair trade-off.
Most Valuable Insight
"This is an ideal fall running jacket: not too thick, so I don't get overly hot, can fit a tank/thin layer underneath comfortably, and stretchy fabric. It's also a full zip, which makes it easier to get on and off. Plus, I like using it as a cover-up for walking to a fitness class or gym."

Who It’s For
Best for tall runners or those with long torsos who want to invest in a high-quality, stylish running jacket made with water-repellant and wind-resistant fabric.
Why We Love It
If you’re looking to invest in a running jacket you’ll have for years,
lululemon's
Another Mile Jacket
is our top pick. This
water-repellant, wind-resistant
jacket is built to last and can handle plenty of blustery days. During chilly runs in 40-degree weather, we loved how lightweight it felt, while still keeping us comfortable and warm. Plus, it's
incredibly durable
—we wore ours in extremely windy, cold, and light rainy conditions and found that it held up very well.
We appreciate that this jacket has
thumb holes, zippered pockets,
and
reflective details
. We also like the versatility and protection its cozy
removable hood
offers. While we preferred to remove it for our runs, we loved wearing it on our
cold-weather morning walks
. With a stylish, streamlined silhouette, it quickly became a daily staple in our routine.
Potential Flaws
This jacket is fairly long. Although it didn’t restrict our movement, it may be too long for some petite runners.
Most Valuable Insight
"I love this jacket! It's so versatile! During runs, I felt warm but not overheated, and its fabric still felt lightweight. In addition to wearing it on runs, this quickly became my fave option for running errands and taking long walks, as it's a fantastic jacket overall."

Who It’s For
Best for those who plan on running during the day in very cold weather (around 30-degrees and below).
Why We Love It
Designed for running in very cold weather,
Brooks’ Shield Hybrid Jacket 2.0
is the best winter jacket we tested. During testing, we noticed how
cozy and protective
its insulation felt during cold, windy runs. We love how it kept us warm without adding too much weight or bulk. When we did start to heat up, we loved how its fabric effectively wicked moisture away, keeping us
dry and comfortable
on the trail.
We found that its
stretchy, flexible material
allows for a comfortable fit while providing a good range of motion. With four exterior pockets and one interior pocket, this
wind-resistant
jacket also offers lots of
convenient storage
for your phone and other essentials. We especially love using the open side pocket to stash our
running gloves
so they can be easily accessed when our hands get chilly. Plus, we love how well it holds up to laundering, making it a breeze to keep fresh and clean.
Potential Flaws
We wish this jacket had some reflective details. To remedy this, you can avoid running when it's dark or opt for
reflective running gear
, like armbands, headbands, and pants, to ensure you'll be seen when running.
Its zipper got stuck a few times, which bothered us. However, it didn't break, and we could still use it properly.
Most Valuable Insight
"This jacket fits true to size and is very comfortable. It has lots of give and flexibility on the sides, making it super comfortable. It's one of the best-fitting running jackets I've tried."

Who It’s For
Best for runners who want a waterproof running jacket chock full of storage that can stand up to rainy day runs.
Why We Love It
Baleaf’s DWR Hooded Windbreaker
has five pockets, an adjustable hood, and is fully waterproof, making it a great option for anyone who sticks to their outdoor
running routine
, come rain or shine. With so many deep pockets available, we love having so much space for our phones, keys, gloves, snacks, and gels. Other useful features we love include
reflective elements
for low-light visibility and an
adjustable hood
that can be cinched closed for protection from rain and wind.
During testing, this jacket proved
extremely functional and comfortable
for running and everyday wear. We also found that it’s not nearly as thin as most traditional windbreakers are, adding to its durability. With a variety of colors to choose from and a
budget-friendly
price tag, we think this running jacket is a great option for anyone who loves to run or take
fitness walks
in the rain.
Potential Flaws
While we love the hood's protection, it would be nice if it were detachable so we could use this jacket as just a windbreaker.
Most Valuable Insight
"This running jacket's price point makes it accessible for many individuals, and its exceptional fit makes it an option runners of all levels will also enjoy, whether for 1 mile or a rainy
half marathon
."

Who It’s For
Best for runners who are looking for a durable, waterproof, and super cozy running jacket that will last.
Why We Love It
With a design that held up through many wears and washes and an
easy-to-clean shell
for those extra muddy runs,
lululemon’s Cross Chill Jacket
is the most durable option we tested. It delivered excellent protection from wind and moisture and was
easy to move in
, which isn’t always the case with waterproof and windproof jackets. We also love lululemon’s attention to detail: The cuffs are made from soft, silky material, making us excited to wear this jacket.
This jacket's fleece lining feels soft and protective in cool temperatures but remains
breathable and lightweight
. We found it worked best in mild to moderate fall and winter weather, offering just the right amount of warmth and protection. We also love its
four zippered pockets
, subtle reflective detailing, thumb holes, and a cinchable hood. Even better, there’s a hidden phone sleeve to protect your tech. Plus, it stands up extremely well to laundering and is a breeze to spot-clean.
Potential Flaws
While this jacket is pricier than some other options on our list, we think its high quality, functional design, and durability are worth the additional investment.
This jacket may run small—consider sizing up, especially if you want room for layering underneath.
Most Valuable Insight
"This jacket still looks great after wearing and washing. Its outside material is easy to clean if you kick up mud on a run. It's high-quality and well-made."

Who It’s For
Best for runners who are looking for a high-quality, lightweight windbreaker.
Why We Love It
lululemon’s Mist Over Windbreaker
is our top pick for a reliable three-season jacket and windbreaker. During testing, it impressed us by blocking harsh wind despite its
lightweight
construction. It’s
breathable and water-repellent
but still feels soft and stretchy—a rare combination in a windbreaker. And when temperatures rose by 15 degrees on our morning runs, this jacket helped regulate our body heat to prevent us from overheating and becoming sweaty.
This running jacket really won us over with its smart design and flattering style. We love the thumb holes and no-bounce loop that keeps the hood tucked away when it’s not needed. We especially like its
large zippered back pocket
for storing our energy gels for longer runs. Plus, it feels very
durable
and
high-quality
: Even after wearing it many times in wind, light rain, and heavy downpours, we didn’t notice any pilling, rips, or wear and tear.
Potential Flaws
This jacket tends to run small—we had to size up to find the perfect fit.
Most Valuable Insight
"This is the best windbreaker I've ever tried. It's an ideal three-season jacket (maybe four if you live in mild climates). It's super lightweight and breathable yet helps to cut through windy conditions. It's excellent quality and comfortable to wear."

Who It’s For
Best for runners who want a lightweight, travel-friendly running jacket for milder weather.
Why We Love It
Lightweight, windproof, and packable,
Patagonia’s Houdini Jacket
is our top pick for a mild-weather running jacket. We like that it can be worn on its own or over a base layer when the weather gets brisk. When we tested this jacket, we loved its
barely-there feel
. We also appreciate its
adjustable hood and waist
, which we tightened for a more snug fit. Plus, elastic around the wrists offers a comfy, secure fit.
We love that it folds into its chest pocket for easy portability. With a
water-resistant finish
, this jacket is a great option for
long runs
in unpredictable weather since you can easily tie it around your waist. It also held up extremely well in the wash. Plus, its fabric is very
durable
,
so you don’t have to worry about snagging it on branches or bushes during trail runs.
Potential Flaws
Although this jacket has one zippered pocket in the front, we wish it offered more storage.
Most Valuable Insight
"Like all Patagonia products, this jacket is extremely durable and comfortable. It washes impeccably and seems brand new after multiple wears."

Who It’s For
Best for runners looking for a lightweight, reflective jacket ideal for running at dawn or dusk.
Why We Love It
More flexible than a raincoat but not as heavy-duty as winter outerwear, a lightweight running jacket can be worn in many seasons and conditions. During testing,
L.L.Bean’s Bean Bright Multisport Jacket
provided reliable protection during our windy, cold, and wet weather runs. Plus, it’s very
breathable
, keeping us dry and comfortable without allowing sweat to build up underneath.
With its bright colors and
reflective details
, this jacket has impressive visibility in low-light conditions. We also like that the sleeves are slightly longer than the typical running jacket for extra coverage, which can be especially helpful if
outdoor cycling
is part of your cross-training plan. Even better, this jacket has
five front and back pockets
, providing plenty of space to stash our phone, gloves, and other essentials.
Potential Flaws
This jacket runs large, which is ideal if you plan on wearing it with layers. If you want a closer fit, you may want to size down.
Most Valuable Insight
"I absolutely love this jacket's comfort. I felt weighed down by other jackets, but this one is light and still incredibly helpful against the wind and cold. I'll be using this frequently in my cold weather run routine."

Who It’s For
Best for runners who want to invest in a lightweight, breathable jacket loaded with thoughtful features.
Why We Love It
On’s Weather Jacket
is a performance-tech running jacket designed for optimal breathability and ventilation in wet, windy conditions. When testing this jacket, we liked that its waist drawcord created a
comfortable, secure fit
. As we ran on the beach, we noticed that this
ultra-lightweight
layer still provided exceptional protection from the wind. We also appreciate its
adjustable hood
, which includes a visor to keep the rain out of our face.
In addition to its weather-resistant finish, it features an
anti-odor treatment
to keep you feeling fresh and comfortable. Other helpful features include a
reflective logo
and a slot to thread our earbuds through. Its front zippered pocket is also water-resistant and can fit most phones. We love that we can fold the entire jacket up into its pocket, making it a breeze to travel with. Plus, it washes well and is quick-drying.
Potential Flaws
We love this jacket so much, but we wish it had more than one pocket for additional storage.
Although this jacket is pricier than others on our list, its handy features make it worth the extra cost.
Most Valuable Insight
"This jacket's material is truly a marvel and is magical for running in the wind. It blocks the wind so well while also feeling paper-thin. It's also engineered for easy packing and traveling."

Who It’s For
Best for exercisers who run in very cold weather and want a warm, water-resistant running jacket with a comfy hood.
Why We Love It
lululemon’s Down For It All Jacket
has all the necessary features to keep you comfortable and warm in below-freezing temperatures, including a very cozy hood. During testing, this jacket felt
surprisingly lightweight
and not bulky despite its warm goose-down filling. And its high collar and hood kept cold, windy air out during our runs.
Windproof and water-resistant
, with convenient thumb holes, this jacket checks a lot of boxes we look for in functional outerwear. Its fleece fabric is brushed for additional warmth and has
four-way stretch
that moves nicely with us on our runs. Added insulation in the shoulders, sleeves, and hood traps heat even when wet, keeping us warm and comfortable in very cold weather.
Potential Flaws
This jacket is pricier than some other options on our list, but we think it’s priced fairly considering its thoughtful, high-performance design.
This jacket has a very slim fit, even compared to other lululemon jackets we tested. We recommend sizing up, especially if you prefer a looser fit.
Most Valuable Insight
"Despite how warm it is, this jacket is super comfortable to run in and is lightweight. It has ample storage, including zippered pockets and a drop-in pocket that fits my phone. It also has a removable hood and thumb holes, and is windproof and water-resistant."

Women's Running Jackets We Also Tested
We tested 26 running jackets for women, but only 11 earned a spot on our final list of recommendations. While these other jackets impressed us in some ways, they ultimately fell short in one or more key categories.
We like that
Brooks’ Run Visible Convertible Jacket
comes with a detachable vest that can be worn over any top for added visibility in low-light situations. But on one of our test runs, the zippers on both internal pockets broke—a disappointing flaw for an expensive jacket.
Baleaf’s Windproof Thermal Running Jacket
is durable and protective, but its fabric is too thick and stiff—we didn’t feel comfortable while running in it.
Columbia’s Park View Grid Fleece Full Zip
Jacket
scored well for its cozy comfort, which we found was great for cool weather runs. But we wish it had reflective details, and we noticed that the sizing runs pretty small.
What to Look for When Shopping for Running Jackets for Women
Weather Resistance:
Most running jackets are wind- and water-resistant for some protection from the elements. But to stay completely dry in the pouring rain, you’ll need a waterproof jacket with a breathable membrane to help keep your temperature in check. Some runners prefer to have a few running jackets for varying conditions, including waterproof jackets for heavy downpours and water-resistant options for drizzles or light snowfall.
Fit:
A running jacket should fit properly, feel comfortable, and allow you to access your full range of motion. Look for something form-fitting but allows your upper body to move freely as you run.
Materials:
Look for jackets made from comfortable, stretchy, breathable materials with excellent moisture-wicking abilities. We recommend technical fabrics and synthetic blends, like polyester, Lycra, spandex, and nylon. Don’t run in a jacket made from cotton—it holds onto moisture and can put you at risk for frostbite or hypothermia in cold temperatures.
Pockets:
The weather can change quickly during a run, so it’s nice to have a jacket with some room to stash a winter hat and gloves in case you need them. Pockets are also handy for storing safety items, like your phone, money, ID, and
long-run nutrition options.
Look for a jacket with at least one zippered pocket to securely tuck your essentials away. A waterproof pocket that will keep your phone and other items dry is a huge plus, says running coach
Whitney Heins
.
Reflectivity:
Check to see if the jacket has reflective trim, stripes, or other designs on the front and back to increase your visibility in low-light conditions. Although you can always add some reflective elements, it’s nice when a jacket has some built into the design.

How We Tested the Running Jackets for Women
To select the best running jackets for women, we tested 26 products from trusted brands, wearing them while running on chilly beaches, roads, and trails. When testing running jackets for women, we evaluate each option based on the following key criteria.
Fit:
When we try the jacket on, we check to make sure it’s comfortable and has a snug, secure fit that doesn’t impede our movement. Are the sleeves too short or too long? Is there room to layer underneath? Can it stretch to accommodate different body shapes and sizes?
Comfort:
We prioritize running jackets made from soft, smooth materials. Do we notice any zippers, seams, or tags that cause
discomfort or chafing
? How well does the jacket wick moisture away? We also look for well-ventilated options that prevent overheating.
Design:
We pay attention to how warm the jacket keeps us and how effective its features are. If the jacket is waterproof, water-resistant, or windproof, we note whether it protects us from the elements. Additionally, we consider any special design features the jacket has—like pockets, reflectivity, or thumb holes—and how useful they are.
Durability:
During the testing period, we wash the jacket multiple times according to the manufacturer's instructions and evaluate how it holds up. We check for signs of wear, including fraying, fading, or pilling. Does it keep its shape, color, and warmth?
Value:
To give each jacket an accurate value score, we don't look at its cost until we evaluate it in other key categories. When we check its price, we ask ourselves if its quality and performance justify its cost. Would we recommend it to someone else? Generally, jackets with a high value score cost less than or the same as what we expect to pay.
Our Experts
We consulted experts at each stage of our research, testing, and reporting process. The following experts assisted us during the testing process and helped us better understand what key features to look for in a high-quality running jacket. Although we choose products independently, expert input influences our choices.

Frequently Asked Questions
Should a running jacket be loose or tight?
A running jacket shouldn’t be overly loose to prevent too much cold air from flowing in, says Moloznik. But it also shouldn’t be so tight that it restricts your movement.
Do I need a waterproof jacket for running?
Water-resistant jackets may be protective enough for running in light rain, but waterproof ones are designed to keep all water out. If you live in a snowy, rainy, or otherwise wet climate, you may want to consider purchasing a waterproof jacket to keep you dry and warm.
Do running jackets keep you warm?
Yes, running jackets should keep you warm and dry, Delaney says. Depending on the conditions, you may need a lightweight, windbreaker-style jacket or a thicker, insulated one to help regulate your temperature.
Are down jackets good for running?
Down jackets can be good for running on clear, cold days with light, dry snow since down is typically water-resistant (not waterproof).

Why Trust Verywell Fit
Verywell Fit / Claire Bugos
Preparing for a bike ride requires the right gear, from a well-fitted helmet to quality cycling shoes. And what nears the top of the list of biking essentials is a quality pair of padded bike gloves. While standard bike gloves prevent calluses and soreness, the best padded bike gloves add an extra layer of comfort and protection so you can focus on your ride. When choosing the best padded bike gloves for you, look for a pair that is
comfortable, protective, moisture-wicking, and durable.
To find the best padded bike gloves on the market, first consulted bike experts to learn more about what key features to look for. Then,
we tested 14 best-selling pairs
from popular cycling gear brands. While riding, we evaluated each pair for
comfort, moisture-wicking, grip, and overall value.
We also had a USA Cycling- and USA Triathlon-certified coach from our
Review Board
review this article for accuracy, what to look for in padded bike gloves, and what benefits they potentially can provide.

MOREOK Cycling Gloves

$17 at Amazon
Pros
Budget-friendly
Easily adjustable
Durable
Cons
Somewhat bulky
MOREOK’s Cycling Gloves stand out for their consistent comfort, moisture-wicking capabilities, solid grip, and overall value—we think they’re worth their budget-friendly price and then some. These gloves never let us down when riding—they kept hands protected, dry, and pain-free even after two hours or more of cycling.
Featuring shock-proof gel pads, an anti-slip coating, and reinforced micro-fiber cloth, the gloves are durable enough for years of rugged rides to come. We appreciate the adjustable hook and loop closure for a customized fit, as well as the standard fingerless design that makes reaching for your phone, water, or a mid-ride snack even easier. But we do wish this somewhat bulky pair of gloves had a more streamlined look, like Specialized’s Women's Body Geometry Gloves (our best gel pick). However, this pair is a great, affordable option for those who don’t mind some extra bulk for added protection.

Best for Road Cycling
Giro SIV Men’s Road Cycling Gloves
PHOTO: Amazon
$25 at Amazon
Pros
Suitable for warm weather
Lightweight and breathable
Easily adjustable
Cons
Not padded enough for mountain biking
In order to reap the many
benefits of outdoor cycling
, you need comfortable and durable gear to keep you in the zone. We love Giro’s SIV Men’s Road Cycling Gloves because they kept us comfortable, secure, and focused on
working our muscles
during each ride throughout testing. And we specifically recommend this pair for warm weather wear, thanks to its breathable, moisture-wicking fabric.
Unlike our plush best overall pick, these gloves are thin with minimal padding—making them a better pick for hot and sweaty days but not ideal for cold weather or very bumpy rides on rugged terrain.
We appreciate the microfiber suede palm that provided a tacky grip, regardless of how much sweat sneaks between your hand and handlebars. This pick will cost you a little bit more than MOREOK’s Cycling Gloves Bike Gloves, but we think it’s well worth it for outdoor cyclists with sweaty hands that need grip and protection without the bulk.

Best Gel
Specialized Body Geometry Dual-Gel Short Finger Gloves

View on Specialized.com
Pros
Easily adjustable
Streamlined look
Lightweight and breathable
Cons
May run small
When testing, we had total control of our rides in this pair of padded bike gloves, thanks to their advanced anti-slip grip. The pair features a similar level of padding and comfort to MOREOK’s Cycling Gloves (our best overall pick) but with two layers of gel pads for optimal shock absorption and vibration damping.
Our only complaint, the Specialized Women's Body Geometry Dual-Gel Short Finger Gloves might run a bit small. While we found them to be super comfortable and protective during our test, one of our testers did complain about feeling a bit constricted and needed to size up for a more freeing fit.
This pair is a bit pricer than other options on our list, but we think it’s worth it for frequent cyclists who prefer thick gel padding to get them through tough rides like mountain biking.

GEARONIC Shockproof Short Gloves
PHOTO: Amazon
$12 at Amazon
Pros
Very solid grip
Streamlined look
Easily adjustable
Cons
Not moisture-wicking during longer rides
GEARONIC’s Shockproof Short Gloves are, like most other picks on our list, a fingerless padded bike glove that will protect your hands while riding on all types of terrains. But what sets this pair apart is their super budget-friendly price.
During test rides, we found the gloves to fit well and provide a really solid grip. And at the start of rides, they felt super breathable, keeping our hands comfortable and dry. But the longer we rode, the more sweat built up inside the gloves—causing the velcro closure to loosen and the gloves to move around.
While we still think these are a great option for a 30-minute to hour-long bike ride, if you plan on riding for longer distances, we recommend spending just a little bit more on MOREOK’s Cycling Gloves for longer-lasting sweat-wicking capabilities.

PEARL IZUMI Elite Gel Cycling Glove

$38
$34 at Amazon
Pros
Generous padding
Easily adjustable
Good for mountain biking
Cons
Somewhat bulky
Whether you ride outside in cool climates or warm weather, PEARL IZUMI’s Elite Gel Cycling Gloves will keep your hands protected, dry, and comfortable. The generously padded palm features a cooling gel and ventilation holes for optimal breathability. We especially appreciate the extra padding on the balls of the hand and at the base of the thumb for added shock absorption when riding on rough terrains.
While testing, we completed long and sweaty rides on an indoor cycling bike and had no issues with sweat retention or overheating when wearing these gloves. It’s important to note that because of the additional padding, this pair feels somewhat bulkier than some other options on our list. So if you're going for a more streamlined, versatile look, we recommend opting for our best gel pick, Specialized’s Women's Body Geometry Dual-Gel Short Finger Gloves.

Best for Beginners
PEARL IZUMI Women’s Select Glove
PHOTO: Amazon
$27 at Amazon
Pros
Streamlined look
Versatile
Budget-friendly
Cons
Not padded enough for mountain biking
PEARL IZUMI’s Women’s Select Gloves are great for beginners because they provide comfort, protection, and good grip—all at a low-stakes price. We tested this pair outdoors in warm and cool climates and even completed one test ride on an indoor cycling bike. During all of our test rides, these gloves never slipped due to excess moisture retention, thanks to their breathable, sweat-wicking material.
Similar to Giro’s SIV Men’s Road Cycling Gloves, this pick features less padding than some other options on our list. The minimal padding gives these gloves a more streamlined look that’s suitable for a variety of activities and great for warm-weather riding. But you may want to opt for something with more padding, like our best overall pick, if you’re planning on biking on off-trail, rugged terrain.
We recommend this pick for beginner cyclists, recreational road bikers, commuters, or those who want extra grip on their stationary bike.

Aero Tech Crochet Cycling Gloves

Pros
Great size range
Stylish design
Easily adjustable
Cons
Not great for those with sweaty hands
Aero Tech’s Cycling Gloves feature thick gel padding on the palm that provides great shock absorption and protection without sacrificing range of motion and comfort. We appreciate that even though this pair is heavily padded, it doesn't feel bulky like other similarly padded options on our list. We found these gloves to be super comfortable and enjoyed their stylish front crochet design.
But when it comes to moisture-wicking, there are better options out there. On longer, sweaty rides we did notice that some heat got trapped inside the gloves causing excess sweat to accumulate, especially for those of us with particularly sweaty hands. If you're looking for a more breathable, sweat-wicking option, we recommend PEARL IZUMI’s Elite Gel Cycling Glove (the most breathable option on our list).

We Also Tested
In total, we tested 14 padded bike gloves, but we only deemed seven of them worthy enough to be included in our final list of recommendations. While these two didn't make our list of the best pairs, they did have some valuable features worth mentioning.
Giro’s Strade Dure SG Men's Road Cycling Gloves
feature padding on the palm that should make riding a lot more comfortable. But what made our rides uncomfortable when using these gloves was the lack of moisture-wicking that left our hands sweaty and our minds distracted.
With just enough padding in all the right places,
Aero Tech’s Gel PADDED Leather and Cotton Crochet Fingerless Gloves
would have been a solid pick if it weren't for their bulky fit and lack of grip and moisture-wicking. Instead, we went with the brand’s
extra-thick version
, which proved to be more comfortable during tests.
How We Tested the Padded Bike Gloves
We test many products in
The Verywell Testing Lab
, but some—like padded bike gloves—better lend themselves to long-term, real-world use so that we can get the most accurate results for our readers. Our team of fitness editors—including seasoned cyclists and beginner bikers—tested 14 top-selling padded bike gloves from their own saddles at home, in the streets, and on paths for a minimum of five bike rides with each set of gloves.
When the gloves arrived, we first examined them for any initial damage and wear and tear. If everything looked fine, we put the gloves on and noted how well they fit: Did they fit snugly, without constricting movement? Were we able to make a fist? Are the gloves bunchy? The best padded bike gloves should fit snugly without any scrunching to avoid
uncomfortable chafing
.
If the fit felt right, we got onto our
indoor cycling bikes
or
outdoor road bikes
for a 15-minute ride wearing the gloves. We completed at least five rides throughout the testing period. As we pedaled, we paid close attention to the comfort, moisture-wicking ability, grip, and overall value of each pair of padded gloves—rating them on a scale of 1 (would not recommend) to 5 (highly recommend) for each of these key categories.

What to Look for in Padded Bike Gloves
Comfort
Comfort is the most important thing to consider when choosing padded bike gloves since the purpose of the gloves is to make your ride more comfortable. Features that affect the comfort of padded bike gloves include breathability, cushioning, flexibility, and adjustability. A comfortable pair of gloves can help ward off hand pain and strain on longer rides.
Look for gloves with padding on the palms and mesh upper materials to allow airflow. You may also want adjustable wristbands to secure your gloves and prevent slipping. Avoid scratchy materials or seams that can rub on your skin and cause discomfort. And lastly, make sure your gloves fit properly.
Grip
A pair of padded bike gloves with a grippy surface, much like
grippy silicone rings
, on the palm can help with preventing slippage and accidents. This is essential for anyone needing to lean or press on their handlebars to stand or change direction.
Good grip will also help you position your hands properly while riding, which in turn can help you better grasp the bike’s handlebars and maintain a sturdier position during your ride, says
Kristi Mohn
, Marketing Manager at Life Time and avid biker.
Verywell Fit / Courtesy of Sophia Heald
Moisture-Wicking
The purpose of padded bike gloves is to add comfort, making for a more enjoyable and distraction-free riding experience. But if your hands are overheating and becoming sweaty inside the gloves, it defeats the purpose. So make sure to opt for a pair of moisture-wicking gloves, especially if you have particularly sweaty palms, says Mohn.
Price
When deciding which padded bike gloves you want to purchase, it’s important to consider both quality and price (and the quality for the price). If you don’t plan on cycling frequently or if you’re a beginner to cycling and aren’t sure you’re ready to commit to the activity long-term, you may want to opt for a budget-friendlier pair of cycling gloves. But if you plan on using your bike gloves multiple times a week and you go for the cheapest option without considering the quality, you may end up with gloves that fall apart or are uncomfortable. Depending on how often you use your gloves, you may wish to invest in a more durable pair that stand up to frequent use.

Frequently Asked Questions
What are the benefits of padded bike gloves?
Padded bike gloves can help prevent hand pain and strain. They can also provide a barrier between the handlebars and your skin to prevent calluses and blisters. And if you tend to sweat while you ride, grippy gloves can improve your grasp on the handlebars.
Should cycling gloves be tight or loose?
The most important thing is comfort—you want to ride freely and without distraction. It’s important to choose a pair of padded bike gloves fitted to your hands without a lot of excess room. But they should also not restrict movement or feel too snug, says Mohn.
How do you clean padded bike gloves?
To clean bike gloves, use mild soapy water and allow the gloves to air dry. Cleaning them after each use can help prevent bacterial growth that may deteriorate the gloves. Always be sure to wash your gloves according to manufacturer instructions.
Why do bikers wear gloves?
Bikers wear gloves for comfort and protection. Padded bike gloves add an extra layer of cushion between the hands and handlebars, preventing pain and strain. And a quality pair of gloves will provide good grip to avoid slippage when sweating—they also offer great protection against the sun, says Mohn. Frequent bikers also appreciate that gloves can limit the formation of painful calluses and blisters over time.

Why Trust Verywell Fit
Verywell Fit / Jessica Juliao
Amazon makes it easy to discover new legging styles inspired by
your favorite activewear brands
. These pairs are often less expensive than fan favorites like
Gymshark leggings
or
lululemon leggings
, with many of the same
key features
. To find the best leggings on Amazon, we spoke with fitness trainers and other experts for their advice and shopping tips. We prioritized
high-quality, sweat-wicking leggings made from performance materials, like nylon, Spandex, and polyester
. We also broke down the physical and functional properties of different fabrics, finishes, and construction methods.
In addition,
we've tested over 25 expert-approved Amazon leggings
to date in the Verywell Testing Lab and the real world. We wear each pair for low-, medium-, and
high-impact workouts
, as well as during our daily routines. Often, we have two experts test each pair of leggings so we can assess how they fit and feel on a range of body types. We note how compressive the leggings are, whether they're opaque, and if the waistband sags or rolls down throughout the day. Our favorite pairs received high scores for
material, opacity, fit, hold, durability, and value.

Who They're For
Best for people who lounge and do low- to medium-impact workouts in their leggings.
Why We Love Them
Out of all the leggings we've tested, we're most impressed by
ODODOS' High Waisted Yoga Leggings.
Made with
performance fabric,
they're soft to the touch and have a cool, silky interior. The blend of polyester and Spandex reminds us of
lululemon's Everlux leggings
. But we like that these feel thinner and stretchier, which makes them a great choice for tough workouts where you'll be sweating a lot.
We also love that ODODOS' leggings are
completely opaque
—even the lighter colors and patterns don't sheer out when we bend over. And the double-lined waistband stays securely in place, whether we're strength training or lounging.
The
side pockets
are deep enough to hold your phone, so you can work out hands-free. (As a bonus, we found that the material also keeps our phone in place—no bouncing or sliding around.) For even more storage, there's a
hidden pocket
inside the front of the waistband.
A flattering
V-contoured seam
in the back adds visual interest, making these leggings a stylish basic that can take you from the gym to the grocery store. Choose from over a dozen colors and patterns in seven sizes.
Potential Flaws
The leggings may pill due to friction from intense exercise, like running. But they perform well during walking, yoga, lounging, and
strength training
.
Certain colors and patterns are made with different blends of materials. Still, every pair is made with performance fabric that will hold up to most levels of activity.
Most Valuable Insight
"For an affordable pair of leggings, these punch above their weight. I was also pleasantly surprised that the White Camo print passed the squat test in broad daylight."
—Emily Stone, Verywell Fit product tester
Great for sweaty workouts, these leggings are breathable with a silky interior that's cool to the touch.

Who They're For
Best for runners and anyone who prefers hands-free storage.
Why We Love Them
For runners, we highly recommend
FlipBelt's Mid-Weight Leggings with Pockets.
They feature FlipBelt's patented waistband, which has two side pockets and one back zipper pocket. But unlike our other top picks, we love that each pocket provides access to
360 degrees of storage:
You can stash your essentials (including your iPhone 12 Pro Max or Samsung Galaxy) throughout the entire "belt," or waistband. There's even an internal hook to safely hold a key.
We found the waistband to be more comfortable and less bulky than a
fanny pack
—even when we packed it full of items, the waistband stayed put and didn't slide down or dig in. And we like that FlipBelt's Leggings are made from polyester and Spandex, meaning they
wick sweat away well
and dry quickly. They're also
completely opaque
and squat-proof, making them a sure bet whether you're running errands or
training for a 5k
.
Potential Flaws
We wouldn't recommend these for hot weather workouts, since the material is on the thicker side. But they're ideal for running in colder temperatures (or air-conditioned gyms).
We wish these leggings came in more sizes, although the stretchy fabric ensures that most wearers will find the right fit.
Most Valuable Insight
"These are extremely versatile and can eliminate the need for a purse or fanny pack. This is a great pick for runners, gym-goers, parents, and truly anyone."
—Emily Stone, Verywell Fit product tester
These leggings are designed with an integrated storage belt that comfortably holds as much as a fanny pack.

Made of polyester and spandex, they fit like a glove.

They have two side pockets, a front pocket, and an around-the-waist storage belt.

Who They're For
Best for lounging and low-impact workouts.
Why We Love Them
For fans of lululemon leggings
who are looking for an
Align High-Rise Pant
-inspired style, we recommend
CRZ YOGA's High Waisted Workout Capri Leggings.
The material—a combination of polyamide and Spandex—provides a smooth, sleek feel that moves with us like a second skin. Plus, it has
maximum stretch
, making these leggings extremely comfortable without any unwanted pressure from the high-rise waistband.
Like the Aligns
, CRZ YOGA’s Leggings have front and back
seams that lay flat
against the fabric so you don’t feel them. We were pleased that the stitching and seams also perfectly match the fabric color, for a high-end look. In addition, these crops are reinforced with
a long, U-shaped gusset
that extends from the crotch to the knees, prolonging their lifespan.
Potential Flaws
These leggings aren't as compressive as other pairs we tested, but you can order one size down from your usual for a tighter fit.
The thin fabric may show underwear lines, although we noticed that it's still completely opaque.
These leggings never pinch, bunch, or dig in; their high-rise waistband always stays in place.
PHOTO: Verywell Fit / Jessica Juliao
Made of polyamide and spandex, these leggings are incredibly stretchy.

We love that they come at a budget-friendly price and in 33 colors.

Who They're For
Best for lounging and low- to medium-impact workouts.
Why We Love Them
For thin leggings that don't skimp on opacity or comfort,
Colorfulkoala's High Waisted Yoga Pants
are our top pick. Crafted from polyester and Spandex, we found that the soft, lightweight fabric delivers the ideal balance of elasticity and hold, for a
secure fit.
The seamless, double-lined waistband stays in place whether you’re working out or chilling out, and we like the
flattering V-seam
in the back.
During our test, we found that the high-rise waistband delivered moderate compression, staying up and in place all day long. These leggings also have
two side pockets
on the upper thighs that fit most smartphones. Contouring, chafe-free seams along the legs and a U-shaped gusset add even more comfort and durability.
Potential Flaws
While we found that these leggings run true to size, we wish they offered more options.
The waistband is comfortably compressive, but the legs have a looser fit. This makes these leggings a better choice for strength training or yoga, rather than running.
Most Valuable Insight
"These are great multipurpose leggings for both working out and lounging around the house. They're affordable, comfortable, and have pockets." —

Our Overall Rating:

Who They're For
Best for athletes, people with short torsos, or anyone who likes a very supportive, compressive fit.
Why We Love Them
If you've ever worn
kinesiology tape
—an athletic tape that stabilizes your muscles and joints—you know what a powerful tool it can be. For that same support in a pair of leggings, we recommend
CW-X's Stabilyx Joint Support Compression Tight.
We love that these leggings are just as stylish as they are stabilizing, with
a subtle, sporty design
that sets them apart.
Unlike many of our other top picks, CW-X's Tight is
mid-rise
—so if you struggle with getting wide waistbands to hit you in the right spot, we recommend giving these a try. This pair is made from breathable, moisture-wicking
material that's rated UPF 50+,
meaning it blocks 98% of UVA and UVB radiation from the sun's rays.
We also like that the reinforced elastic waistband features
a flat drawstring
and a built-in pocket.
Potential Flaws
These leggings tend to run small because of how compressive they are, so we suggest sizing up.
These are one of our most expensive picks, although we think you get what you pay for in terms of high-quality materials and additional support.
Most Valuable Insight
"I noticed the extra boost of stability in my knees during workouts. In fact, I liked these so much I ordered the capri version."

Who They're For
Best for people who want super soft, low-maintenance leggings.
Why We Love Them
Another more expensive pair that's truly worth the investment, we recommend
Beyond Yoga's High Waisted Midi Leggings
for their high-end feel and thoughtful features. Crafted from Beyond Yoga's signature Spacedye performance fabric, we love that they're
exceptionally cozy, soft, and durable.
This polyester and Lycra fabric is also
Bluesign Certified
, meaning it's made using a more efficient process that doesn't rely on harsh chemicals.
Lightweight with
four-way stretch,
these leggings retain their shape and are
rated UPF 50+
for additional protection in the sun. They're also
washer- and dryer-safe
(a huge plus), and we found that they maintained their rich color and quality after continued washing. Plus, we noticed that they dried quickly and kept us comfortable during sweaty outdoor workouts.
Potential Flaws
These leggings don't have any side pockets. If storage is important to you, we recommend FlipBelt's Mid-Weight Leggings instead.
While we like how much support the super-high-rise waistband offers, it may be too wide for shorter wearers.
Most Valuable Insight
"These leggings were among the softest pairs I’ve tried. They have a brushed-out suede feel and are so cozy you want to sleep in them."

Who They're For
Best for athletes.
Why We Love Them
Under Armour's HeatGear Pocketed Leggings
made our list for their elite sweat-wicking and quick-drying abilities. The polyester and elastane blend kept us cool, dry, and comfortable during
outdoor summer workouts
. Plus, it has
four-way stretch
and doesn't chafe, with
all-over light compression
for gentle support.
The fabric is also
anti-odor,
which means that there’s a finish applied that helps prevent bacteria from building up and causing unpleasant smells over time. Smooth and durable, we were also pleased by how these leggings held up—we didn't find any pilling, even after multiple washes. The waistband has
silicone webbing
inside the back panel that prevents any slipping, and the convenient side pocket is deep enough to hold most smartphones.
Potential Flaws
While Under Armour labels these as a high-waisted legging, we found them to be more of a mid-rise fit, sitting below the belly button. But we like how secure the waistband is.
They also tend to run large, so we suggest sizing down for the right compression. This helps the waistband stay in place during workouts.
Most Valuable Insight
"These are especially great for athletes due to the quick-drying, sweat-wicking material. The fabric is incredibly light and doesn't weigh you down in heat." —

Who They're For
Best for busy people who want leggings that look just as good at brunch as they do at the gym.
Why We Love Them
With a flattering, crossover waistband,
ODODOS' Cross Waist 7/8 Yoga Leggings
are our favorite pair for everyday wear. Double-lined with an
interior pocket,
the waistband ultimately offers
four layers of coverage and support
across your midsection. In testing, we noticed that these looked and felt similar to Aerie's popular
Crossover Pocket Legging
—but they're
more durable,
which we think makes them a better investment.
These leggings' soft exterior and silky, cooling inner lining makes them a solid choice for daily workouts.
The fabric also repels lint,
for easy wearing. Choose from dozens of colors, three inseam lengths, and styles with added
side pockets
and side seams to find your new go-to pair.
Potential Flaws
However, we did find that the layered construction makes these less breathable than some of our other picks.
Like our top overall pick, ODODOS' High Waisted Yoga Leggings, these are available in three fabric blends, depending on the color or print you choose. But we found that they're all designed for high performance, whether you're working out or relaxing.
Most Valuable Insight
"These are affordable, comfortable leggings offered in a wide range of colors, prints, sizes, and pocket options. The fabric was a real standout, too." —

Who They're For
Best for low- to medium-impact workouts like yoga, walking, or Pilates.
Why We Love Them
Copyleaf's Flare Yogo Pants
are the
best flared leggings
from Amazon we've tested so far. The nylon and Spandex fabric is thick, compressive, and
completely squat-proof.
And we love the way these leggings fit—the
high-rise, crossover waistband
holds everything in, while the thick, stretchy material hugged our curves in all the right places.
The
deep side pockets
are secure, for stashing your phone or other small essentials. We also noticed that these leggings
don't show sweat or hold onto odor,
making them ideal for low- to medium-impact workouts (unlike other, thinner flared pairs). Available in a range of neutral colors, we think these Copyleaf leggings are ideal for expanding
your everyday athleisure wardrobe
.
Potential Flaws
We did notice that these leggings show underwear lines. However, the fabric is totally opaque, meaning no colors or patterns will show through.
Most Valuable Insight
"The more I wear these leggings, the more I love them. I have worn the same pair of leggings for the past ten years because I couldn't find a pair that I felt comfortable in, so it was incredible to wear these leggings and feel completely at home immediately."
—Sophia Noulas, Verywell Fit product tester

Who They're For
Anyone who
exercises outdoors in cold temperatures
, like runners, hikers, skiiers, and snowboarders.
Why We Love Them
With superior coverage and a soft fleece lining,
BALEAF's Fleece Lined High Waisted Winter Leggings
are our top pick for cold weather. We were immediately impressed by how thick they were, with a secure fit that gave us plenty of confidence. Unlike some leggings,
these wash well:
We didn't notice any pilling or shrinking, even after tossing them in the dryer multiple times.
Although they're lined,
they aren't bulky
—we felt we could layer them underneath snow pants just as easily as we could wear them alone.
Ultra-soft and comfortable,
BALEAF's Leggings are a pair we love living in. Choose from a range of modern, neutral colors, with options that have anywhere from one to four pockets.
Potential Flaws
These are long, with inseams starting at around 27 inches. But we appreciate that the inseam varies with each size, for a fit that works for most people.
Most Valuable Insight
"I don't normally wear leggings as pants without something long over them, but these made me feel completely covered and secure. The fabric is nice and thick, and the inner fleece is incredibly soft."

Why We Love Them
Some of our top picks only come in a few sizes, but
ZUTY's 7/8 Workout Leggings
are available in
nine sizes (up to 5X),
making it easy to find the right fit. They're made from a lightly brushed fabric that’s
completely matte and opaque,
with a thick, compressive, ultra-high-rise waistband for plenty of support.
The waistband is also double-lined and has an
interior drawstring,
to prevent any slipping or rolling down. And we like that it has a hidden pocket for your cards or keys. We also love the
spacious, secure side pockets,
which are large enough to stash a smartphone or other essentials. Choose from a range of jewel tones and fun patterns, like Black Leopard and Green Camo Splinter.
Potential Flaws
We did find that the waistband may be a little bit too high-rise for some shorter wearers. But the interior drawstring keeps it secure and in place.
These leggings may run large—we recommend sizing down for a more compressive fit.

Why We Love Them
We love that
HeyNuts' Essential 7/8 Leggings
look and feel like a luxury pair of leggings at a fraction of the price. And with a
25-inch inseam length,
they're our top choice if you're tired of bunching and rolling excess fabric at your ankles. The high-rise waistband is double lined for support and features a slight V-seam in the back that provides some
extra contouring,
plus an interior pocket that we found fits an iPhone 12.
These leggings are made from nylon and Spandex material that's lightly brushed on both sides. This adds thickness for better coverage, without any additional weight.
Seamless legs,
a U-shaped gusset, and
flatlock seams
all add to this pair's high-quality construction.
Potential Flaws
We found that HeyNuts' leggings run true to size, but we wish they came in more sizes and inseam lengths.
Most Valuable Insight
"Delivers an lululemon Align-like feel with more compression for a fraction of the price!"
—Emily Stone, Verywell Fit product tester
Leggings We Also Tested
We tested over 25 pairs of leggings,
but not all of them made the cut. These leggings just didn't stack up against our other Amazon favorites:
We like that
Hanes' Sport Women's Performance Pant
is budget-friendly, but it's not as breathable as our other top picks. We also weren't fans of how the waistband fit—we found ourselves constantly pulling it up.
Zenana's Premium Cotton FOLD Over Yoga Flare Pants
are comfortable, soft to the touch, and opaque. However, we noticed that the material was very thin, and we wished they were more compressive.
Five key features to look for in leggings.
Verywell Fit / Michelle Parente
What to Look for When Shopping for Leggings on Amazon
Fabric:
Most leggings, like most
exercise dresses
and bras, are made from performance fabric that includes a blend of synthetic fibers. You'll often find nylon and polyester, which are lightweight, durable, and sweat-wicking. Polyester isn't as breathable as nylon, though, so our experts recommend washing polyester leggings after each wear to prevent odors from building up. Both are usually blended with Spandex (also called Lycra or elastane) for a comfortable, compressive fit. Steer clear of cotton leggings—they're highly absorbent and don't wick away sweat very well.
Finishes:
Manufacturers may use physical, chemical, or mechanical finishes to change how their legging fabrics feel or perform. Brushing is a physical finish that adds softness and thickness without changing how much a fabric weighs. During our test, we noticed that brushed fabrics are more opaque and squat-proof. Synthetic fabrics sometimes have an anti-odor or antimicrobial finish to help prevent bacteria from causing odors.
Rise:
Leggings come in low-, mid-, high-, and super-high-rise styles. Low-rise or low-waisted leggings sit far below your belly button, while mid-rise leggings sit just below your belly button. High-rise or high-waisted leggings sit at your natural waist, around your belly button. Super-high-rise leggings sit slightly higher, coming closer to your bra line. Just keep in mind that the way each rise fits you depends on your torso length.
Inseam Length:
A legging's inseam length tells you how long it is. It's the measurement of the inside of the leg from the crotch to the bottom of the ankle. Cropped leggings tend to have inseams between 17 and 23 inches and may hit just below your knee or at the middle of your calf. 7/8 leggings sit above your ankle and are often 25 inches long. Full-length styles usually range between 28 and 33 inches long and are designed to hit at your ankle. To find your ideal inseam length, you can measure yourself or measure the inseam of a pair of leggings you already love.
Seams:
Our experts recommend paying close attention to where the seams are placed in each pair of leggings. You may want to avoid seams that aren't as flattering or look for seams that contour your figure. Look for seams that lay flat to
prevent chafing or irritation
during workouts. Or, try
a high-quality pair of seamless leggings
for a second-skin-like feel.
To make sure each pair of leggings offered enough stretch, we performed various exercises in each pair.

How We Tested the Best Leggings on Amazon
To find the best leggings on Amazon, we've tested over 25 pairs to date in the Verywell Testing Lab and in the real world. During the testing process, we evaluate each one based on these six key attributes:
Material:
When we first try the leggings on, we assess how the material feels to the touch. Is it soft and brushed or cool and silky smooth? We're also checking to see how thin the fabric is, which helps us determine which activities each pair is best for. Finally, we consider how compressive the material is and how much support it provides.
Opacity:
We perform multiple squat tests in front of a mirror to check how opaque the leggings are. We prioritize leggings that are completely squat-proof, meaning we can't see any skin or underwear color through the fabric.
Fit:
To assess how the leggings fit, we have multiple testers wear them. We prioritize leggings that fit a range of body types well, meaning the inseam length is consistent between sizes and the waistband hits each wearer in the correct spot.
Hold:
Hold refers to how secure the leggings are—do they stay in place, or do we find ourselves readjusting them often? When it comes to hold, we're mostly referring to the leggings' waistbands, although we also check for this feature in the legs and the crotch.
Durability:
As we wear the leggings, we pay attention to how they hold up over time. Do they still look the same after multiple wears and washes? Or have we found any loose threads, pilling, sheering, or other signs of wear?
Value:
To accurately rate each pair's value, we don't look at the price of each legging until after we put it through our full testing process and evaluate it for the other five categories. Leggings that receive a high value score are usually priced below what we would consider paying for them, based on our experiences.
To find the best pairs of leggings on Amazon, we tested 25 pairs and narrowed them down to our top picks.

Frequently Asked Questions
How should leggings fit?
You might prefer soft, stretchy leggings for running errands but want a more compressive pair for running or
HIIT workouts
. No matter what you're looking for, your leggings should be comfortable and provide a supportive hold, with a waistband that doesn't dig in or gap in the back.
What should you wear under leggings?
Going commando or wearing a seamless
pair of underwear with leggings
can prevent panty lines.
If you do decide to wear underwear
, remember to change out of them after a workout to prevent odors and bacteria from building up.
How long do leggings last?
The longevity of leggings depends on how much you sweat, if the fabric is antimicrobial, how you launder it, and the roughness of activity you are engaging in, Emerson says. Key indicators that your leggings may be wearing out include thinning or sheer spots, excess stretch, a lack of support, fraying seams, pilling, or needing to hoist up the waistband more than usual.
Do leggings contain BPA?
Bisphenol A (BPA)
is a chemical found in some types of plastic.
Research has shown that exposure to high levels of BPA can lead to obesity, hormonal imbalances, and uterine cancer, among other health complications.
In May 2023, the Center for Environmental Health (CEH) announced that, after testing, it found high levels of BPA in certain activewear pieces containing blends of polyester and spandex, including sports bras from Sweaty Betty, leggings from Nike, Athleta, Champion, Patagonia, and Kohl’s, shorts from Champion, Nike, and Adidas, and athletic shirts from Fabletics.
We may recommend some of these products or similar items from these brands in this list, as
these products have not been recalled and the science on transdermal absorption of BPA is still not settled.

Frequently Asked Questions
Why Trust Verywell Fit
Verywell Fit
Whether you’re hitting the pavement or
choosing a treadmill
,
wearing the right sports bra
for running is essential for comfort and performance. Inadequate bra support can lead to breast pain and actually be a deterrent to exercise for some women. The best sports bras for runners offer a
snug and secure fit
(without being
too
tight), provide support and
compression to reduce movement
and boast breathable,
moisture-wicking materials
that keep you cool and comfortable throughout your run.
To find the best sports bras for runners, we first spoke with experts—three sports bra specialists, one certified personal trainer, and a professor of dermatology—to get their advice on which
key features to look for
. Then, we researched dozens of options from top, trusted brands. Finally, we
tested 61 expert-approved sports bras
at home in our daily running routines. The options on this list earned high scores for
fit, support, comfort, adjustability, durability, and value
. Another reason to trust us? A certified personal trainer from our
Review Board
reviewed this article for accuracy and how to find a comfortable, supportive sports bra for running.
Support Type: Compression vs. Encapsulation
Sports bras offer support through two different methods: compression and encapsulation. Compression sports bras secure both breasts together against your chest, restricting movement and bounce. Encapsulation sports bras hold each breast in a separate cup, providing a more natural shape.
Most of the sports bras on our list offer a combination of the two, which is ideal for running and other high-impact activities.

Who It's For
Best for runners who want reliable support without sacrificing comfort.
Why We Love It
Runners need a sports bra with
exceptional comfort
and
maximum support
—
lululemon’s Run Times Bra High Support Bra
checks those boxes and more. It features three rows of hook-and-eye closures on the ribcage band, as well as adjustable, crossable shoulder straps that helped us find a
snug, secure fit
. And despite the supreme support, the band and straps don’t dig into your skin.
The cups—a combination of compression and encapsulation—deliver a
flattering lift
and help control movement. A breathable blend of nylon, elastane, and Lycra feels
sweat-wicking
and
buttery soft
against the skin to add even more comfort. We also appreciate that the bra held up beautifully after repeated wear and washing—with no stretching out, fading, or pilling.
Potential Flaws
You may need a different option if you have smaller breasts, since this bra doesn’t come in A-cup sizes.

Who It's For
Best if you prefer a longline cami-style sports bra that’s great for lounging and running—especially if you’re below a C-cup.
Why We Love It
Comfy enough for lounging yet supportive enough for running,
Lemedy’s Padded Sports Bra
is
the budget-friendly solution to your sports bra needs. The
thin, cami-style straps
add a sleek look while still
controlling movement and bounce
during runs. We also like the
removable pads
, which are the ideal thickness for comfort and coverage.
The material, a breathable combination of nylon and spandex, feels
soft, stretchy, and sweat-wicking
. During test runs, we never noticed any discomfort or chafing. In fact, this
pullover bra
is so comfortable that we found ourselves reaching for it even when we weren’t working out.
Potential Flaws
The band and straps aren’t adjustable, but we found the sizing to be accurate and the overall fit to be secure and comfortable.
This bra doesn’t have adequate support for C cups or higher.
Most Valuable Insight
“I loved this bra and that it was supportive for high-impact exercise without being too tight for wearing for lounging.” —

Who It's For
Best for runners who want a simple, supportive pullover bra with removable pads.
Why We Love It
Looking for a
comfy, supportive
sports bra at a budget-friendly price?
Running Girl’s Sports Bra
held us up while running,
lifting weights
, jumping, and more. It’s a simple
pullover bra
that combines compression and encapsulation to
minimize movement
and
prevent spillage
.
During intense runs, it held everything in place, while remaining comfortable the entire time. The fabric, a
sweat-wicking
combination of nylon and spandex, feels
soft and stretchy
. We love that it comes in a wide range of neutral and fun colors, and at such a reasonable price, we definitely recommend grabbing more than one.
Potential Flaws
The removable pads came out in the washing machine, but it was easy enough to put them back in.
The band and straps aren’t adjustable, but we still found a supportive fit.
Most Valuable Insight
“I highly recommend this bra—It's comfy, cute, stylish, and gets the job done. I can work out without breast pain, discomfort, or excessive bouncing. I look forward to putting this bra on.” —

Who It's For
Best if you want maximum support without sacrificing comfort—especially for medium to large breasts.
Why We Love It
Good support is non-negotiable in any sports bra for running, especially for medium- and
large-chested runners
. We love
Alo’s Power Play High Impact Bra
because it combines compression and encapsulation, as well as an easily adjustable band and shoulder straps, to deliver
maximum support
and a
customizable fit
. Plus, it has an attractive style, combining fashion and function.
The compression helps
reduce movement and bounce
, while the molded encapsulation cups enhance overall comfort and
prevent spillage
. We were genuinely amazed that, despite the substantial support, the bra never felt constricting and the straps never dug into our skin. Plus, the
soft, breathable fabric
never caused irritation or chafing.
Potential Flaws
The bra's cup sizes start at C, so this isn’t a good option for runners with smaller breasts.
The crisscross straps made it somewhat difficult to take off, but it was just a minor inconvenience and did not take away from our experience with this bra.
Most Valuable Insight
“Ultra-supportive! Seriously, this is so impressively high-impact. I can literally do anything in this bra—it's not restrictive, but I feel completely secure.”

Who It's For
Best for super sweaty runs, since the zip-front style makes it easy to take on and off.
Why We Love It
One of our
favorite zip-front sports bras
,
lululemon’s Enlite Front-Zip Bra
saves you from the struggle of trying to remove a sweat-drenched sports bra post-run. During testing, we found the front zipper easy to use and love that it locks in place to avoid slipping. The bra's
wide straps
are both
comfortable and supportive
, ensuring no digging, pinching, or irritation.
Designed with a
breathable and sweat-wicking
combination of nylon and Lycra, the bra feels smooth, soft, and stretchy. The
lightly padded built-in cups
offer additional
bounce protection and coverage
while helping to center and contain our breasts. We also love that this stylish, strappy bra is available in several colors and patterns.
Potential Flaws
The straps aren’t adjustable, but we found the sizing to be accurate and the overall fit to be secure and comfortable.
Most Valuable Insight

Who It's For
Best if you want to store your phone, earbuds, and more.
Why We Love It
Whether it's your phone,
workout headphones
, or a
mid-run snack
, the
roomy back pocket
on
Senita’s Sarah Sports Bra
offers a convenient solution for storing essentials on your run. And we found that you can load it up without any extra bounce. The bra’s compression feels
snug and supportive
, while still offering
chafe-free comfort
.
What’s more, the
ultra-soft, sweat-wicking fabric
kept us dry and comfortable on sweaty runs. We were also impressed with the bra’s durability; there were no signs of pilling, fading, or stretching throughout testing. Given this pullover bra’s storage and support, exceptional comfort, and
budget-friendly price
, we think it’s a truly
high-value purchase
for runners.

Best for runners with medium to large breasts who need maximum support—especially if you prefer a convenient zip-front style.
Why We Love It
Need a sports bra with maximum support for medium to large breasts?
Champion’s Motion Control Zip Sports Bra
combines encapsulation and a zip-front design, featuring a racerback and adjustable shoulder straps. These features work together to
prevent spillage, limit movement, and offer a customizable fit
.
The bra is so comfortable that, after wearing it all day, we practically forgot we were even wearing a sports bra. Plus, the performance fabric is
breathable and moisture-wicking
, keeping us cool and dry during intense workouts.
We also found that the bra is flattering and even
promotes good posture
when running.
Potential Flaws
The bra cup sizes start at B, so this isn’t a good option for runners with smaller breasts.
After several wears during testing, we found that the tag on the inside of the bra was irritating, so we had to cut it out.

Who It's For
Best for runners who want a budget-friendly sports bra that provides enough support and comfort for a variety of workouts.
Why We Love It
For a well-fitting, durable sports bra at a budget-friendly price, it’s tough to beat
All in Motion’s High Support Sports Bra
. We wore this bra for running,
cycling
, tennis, weight lifting, and more—feeling equally supported and comfortable during every activity. Plus, the
lightweight and soft fabric
allows us to move sweat- and chafe-free.
The bra combines compression and encapsulation to
reduce bounce and spillage
while offering some shape. And the
adjustable ribcage band and racerback straps
help us find a customizable fit for every workout. Plus, after tons of wears and washes, the bra hasn’t shown any signs of stretching, fading, or pilling—making it even more worth the already low price.
Potential Flaws
We found that the neckline of this bra comes up quite high, offering too much coverage for some.
Most Valuable Insight
“A steal! I would (and probably will) buy this sports bra again. I think it stands up there with any of my other sports bras from brand names.”

Who It's For
Best for distance runners with small- to medium-sized breasts.
Why We Love It
Comfort, support, and storage are key features to look for in a sports bra for
distance running
.
Tracksmith’s Allston Bra
feels buttery-soft, reduces bounce, and has an
internal pocket
to stash your phone, keys, or
mid-run energy fuel
. During testing, the compression style helped us feel fully supported without any pinching or constriction.
The
classic racerback
features a mesh panel that adds
breathability
, making this a solid choice for sweaty workouts. Plus, we found that this attractive bra
offers enough coverage
to be confidently worn alone or under clothes. It’s also comfortable enough for casual wear and even quick post-run naps on the couch.
Potential Flaws
Since it doesn’t have adjustable straps or molded cups, this bra isn’t the best option for larger breasts.

Who It's For
Best for runners with medium to large breasts who want support and style.
Why We Love It
Oiselle’s Queen Bra
proves it’s possible to excel in both support and style. With its smooth,
soft fabric and eye-catching colors
, it helps us run in confidence—in more than one way. We love that the bra combines
compression and encapsulation
to hold your breasts in place and deliver a
flattering shape
. And we also appreciate the
wide ribcage band
that adds support and lift.
With adjustability in the band and shoulder straps, this bra offers
customizable support and fit
. It also lets you switch between an H-back or a crisscross racerback depending on your preferred style. The
molded, sewn-in cups
are perforated for heat release, which helps keep us cool and comfortable on long-distance runs.
Potential Flaws
While we like the extra-wide band for added support, it tends to roll down when we’re sitting, so it’s not the best option for all-day wear.
The bra cup sizes start at C, so this isn’t a good option for runners with
smaller breasts

Who It's For
Best for sweaty runners who run outside in warm to hot weather.
Why We Love It
Made with a
sweat-wicking
, breathable blend of performance fabrics,
Brooks’ Dare Crossback Run Bra 2.0
is ideal for cool, chafe-free running. It has perforated ventilation on the front and back of the bra which we found helps mitigate excess heat. It’s also super supportive, thanks to the combination of compression and encapsulation that
controls bounce and minimizes spillage
.
We wore this bra for low-impact yoga and
high-intensity interval training
, feeling supported during each activity. The bra's
minimal seams and soft, stretchy fabric
not only provide a comfortable feel against the skin but also contribute to the bra's streamlined and sleek appearance. Plus, after dozens of wears and washes, there are
no signs of wear and tear
.
Potential Flaws
We wish the straps were adjustable, as they sat slightly higher than where we would have liked.

Who It's For
Best for optimal range of motion, especially for running in warm to hot climates.
Why We Love It
Crossback bras like
Brooks’ Plunge 2.0 Sports Bra
allow for
optimal range of motion
in the upper body, making them a good option for running. During test runs, we were immediately impressed with how easy it was to move in this bra—it offered better side-to-side mobility than any other bra we tested. It also delivers
maximum support, lift, and bounce control
.
The
smooth, sweat-wicking material
feels stretchy and prevents chafing. Meanwhile, the back mesh panels add even more airflow and a stylish flare. We also love that this bra feels
high-quality, without a high price tag
—showing no signs of wear and tear throughout testing.
Potential Flaws
The band and straps are not adjustable, so it may be hard to find a customized fit.

Support:

Care:

Our Overall Rating:
4.5/5
Who It's For
Best for sweaty runners with large chests who need maximum support for running in warm to hot weather.
Why We Love It
Running in the heat
calls for a sweat-wicking sports bra, like
Wacoal’s Simone Sport Underwire Bra
. With soft, breathable fabric, it provides
excellent coverage
while effectively managing sweat during runs. During test runs, we found that the bra offers outstanding
support and motion reduction
, thanks to the compression and underwire. The molded cups also help
maintain a natural shape
without flattening your chest.
The
adjustable band and straps
ensure a customized fit, and the two layers of fabric between the skin and underwire enhance overall comfort and minimize the risk of irritation or chafing. We also love that you won’t have to worry about sweating in this bra since the
durable fabric
holds up over time.
Potential Flaws
The bra doesn’t come in cup sizes smaller than C, so this may not be the best choice if you have smaller breasts.
We noticed that the underwire may cause some discomfort during distance runs, but it is cushioned, which we found helps.

Who It's For
Best for runners who want to invest in a supportive sports bra that can also be used for daily wear.
Why We Love It
While
Knix’s Catalyst Sports Bra
costs more than most, we found it to be well worth the investment after vigorous testing. It’s the ideal combination of performance, quality, and style. The compression, along with
adjustable band and shoulder straps
, provide
exceptional support
for runs. Meanwhile, the molded, encapsulated cups offer a
natural, flattering shape
.
The fabric, a blend of nylon and spandex, feels
stretchy, soft, and sweat-wicking
—adding to the bra's overall comfort for running or lounging. We also love how
lightweight
it feels, making it effortless to wear or pack in a
gym bag
or suitcase for workouts on the go. And throughout testing, we noticed that the fabric and structure hold up well after many wears and washes.
Potential Flaws
The bra feels extremely compressive at first, but it does loosen up a bit over time.

Who It's For
Best for runners who like a sports bra with a lot of adjustability for a custom-like fit.
Why We Love It
If your bra size tends to fluctuate or you have trouble finding the right fit, you may want to consider a highly adjustable sports bra.
SheFit’s Ultimate Sports Bra
easily adjusts and the ribcage band and shoulder straps via a simple
Velcro closure
. You can also remove the pads and switch between
crossed or uncrossed back straps
for even more customization.
During testing, we found that the
soft, stretchy, sweat-wicking fabric
does a great job of providing support,
bounce protection
, and coverage. We also love the
front zipper closure
for easy on and off, especially when things get sweaty. Plus, we didn’t notice any piling, discoloration, or wear and tear, after repeated wears and washes.
Potential Flaws
While it’s a great option for high-impact workouts like running, the bra may be too compressive for everyday wear.

Our Overall Rating:

Who It's For
Best for runners with small frames and large chests who need maximum support.
Why We Love It
If you have a small frame but large breasts, consider
Syrokan’s Underwire Molded Cup High Impact Sports Bra
. It provided optimal support, particularly for one tester who often has trouble finding the right fit for her narrow ribcage yet bigger bust. The combination of compression and encapsulation
limits bounce and offers a natural, flattering shape
.
Adjustable, padded shoulder straps
and a hook-and-eye ribcage band with four rows allow for great customization. Plus, the straps can be turned from
H-back to racerback
with an included J-hook, if you prefer that style for running. We also love that you can get this bra on and off over your shoulders, like a traditional bra—especially after sweaty runs.
Potential Flaws
We love the adjustable straps, but wish there was an easier way to access them from the front.
Verywell Fit
We Also Tested
We like the quality and durability of
Adidas’ Medium-Support Running Pocket Bra
, but we found the fit to be fairly uncomfortable. During testing, the band did not lay flat or stay in place, which was very distracting during workouts.
On’s Running Performance Bra
is well-made and attractive, but the fit felt too compressive and constrictive. It would have been better if the band had some adjustability to allow for a more precise and comfortable fit.
While we appreciate the support provided by
Under Armour’s Infinity High Crossover Sports Bra
, we found it to be uncomfortably constricting, stiff, and bulky. The side of the bra also dug into our armpits, impacting overall comfort.
lululemon’s Energy Bra
is extremely supportive for running, but we found that it runs very small. The straps felt too tight and uncomfortable during regular wear and test runs.
Where We Stand
After
testing 61 sports bras
,
lululemon’s Run Times Bra
was our top pick for its exceptional support, soft and breathable fabric, and adjustable fit. As we continue to wear-test these sports bras, as well as new styles that come out, we will update this list with the most relevant recommendations.
What to Look for When Shopping for Sports Bras
Support Type:
There are two main types of sports bras: Compression and encapsulation. Compression bras hold both breasts firmly against your body, while encapsulation bras support each breast in a separate cup. If you have a smaller cup size, we recommend a compression bra, and for larger cup sizes, we like an encapsulation bra. You can also find sports bras that offer a combination of the two support types.
Fit:
Your sports bra should be snug from the first wear and there shouldn’t be any gaps or extra room. It should comfortably and adequately contain your breasts, so make sure you don’t have any spillage on the top, side, or underneath your bra, says LaJean Lawson, PhD, sports bra researcher and movement expert. However, a recent study showed that a sports bra that's
too
tight around the ribcage can negatively impact running performance.
When buying a sports bra, make sure the band doesn't feel too tight or restrictive, and that you can easily take full, deep breaths when wearing it.
Closure:
Sports bras are available in various closure styles, including pullover, front zipper, and back clasp options. While zippers and clasps make it easier to take the bra on and off, some wearers prefer a seamless design with no added closure mechanisms. If you have a smaller chest, a pullover bra may be sufficient. But those with larger chests may need a zip-front or back-clasp closure for added support.
Materials:
Look for a sports bra crafted from breathable, stretchy, and soft performance materials, such as polyester and nylon. These materials effectively wick away sweat from your skin, ensuring comfort and unrestricted movement. When shopping, steer clear of cotton, as it tends to absorb moisture, leaving you feeling sweaty.
Pad Options:
Certain sports bras feature built-in padding or removable cups that provide a smooth, rounded shape and envelop each breast. Smaller-chested women may opt for padding to achieve a more flattering look, while larger-chested runners appreciate that padding offers enhanced support and coverage. If you’re unsure, it’s always a good idea to select a bra with removable padding.
Straps:
Your choice between crisscross, H-strap, or racerback styles depends on personal preference. But for the most support, comfort, and even weight distribution, opt for a sports bra with wide straps. Runners, especially those with large breasts, should avoid bras with very thin straps as they don’t offer enough support. Cushioned straps not only enhance the overall comfort but also help prevent chafing.
Adjustability:
Sports bras with adjustable straps and closures make it easier to get a snug, custom-like fit for optimal support and coverage.
Sizing:
To determine the correct sports bra size, consider both band and cup measurements. The band should fit snugly around your ribcage, providing a secure foundation without causing discomfort or digging into the skin. The cup should encapsulate and support your breasts without causing spillage or gaps.
Verywell Fit
How We Tested the Sports Bras
To find the best sports bras for running, we tested 61 options from top, trusted activewear brands. When wear-testing, we evaluate each sports bra based on the following key criteria:
Fit:
First, we try on each sports bra to assess for fit in the shoulder straps, ribcage band, and cups. We test to see if we can fit two fingers between the straps and our shoulders and if the straps are too tight or loose. Then, we note if the band feels snug and secure around our ribcage and if it moves around during runs. We also pay attention to the cup size: Is there any spilling or gaping in the breast area? Sports bras receive high scores for this category if the shoulder straps evenly distribute weight and the ribcage band provides support without any digging or pinching.
Support:
To evaluate each bra’s support level, we complete low- to high-impact exercises to see if it’s compressive enough to hold our breasts in place without feeling restrictive. We account for several things: Are our breasts centered and fully contained in the cups? Is the weight of our breasts evenly distributed? Do our breasts feel secure and supported? We prioritize sports bras that provide the support level as advertised.
Comfort:
If a sports bra isn’t comfortable, you won’t wear it—so we assess for comfort next. During regular wear and test runs, we take note of how comfortable we feel in the bra: How does the fabric feel? Is it breathable and sweat-wicking? Does the bra dig into our skin? We only recommend bras that offer proper support without any discomfort.
Adjustability:
For sports bras with adjustable straps and bands, we assess their ease of use and determine if they help us achieve a personalized fit. If the bra has a rear hook closure, we take note of the number of row and hook options. Sports bras that have easy-to-use adjustability features receive high scores in this category.
Durability:
Throughout testing—several weeks of wears and washes—we take note of how well the bra maintained its initial structure and overall quality. We pay attention to any signs of pilling, fading, or stretching. If the bra is padded, we also assess how the pads hold up after each wash. We prioritize sports bras that show little signs of wear and tear throughout the testing period.
Value:
To fairly rate each bra's value, we don't look at its price until the testing process is completed. Once the testing is complete, we consider whether the price seems reasonable, if we’d be willing to pay that amount (or possibly more), or if we'd prefer to wait for a potential sale. Bras that receive a high value score are typically priced below our threshold based on our evaluations.

Frequently Asked Questions
How are sports bras for running supposed to fit?
For the best fit, ensure your sports bra is snug but comfy. You don't want the band to feel
too
tight around the ribcage, though, as a recent study showed that wearing a sports bra with a band that's too tight can negatively impact running performance.
You should also ensure all breast tissue is in the cup, avoid tight straps for lift, and check straps or clasps aren't digging in.
What happens if you don’t wear a sports bra when exercising?
Not wearing a sports bra during exercise can result in breast tenderness and tightness due to the stress on chest muscles and ligaments, says Burke. It can also affect posture, leading to hunching, neck pain, and headaches, as sports bras play a crucial role in supporting the Cooper ligaments responsible for structural integrity.
What kind of sports bra is best for running?
The best sports bra for running is one that offers enough compression and support to contain your breasts and reduce bounce. All of the sports bras on this list have been wear-tested and are great options for running and other high-impact exercise.
What sports bras do elite runners wear?
Professional runners look for the same qualities in a sports bra as the average runner would: a snug and comfortable fit; compression and support to limit bounce; and breathability and moisture-wicking capabilities.
Should I get a sports bra with a phone pocket?
It’s completely up to your own personal preferences. Even if you don’t want to store your phone, a pocket can be useful for stashing other small essentials on the go.
Do sports bras contain BPA?
In May 2023, the Center for Environmental Health (CEH) announced that, after testing, it had found high levels of BPA in certain activewear pieces containing blends of polyester and spandex, including some sports bras.
We stand by our recommendations on this list, as these products have not been recalled and the science on transdermal absorption of BPA is still not settled. As a precaution, it is best to limit the amount of time you spend in activewear by changing out of it when you are finished working out.

Why Trust Verywell Fit
Verywell Fit / Alexander Huang
Compression leggings feel tighter and more supportive than standard leggings. And like other
compression garments
, they’re thought to improve recovery and performance.
“Compression leggings increase blood flow from the lower body to the heart and back again,” Corey Lewis, CPT, personal trainer and CEO of 1AND1, a health and wellness company, says. “This boosts the supply of oxygen and nutrients to the muscles, improving energy and reducing muscle fatigue.”
But the best compression leggings aren’t just tight. They’re also comfortable, easy to clean, and well-suited to your favorite workouts. Great compression leggings wick moisture, dry quickly, and boast chafe-free seams. They offer the right amount of compression (light, moderate, or high) for your go-to exercises. And they’re packed with features (like padding or breathable panels) that will keep you comfortable as you work out.
We tested 88 pairs of leggings at home, following
Verywell's testing guidelines
, to find pairs with the right amount of compression for every workout. We tested each pair for four weeks (and counting!). We wore each option while lounging, stretching, and doing various classic workouts, including yoga, brisk walking, high-intensity interval training, and more. We then assessed each pair based on eight key factors: quality, opacity, fit, performance, durability, hold, material, and value.
We also interviewed three experts—a personal trainer, a yoga instructor, and an apparel expert—for buying tips and key factors to consider when looking for compression leggings.

Best Women's Overall
lululemon Wunder Train High Rise Tight 25"
PHOTO: Lululemon
$98 at Lululemon
Pros
4 inseam lengths
Drawstring waist for superior hold
Fully opaque
Cons
Too hot for outdoor summer workouts
Made from lululemon’s signature Everlux fabric (a blend of nylon and lycra) these leggings are compressive and great for higher-intensity workouts and strength training. They're our favorite pair of compression leggings that we tested because their fabric is compressive while still having four-way stretch, so you'll never feel constricted. We even found these comfortable enough for Pilates and
barre classes
.
The fabric is thicker than we expected. This means that the leggings are fully opaque and squat-proof, which makes them perfect for weightlifting. But it also means that they may be too hot for outdoor exercise in warmer weather and are better suited to indoor workouts in air conditioning or exercise in colder weather. That being said, even though the leggings are thick, they're still exceptionally sweat-wicking—even during sweatier HIIT workouts our sweat dried quickly and never pooled.
The leggings fit true to size, but if you're not used to very compressive leggings, they may feel small. The tights also boast an adjustable drawcord, allowing you to get a more customized fit. The hidden waistband pocket is perfect for holding essentials like cards and keys.
Unlike some lululemon leggings, we love that these are washer- and dryer-friendly for easy cleaning. And the fabric held up in the wash throughout our four-week testing period, even after washing the pair multiple times a week.
We like that the leggings come in a range of sizes and four inseam lengths to further help you find your ideal fit. They also come in 16 color options. With that many choices, it’s easy to nab a version of the leggings you love—in a size, length, and color that suits you perfectly.

Under Armour UA RUSH SmartForm Leggings

$50 at Amazon
$64 at Underarmour.com
Pros
Flexible, figure-hugging fit
Inclusive size range
Easy to clean
Cons
Designed without a fly
Under Armour’s UA RUSH SmartForm Leggings are tight, sweat-wicking, and breathable. And thanks to their unique design, they fit better than most compression tights.
The leggings are made of Under Armour’s UA RUSH fabric, a stretchy blend of polyester and elastane. And they’re some of the tightest compression leggings on our list. The tights wick sweat and dry quickly, so they’re great for intense workouts. They’re also lined with breathable mesh panels, designed with a supportive gusset, and machine-washable for easy cleaning.
But the best thing about the tights is their unique design. The leggings are woven with a flexible knit, which stretches as you move around. And since they’re segmented into panels, they can stretch in the knees without pulling down your waistband. This combination makes the leggings fit like a dream. They’re figure-hugging but flexible—and they’ll stay put as you exercise.

Best Sweat-Wicking
lululemon Base Pace High-Rise Crop
PHOTO: lululemon
$88 at Lululemon
Pros
No inseam for a chafe-free fit
Drawstring waist for superior hold
Very breathable
Cons
Too compressive for everyday wear
If you tend to sweat a lot during exercise, you need sweat-wicking leggings to keep you cool and dry throughout your workout—enter lululemon's Base Pace High-Rise Crops. These leggings are made of the brand's popular Nulux fabric, which manages to be both soft and compressive at the same time. It's also incredibly breathable, thanks to the thinner, lightweight material that feels cool to the touch.
When testing this pair, we found them compressive enough to feel held in and secure but not restricted. One of our testers, a postpartum mother, even said that this pair supported her core in a way that helped her perform better on runs and other workouts.
Despite being thinner compared to
other lululemon leggings we've tested
, this pair is still fully squat-proof and very durable. We didn't notice any fraying or pilling after four weeks of regular wear. The leggings fit true to size, although they feel a little tighter at the top and looser on the pant leg. They provide a high level of compression, making them great for higher-intensity activities like running and HIIT but not the best option for lounging or running errands.
The high waist has a continuous drawcord that helps you adjust for a perfect fit. There is no inseam, which helped us avoid chafing, and we noticed that the sleek fabric doesn't catch on our inner thighs on runs (a major plus!). We love that these machine-washable leggings can also be tossed in the dryer. They come in two inseam lengths and six colors.

Best for Cold Weather
Gymshark Seamless Leggings

Pros
Thick, ribbed waistband stays put
Durable fabric
Fully opaque
Cons
No pockets
We recommend these Adapt Camo Leggings for when you need extra warmth for workouts in cooler weather or in highly air-conditioned gyms. The thicker fabric is compressive, comfortable, fully opaque, and squat-proof, making these great for strength training workouts. But if you're looking for a pair to wear in warmer weather, lululemon's Base Pace High-Rise Crops are a better option.
We like that these leggings are sweat-wicking and never hold onto odor after tough workouts. The seamless, tag-free design prevents irritation, and the ribbed, thick waistband stays put, even during explosive movements. The high-rise waistband feels comfortable and looks flattering, and the ankle cuffs are also ribbed, so they don't ride up.
The leggings fit true to size, and despite being very compressive, we never feel like we're being squeezed uncomfortably when wearing them. We like that they come in five color options, but we wish they featured pockets for storage.

Best for Running
lululemon Original Fast and Free High-Rise Crop
PHOTO: Lululemon
$128 at Lululemon
Pros
Lots of pockets
Tight waistband
Two inseam lengths
Cons
Side pockets may be too deep
We love lululemon's Fast and Free High-Rise Crop Leggings for running because they're lightweight, quick-drying, and have a good balance of stretch and compression. During testing, we realized that this pair is great for both cool and warm weather workouts: We did not overheat on summer runs, but the longer length did help us to
dress for winter exercise
.
The leggings are designed with a high-rise, snug waistband that stays in place during runs. There's also a continuous drawcord in the waistband so you can tighten or loosen the leggings to find the perfect fit for you. Plus, we found that the leggings never loose any stretch or opacity overtime—even after multiple wears and washes.
We love that they come in six colors and two inseam lengths, allowing you to find the right pair for your style and size. And, we also appreciate that there are two side pockets and five waistband pockets for storing your keys, phone, or mid-run snack on the go. But it's worth noting that we found the side pockets to be so deep and spacious that a phone can slide down toward your knees, causing discomfort during longer runs.

Best Seamless
Gymshark Adapt Animal Seamless Leggings

$60 at Gymshark.com
Pros
High, ribbed waistband
Thick, compressive fabric
Ruched bum detailing
Cons
No pockets
Waistband sometimes folds down
Some bagginess in the crotch
The high-rise waistband and seam-free design of these
GymShark leggings
make them our top choice for a comfortable, chafe-free workout. We love the ribbed waistband that adds flatter and support, but we did notice that it sometimes folds over during exercise because it's so high-rise. Still, we found these ultra-compressive leggings a great choice for high-impact workouts like strength training or running.
During testing, we also noticed that the Adapt Animal Seamless Leggings are super sweat-wicking and completely opaque. Breathable and thick, a hard duality to come by, these leggings showed no signs of wear and tear after weeks of workouts and washing. Plus, they also feature a butt scrunch detail that makes for a flattering fit.
It's worth nothing that this pair doesn't have any pockets, but we still think they're well worth it for a comfortable high-impact sweat session.

Best for Strength Training
Gymshark Apex Seamless Leggings

$64 at Gymshark.com
Pros
Ribbed waistband stays put
Squat-proof fabric
Heat mapping ventilation technology
Cons
Some pilling in the crotch
No pockets
Squat-proof tights with good compression are a must for strength training workouts, and Gymshark's Apex Leggings don't disappoint. We love the heat mapping ventilation technology that kept us cool during the sweatiest of sessions. Plus, the design includes muscle contouring lines for a sleek, stylish look.
During test workouts and wear, we found that the high-rise, ribbed waistband stays put. And we appreciated that, despite being super breathable and sweat-wicking, the leggings did not sheer out at all. But we did notice a bit of wear and pilling in the crotch. We also thought the fabric felt a bit scratchy.
Still, this pair offers the coverage and compression you need for a successful strength training workout.

Pros
Moderate compression
UPF 50+ sun protection
Regular, tall, and petite sizes available
Cons
Waistband sometimes folds down
No pockets
One of
our favorite flare yoga pants
(or flare leggings), Athleta's Elation Flare Pant, is a fun, unique addition to your wardrobe. They are stylish and flattering, while still offering the compression and support that you need in high-quality activewear bottoms. We found the fabric to be super soft, stretchy, and comfortable enough for all types of activities—from strength training to lounging around.
These leggings held up well, not showing any signs of wear and tear after several workouts and washes. They also passed our squat test—remaining completely opaque inside as well as outside in the sun. Plus, they feature a high-rise waistband that stayed put during most activities throughout testing.
We appreciate that these leggings fit true to size and that the flare hits at the right length for full coverage without getting in the way or snagging on shoes. We also like that they come in regular, tall, and petite sizes, as well as five fun colors. While they don't have pockets, we do love that these compressive flare leggings feature built-in UPF 50+ sun protection.

View on Gap.com
Pros
Regular, tall, and petite sizes
Drawstring waist stays put
Squat-proof fabric
Cons
Seams may feel a little stiff
For
high intensity workouts
you'll want to choose a pair of leggings that offer ample compression to keep you supported while you're running, jumping, and (definitely) sweating. Designed for high-impact exercise, Athleta's Ultimate Leggings are supportive, sweat-wicking, and comfortable. Plus, we found that they're completely opaque, which is always important when hitting the gym or your favorite workout class.
While testing, we noticed that the leggings stay in place without digging in or sagging in any unwanted areas. Plus, the adjustable drawstring helps you find the perfect fit. We did find the seams to be a bit stiff and noticeable, making them quite uncomfortable for lounging and all-day wear. But for your next high intensity workout, you won't find a better pair.

We Also Tested
In total, we tested 12 pairs of compression leggings, and while the following didn't make our list, they do have some features worth noting.
lululemon's Wunder Train Contour Fit High-Rise Tights
are compressive and hug you in all the right places, but we didn't find them to be comfortable enough for long workouts or all-day wear.
Seamless and body contouring,
Gymshark's Flex High Waisted Leggings
are comfortable and flattering. But the thick fabric is not very stretchy and the waistband tends to roll down during certain exercises.
These
Girlfriend Collective Black Compressive Pocket Leggings
have pockets, a soft and compressive fabric, and a smooth, high waistband. But during testing, we found that they had to be readjusted often and started to sag in the crotch after wearing them for a while.
How We Selected and Tested the Best Compression Leggings
To find the best compression leggings available today, we first turned to three fitness experts to get their input on what features to look for in a quality pair of leggings. The experts we spoke to include:
Corey Lewis, CPT, CSCS
, certified personal trainer
Alex Farrar
, yoga instructor
Shelly LeSun
, apparel expert
Then, we researched dozens of popular compression leggings, prioritizing options that are offered in several sizes, lengths, and colors. We sought to feature a range of compression leggings that are well-suited to different activities, body types, and personal preferences.
After our in-depth research, we pulled several pairs of compression leggings from our recent Verywell Fit leggings tests. In total, we've tested over 80 pairs of leggings in
The Verywell Testing Lab
and at home in the real world over the course of several months. For this list, we focused specifically on compression leggings, evaluating 12 different pairs a scale of 1 (would not recommend) to 5 (highly recommend) for the categories of opacity, fit and performance, hold, durability, quality, and overall value.
To test each pair of leggings we wore them at least seven times for several different activities: Strength training, running, yoga, Pilates, lounging, and more. While wearing the leggings, we paid attention to how comfortable and compressive they are, as well as any notable design elements (like pockets, seams, or flares).
We performed a squat test at the beginning and end of the testing month to check for opacity and durability overtime. We also completed a 60-second hold test to check how well the waistband stayed put during vigorous activity. And finally, we did a stretch and recovery test of the waistband to measure how well the waistband snaps back to its original size after being stretched. We also washed and dried the leggings several times according to the manufacturers instructions.
We used our expert interviews, thorough research, and months of rigorous testing to compile a reliable list of the best compression leggings for our readers.
What to Look for in Compression Leggings
Compression Level
Not dissimilar to
compression socks
, compression leggings come in three compression levels: Light, moderate, and high. And when deciding which compression level is right for you, you should consider when you want to wear your leggings and how you want them to feel. High-compression leggings are great for intense exercise, like
low-impact HIIT workouts
, while low-compression leggings are better for everyday wear. Moderate-compression leggings split the difference—and they’re most of what you’ll find when shopping.
Size and Fit
When shopping for compression leggings, check two numbers: size and inseam length. You want to choose a pair of leggings that are snug, without feeling constrictive, and hit you at a comfortable length. And since compression leggings run tight, you might have to size up to get the right fit.
“Your compression leggings should be skin-tight,” Farrar says. “But if you feel like you can’t breathe and your flow of breath and circulation feels constricted, then go up a size!”
Once you’ve found your perfect fit, pay attention to rise and style. You can find compressive high-waisted leggings, flare leggings, or capris. And you can score compression leggings in a range of prints and colors. “There is so much to choose from, so enjoy what’s best for you and your preference,” LeSun says.
Comfort
If your leggings aren’t comfortable, you won’t keep wearing them. So you'll want to look for a pair that are breathable and moisture-wicking to keep you cool and dry, says Lewis.
You should also make sure that the material is soft and stretchy enough to wear for different activities and many hours at a time without any discomfort. And for your own convenience, you might want your leggings to be easy to clean, too, so you can toss them in the wash along with your athletic socks and
workout underwear
.
Preferred Activity
Since compression leggings are such a popular pick for exercise, some are tailored to specific workouts. There are compression leggings designed specifically for running, like
lululemon's Fast and Free High-Rise Crop Leggings
, that have offer optimal support and helpful design elements (like pockets). And there are also leggings made for more low-impact exercise or daily wear, like
Athleta’s Elation Flare Pants
, that excel in style and comfort.
When shopping, consider how you like to work out and what features you’d find handy while exercising. Then, look for a pair of leggings that provides the right amount of compression for your workouts—and that offers some of those nice-to-have features.
Frequently Asked Questions
Who can benefit from wearing compression leggings, and why?
“All exercisers can benefit from wearing compression leggings,” Lewis says. “Compression leggings have also been shown to speed up
post-workout recovery
.”
And they’re thought to boost performance and blood flow.
And this last benefit can be helpful, even if you don’t work out. “[If you] travel a lot—or sit for long periods of time—compression leggings [can] keep [your blood] moving—even when you aren’t,” Farrar says.
What are the benefits of compression leggings?
Compression leggings have been linked to a wide range of benefits: They’re thought to improve performance during exercise—and speed up post-workout recovery.
They’re also thought to increase blood flow, even when you’re sitting down.
Can you wear compression leggings all day?
“Yes, you can wear compression leggings all day long,” Lewis says. “The gentle compression they deliver [shouldn’t] have harmful effects, so there are no restrictions on their use.”
That said, if your compression tights feel painful or irritating, take them off. “When wearing compression becomes uncomfortable or painful, you should remove the compression from your body,” LeSun says. And if you’re worried about something specific, check with your doctor.
What is the difference between leggings and compression leggings?
“Compression leggings are snug-fitting tights that apply gentle pressure to the lower body,” Lewis says. “These leggings have a second-skin feel that is different from regular leggings.” Farrar and LeSun note that compression leggings are often thicker than regular leggings—and they have a much tighter fit. “Compression leggings purposefully fit more snugly than a regular pair of knit leggings that do not ‘compress,’” LeSun says.
How tight should compression leggings be?
Your compression leggings should be tight—but not too tight. “You want your compression leggings to be tight enough to provide constant, gentle compression,” Lewis says. Well-fitting compression tights should be tough to put on, but you shouldn’t have trouble breathing or moving around in them. “You should be able to perform a
deep squat
without restriction,” Lewis adds. If your leggings make you feel restricted, uncomfortable, or distracted, try sizing up.
Do compression leggings contain BPA?
Bisphenol A (BPA)
is a chemical found in some types of plastic.
Research has shown that exposure to high levels of BPA can lead to obesity, hormonal imbalances, and uterine cancer, among other health complications.
In May 2023, the Center for Environmental Health (CEH) announced that, after testing, it found high levels of BPA in certain activewear pieces containing blends of polyester and spandex, including sports bras from Sweaty Betty, leggings from Nike, Athleta, Champion, Patagonia, and Kohl’s, shorts from Champion, Nike, and Adidas, and athletic shirts from Fabletics. We may recommend some of these products or similar items from these brands in this list, as
these products have not been recalled and the science on transdermal absorption of BPA is still not settled.
“The best way to prevent BPA exposure is to make educated decisions in choosing your personal care products,” explains
Joshua Zeichner, MD
, associate professor of dermatology and director of cosmetic and clinical research in dermatology at Mount Sinai Hospital. As a precaution, it is best to limit the amount of time you spend in activewear by changing out of it when you are finished working out.

Why Trust Verywell Fit
Verywell Fit / Kevin Liang
Wearing a rash guard while you enjoy the outdoors can help keep you
safe from the sun’s harmful UV rays
. Most styles have
a built-in UV shield,
which is crucial when the UV factors are high, says surf coach Thomas Cravarezza. When shopping for a rash guard, it’s important to find one that's
comfortable, easy to wear
(depending on
your favorite summer sport
), and
protective.
To find the best rash guards on the market, we spoke with Cravarezza to learn which features every style should have. Then,
we researched dozens of options
from popular brands at different price points. We chose our top picks for their superior
fit, comfort, design, and value.
We also had a board-certified family physician from our
Review Board
review this article for accuracy, including how a rash guard can protect your skin and when you should wear one.

Why We Love It
O’Neill's Premium Skins Rash Guard
is our top overall pick because its
four-way stretch
and
quick-drying fabric
are ideal for most water sports. Whether you’re a professional surfer or spending a casual day at the beach, this rash guard is rated UPF 50+ for your safety—
the most protection
that exists.
We like that this rash guard is made from
breathable
nylon and spandex, plus there are
lots of colors and sizes
to choose from. The
tight, performance fit
provides comfort without adding bulky layers. Even better, there are
minimal seams
to prevent chafing or drag that can slow you down.
Potential Flaws
Some wearers note that it may run small—consider ordering one size up from your usual.

Why We Love It
For a budget-friendly option, we recommend
Kanu Surf's Platinum Rash Guard.
It’s made from a combination of nylon and spandex, which means it’s both
lightweight and quick-drying.
It doesn’t matter if you’re a surfer or want a rash guard for recreation—this one performs at a
lower price point
than many of our other top picks.
This rash guard has
long sleeves,
a
standing collar,
and can be tossed in the washing machine after each wear. It also boasts
UPF 50+ sun protection,
so you can swim and work out worry-free.
Potential Flaws
Since this rash guard is so thin, some of the lighter colors may appear slightly see-through when wet.

Why We Love It
For scorching-hot days when long sleeves aren't an option, we recommend
L.L.Bean's Swift River Cooling Sun Shirt.
This rash guard is
slightly fitted
and made with
lightweight comfort
in mind for those who don’t like a tighter, more traditional performance fit. The
anti-microbial fabric
also wicks moisture away quickly, to keep you cool and dry.
Made from polyester and spandex with
UPF 50+ sun protection,
this
abrasion-resistant
rash guard is ideal for
walking on the beach
or your favorite outdoor activity. We also like that it's
machine-washable
and comes in both
regular and tall sizes.
Potential Flaws
Unlike some of our other top picks, this rash guard doesn't have a tall collar.

Why We Love It
We recommend
Platinum Sun’s Unisex Thermal Swim Shirt
for chilly days and cold water. Made from 100% polyester, it can be worn as a layer or by itself, depending on the weather. We like that the
fleece lining
means this rash guard can also be worn for hiking or even skiing. Plus, it’s
rated UPF 50+
for maximum protection.
Searching for a more sustainable option? This rash guard is
made from recycled plastic
and other post-consumer waste. We also like that the seams are spread out (not tucked under your arms)
to
prevent irritation and chafing
.
Potential Flaws
Although it's more expensive than other rash guards on our list, we think the added fleece lining is worth paying a little extra for.

Why We Love It
Searching for a rash guard with a unique design? We recommend
Platinum Sun’s Long Sleeve Rash Guard.
We like that it's
lightweight
and
breathable,
with a
silicone band
that prevents it from riding up when you’re
swimming in heavy surf
.
We also love that it has a
shoulder zipper
to help you slide it on and off, even when wet. Choose from a variety of
bright hues
and
watercolor patterns
that will stand out on the sand.
Potential Flaws
Some wearers have found that this rash guard runs small, so you may want to size up.

quick-drying
and has a zipper in the back with
a long pull
for easy wearing. Choose from a range of colors and patterns in sizes ranging from XXS to XL.

option has long sleeves and comes in a variety of bright colors. Like many others in our list, it also offers
maximum UPF 50+ protection.
We like this rash guard has a
flexible fit,
thanks to a stretchy blend of nylon and spandex. And
flatlock seams
mean this top will still feel comfortable, even after spending hours in saltwater.
Potential Flaws

Why We Love It
If you’re looking for a rash guard for scuba diving,
Huge Sports’ Splice Skins Rash Guard
is our top pick. The
four-way stretch fabric
makes this rash guard ideal for spending long days in the water. Plus, we like the
unique asymmetrical design,
which features different patterns on just one sleeve.
With
UPF 50+ sun protection,
this rash guard is just as sleek as it is protective. Wearers have also found that
it stays put all day long,
from the hem to the sleeves.
Potential Flaws
Unsure which size to order? The brand recommends trying one up from your usual.
What to Look for When Shopping for Rash Guards
Color:
It's not just a matter of personal preference. Dark and bright colors (like yellow, pink, and red) absorb ultraviolet rays more effectively than paler colors do.
Also, consider the climate: A darker rash guard will keep you warmer, while white and other light colors will cool you down, notes Cravarezza.
Coverage:
Check the rash guard's label to find its UPF rating (this indicates how well the rash guard blocks UV rays). The higher the number, the better—UPF50 fabric blocks 98% of the sun's rays.
Fit:
Your rash guard shouldn't be skin tight. Instead, look for one that's a little loose—not so loose that it comes off in the ocean, but not so tight that it pulls as you move your body. Fabric that's stretched too tightly will lose its UV effectiveness over time.
Materials:
Nylon and polyester offer the best UV protection. Also, make sure your rash guard has a tight weave, which makes it harder for UV rays to pass through the fabric.
Thermal Protection:
For colder climates, consider a rash guard with built-in thermal protection. The extra layer can make a huge difference in cooler temperatures.
Sleeve Length:
Long sleeves can help protect your arms from the sun’s UV rays, but short sleeves may feel more breathable and comfortable.
How We Selected the Rash Guards
To choose the best rash guards, we've
researched dozens of options
from popular, trusted brands.
First, we speak with experts
to learn which key features every rash guard should have. Then, we
review key specs
from manufacturers and sort through
customer feedback
for dozens of rash guards at a variety of price points to find the top styles. As we continue to evaluate more rash guards, we keep these
important criteria
in mind:
Fit:
We consider the rash guard's silhouette and customer feedback when assessing how it will fit. Is it made from stretchy, breathable materials? How do wearers feel about the fit? This research helps us determine if the rash guard runs small, large, or true to size.
Comfort:
We prioritize rash guards made from high-performance fabrics that won't irritate your skin. We also take into account the rash guard's design—is it adjustable? Does it provide enough coverage?
Design:
There are many styles of rash guards available. We evaluate design based on sleeve length, coverage, zippers or fasteners, and color.
Overall Value:
To assess a rash guard's value, we weigh its price against its features. Based on its fit, comfort, and design, do we think it's priced fairly? Would we buy it ourselves, or would we only purchase it if it went on sale? How does the price compare to other rash guards on the market?
Our Experts
We consulted experts at every stage while researching and writing this story. Although we choose products independently, expert input influences our decisions.
Thomas Cravarezza
, a surf instructor at Manly Surf School in Australia, taught us what to look for while shopping for rash guards and helped us understand how they can protect your skin from UV rays.
Frequently Asked Questions
Do rash guards keep you warm?
Some rash guards come with built-in thermal protection or fleece linings that can help keep you warm. But it's worth noting that rash guards are made to block, reflect, and absorb the sun’s rays—not for body temperature control. If you’re looking for something to keep you warm for long periods of time, consider a wetsuit, which is specifically designed to be worn in cold water.

Your fitness journey requires activewear that not only supports your goals but also celebrates your unique body type, ensuring comfort and confidence with every workout.
Finding the right sports bra
can be a game-changer, but it’s not always easy. Luckily, we found the best plus-size sports bras—with

for jogging, says
Suzanne Koval
, MPT, a physical therapist and Pilates instructor.
To start our search, we first spoke with six fitness and activewear experts to learn more about which

Who It’s For
Best for support during high-impact workouts and comfort for casual wear.
Why We Love It
Glamorise No-Bounce Cami Wire-Free Sports Bra
provides support for
high-intensity circuit training
and comfort during casual wear in between workouts. It’s a
versatile, budget-friendly
option that we favored most in testing. The triple hook-and-eye closure and wide H-style
straps, adjustable at the shoulders and back,
not only offer support but also let you
customize the size
for an optimal fit.
Constructed with a blend of performance materials, the fabric allows
unrestricted movement
and eliminates the need for mid-workout adjustments. The bra feels
breathable and moisture-wicking,
which we especially appreciated during sweaty workouts. Thanks to the high neckline, we also noticed a
flattering lift
that doesn’t reveal too much. During testing, we even found that the bra's reliable support
helped us
lift heavier
and with better form.
Potential Flaws
The material feels somewhat scratchy, but this didn’t affect our overall comfort level and performance.

Who It’s For
Best if you have a limited budget but don’t want to sacrifice support and quality.
Why We Love It
This plus-size sports bra delivers optimal
support and coverage
without a hefty price tag.
All in Motion’s High Support Embossed Racerback Run Sports Bra
helps you find the right fit, with
adjustable straps
at the shoulders and backband. It also helps eliminate any awkward bulging since the material lays flat against your body, especially around the straps, and provides
full coverage
with its high front panel.
For outdoor enthusiasts, the
moisture-wicking features
of this sports bra stand out, thanks to its
breathable and lightweight
polyester fabric. Whether running,
cycling
, or weight lifting, we finished our workouts sweaty but not with a completely soaked bra. Plus, the
multiple color options
add to its appeal, allowing you to choose one (or even a few) to match all your
flared leggings
for a stylish fit.
Potential Flaws
The bra only goes up to cup size DDD, which is lower than many other options on our list.

Our Overall Rating:

Who It’s For
Best for high-impact endurance activities like running, jogging, and
various sports
.
Why We Love It
For
cardio-centric workouts
like running and sports,
lululemon’s Run Times Bra
stands out as a
supportive yet comfortable
choice. Engineered with
perforated accents
and
quick-drying, sweat-wicking fabric,
it keeps us cool and dry during sweaty sessions. We also like that the higher scoop neck adds
coverage
and
prevents spillage
during intense movements. Plus, the encapsulated cups help shape your chest and offer a
flattering lift.
During testing, we found the
wide, padded straps
to be a standout feature. They are not only
adjustable at the shoulders and backband
but can also be swapped between an H-back and X-back style. The
secure triple hook-and-eye closure
is a game-changer, eliminating any unwanted bulging or chafing, making this bra a dependable choice for any gym enthusiast.
Potential Flaws
If your band size goes beyond 42, you might want to check out other choices because that's the largest band size this bra comes in.

Who It’s For
Best for high-impact workouts, especially if you want maximum adjustability and a zip-front style.
Why We Love It
If you prefer a
zip-front sports bra
, we recommend
Shefit’s Ultimate Sports Bra.
We like that this high-impact bra is designed to be totally adjustable, from the
stabilizing band
to the
cushioned convertible straps.
We found it super seamless to adjust, even mid-set if needed. Using
compression and encapsulation
(with removable cups), the bra effectively isolates each breast to prevent movement—making it a reliable choice for high-impact workouts.
To ensure a proper fit
without bulging or spillage,
we recommend using the brand’s quiz, which aligns your traditional bra size with SheFit’s sizing. During testing, we noticed that the blend of performance fabrics feels
breathable and moisture-wicking
—which we particularly appreciated during hot, sweaty workouts. We also love that it's available in
10 stylish shades
since you might want to grab a second one for your activewear rotation.
Potential Flaws
While most sports bras offer a four-way stretch, this one only provides a two-way stretch. We noticed that it feels a bit stiffer than the other options we tested.

Who It’s For
Best for people who want a bra with a longline fit that offers more coverage.
Why We Love It
Girlfriend Collective's Paloma Bra
is a compressive and supportive choice if you want a thick and comfortable bra suitable for both
intense workouts and everyday wear.
While it offers
substantial compression
, effectively holding the chest, it leans more towards a tank-bra style than a traditional sports bra. We found that it delivers a
fashion-forward feel,
effortlessly transitioning us from the studio to the street.
This well-crafted bra features
thick, soft, and opaque fabric,
with no visible marks or loose threads upon opening. A best-selling item from the brand, it comes in
various neutral colors and vibrant limited-edition hues
—we secretly want more than one. And true to Girlfriend Collective's reputation for
inclusive sizing,
this bra is no exception, accommodating a diverse range of body types.
Potential Flaws
The band isn’t adjustable, so it can be hard to find the perfect fit. If customization is important to you, check out SheFit’s Ultimate Sports Bra.

Who It’s For
Best for people who love adjustable straps to achieve maximum lift and support for a workout.
Why We Love It
SheFit’s Low Impact Sports Bra
boasts wide shoulder straps, ensuring optimal comfort and bidding farewell to any unwanted skin digging. Despite being labeled as a low-impact bra, we find it sufficiently supportive for medium-impact exercises, thanks to its zip front and
two center clips that keep it securely in place
. While it may not be the best choice for endless jumping jacks, it suits activities like walking and biking.
In terms of material, this sports bra is
soft to the touch,
providing comfortable wear for extended periods—whether you're heading to the gym or spending a day at work. The straps are secured with Velcro, allowing for
easy adjustments
while wearing. Plus, we love that this bra comes in many fun colors.
Potential Flaws
The non-adjustable ribcage band can make it challenging to get the bra to fit properly and stay in place during a workout.

Best for people who want an adjustable bra with lots of support for high-intensity exercise.
Why We Love It
Anita’s Women's Plus-Size Extreme Control Sport Bra
keeps your chest bounce-free during even intense
HIIT workouts
. It features an
adjustable, quadruple hook-and-eye band
for a customizable fit and a locked-in feel. Plus, the unique tailored construction on the outside and a
seamless interior
keep this bra chafe-free.
We love the three-section cups that offer
side support
for full encapsulation, meaning you’ll have no spillage. There are also
padded, adjustable straps
that add comfort and help tailor this bra to your own personal body shape. And
breathable netting inserts
at the back help wick away sweat. We love that it’s available in
various sizes and colors,
so finding the right style is simple.
Potential Flaws
The bra tends to run smaller, so consider sizing up to ensure you achieve the ideal fit.

Why We Love It
Shapermint’s Truekind Seamless Racerback Sports Bra
combines breathability and lightweight comfort through its soft nylon and spandex construction. It delivers just the right support for
low- to medium-impact activities
like yoga and pilates. We appreciate how the
classic racerback straps
actively provide reliable comfort and
lift your chest
without causing discomfort or digging into your shoulders.
With
removable cups and a scoop neck,
the bra actively offers medium coverage, balancing modesty and flatter for confidence during gym sessions. We also love that it comes in neutral colors and boasts one of the most
inclusive size ranges

Who It’s For
Best if you prefer a cropped silhouette and light support for low-impact exercise and daily wear.
Why We Love It
Athleta’s Conscious Crop Bra
has a
high neckline for coverage
while bending over, as well as
light support
for low-impact exercise or everyday wear. It comes in
over 15 shades,
from bright and bold to neutral, so you can easily pair it with your go-to leggings. It also has
removable pads
for extra coverage and separation.
The crop’s
buttery soft, quick-drying fabric
is rated
UPF 50+
to block UV radiation from the sun when exercising outside. We also love that this bra is
sustainably made
and that it has a
sleek racerback shape
to keep your chest lifted and supported.
Potential Flaws
While generally comfortable, this bra lacks the adjustability for a more personalized fit to meet your specific needs.

Care:
Machine wash cold, tumble dry low
Who It’s For
Best for if you prefer a full-coverage bra that doubles as a
workout tank
, letting you transition from studio to street in style.
Why We Love It
When you need extra coverage, reach for
Old Navy’s PowerChill Longline Sports Bra Tank.
This hybrid design seamlessly combines the length of a tank top with the
gentle support
of a low-impact sports bra, creating versatile activewear suitable for any occasion. The built-in shelf bra features a
front mesh lining
for breathability and
removable cups
for added modesty if desired.
Flat, no-chafe seams and a blend of
soft, moisture-wicking fabrics
ensure comfort, coolness, and dryness. We appreciate the tank's
budget-friendly
price point. It's available in
various colors,
ranging from black to pink, so you can easily snag more than one to match your favorite
workout leggings
.
Potential Flaws
The tank may run small, and the straps aren’t adjustable, so it may be tricky to find the right fit.

Who It’s For
Best for comfort and focus during high-impact workouts, especially if you want a customized fit.
Why We Love It
With a simple,
supportive design
and plenty of adjustability,
Girlfriend Collective’s Simone Bra
is our top choice for comfort.
Sustainably made from recycled water bottles,
the bra is
moisture-wicking,
with a
four-way stretch
that smooths, lifts, and moves with you.
Built for high-impact exercise,
it has the right amount of compression and structured, sewn-in cups. We love the
wide, X-style cross-back straps
and triple hook-and-eye closure, which can be easily adjusted throughout the day as you move.
Made from recycled water bottles
and spandex, the fabric is durable and comes in a
range of jewel tones.
Plus, when this bra wears out, you can send it back for store credit using the company’s
ReGirlfriend
recycling program.
Potential Flaws
The X-style cross-back straps may make slipping into and out of this bra a bit tricky, but it's just a minor inconvenience.
Plus-Size Sports Bras We Also Tested
We’ve tested 10 plus-size sports bras so far, but only six scored high enough to earn a spot on our list. While these three have some noteworthy features, they ultimately didn’t impress us:
Knix’s LuxeLift Pullover Bra
offers comfort with its soft and stretchy material that moves seamlessly during exercise. However, the non-adjustable straps and lack of support make it less suitable for high-impact workouts and larger breasts.
We appreciate the adjustable straps and moisture-wicking material of
Glamorise’s High Impact Seamless Underwire Sports Bra,
but it proved super uncomfortable to wear while working out. The rigid fabric and underwire consistently dug into our ribcage, leaving behind irritating red marks.
While
Athleta’s Advance Sports Bra
offers exceptional support for high-impact workouts, we found it quite uncomfortable to wear. We also had to do a lot of squeezing and shaking to get it on and off, which is particularly annoying after sweaty workouts.
What to Look for When Shopping for a Plus-Size Sports Bra
Support:
Your activity level will determine how much compression and support you need in a plus-size sports bra.
Low-impact sports bras
have less compression and a minimal support structure, for activities like stretching, walking, or yoga.
Medium-impact sports bras
have more compression, an internal structure (like contouring or underwires), and wider straps. They’re best for activities like cycling, barre, and studio classes.
High-impact sports bras
have the strongest level of support, encapsulated cups, wide, adjustable straps or bands, and sometimes underwires. We recommend them for
high-intensity workouts
that have you jumping, bending, running, or moving quickly.
Fit:
Your sports bra should allow you to breathe comfortably and lift your breasts without excessive compression, says
Helena Kaylin
, founder and CEO of MINDD, an online intimate apparel company. She recommends looking for a snug feel that isn't too tight. Look for a fit that covers both the front and sides and always pay attention to size charts for guidance.
Sizes:
To find your traditional bra size, use a measuring tape to measure around your rib cage, right where a bra’s band would sit—this is your band, or underbust, size. Then, measure around the fullest part of your breasts—this is your bust size. Finally, subtract the band size from your bust size to find your cup size.
Cup Style:
The cup style that will work best for you will vary based on your support needs and personal preference, Kaylin says. Compression cups hold your breast to your chest wall to limit movement, while encapsulated cups fully encase each breast to control movement from all angles. A sports bra with an underwire can offer even more support.
Padding:
For extra coverage, you may want a bra made from a thicker material or one with padded cups. Padding helps shape your chest and can also provide modesty, Kaylin says. Ensure that built-in padding is securely stitched or fused in place to avoid shifting or creasing during washing. Sports bras with removable padding allow you to adjust shape and coverage based on your outfit and activity.
Adjustability:
Adjustability is a key feature in many plus-size sports bras, offering customizable fit and support through mechanisms like buckles, hook-and-eye closures, zippers, or Velcro. Regardless of style, Kaylin and certified personal trainer
Amanda Barton
, CPT, recommend a sports bra with wide, padded straps that will comfortably distribute your weight.
Material:
Choose breathable, moisture-wicking performance materials like nylon, polyester, and elastane. These fabrics (along with spandex and Lycra blends) are also soft, stretchy, and comfortable. Avoid bras made from cotton since it retains moisture. Additional features, like laser-cut ventilation or mesh panels, can also help promote airflow and prevent odors.
Care:
Following the manufacturer's laundry instructions is crucial, as some bras require extra care beyond a regular wash. Consider machine-washable bras for a low-maintenance option, and always use a laundry bag to limit stretching. Though some bras can go in the dryer, hanging them to dry may prolong their life and support. Also, don’t forget to remove any cups or pads and secure all hooks before washing.
How We Tested and Selected the Plus-Size Sports Bras
To find the best plus-size sports bra, we’ve
researched and tested dozens of pairs
from top, trusted activewear brands. For options we select through research, we
first speak to our experts
and ask them which features to look for in quality sports bras. Then, we
review key specs and customer feedback
for dozens of bras from top-quality brands at all price points to find the best options on the market. When testing sports bras, we keep these key criteria in mind:
Fit:
When we first try on the bra, we pay attention to how the fit feels—Is it too small? Too tight? Just right? We take note of the fabric's texture against the skin and assess the level of support the bra provides for various activity intensities, ranging from low to high impact. Additionally, we carefully observe the width, padding, and weight distribution capabilities of the straps.
Support:
To determine the level of support, we engage in various exercises, from low- to high-impact. We perform everything from light yoga sequences to high-intensity interval training, paying attention to how well the bra limits bounce and keeps our breasts in place.
Comfort:
Sports bras are notoriously uncomfortable, but that doesn't have to be true. We consider the fabric, compression level, and adjustability features of each bra. We prioritize sports bras that are comfortable to wear for quick workouts and longer periods of time.
Adjustability:
Certain bras provide adjustability options at the shoulder straps and ribcage or backband, allowing for a personalized fit. In our testing process, we thoroughly examine each bra to determine the presence of adjustability features and assess their ease of use. This ensures not only a tailored fit but also a user-friendly experience for optimal comfort and support.
Quality:
If your sports bra starts to fall apart over time, it's not worth your money. Throughout the testing period, we continuously evaluate the bra’s quality: Does the material feel strong? Does the support lessen over time? How does the construction feel against our body?
Durability:
Upon opening each bra, we meticulously inspect it for any missing threads, marks, or signs of wear and tear. During testing, we put the bra through several wears and washes, paying attention to how it looks and feels over time. We only recommend sports bras that maintain their initial quality during testing.
Value:
Finally, we asses each sports bra's value by waiting to look at its price until the end of the testing period. Then, we determine if it's worth the price (or maybe even more) considering each of the above testing categories. Sports bras earn high value scores if we would pay the price and personally recommend them to a friend.
Our Experts
We engaged with experts at every phase of our research, testing, and reporting for this story. Some guided us in identifying key features to look for in top-quality sports bras, while others contributed valuable insights to enhance our testing process.

Frequently Asked Questions
Do sports bras work for large breasts?
Yes, if you have large breasts, wearing a sports bra while working out has many benefits. Not only does a sports bra hold your chest close to the body, making exercise easier, but the added support can reduce pain and strain on your breast tissue, helping to prevent stretch marks and sagging.
How do I choose a sports bra for sagging breasts?
When choosing a sports bra for sagging breasts, examine the straps and assess the fabric’s lift and hold, Koval says. She suggests selecting a bra with adjustable straps and a full cup style, as these features deliver adequate support for sagging breast tissue.
Can you wear a sports bra every day?
Wearing a sports bra daily may lead to back or shoulder pain, especially if you’re not wearing the right size. However, as long as you don’t experience discomfort, it boils down to personal preference.
How tight should a sports bra be?
Your sports bra should be comfortably snug, without any tightness, pinching, or chafing. It also shouldn’t limit your regular range of motion. You should be able to breathe in your sports bra, Kaylin says.
Can you wear a sports bra to bed?
While you can wear a sports bra to bed, it's not always advisable because it can negatively impact your neck, shoulders, and back over time. It can also disrupt your sleep due to the tight and compressive fit that's designed for working out.
Do sports bras contain BPA?
Bisphenol A (BPA)
is a chemical found in some types of plastic. Research has shown that exposure to high levels of BPA can lead to obesity, hormonal imbalances, and uterine cancer, among other health complications.
In May 2023, the Center for Environmental Health (CEH) announced that, after testing, it found high levels of BPA in certain activewear pieces containing blends of polyester and spandex, including sports bras from Sweaty Betty; leggings from Nike, Athleta, Champion, Patagonia, and Kohl’s; shorts from Champion, Nike, and Adidas; and athletic shirts from Fabletics. We may recommend some of these products or similar items from these brands in this list, as
these products have not been recalled and the science on transdermal absorption of BPA is still not settled.
According to Joshua Zeichner, MD, associate professor of dermatology and director of cosmetic and clinical research in dermatology at Mount Sinai Hospital, the best way to prevent BPA exposure is to make educated decisions in choosing your personal care products. As a precaution, it is best to limit the amount of time you spend in activewear by changing out of it when you are finished working out.

What to Look For
Why Trust Verywell Fit
Verywell Fit / Israel Fontoura
Whether you’re
working on your core strength
or
improving your flexibility
, the right pair of yoga shorts can make a huge difference in your workout. Pairs made from
lightweight, absorbent fabric
will keep you feeling cool and comfortable
on your mat
. Another factor to consider is
compression:
“They should be just tight enough to keep everything in its place, but not so tight to restrict your range of motion or be uncomfortable in yoga postures,” says
Jared Foote, MTS, CPFT
, a certified yoga instructor based in Koh Samui, Thailand.
To find the best yoga shorts for men, we first asked experts which key features every pair should have. Then,
we put a few pairs to the test,
completing yoga, cardio, and
strength training workouts
to determine which are built to last. We evaluated the shorts based on their
quality, durability, fit, sweat-wicking ability, style, and overall value.
A certified yoga instructor from our
Review Board
also reviewed the contents of this article for accuracy and how to evaluate men's yoga shorts.

Pros
Lightweight
Moisture-wicking
Sleek, stylish design
Cons
Pricier than other options
Key Specs
Materials:
Polyester, elastane |
Sizes:
XS to XXL |
Inseam:
5, 7, or 9 inches
Why We Love Them
lululemon's Pace Breaker Linerless Short 9"
checks all of our boxes—they're
extremely comfortable, lightweight, and stretchy
(which is no surprise, considering
we love their leggings
for the same reasons). During testing, we noticed that they're excellent for
sweat-inducing hot yoga classes
that require lots of movement. Even though they're
soft to the touch,
they still wick moisture away well.
These shorts may not have a built-in liner, but they're still
designed to be supportive,
with a drawstring that's easy to adjust and stays in place. We also love how
sleek and stylish
they look—the design made us feel confident on our way to the gym. Other notable features include
zippered pockets
to keep your phone and other essentials close by.
Potential Flaws
These shorts are one of our pricier picks, although we think they're worth the investment for their high-quality materials and design.

Best Budget
Amazon Essentials Performance Tech Shorts

$19 at Amazon
Pros
Wide range of colors and patterns
Versatile
Four-way stretch
Cons
May run large
Not as opaque
Key Specs
Materials:
Polyester |
Sizes:
S to XXL |
Inseam:
8 inches
Why We Love Them
Amazon Essentials' Performance Tech Loose-Fit Shorts
are the best budget-friendly option we tested. We love that you get
two pairs of shorts
for less than the price of some of our other top picks—plus, these shorts are
versatile
and can be worn to everything from
yoga class
to strength training workouts.
Made from 100% polyester, these
lightweight
pairs have
four-way stretch
and won't hold onto sweat. And we like that they have an
adjustable drawstring,
so you can customize the fit. They're also available in a
wide range of colors and patterns
to match any style.
Potential Flaws
These shorts were a little baggier than we would have liked for yoga, resembling basketball shorts.
They're mesh, meaning they're fairly transparent—something to note if you plan to wear them at a studio or while running errands, and not just for a home workout.

Best for Agility
Manduka Agility Short
PHOTO: Manduka
View on Manduka.com
Pros
Four-way stretch
Faux fly
Sleek, stylish design
Cons
Pricier than other options
Key Specs
Materials:
Polyester, spandex |
Sizes:
S to XXL |
Inseam:
9 inches
Why We Love Them
The athletic fit of
Manduka's Agility Short
makes them great for everything from
Downward Facing Dog
to
Pigeon Pose
.
Lightweight and moisture-wicking,
they dry quickly and keep you cool, thanks to the
breathable,
polyester blend fabric. We also love the
sleek, modern design,
which sets them apart from our other top picks.
The
waistband lays flat
and has an
adjustable drawstring,
so there's no need to constantly pull them up during your practice. And while the
four-way stretch material
isn't very compressive, it's
comfortable
and non-restrictive. Other notable features include a
faux fly
and
secure pockets
at the sides.
Potential Flaws
These are also on the pricey side—but if you're searching for high-quality shorts you can also wear outside of the gym, we think they're well worth the added cost.
Best Long
YOGA CROW Men's Swerve Shorts
PHOTO: Amazon
$60 at Amazon
View on Yogacrow.com
Pros
Inner drawstring
Doesn’t bunch up
Four-way stretch
Cons
May be too thick for hot yoga
Loose pockets
Key Specs
Materials:
Polyester, nylon |
Sizes:
XS to L |
Inseam:
7 inches
Why We Love Them
Breathable
and flexible,
Yoga Crow's Swerve Shorts
have
four-way stretch
that allow you to move freely during your practice. Made from a blend of nylon and polyester, they have a
built-in mesh liner
that offers plenty of support and an
internal drawstring
to keep the waistband in place. Plus, they have a
longer inseam
that hits most wearers right above the knee for added coverage.
Since they're on the thicker side, they're ideal for yogis who prefer more compressive shorts. This also means
you won't have to adjust them,
since they won't fall down or bunch up during class. We love that they're made with
anti-microbial technology
that fights bacteria to keep them smelling fresh.
Potential Flaws
The material is thicker, so we don't recommend wearing these shorts for hot yoga.
The pockets don't zip, meaning they're not as secure.
What to Look for When Shopping for Yoga Shorts for Men
Style:
The most important design factors to look out for are style and compression. Check the shorts' inseam length to see where they'll fall on you, whether that's mid-thigh or around your knee. Yoga teacher
Peter Bartesch, CPT
, also recommends shopping for shorts with no zippers and deep front pockets. Compression is up to your personal preference: Certified yoga instructor
Sam Gach, NASM-CPT
, notes that as long as you feel comfortable in your shorts, they can be as tight or as loose as you'd like.
Comfort:
To make sure your shorts are ultra-comfortable, consider whether they're lined or not. Liners (or built-in underwear) can feel itchy or overly snug, depending on the fit and material.
Material:
Look for yoga shorts made from fabrics like polyester, nylon, and spandex, which are stretchy and wick moisture away quickly. Avoid cotton—it's more absorbent and can hold onto sweat.
How We Tested the Yoga Shorts for Men
To find the best yoga shorts for men, we've
researched and tested dozens of pairs
from popular, trusted brands. For the pairs we select through research, we
first speak with experts
to find out which features to look for in high-quality yoga shorts. Then, we
review key specs and customer feedback
for dozens of shorts at
all price points
to find the best options on the market. As we continue to test and evaluate more yoga shorts, we keep these key criteria in mind:
Quality:
When we first open the shorts, we check them for any defects, like holes or loose threads. Do they feel high-quality?
Durability:
During testing, we wear the shorts for cardio, yoga, and strength training workouts. At the end of the testing period, we note how well they've held up. After multiple wears and washes, do they still look like new? Or do we notice any pilling, fading, or other signs of wear?
Fit:
How do the shorts fit and feel on? Are they easy to wear, or do we find ourselves looking forward to taking them off? We also consider which materials the shorts are made of and how they feel against our skin. Do the shorts cause any irritation or chafing?
Sweat-Wicking:
We prioritize yoga shorts that are breathable and wick away sweat well. Ideally, they're made from high-performance materials that don't hold onto moisture, even during
hot yoga sessions
.
Style:
Yoga shorts come in different lengths and shapes. As we wear each pair, we consider where they hit on our legs, and whether the silhouette is flattering. Are they lined? Do we reach for them regularly, or do we keep prefer other shorts we already own?
Overall Value:
To accurately rate each pair's value, we don't check the price until the end of the testing period, after we've scored them in all other categories. Based on their performance, do we think they're priced fairly? Or would we only buy them if they went on sale? If a pair of shorts scored highly on all attributes but is significantly more expensive than others we tested, we don't give them a perfect value score.
Our Experts
We relied on experts at every stage while researching and reporting this story. Some, like Foote and Bartesch, helped us understand which features to look for while shopping for yoga shorts. Although we choose products independently, expert input influences our decisions.

Frequently Asked Questions
What kind of shorts should I wear to yoga?
Look for shorts that are comfortable, breathable, and moisture-wicking. Ultimately, the fit and length are up to you—Gach and Foote note that your shorts should be as tight as you are comfortable with, as long as they don't restrict your range of motion.

Frequently Asked Questions
Why Trust Verywell Fit
Verywell Fit
When you’re busy on the go or
conquering an intense workout
, the last thing you want to worry about is your sports bra. It’s especially important to
choose a sports bra
that’s designed for your body type—and when it comes to smaller busts, certain styles just don’t cut it. The right
sports bras
are comfortable, sweat-wicking, and structured for stress-free support all day long. To find the best sports bras for small chests, we first spoke with experts (including personal trainers and bra designers) for advice on which
key features
to look for in each style.
We’ve also
tested 61 expert-approved sports bras
from popular fitness brands in the real world, sweating in them and wearing them during our daily routines. We prioritized bras made with soft, quick-drying material that won’t rub or chafe. Our top picks received high marks for
fit, support, comfort, adjustability, durability, and overall value
. For accuracy and even more advice on how to shop for a sports bra that feels great, we also had a certified personal trainer from our
Review Board
review this article.
How to Measure for a Sports Bra
To get the best fit, you can take your own measurements at home before you start shopping. Start by wearing a non-padded, non-compressive sports bra and use a soft measuring tape. You’ll need to find two key measurements: band size and cup size.
To determine your band size, place the measuring tape around your ribcage and pull it snug, right underneath your bust. If you have another person to help you, you can have them hold the tape and relax your arms at your sides while you exhale to get a more accurate measurement. Round down to the nearest whole number to get your rib cage measurement. You can use this number to find your corresponding band size on most brands’ size charts.
To find your cup size, measure around the fullest part of your bust. Then, subtract your ribcage measurement from your bust measurement. The difference translates to your cup size: Less than one inch means you’re most likely an AA cup, one inch translates to an A cup—all the way up to 6 inches, meaning you’re a DDD or F cup. The bras on our list are designed to fit and cater to most band sizes up to a C cup. If you need a larger cup size, see our picks for
sports bras for large breasts

Who It’s For
Best for most low- to high-impact activities, including running,
high-intensity interval training (HIIT)
, and weight training.
Why We Love It
Nike’s Dri-FIT Indy Sports Bra
is our top overall pick for smaller breasts because it has the ideal amount of compression, but still
fits our rib cages well
. We love that the straps are
adjustable from the front
—plus, the V-neck design offers just enough coverage without feeling restrictive.
When we tested this bra, we liked that the
soft fabric
provided the
right amount of support
(no bouncing or chafing) and had a
snug, comfortable fit
. Even though the brand says it provides light support, our 34A tester found the support adequate even for
high-impact workouts
.
Breathable mesh panels
in the front and on the sides stopped sweat from building up, even during a 15-mile run.
The Indy Sports Bra does have some light padding for modesty, but we like that it’s removable. Another bonus? Unlike with many other bras we’ve tested, the
padding stays in place
and won’t roll or slip out in the wash. Plus, it comes in a range of bright colors you can wear alone or underneath
your favorite tank top
.
Potential Flaws
Although the straps are on the thinner side, it’s worth noting that they didn’t dig into our shoulders during testing.
Most Valuable Insight
“This is the world's perfect sports bra. I save it for my longest runs because of how comfortable it has been.” —

Who It’s For
Best if you’ve had issues finding a compressive sports bra that doesn’t squish your chest or cause “uniboob.”
Why We Love It
For a budget-friendly sports bra that still pulls its weight, we recommend
Running Girl’s Sports Bra
. While running, lifting weights, stretching, and doing
boot camp workouts
, we were pleasantly surprised by how well it kept our chests in place without feeling uncomfortable or restrictive.
The band sat comfortably on our rib cages
and
didn’t ride up
—even during MMA-style sweat sessions.
The
thick fabric
(a blend of nylon and spandex) is
soft and smooth
, and we love the
strappy details
in the back. This sports bra is easy to slip on and off overhead—plus, it fit us perfectly. Even after weeks of wears and washes, the
color stayed vivid
(it comes in 35 colors) and we
didn’t find any pilling
, proving that you don’t need to spend a fortune to find high-quality sports bras.
Potential Flaws
We didn’t have any issues with the way this bra fits, but we still wish the straps or band were adjustable.
The removable cups may twist up in the wash, so you might need to adjust them occasionally.
Most Valuable Insight
“I highly recommend this bra. It's comfy, cute, stylish, and gets the job done. I can work out with no pain, discomfort, or excessive bouncing.”

Who It’s For
Best for low-impact workouts, like yoga,
Pilates
, or walking.
Why We Love It
Alo Yoga’s Wild Thing Bra
boasts ​​ruching down the front, a deep neckline, and a V-cut band for a
flattering fit
that’ll get you compliments from Pilates to brunch. We love the
four-way stretch
material that moved with us during weight training sessions and outdoor hikes. Plus, it
lifts small chests
without overly compressing or flattening your breasts.
This
versatile studio-to-street top
is a go-to for Alexis Sweeney, founder of the Silhouette by Alexis App and online fitness platform. It’s supportive and
very well-made
,
she explains—and, as a B cup, it’s the only plunge bra she can wear while teaching dance cardio classes. Choose from a range of neutral and bright colors (just note that only the lightest shades include additional padding).
Potential Flaws
We don’t recommend this bra for medium- or high-impact workouts because it isn’t as compressive as some of our other top picks.
The straps and band aren't adjustable, although we found that the stretchy material fits true to size.
Most Valuable Insight
“I love that I was able to use it both as a sports bra for exercise and as a shirt for hiking, and even for going out! It’s super flattering.”

Who It’s For
Best for sweaty workouts, from strength training to hot yoga.
Why We Love It
For deadlifts, chest presses, lunges, and everything in between, we recommend
Gymshark's Sweat Seamless Bra
. The
soft fabric
contains nylon, polyester, and elastane, so it stays
breathable
even during
hot yoga classes
. We love the amount of coverage, which kept us feeling secure during workouts and never needed to be adjusted. We were also surprised by the construction of the
removable cups
—they’re
thicker
and
more padded
than others we tried, with tapered edges that are
almost undetectable.
The
straps never dug into our skin,
and the thin width makes them easy to hide underneath a tank top. The brand notes that the Sweat Seamless bra is designed to offer low support, although our 34A tester enjoyed wearing it for everything from cardio to tennis matches, thanks to the
compressive band
. No matter what your weekly training schedule brings, this sports bra is built to help you power through it.
Potential Flaws
This bra runs small, according to Gymshark—we ordered up one size from our usual for the right fit.
Most Valuable Insight
“I love that it looks like a basic sports bra, but it's so high-quality and high-performing that it's become a staple piece in my athletic wardrobe. I would not change anything about this bra!”

Who It’s For
Best for everyday wear, especially if your workout routine is mostly low-impact.
Why We Love It
When you’re
moving through yoga poses
, you need a sports bra that’s
ultra-soft and supportive
, but never restrictive—like
lululemon’s Flow Y Nulu Longline Bra
, designed
specifically for A to C cups
. We tested this sports bra during yoga classes, indoor and outdoor walks, Pilates, and low-impact strength training. As we wore it, we found that the fit was on the
compressive
side, and the
comfortable band
stayed snug around our ribcages. It
doesn’t
dig in or ride up
, and it stayed in place during every workout.
Made with lululemon’s signature Align fabric (a silky blend of nylon and Lycra elastane), we love how well this bra holds up through multiple wears and washes. Whether we paired it with leggings on the weekends or
bike shorts
in the gym, the
flattering fit
never let us down.
Potential Flaws
The band and straps aren't adjustable, but we were still able to find the right fit. We also liked that the bra never shifted around as we wore it.
Most Valuable Insight
“This bra is as comfortable as a sports bra can get! It feels really light and soft on the skin.”

Who It’s For
Best for wearing on its own or underneath a low- or open-back workout top.
Why We Love It
lululemon’s Free to Be Bra
was
made for A to B cups
and offers
light support
that'll keep you comfortable during
low-impact activities
.
During testing, we loved the fit—our tester, who has a wide rib cage, noted that the band felt snug and lay completely flat without budging. Even with a slight V-neck, we liked the coverage this bra provided, without any gapping or spillage that would have distracted us during workouts.
The
slight padding
offers a little
extra coverage
and shaping without feeling too thick or bulky. And after wearing this bra for a few days each week and washing it after each workout, it
didn’t pill, stretch, or fade
.
Breathable and sweat-wicking
, it’s made from the brand’s signature
four-way stretch
Luxtreme fabric—also used in some of
lululemon's best leggings
—that stays
cool to the touch
, even as you start to feel the heat.
Potential Flaws
Like some of our other top picks, we wish this bra was adjustable.
It’s worth noting that our tester (a 36B) noticed slight marks on her shoulders from the bra’s straps. If you’re between two sizes, you may want to choose the larger option for a more comfortable fit.

Who It’s For
Best if you like high-coverage styles with enough support for most activities.
Why We Love It
Our favorite medium-impact sports bra by far is the
Pionxr Bra Top
from
Goal Five,
a soccer-inspired brand. We like that it’s
double-lined,
with
removable pads
for additional support and opacity. And it fit perfectly—snug enough to feel secure, it wasn’t so tight to the point of causing spillage. From walking to
mat workouts
, the Pionxr Top stayed
comfortable
and
kept us cool,
thanks to the
breathable polyester and Spandex blend.
We also like that the bra is longer, making it a great option to wear alone if you enjoy
outdoor workouts
in warm weather. And we love that it
washes well,
without losing its shape or fading.
Potential Flaws
The straps and band aren't adjustable. However, our tester noted that this bra fit her better than other adjustable bras she's worn.
The removable cups tend to move around during workouts, but we found that they're easy to readjust.

Who It’s For
Best for running, jogging, cycling, or other intense movement.
Why We Love It
Don’t let your sports bra slow you down during high-impact workouts.
Reebok’s Running Essentials High-Impact Sports Bra
carried us through runs, hikes, and days spent
mountain biking
with ease. The
soft, stretchy band
is one of the most comfortable ones we’ve found—and, even after weeks of wear, it
never stretched out
or lost its shape.
This budget-friendly bra
stays in place, won’t ride up
, and
holds everything in
without putting too much pressure on your ribcage. We also like that it comes up higher on the sides, for better coverage that prevents frustrating spillage. Another bonus? We noticed that it
cuts down on bouncing
and
doesn’t chafe
, even when you sweat.
Potential Flaws
While the straps are comfortable, the neckline may be too high for some.

Our Overall Rating:
5/5
Who It’s For
Best if you want coverage and opacity, plus some added shape and fullness in the bust area.
Why We Love It
Lots of sports bras on our list are padded, but Lemedy’s Padded Sports Bra does double duty. Not only does it provide added coverage, but we also found that the pads shaped our busts in a subtle, flattering way. Blurring the lines between a longline sports bra and a crop top, it offers sculpting and support for studio workouts or everyday wear.
Made with nylon and spandex, the
opaque material
marries
stretch
and
shape retention
, with a
lightweight feel
. We found ourselves reaching for it often because it’s comfortable for lounging, but also supportive enough for exercising. During testing, it held up well for a variety of low- to high-impact activities, including
barre classes
, weight training, and running. Perfect for layering or mixing and matching with
your favorite leggings
, it’s an
easy, no-fuss top
we can’t get enough of.
Potential Flaws
We noticed that the pads pop out in the wash, but they're easy to put back in compared to other bras we've tested.
The thick pads in this bra may trap air, making you feel warmer and sweatier, says LaJean Lawson, PhD, sports bra researcher and movement expert.
Most Valuable Insight
“I find myself reaching for this bra more than any other sports bra. It is such a good deal for the quality and how much I wore (and will) wear it. Best deal on Amazon!”

Why We Love It
Girlfriend Collective's Juliet Strappy Bra
boasts a

. We tested this bra through months of weightlifting workouts, plus summer festivals and concerts, and it never dug into our skin or left marks. The

fabric made from recycled plastic water bottles is
incredibly soft,
opaque, and sweat-wicking
.
We love that this bra is

. This means it blocks 98% of the sun’s UVA and UVB rays, so you can walk, hike, or exercise outdoors and know that you’re protected.
Even better: It comes in sizes ranging from XXS to 6XL, with

Who It’s For
The modern silhouette is best worn on its own—we love this sports bra for running errands or grabbing coffee with a friend.
Why We Love It
Made from
lululemon's
buttery-soft, light Nulu fabric, the
Align Bra
is the ideal top for yoga, lounging, studio classes, and everyday wear. The
low back
pairs perfectly with workout tanks, while the
thick band
provides a
secure, smooth fit
.
When testing this bra, we liked how the straps and the band fit, holding everything up without squeezing or digging into our skin. Plus, the sturdy fabric is
on the thicker side
for coverage, but is still
breathable
enough to wear for long periods of time. We also love that, like some of our other top picks, this sports bra has
four-way stretch
that moves with you from the minute you slip into it.
Potential Flaws
It’s pretty low-cut—we noticed some side spillage around the underarm area.

Who It’s For
Best for studio classes (think yoga, barre, Pilates), especially in a heated room.
Why We Love It
Athleta's Solace Bra
is the most breathable option we tested, with a
lightweight lining
for
superior ventilation
and a nylon and spandex exterior that
wicks away sweat
.
We love that the design compresses your bust to
minimize movement
and
distribute the weight of your chest evenly
. And the
removable pads
are relatively thin, tapered, and naturally shaped so you can actually recognize your boobs, says Julia Breitwieser, former bra designer at Athleta and lululemon. While the straps are narrow, the placement and interlacing allow for optimal support, she adds.
When testing this bra, we loved how high-end the
smooth fabric
feels—perfect for sweaty workouts in a heated studio. We especially loved it for weightlifting and HIIT classes as it offered
solid support
, even though the brand lists it as low-impact.
Potential Flaws
This bra doesn’t have an adjustable band or straps.
We found that the band runs tight and digs into our shoulders a bit, so you may want to size up.

Who It’s For
Best if you need a versatile, wear-anywhere bra with a high neckline for extra coverage.
Why We Love It
Tank-style bras bring you the best of both worlds: Wear them in the gym as a sports bra or pair them with leggings, jeans, or a tennis skirt for an easy weekend outfit.
PE Nation’s Tempo Sports Bra
is our favorite for small chests because it has a
built-in shelf
that’s meant for low-impact workouts like yoga or Pilates. The
racerback design
sets this sports bra apart from most others on our list, showing off your shoulders in the studio or the coffee shop line.
Made from a buttery blend of recycled polyester and elastane, this top is comfortable enough to wear all day long. We also like that the
high neckline
provides plenty of coverage, so you don’t have to worry about anything spilling over in
wheel pose
.
Potential Flaws
This is one of the priciest sports bras we recommend. But we think it’s worth the investment for how versatile it is.
We wish it was available in more colors.
We Tested the Best High-Impact Sports Bras—These 12 Can Handle Any Workout
Sports Bras for Small Chests We Also Tested
We tested 61 sports bras, but they can’t all be winners. Although we liked some aspects of these bras for small chests, they didn’t impress us enough to earn a spot on our final list of recommendations.
Hanes’ Racerback Bralettes
were seriously comfortable, but they didn’t offer any support. They don’t have a ton of structure, and we found that the thin, soft, stretchy fabric was best suited for lounging at home.
The cups in
Brooks’ Dare Strappy Run Bra 2.0
were too small and squished our breasts down, instead of separating and supporting them. We also wish this bra were adjustable. But we liked that the band and the straps didn’t dig in or cause irritation.
Asics’ Accelerate Bra
didn’t stretch at all, which made it difficult to put on and take off. We also noticed that the straps were too tight, even on the loosest setting. Still, we appreciated that the fabric was thick enough to hide our nipples, since this bra doesn’t have any padding.
Where We Stand
After
testing 61 sports bras
,
Nike’s Dri-Fit Indy Sports Bra
is our top overall pick for small chests because it offers just enough coverage and support without feeling restrictive. We also love that it has removable padding—plus, you can adjust the straps in the front for a secure fit. We continue to test each sports bra at home, and we’ll update our recommendations if we find anything new that we haven’t already mentioned here.
Verywell Fit
What to Look for When Shopping for Sports Bras for Small Chests
Types of Sports Bras
Sports bras for smaller chests usually have a lower front neckline, narrower straps, and less fabric on the backside of the bra, says Breitwieser. But design aside, there are three types of sports bras to keep in mind:
Compression:
Compression sports bras offer support by pressing your breast tissue against your chest wall, preventing excess movement.
Most of our top picks are compression bras. When opting for a compression sports bra, Breitwieser suggests making sure you feel hugged—if the band or cups feel too loose, the bra may not hold you in securely.
Encapsulation:
Encapsulation sports bras are designed with two separate cups that lift, stabilize, and support your breasts from all angles during physical activity.
This style often features light to medium padding with seamless, molded cups for smooth coverage. Breitwieser's tip: Make sure your breasts fill out each cup completely, or else you'll get movement within the cup instead of support.
Hybrid:
Some bras combine features of both compression and encapsulation bras. The specifics may vary by style, but hybrid designs can be a good option if you’ve had trouble finding compression or encapsulation sports bras that fit you well.
Key Features
Support Level:
No matter your cup size, finding a sports bra with the right amount of support is key.
High-impact sports bras
are ideal for intense workouts like running and cardio, while low-impact options are better for yoga or Pilates. Steer clear of styles with overly skinny straps or super low necklines in the gym—instead, save them for your rest days.
Materials:
Some materials are better for exercise than others. Spandex, nylon, and polyester are common in performance fabrics that wick away moisture well. Avoid cotton, which can hold onto moisture and retain odors.
Fit:
A properly fitting sports bra minimizes breast movement in all directions (forward and back, up and down, and side to side) and won’t cause chafing or discomfort, explains Breitwieser. Some sports bras use standard sizing, while others use cup sizes. Either way, look for a sports bra that feels snug and secure, says Marni Salup, CPT, a certified personal trainer and yoga teacher. When trying a sports bra on, pay attention to the band: If it rides up in the back, either the band is too large or the straps are too short. Also note: while you want the band of your sports bra to feel snug, it shouldn't be too tight that it feels restrictive around your ribcage. A recent study found that sports bras with a too-tight band may interfere with running performance.
Adjustability:
If you find that your sports bra slides up when you lift your arms overhead, try one with an adjustable band and straps instead, Salup says. Hook-and-loop closures in the back will help the band stay snug and in place, while sliding buckles will allow you to adjust the straps in seconds. You also try
exercise dresses
that have built-in bras, which can stay in-place a little easier.

How We Selected and Tested the Sports Bras
To find the best sports bras for smaller chests, we’ve tested 61 options from popular fitness brands so far. As we wear and wash each sports bra, we evaluate it for the following criteria:
Fit:
First, we try on the sports bra and note how it fits. Are the straps wide enough to evenly distribute the weight of our breasts without digging into our shoulders? We also try to slip two fingers underneath the straps and the band to see how tight they are. Then, we note how the band rests around our ribcage and if there’s any spillage, gaps, or loose fabric.
Support:
During the initial wear, we do jumping jacks for 2 minutes or jog for 10 minutes to test the sports bra’s impact level. How supportive does it feel? Does it hold our chests in place without feeling restrictive? For bras with padding, we note whether the cups feel too thin, overly bulky, or just right.
Comfort:
We assess how comfortable each sports bra feels during different activities like walking, running, yoga, and more. We prioritize bras made from soft, breathable materials that don’t dig into our skin or leave red marks. Are we counting down the minutes until we can take the bra off, or do we forget we’re even wearing it?
Adjustability:
If the bra has an adjustable band or straps, we test them to see how easy they are to use. How well can we adjust the fit? If the bra isn’t adjustable, we note whether it feels too tight, too loose, or perfectly snug.
Durability:
We wash each sports bra after every wear to see how it holds up over time. Does it maintain its structure, or does it stretch out? Does it show any signs of pilling or fading? If the bra has any padding, we note how the cups hold up in the wash, too.
Value:
We wait to check the price of each sports bra until after we’ve evaluated them in every other category. Our top picks cost between $10 and $100. Sports bras with a high overall value score performed so well in our tests that we’d be happy to pay the list price for them, if not more.
Our Experts
We interviewed five experts for advice on which key features to look for in quality sports bras for exercisers with smaller chests. More on our experts:
LaJean Lawson, PhD
, sports bra researcher and movement expert
Julia Breitwieser
, former bra designer at Athleta and lululemon
Marni Salup, CPT
, certified personal trainer, Ironman-certified coach, and 500-hour certified yoga teacher
Alexis Sweeney
, founder of the Silhouette by Alexis App and online fitness platform
Joshua Zeichner, MD
, associate professor of dermatology and director of cosmetic and clinical research in dermatology at Mount Sinai Hospital
Frequently Asked Questions
What bra size is considered small-chested?
When it comes to cups, anything from AA to B is considered on the smaller side, Salup says, although some of our top picks go up to a C cup.
How should a sports bra fit if you have a small chest?
The right sports bra should feel snug and comfortable—not so tight that it leaves marks behind, but tight enough that you can only slip two fingers underneath the straps and the band. Take the time to jump around or try a downward dog in the fitting room or your home before assessing if a sports bra is the right one for you, Breitwieser says.
Can you swim in a sports bra?
We don’t recommend it: The fabrics used in most sports bras aren’t made to withstand chlorine or saltwater. Breitwieser adds that swimming in a sports bra can also cause the garment to break down much sooner. Try one of
our favorite swimsuits
instead.
Do sports bras contain BPA?
Bisphenol A (BPA)
is a chemical found in some types of plastic.
Research has shown that exposure to high levels of BPA can lead to obesity, hormonal imbalances, and uterine cancer, among other health complications.
In May 2023, the Center for Environmental Health (CEH) announced that, after testing, it found high levels of BPA in certain activewear pieces containing blends of polyester and spandex, including sports bras from Sweaty Betty; leggings from Nike, Athleta, Champion, Patagonia, and Kohl’s; shorts from Champion, Nike, and Adidas; and athletic shirts from Fabletics.
We may recommend some of these products or similar items from these brands in this list, as
these products have not been recalled and the science on transdermal absorption of BPA is still not settled
.
Is it bad to wear a sports bra all the time?
The best way to prevent BPA exposure is to make educated decisions in choosing your personal care products, explains Zeichner. As a precaution, it’s best to limit the amount of time you spend in activewear by changing out of it as soon as you’re finished working out.

Why We Love Them
We recommend
luluemon's Align High-Rise Shorts
for low- to medium-impact workouts, everyday wear, and casual lounging. The Nulu fabric blends nylon and Lycra elastane for a
buttery soft feel

super-stretchy
with
lightweight compression.
During testing, we also loved the high-rise waistband that doesn’t budge or dig in. And we appreciate that the fabric is
incredibly breathable
and
sweat-wicking.

lululemon’s Always Effortless Jacket
for an easy post-class look.
Potential Flaws

lululemon Materials, Explained
lululemon shorts are constructed from a variety of signature fabrics:
Swift
is a lightweight, quick-drying, and sweat-wicking fabric that feels weightless and breathable. This polyester and elastane fabric is best suited for running and similar activities. It has a four-way stretch, so you won’t feel constricted as you pound the pavement.
Nulu fabric
, made from nylon and Lycra elastane, feels soft and lightweight. It’s sweat-wicking and breathable, with Lycra fibers for even more stretch. Shorts made from Nulu are best for lower-impact workouts, like yoga or Pilates, or lounging, because high-friction movements, like running, can cause the fabric to pill.
Everlux
is lululemon’s fastest-drying fabric and is stretchy, supportive, and comfortable. Containing nylon and Lycra elastane, this fabric feels brushed and soft on the outside and sleek and cool on the inside. Everlux was designed to disperse sweat, so shorts made from this fabric are perfect for sweaty studio classes, like spinning, and high-intensity workouts.
French terry
, made of cotton and elastane, feels super soft and stretchy, just like your favorite cozy sweatshirt. Shorts made from breathable French terry are not ideal for intense workouts—they’re best for hanging out or running errands.
Abrasion-resistant fabric
is tough and designed to withstand scrapes, scuffs, and tears. Made from durable nylon, recycled nylon, and elastane, it's best for hiking and similar activities where you are more exposed to the elements. It’s also water-repellent to help keep you dry.
What to Look for When Shopping for lululemon Shorts
Length:
lululemon’s shorts come in a range of inseam lengths. For women, you’ll find looser style shorts in 2.5-inch, 3-inch, and 4-inch lengths, and tight-fitting styles all the way up to a 10-inch length. And for men, you’ll find lengths around 7 inches.
Waistband Rise:
Depending on your preference, you can choose low-rise, mid-rise, high-rise, and super-high-rise styles. Some waistband fabrics, like Everlux, will offer more compression and support than others.
Fit:
Choose a fit based on the activities you do. Loose styles with wide leg openings are great for running, walking, and hiking. Many loose-fitting shorts also have lightweight liners to protect you from chafing. For low-impact activities that require a lot of flexibility, you may prefer a tight-fitting short that molds to your body.
Pockets:
Nearly all lululemon shorts have at least one pocket built in. Many of the women’s shorts have smaller, drop-in pockets in the waistband that can fit keys, credit cards, or other small valuables. Some styles have additional zippered pockets, and a few styles even have front pockets.
Design:
Along with pockets, lululemon shorts have other features that set them apart from competitors, like continuous drawstrings, liners, reflective detailing, and sweat-wicking fabrics. Consider how and when you’ll be wearing your shorts to determine the right design elements for you.
How We Selected and Tested the lululemon Shorts
To find the best lululemon shorts, we consulted experts to learn which key features to look for and get their specific recommendations. Using their guidance, we sifted through all of the brand’s shorts styles to narrow down our list. Finally, we also tested two pairs in our regular workout routines, evaluating each one based on the following key criteria.
Material:
First, we check which signature fabric the shorts are made of to determine if it holds up to the claims. Then, during our daily wear and workouts, we pay attention to how the material feels: Is it soft and stretchy? Breathable and sweat-wicking? We also consider the level of compression and what types of activities the shorts are best suited for.
Hold:
As we continue working out, we focus on how well the shorts stay up. If shorts have good hold, you won’t have to adjust them much while moving. We participate in various activities, like weight lifting, yoga, walking, and more, to see how well the shorts stay put.
Durability:
We’ve been wearing the shorts we tested for this article for over three years. Over this time, we consider how they’ve held up and whether they look the same now as they did when we first purchased them (aside from normal signs of wear). We only recommend lululemon shorts that are durable and worth your money.
Our Experts
We reached out to fitness experts during our research, testing, and reporting for this story. They helped us determine which key features to consider and even provided some style-specific recommendations. While we choose products independently, our experts help inform our decisions.

Frequently Asked Questions
How do I find the right size lululemon shorts?
Most styles tend to fit true to size and are pretty consistent with other clothing brands, but some lululemon women’s shorts may run one size smaller than your usual size. If you can’t try on the shorts in a store, consider choosing one size up when ordering online.
Do lululemon shorts ride up?
If your lululemon shorts are the correct size for your body, they are unlikely to ride up. lululemon’s fabrics and design features help the shorts stay in place throughout your workouts.
Which lululemon fabric has the most compression?
Luxtreme fabric is the most compressive fabric at lululemon. Made from nylon and Lycra elastane, it’s smooth and cool to the touch. It has a tight interlock construction that offers high support while still feeling stretchy and breathable.
How do you care for lululemon shorts?
To keep them looking and performing their best, all lululemon shorts should be washed in cold water with like colors. You can put shorts made from Swift, French terry, and abrasion-resistant fabric in the dryer, but you’ll need to line-dry those made from Nulu and Everlux.
Does lululemon have sales?
lululemon doesn’t necessarily call it a sale section, but they do have a “We Made Too Much” section that is a gold mine of popular discounted items. Be mindful that Llululemon sale items are non-returnable, so double-check your size before placing an order online.

Why Trust Verywell Fit
Verywell Fit / Sara Michael
It only takes one run with exposed hands to know that running gloves are essential when dressing for cold
weather
runs. Running without gloves in frigid weather is uncomfortable and distracting and can lead to cracked and chafed skin or more serious issues like frostbite. Personal trainer
Michele Canon, CPT
, says running in cold weather without proper protection can lead to poor circulation in your hands and fingers. This can cause numbness, discoloration, or exacerbate conditions like Raynaud’s disease. You can lose a lot of body heat through your extremities, so leaving your hands uncovered can make you feel even colder during runs. Running gloves also
protect your hands from wind, precipitation, and
even
germy surfaces
.
To find the best running gloves, we
reviewed dozens of options
from top brands and
tested 20 of our favorites
by wearing them on short and long runs in cold weather over three weeks. We completed at least three runs in each pair. We then evaluated each pair for
fit, design, comfort, quality, moisture-wicking, durability
, and
value
. We also had a running coach and certified group fitness instructor from our
Review Board
review this article for accuracy surrounding what to look for in running gloves, how they should fit, and why they're important.

View on Trailheads.com
Pros
Convenient storage pouch
Pairing clip
Secure magnets
Cons
Extended cuff may cover wrist wearables
We love everything about Trailheads’ Convertible Mittens: They earned a perfect score of 5 out of 5 for all key categories, making them our best overall pick. “These are hands-down the best winter running mittens I have ever used—and I have tried a LOT,” our tester said. “They’re worth every penny, and maybe more!”
When you wear these as mittens, your fingers will generate and share warmth, making them great for cold weather running. But if you need to cool down or use your phone, the versatile design can be converted into fingerless gloves in seconds. We appreciate the small magnets that secure the thumb flap to the body of the glove, as well as the storage pouch that the mitten flap can fold into.
Other notable features include the anti-slip silicone grip, reflective detailing, and pairing clips to keep left and right together. These high-quality gloves are made with four-way stretch, moisture-wicking materials that will keep your hands comfortable, warm, and dry in all climates. It’s important to note that the extended cuff may cover wrist wearables, like your Fitbit Charge 3, but you can fold the cuff over for easy access.

Best for Cold Weather
Brooks Draft Hybrid Glove

$117 at Amazon
$33 at Brooksrunning.com
Pros
High reflectivity
Great temperature regulation
Touch screen-compatible
Cons
Elastic may shrink after washing
Along with a warm thermal and a cozy hat,
the best cold weather running gear
includes a quality pair of gloves. Made for rain, wind, and cold weather, Brooks’ Hybrid Gloves are perfect for brave runners who venture out when temperatures drop. The internal glove provides comfortable warmth, while the fold-over, windproof, and water-resistant mitt delivers added protection. On a snowy day, they make for an ideal pairing with
shoes for walking on ice
or your
best winter running shoes
.
Not too snug but not too loose, these versatile gloves earned a perfect score of 5 out of 5 for fit. They also scored high in comfort and moisture-wicking because of their great temperature regulation: “These gloves kept me comfortably warm without my hands overheating or getting sweaty,” our tester said.
Early morning or late night runners are covered, as the gloves feature reflective detailing and fluorescent, contrasting colors for optimal visibility. After washing, the gloves stayed mostly intact, thanks to high-quality fabrics. While the mittens’ elastic did shrink a bit, the mittens were still wearable.

The North Face Etip Recycled Gloves
PHOTO: Amazon
$45 at Amazon

$45 at Nordstrom
Pros
Pairing clip
Wide range of colors
Cozy fleece lining
Cons
No reflective detailing
Not as breathable
If you’ve worn touch screen-compatible gloves, you’re probably used to their limited thumb and index finger capabilities. But The North Face’s Etip Recycled Gloves allow you to text, type, and touch with all five fingers.
That’s not the only thing that sets these gloves apart. They also provide a perfect fit and cozy comfort. “I absolutely love the feel of these gloves on my skin,” our tester said. “They really feel like second skin.”
But while the pair earned a perfect score of 5 out of 5 for fit, the warm fleece lining caused our tester's hands to overheat on longer runs, leading to a less than perfect score for comfort. We love the pairing clip that secures left and right together, as well as the anti-slip silicone grip on each palm. These North Face gloves are great for tech lovers, but for early morning or late night runners, we recommend choosing a glove with reflective detailing.

Ozero Winter Thermal Gloves

Pros
Water-resistant
Windproof
Sleek design
Cons
No reflective detailing
After testing Ozero’s Winter Thermal Gloves, we were shocked by their budget-friendly price—earning the pair a perfect score of 5 out of 5 for overall value. The gloves excelled in most key categories, with a perfect score for design, comfort, quality, and durability.
We appreciate that the gloves are easy to get on and off, but are also snug enough to protect against cold air and rain. The fit, plus windproofing, make these gloves suitable for wet and windy climates. But if you run in the early morning or late night, we recommend choosing a pair with reflective detailing for better visibility.
Switching songs or texting mid-run is easy, thanks to the gloves’ touch screen-compatible thumb and index finger, as well as the anti-slip silicone grip on the palm. We also love that for their low price tag, Ozero’s gloves are still a durable, high-quality pick with a sleek, modern design.

Seirus SoundTouch GORE-TEX Infinium All Weather Glove

$19 at REI
View on Seirus.com
Pros
Pairing clip
Cozy fleece lining
Moisture-wicking
Cons
Expensive
May run small
Although blustery conditions are less than ideal, you can make the most of running in the wind with a quality pair of running gloves. Seirus’s SoundTouch Gore-Tex Infinium All-Weather Gloves will keep your hands warm, comfortable, and happy. And when you start to work up a sweat, the moisture-wicking materials get to work: “When I took the gloves off after working up some heat, my hands still felt dry and so did the gloves,” our tester said.
These gloves are 100 percent windproof, keeping your hands insulated while providing much-needed breathability. And we like that they're waterproof, too, for running in rain or snow. We love the pairing clip that keeps left and right together, as well as the touch screen-compatible thumb and index finger and the anti-slip silicone grip on the palm for taking texts and calls while on the go.
We appreciate how durable the gloves are, maintaining their original quality after many washes and wears. But they might run small, so we recommend sizing up. It’s also important to note that they're one of the more expensive pairs on our list.

Pros
Lightweight
Budget-friendly
Pairing magnet
Cons
Not warm enough for cold weather
Designed for mild to moderate weather conditions, Brooks’ Fusion Midweight Gloves provide a comfortable layer of protection. They’re lightweight, with a mesh lining that allows for optimal breathability: “These gloves did a great job of moisture-wicking. My hands never felt sweaty when I was running,” our tester said.
The pair earned a perfect score of 5 out of 5 for moisture-wicking, fit, design, quality, and durability. We love that they fit snug, but not too tight, with an elastic band that prevents cool air from sneaking in. The gloves also boast a magnet to keep the pair together, front reflective detailing for visibility, and a touch screen-compatible thumb and index finger.
At around $30, this pair is budget-friendly, too. We also appreciate that the gloves are comfortable to wear in cool weather, but we wouldn’t recommend them for colder climates. The mesh lining and lightweight design may cut your run short in low temperatures.

Tracksmith Inverno Gloves

Pros
Wide range of colors
Lightweight
Soft
Cons
No reflective details or pairing clip
Made from warm, moisture-wicking performance fabrics, Tracksmith’s Inverno Gloves are ideal for running in mild to moderate temperatures. And when you need to wipe your nose, Tracksmith has you covered, with panels of soft fabric along the thumb and index finger that won’t irritate your skin.
This pair also has a touch screen-compatible thumb and index finger, for checking your phone or fitness tracker. We appreciate the snug fit that blocks air from sneaking in, and the comfortable material with just the right amount of stretch. And although the gloves are thin, they kept our tester’s hands warm and dry on cool, crisp runs.
These durable and cost-effective gloves will last for many wears and washes, earning them a perfect score of 5 out of 5 for overall value. We love that Tracksmith offers unique features and a thoughtful design, but we wish this pair had reflective details or pairing clips.

Pros
Budget-friendly
Lightweight
Wide range of colors
Cons
No reflective detailing or silicone grip
Whether you’re training in the fall or skiing in the winter, Smartwool’s Unisex Liner Glove is our pick for a glove that can handle it all. These budget-friendly liners can be worn alone or under your favorite pair of heavy, winter mittens or gloves.
Snug but not constricting, the comfortable gloves provided a perfect fit, earning a score of 5 out of 5 for both fit and comfort. We like the lightweight breathability and moisture-wicking performance materials. But because of their thin design, you should only wear these liners alone in mild to moderate conditions.
While we do appreciate the touch screen-compatible thumb and index finger, we were left wanting some additional features. The gloves don't have reflective detailing or anti-slip silicone grips—making them best used under other gloves equipped with those features.

Pros
Wide range of colors
Durable
Waterproof
Cons
Not as moisture-wicking
Convertible gloves are a great choice for runners who hit the road in varying weather conditions, since they offer both glove and mitten options. For cold, blustery days, these water- and windproof mittens work to keep your hands toasty. And in warmer weather, simply fold over the mitt, and the inner glove will do the trick.
Like many others on our list, Craft Sportswear’s Hybrid Weather Glove features reflective detailing, touch screen compatibility, and anti-slip silicone grips. We like that the gloves fit true to size and provide comfortable warmth. They’re also durable, lasting through many wears and washes during testing.
For their versatile use, this pair is reasonably priced. And if you opt for the Flumino/Silver color, you’ll get some reflectivity, too. But the gloves only earned a 3.8 out of 5 for moisture-wicking because when our tester's hands got warm and sweaty, they held onto moisture instead of drying quickly.

We Also Tested
In total, we tested 20 pairs of running gloves, but only included nine in our final list of recommendations. While these three didn’t make our top picks, they did have some notable features:
lululemon’s Women’s Run for it All Gloves
provide a perfect fit, with enough room for each finger to breathe, but without any gaps between fingertips and end of the glove. We also love the sleek, sporty design and touch screen capabilities. But the gloves are too thin to protect against cold weather and left our tester's hands wet and sweaty.
Comfortable, sleek, and soft, we liked
Outdoor Research’s Vigor Heavyweight Sensor Gloves
. They’re also durable, with a convenient grip placement and touch screen compatibility. At first, the gloves kept our tester's hands warm, but after 20 minutes of running, they caused overheating and excess sweat.
Craft Sportswear’s Lumen Gloves
are soft and comfortable, with reflective details and storage for your keys. But while they fit well throughout the fingers, our tester found the wristband to be too loose, letting cool air into the glove and making her hands cold.
Verywell Fit / Holly Klamer
How We Tested the Running Gloves
We test many products in
The Verywell Testing Lab
, but some require real-world, consistent use and long-term testing to get the most accurate results. For this story, 20 of our expert testers took home one pair of running gloves each to use in their own running routines.  After unpacking the gloves and examining them for rips, tears, loose threads, or other initial damages, our testers put them on to assess their fit. They noted how tight and restrictive or oversized and baggy they felt or if the gloves fit just right.
During the three-week testing period, testers got outside at least three times for brisk 10 to 15-minute runs, recording the outside temperature each time. As they ran, testers paid special attention to how comfortable the gloves felt and how well they performed: Did the gloves keep their hands warm or let in cold air? Was there any overheating or chafing? Were the gloves too tight, affecting circulation? And how soft, stiff, or itchy did they feel?
Our testers also documented any special features, like reflective details, touchscreen compatibility, anti-slip silicone grips, or convertibility. We also instructed testers to wash the gloves based on the manufacturer’s instructions at least one time during the testing period and note how well they held up. Finally, testers rated each pair of running gloves on a scale of 1 (would not recommend) to 5 (highly recommend) for fit, design, comfort, quality, moisture-wicking, durability, and value. We used these scores and insights to create a list of the best running gloves available on the market today.

Our Experts
In addition to testing dozens of running gloves, we also spoke to running coaches and personal trainers to better understand what to look for in a quality pair. These experts also told us who would most benefit from wearing running gloves and why they're important for running safely in cold weather.
Michele Canon, CPT, coach for STRIDE GO, an online training platform for runners
Steve Stonehouse, NASM CPT,
USATF-certified run coach and director of education for STRIDE
Matt Scarfo
, NASM-certified personal trainer and running coach
John Honerkamp
, RRCA and USATF-certified running coach
What to Look for in Running Gloves
Materials
“When selecting running gloves, you want to choose a pair that’s made with materials that will keep you warm and dry,” Canon says. Look for gloves made with fabrics that wick away moisture, like Merino wool or synthetic blends (made from polyester, spandex, or nylon). Stay away from gloves made from materials that hold water, like cotton, since wet hands will be more prone to irritation and dangerous effects of the cold, such as frostnip or frostbite.
The right moisture management technology will provide extra warmth, comfort, and protection, says Steve Stonehouse, NASM CPT, USATF certified run coach and director of education for STRIDE, an indoor running franchise. “Wicking moisture away means dry, and dry means warm,” he says.
Touchscreen Compatibility
Any runner who has fumbled to use their GPS watch with gloves on or froze their fingers when trying to snap a selfie knows the benefit of having touch screen capability in a pair of gloves. Many running gloves offer some level of compatibility with touch screens, but some are better than others—like our top pick,
The North Face’s Etip Recycled Gloves
. If touch screen sensitivity is one of your must-have features, you should expect to pay a few dollars more.
Reflectivity
Some gloves feature reflective elements, such as stripes, patterns, or logos, to help runners increase their visibility in low-light conditions. Wearing reflective gloves may seem unnecessary, but it’s always best to be as visible as possible, Matt Scarfo, an NASM-certified personal trainer and running coach, says. Since your hands move as you’re running, adding some reflectivity to them may actually help catch the attention of drivers.
Some gloves (like
Nathan’s Hypernight Reflective Gloves
) are also available in bright, high-visibility colors, so you may want to consider that option as another way to catch drivers’ attention.
Verywell Fit / Amina Abdelrahman
Comfort and Fit
“It’s really a happy medium of finding a glove that’s not too tight but not too loose,” John Honerkamp, RRCA and USATF-certified running coach, says. If your gloves are too tight, you risk losing circulation in your hands. But if they’re too loose, cold air might get in, defeating the gloves' purpose.
Running gloves should also feel comfortable enough that you forget they're even on—there’s nothing worse than having to fiddle with clothing or accessories during long runs, Honerkamp adds.
Moisture-Wicking
Choosing a running glove with moisture-wicking capabilities will ensure that your hands stay dry, warm, and comfortable on outdoor runs in any weather condition. Look for fabrics that wick away moisture, like Merino wool, or synthetic blends with polyester, spandex, and nylon. The best moisture-wicking glove that we tested is
Brooks’ Fusion Midweight Glove
. Our tester appreciated the mesh insert located at the palm that allowed for optimal breathability.
Warmth
Depending on the weather outside, you’ll need to choose a glove with appropriate warmth, insulation, and protection. Typically, running gloves come in three levels of warmth: low, medium, and high.
If you plan to run in cold weather, opt for a running glove such as
Brooks’ Hybrid Glove
that will provide optimal warmth. For cool conditions, a midweight glove like
Tracksmith’s Inverno Gloves
is a good choice. And for warmer days, we recommend a lightweight glove, like
Nike’s Sphere 360 Running Glove
.
Weatherproof
Waterproof and windproof running gloves are important for those who run in wet and windy climates. You don’t want to start your run dry and warm, and finish with damp, numb, and cold extremities. Luckily, it’s easy to find waterproof and windproof gloves. Just check the manufacturer website—usually, any weatherproofing will be listed in the product description. We recommend
SoundTouch’s Gore-Tex Infinium All-Weather Gloves
for running in wet, windy weather.

Frequently Asked Questions
Is it good to wear gloves while running?
“Running gloves are a good idea when temps drop below 50 degrees,” Canon says. “In extremely cold temperatures 20 degrees or below, gloves are necessary to prevent the risk of frostbite. Mittens and hand warmers are other good options to keep your hands even warmer in much chillier temps.”
How tight should running gloves be?
Gloves that are too tight can be harmful because they can affect circulation to your hands, which is especially important when running in cold weather. Choose running gloves that fit snugly, but still allow for a good range of motion. Avoid a loose fit around the wrist, since that may allow cold air to sneak in.
What are the warmest gloves for running?
When running in cold temperatures, you’ll want a glove that will keep your hands warm yet feel lightweight and breathable. It’s also a good idea to look for wind- and waterproof gloves if you plan to run in brisk and wet weather. We recommend
Tracksmith’s Inverno Gloves
to keep your hands warm on cold, windy, and rainy runs.
Is it better to train with heavy or light gloves?
“
If your gloves are too heavy, even an extra two ounces, it really adds up,” Honerkamp says. “You don’t wait to be distracted while you're running—it's all about being comfortable and focused.” You want to find a good balance between a running glove that’s thick and heavy enough to keep your hands protected and warm, but not too light that wind, rain, or cold air can get in.
Can you wear compression gloves while running?
Compression gloves are used to address symptoms of certain conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis and hand osteoarthritis, and may not be recommended for use during exercise. Ask your doctor or physical therapist for specific instructions on how and when you should be using compression gloves.

Why Trust Verywell Fit
Verywell Fit / Alexander Huang
When it comes to running, the right leggings can help you go the distance. Since runners inevitably work up a sweat in any season, it’s essential to opt for leggings crafted from
moisture-wicking materials
to keep you dry and
prevent chafing
. The best running leggings should also have the right
balance of compression,
ensuring they stay in place without feeling too tight. Beyond fit and fabric, having convenient pockets is a plus for stashing essentials like your phone securely.
To choose the best running leggings, we first consulted running experts to learn more about which materials, styles, and
features to prioritize
. With their expert input, we then researched over 100 pairs from popular activewear brands. We also
tested 77 pairs of leggings
, running in each one multiple times a week over four weeks. During our wear-tests on roads and trails, we evaluated each pair based on its
materials, fit, support, opacity, durability, and value.
We also had a certified personal trainer from our
Review Board
review this story for accuracy, including how to shop for running leggings and which key features to look for when purchasing a new pair.

Best Women's Overall
lululemon Original Fast and Free High-Rise Crop
PHOTO: Lululemon
$128 at Lululemon
Pros
Lightweight
Drawcord waistband
7 pockets
Cons
Side pockets may be too deep for comfort
Waistband may be too tight for some
These lululemon leggings are our top overall pick for running, thanks to their lightweight feel, sweat-wicking capabilities, and durable fabric. These leggings can be worn in all seasons and will even keep you cool in warmer summer months. We found them very opaque when testing, and they passed the squat test with flying colors, despite their lightweight feel. They are slightly longer than typical crop leggings, providing more coverage, especially in cooler weather.
They have a snug, compressive fit and run true to size. These leggings fit a little tighter around the waist due to their high-rise waistband and built-in drawcord, but this also means they offer superior hold. They stay put and never slide down, no matter how many miles we run in them. And the waistband never stretched out, even after multiple washes.
We love that this pick features seven pockets—two side drop-in pockets and five drop-in waistband pockets that hold small essentials. Our only complaint is that the side drop-in pockets are very deep, making storing a phone or heavier object during runs a bit uncomfortable. When stashing our phone in one of the side drop-in pockets during a run, it slid almost to our knees. The five small waistband pockets are perfect for storing keys, cards, or
energy chews and gels
.
The leggings are very durable and showed no signs of wear and tear after we washed them multiple times a week over our four-week testing period. They come in six colors and three lengths. While they're pricier than other options, we feel they are worth the investment.

$79 at Amazon
View on Girlfriend.com
Pros
Four-way stretch
Sheer-proof
Made with recycled materials
Cons
May run large
Girlfriend Collective’s Compressive Pocket Leggings are designed for high-impact workouts and feature a soft four-way stretch material that swiftly wicks away sweat. We like that the fabric is supportive and sheer-proof, providing good coverage without feeling tight. The leggings also have a wide, elastic waistband and a high-rise fit, so they stay put
from warm-ups to cool-downs.
With two deep side pockets and a back pocket, there’s plenty of room to store your phone, keys, cards, and more.
This pair comes in a wide range of sizes, from XXS to 6XL, and in two inseam options—23.75 and 28.5 inches. These leggings run large, especially in the waistband, so you may want to size up.
We love that this pair is made with recycled materials, so you can do your part for the planet by wearing them.

The 15 Best Legging Brands, Whether You’re Working Out or Lounging Around
Best with Pockets
lululemon Swift Speed High-Rise Tight
PHOTO: lululemon
$128 at Lululemon
Pros
Zippered waistband pocket for security
Reflective detailing for visibility
Drawcord waistband
Cons
Drawcord may need to be re-tightened occasionally
If you need to carry your phone, keys, card, or nutrition during your workout, you'll need a good pair of leggings with pockets. We recommend these Swift Speed leggings from lululemon. They feel smooth and tight without being restrictive and are completely opaque, passing our squat test with ease.
These leggings have deep, drop-in pockets on the thighs to hold your phone and other essentials and a zippered pocket on the back of the waistband to secure valuables like keys or a card. They feature reflective detailing for visibility for
runs in low-light conditions
, and they only have seams on the outside to reduce irritation. We love the drawcord waistband that keeps these leggings from sagging, but we need to tighten it occasionally before runs to ensure optimal hold.
The leggings wash well and are durable. They offer the right amount of compression but still allow for easy movement. Like other lululemon leggings on our list, they're pricier, but we think they're worth the investment for runners with many essentials to carry during runs.

Pros
Moisture-wicking
Wide range of sizes
Mesh panels for ventilation
Cons
Only one pocket
Under Armour’s HeatGear Leggings are our top men’s overall pick for running because they feature the ideal blend of comfort and performance. We recommend them for runners who want lightweight leggings or an extra layer under shorts or pants when temperatures dip.
The thin fabric, a blend of polyester and elastane, wicks sweat away and dries quickly. With a snug, compressive fit, these leggings offer plenty of support without feeling too bulky or constricting. They also feature strategically placed mesh panels for extra ventilation right where it’s needed.
We like that this pair’s seams are designed to help prevent irritation and that the wide elastic waistband helps them stay in place. Plus, the leggings come with a side drop-in pocket that’s perfect for holding your phone.

Pros
Deep side pockets
Wide range of sizes and colors
Lightweight
Cons
Compression may be too light for some
If you're looking for high-waisted leggings that are budget-friendly and comfortable for running, we recommend this pair from Old Navy. They’re made from a breathable, lightweight fabric that feels soft against the skin and offers support—although some runners may prefer more compression. We like that this pair is moisture-wicking and has flat-lock seams to keep you dry, comfortable, and chafe-free.
The PowerSoft leggings feature two deep side pockets to hold all your necessities. They’re also available in a wide range of inseam lengths and sizes, from 00-30, so it’s easy to get a custom-like fit. And with more than a dozen of colors to choose from, you may want to grab more than one pair.

Pros
Moisture-wicking
Four-way stretch
Deep side pockets
Cons
Inseam may not be long enough for some
We recommend these budget-friendly BALEAF leggings for runners who want to build up their
cold-weather running wardrobe
without spending a fortune.
They’re durable and come with a range of features you’d expect to find in more expensive pairs.
The leggings are designed with quick-drying, breathable material that stretches with you while you’re running. The smooth fabric and flatlock seams help prevent chafing. Whether you want to wear this pair alone or as a base layer, the elastic waistband holds them securely in place.
We like that they have two side pockets that are big enough to hold your phone and other items without weighing you down. But there’s only one inseam option, which may not be long enough for some wearers.

lululemon Base Pace High-Rise Tight
PHOTO: lululemon
$98 at Lululemon
$98 at Net-a-Porter
Pros
Seamless ankle design
Light compression
Very breathable
Cons
Not as opaque as others on our list
Lighter colors will show sweat marks
If you're looking for lightweight leggings with light compression, we recommend these Base Pace leggings. The compression feels light and comfortable, but the leggings still stay put during runs. And the material is thinner compared to other options on our list, which makes it breathable and will keep you cool during outdoor runs in hot weather. We also appreciate the seamless ankle design that prevents chafing.
Since these leggings are thinner than other options, they're also not as opaque. The lighter-colored leggings we tested showed tags and outlines of undergarments in bright light. But if you plan on wearing these leggings on runs instead of squatting at the gym, their opacity won't matter as much. The lighter colors may also show sweat marks.
We found the fit and length perfect, and they stayed put with no sagging or waistband rolling during runs. The leggings have a drawstring in the waistband that helps keep them in place and a hidden back pocket for valuables. They held up in the wash and didn't show signs of wear and tear after our four-week testing period, but their thin material makes us question their long-term durability.

Best for Hot Weather
lululemon High-Rise Drawcord Waist Crop

$59 at Lululemon
Pros
Cool to the touch
Lightweight
Seam-free front
Cons
Thinner than other options
We recommend these leggings from lululemon to keep you cool when you
exercise in warm weather
or a hot gym. Their four-way stretch fabric provides enough supportive compression without restricting movement during runs, yoga, or Spin class. We found them to be very lightweight and breathable. And thanks to their sweat-wicking properties, they feel cool to the touch even after hot workouts.
These leggings are comfortable and don't restrict our movement at all. They feel thinner than other lululemon leggings on our list, which is good for hot exercise but makes them less opaque compared to other options. They fit true to size and don't bunch, sag, or roll down at the waist.
We like the seam-free front that helps prevent chafing, and we like that the pair features three drop-in pockets that make it easy to carry everything you need. The drawcord waist helps keep the pants secure. We like that this pair dries quickly and showed no signs of wear and tear after our initial testing period.

Pros

Cons

We recommend
Under Armour’s ColdGear Authentics Leggings for people who enjoy exercising outdoors or
walking in cold weather
. The polyester and elastane fabric has two layers to help wick away sweat, so you'll stay dry and chafe-free. And a soft, brushed interior will keep you warm and comfortable in chilly conditions.
Unlike some winter running pants and leggings, this pair isn’t bulky and feels like a second skin. With a wide elastic waistband, they don’t sag or ride up, so you can stay focused on your run. These versatile leggings are a great option to wear alone in cold conditions or under another layer in more frigid temperatures.
They're even great to wear under pants when walking the dog in cold weather (if it's icy out, make sure you're also wearing
shoes for walking on ice
). While they don’t have any pockets, you can always pair them with a
running jacket
, vest, or pants that does.

Pros
Perforation adds ventilation
3 deep pockets
Drawcord waistband
Cons
Only one inseam length
Distance runners
need leggings that are supportive but won’t restrict movement. Designed with motion in mind, the Brooks Method 7/8 Tights offer a comfortable fit with the right amount of stretch and compression for distraction-free miles. An adjustable infinity drawstring gives you even more assurance that the leggings will stay put.
We like that the fabric is breathable, quick-drying, and moisture-wicking and that strategic perforations help with airflow. Distance runners will also appreciate the deep back pocket and two side pockets large enough to hold a phone. Although they come in sizes XS-XXL, they’re only available in one inseam length, so they may not work for very petite or tall runners.

Pros
Reflective elements
Odor-resistant
Drawcord waistband
Cons
Limited size range
We recommend these Janji 7/8 Groundwork Tights for trail running because they’ll keep you dry and comfortable. This pair provides light, supportive compression that won’t interfere with your stride. And the waistband prevents slippage, so you don’t have to worry about pulling them up in the middle of a run. Wear them with a pair of
great trail running shoes
for optimal support on the trail.
The nylon and spandex blend is moisture-wicking, odor-resistant, and will retain its shape over time. And we like that reflective elements on the front and back help you stay visible to cars and other runners if you’re exercising outdoors in low light.
These leggings have two deep side pockets, two slits in the waistband, and an external back pocket to carry all your essentials. The dual-entry back pocket can be used to store items or as a pass-through pocket to hold a shirt or lightweight jacket in case conditions change.

May run small
We recommend these leggings from Under Armour for runners looking to prevent muscle fatigue or to get some post-workout relief for tired legs. This pair offers good compression, and they’re moisture-wicking, so they’ll be reliable from mile 1 to 100.
With a wide, high-rise waistband, these
compression leggings
stay comfortably in place without digging in. The four-way stretch material moves with you and is odor-resistant to keep you feeling and smelling fresh. We like that these leggings come in a range of sizes and three inseams—short, regular, and tall—so you can find the perfect fit. Note that they may run small.

Pros
Opaque in the butt and crotch
Tight waistband stays put
Cons
Waistband may be too tight for some
Limited size range
These leggings from Outdoor Voices are breathable, with the right amount of compression to support hard workouts. The fabric is designed to be cool to the touch and felt like a second skin from the first time we put them on during testing. The fit is perfect, and there is no need to yank or tug them to get the waistband in the right place. They are opaque where it matters most—in the butt and crotch area—but more sheer in the front and back of the legs for style and superior breathability.
We found the waistband to be very tight but not uncomfortable. It provides support and hold without pinching or being too restrictive, although runners who prefer less compression around the waist may find these too tight. They never sag during runs or need to be readjusted.
The leggings come in four colors and have two side pockets for a phone or other valuables.

Pros
No inseam
Durable
Waistband and drawstring keep them in place
Cons
Fold-over pockets may not be as secure as zippered
Pricier than other options
These SenseKnit leggings are perfect for running because they provide targeted support and medium compression. We also like that they offer enough hold and support for running but are also comfortable enough to lounge in. The fabric feels very soft, and the inseam-free design further reduces the chance of irritation during exercise.
We like that the high-rise waistband and drawcord keep these leggings in place. The fold-over pockets on the back of the waistband are large enough for a small phone, but we wish the pockets were zippered for more security. The leggings are completely opaque and passed our squat test, even in bright light. We feel secure, no matter what pace we're running, and they never shift or sag.
This pair is on the pricier side compared to others on our list and only come in one color, but if you're looking for durable leggings that will maintain compression after many uses, the investment is worth it.

Pros
Quick-drying
Cool-to-the-touch fabric
No inseam
Cons
Only come in one color
No side pockets
If you sweat a lot during your workouts, you'll want leggings that help wick moisture away, and these Base Pace Cropped leggings from lululemon do the trick. They provide lightweight, breathable coverage with fabric that feels cool to the touch. They're soft, sleek, and very compressive without being restrictive. They have great sweat-wicking abilities and don't pinch or bunch anywhere. They make us feel "held in" and secure throughout our workouts.
We found them durable and resistant to pilling even after many wears and washes. The compression and sweat-wicking ability never changed throughout our testing period. This pair fits true to size and is a little tighter around the waist and looser in the legs.
We like that these have no inseam, preventing irritation, and that they passed our squat test. They only come in one color, but their reasonable price makes them a great value.

Gymshark Seamless Leggings

$42 at Gymshark.com
Pros
Tag-free
Ribbed waistband and ankle cuffs
Fit true to size
Cons
Some gapping around the waist when squatting
No pockets
If irritation and scratchiness from seams are one of your biggest pet peeves in leggings, you'll love Gymshark's seamless Adapt Camo leggings. They're seamless, tagless, and feature a ribbed waistband and ankle cuffs for soft support. They do a great job at wicking sweat and never trap odor. We also like that the thicker fabric and design pattern help mask sweat marks. Although we like the thicker material for colder weather, it's not ideal for hot-weather runs.
These leggings are completely opaque and passed our squat test. However, we sometimes notice some gapping around the waist when squatting. The overall fit is perfect and true to size, and we feel secure and comfortable when wearing these for higher-intensity activities. The leggings occasionally bunch around the knees, but we don't find this very distracting or bothersome.
Although we love the affordability of this pick, they may not be as durable as other options on our list. They generally held up to washes and wear after our four-week testing period, but we did notice some minor thinning of the fabric in the crotch area. We also wish these had pockets to store valuables on the go, but you can easily pair these with a
fanny pack
for more storage space.

Gymshark GS Power Original Leggings

$45 at Gymshark.com
Pros
Buttery soft texture
Flat front design
Quick-drying
Cons
Too long for shorter users
Lighter colors are not opaque
These GS Power Original Leggings are a good choice for taller exercisers or anyone who likes their leggings to come down to their ankles. One of our editors, who is 5 foot-1, noted that even the extra-small size bunched around her ankles, so these leggings are best for taller wearers. They are supportive enough for workouts but are also comfortable enough for lounging. They have a buttery soft, smooth texture that feels like a second skin.
They offer good compression without being restrictive. While the dark-colored versions of these leggings are completely opaque, the lighter colors may show lines and undergarments, so you may want to pair these with seamless underwear.
We like the flat front design of these leggings that prevents irritation. We also appreciate the quick-drying fabric and that they come in six different colors. The waistband feels comfortable but rolls down on occasion. And, although these come at a budget-friendlier price than many on our list, they're not as durable and may show some fraying in the crotch area over time.

Cons
May be too restrictive for some activities
If you're looking for leggings that will pass the squat test, these Flex leggings from Gymshark are a good choice. They're thick and sturdy, and completely opaque. No underwear colors or lines show through, even in bright light.
Durable and supportive, these leggings are great for activities like running, but they may be too restrictive for everyday wear or yoga. They're some of the most compressive leggings on our list and are best for activities like running and HIIT, as the fabric doesn't offer enough give for stretching or yoga.
We liked the high, seamless waistband that never rolls down and provides a flattering fit. These leggings held up in the wash and showed no wear and tear after our four-week testing period. Even though we wash them regularly, these pants never lose compression or opacity.

How We Tested the Running Leggings
To find the best running leggings, we first spoke to two experts,
Lauren Sheu
, an RRCA-certified running coach, and
Ashtain Rothchild
, a NASM-certified personal trainer, to get their expert input on key features to look for. Keeping their input in mind, we researched and reviewed over 100 leggings from top, trusted retailers, paying special attention to each pair's fit, comfort, materials, and size options. We also looked at price, color options, and the number of pockets in each pair.
We then put 77 of the best options to the test in the real world, following
Verywell's at-home testing guidelines
. We wore each pair of leggings at least seven times over a four-week testing period. We ran in each pair on short and long runs on varied terrain. We also wore the leggings for other high-impact workouts, like HIIT and strength training, and even wore them for lounging and light stretching.
We did two squat tests in each pair of leggings, one at the beginning of our testing period and one at the end, and noted the opacity (or lack thereof) of each pair wearing different color underwear. We also noted whether the sheerness of the pants changed throughout the testing period. We washed each pair of leggings one to two times a week throughout the testing period to see how easy they were to care for and if they held up in the wash.
We paid particular attention to each pair's hold, fit, opacity, durability, material, and performance during test runs. We also completed a stretch test to see if the waistband of each pair bounced back to its original shape and size after being stretched.
Finally, we rated each pair of leggings on a scale of 1 (would not recommend) to 5 (highly recommend) for six key categories, giving each pair a value rating that compared its price to its quality. Only the highest-rated pairs of leggings made it on our list of final recommendations.
What to Look for When Shopping for Running Leggings
Five key features to look for in leggings.
Verywell Fit / Michelle Parente
Material
Synthetic performance fabrics, such as polyester, nylon, or elastane, are ideal for running leggings because they are stretchy, soft, and durable. Mesh panels in targeted areas can add even more ventilation. Cotton is not breathable or moisture-wicking, so it’s best for everyday leggings.
A blend of these fabrics is ideal, so you can combine the benefits of each material. “I want to feel in sync with the fabric to ensure it's running with me, not against me,” Rothchild says. “If the fabric feels good, I feel good, and my run, without a doubt, is great.”
Rise
The rise of the waist can affect the leggings’ overall fit and comfort. High-rise leggings fall above your waistline, offering the most coverage and support. Mid-rise leggings usually fall just below the belly button, while low-rise will sit just below your waist. Choose the rise that makes you feel the most comfortable and confident while you run.
Pockets
Most runners prefer leggings with pockets to store essentials. Whether it's a drop-in side pocket that’s big enough for your phone, a zipped back pocket to hold your keys, or a waistband pocket to stash a credit card or snacks, extra storage is always a plus.
Fit
To get a comfortable, secure fit, look for features like an elastic waistband and a drawstring. Also, choose an inseam that reflects how long you’d like your leggings to be. Some leggings are full-length, while others are meant to hit just above your ankle. Taller runners should look for long inseams and full-length styles. Shorter runners who want to avoid folding over the bottom of their leggings may want to opt for capris, petite pairs, or 3/4 and 7/8 lengths.
Care and Maintenance
Some running leggings can be machine-washed and dried, but others require hand-washing and air drying. If you prefer low-maintenance leggings, be sure to check the manufacturer’s care instructions. For instance, you can machine or hand wash most
lululemon leggings
, though it is best to use the least amount of detergent as possible.
Frequently Asked Questions
What kind of leggings are good for running?
Leggings for running should have a snug, supportive fit, so they don’t fall down or ride up when running. “The material should be lightweight and moisture-wicking,” Sheu says. “Another plus is if the leggings contain pockets.” Running leggings can come in various lengths, including capri, 7/8, and full-length.
How should running leggings fit?
Running leggings should feel snug around your butt, calves, and thighs but not so tight that they affect your range of motion. The best running leggings will move with you and stay close to your skin to help prevent chafing. Make sure that the leggings don’t slip down or feel loose at your knees or waist.
Do running leggings keep you warm?
Some running leggings can keep you warm, but certain pairs are better for running in cold weather than others. Look for leggings that are thermal or fleece-lined for added warmth in the winter months.
What is the difference between leggings and running tights?
Running leggings and tights are sometimes used interchangeably. But
running tights
are generally more compressive than leggings since they’re designed to increase circulation and keep your muscles warm. And tights are usually made from a thinner, more sheer material, while leggings are constructed with thicker, opaque fabric.
Leggings can be worn as stand-alone garments, while tights are typically worn under another layer. Tights may cover the whole feet or have a loop ring at the bottom, while leggings usually stop at the ankle.
Do running leggings contain BPA?
Bisphenol A (BPA)
is a chemical found in some types of plastic.
Research has shown that exposure to high levels of BPA can lead to obesity, hormonal imbalances, and uterine cancer, among other health complications.
In May 2023, the Center for Environmental Health (CEH) announced that, after testing, it found high levels of BPA in certain activewear pieces containing blends of polyester and spandex, including sports bras from Sweaty Betty, leggings from Nike, Athleta, Champion, Patagonia, and Kohl’s, shorts from Champion, Nike, and Adidas, and athletic shirts from Fabletics.
We may recommend some of these products or similar items from these brands in this list, as
these products have not been recalled and the science on transdermal absorption of BPA is still not settled.
“The best way to prevent BPA exposure is to make educated decisions in choosing your personal care products,” says
Joshua Zeichner
, MD, associate professor of dermatology and director of cosmetic and clinical research in dermatology at Mount Sinai Hospital. As a precaution, it is best to limit the amount of time you spend in activewear by changing out of it when you are finished working out.

Frequently Asked Questions
Why Trust Verywell Fit
Verywell Fit
If you’ve got breasts, donning a sports bra is likely an essential step in getting ready to exercise—but the task of stretching one over your head to get it on (and back off) doesn’t have to be part of the actual workout. The
best zip-front sports bras
eliminate this hassle while offering a
comfy and convenient
way to get the
most support in style
during even your sweatiest workouts.
To find the best zip-front sports bras, we spoke with experts to get their advice on what
key features to look for
. We prioritized bras that are
adjustable,
wick away sweat,
and offer the right amount of support for a wide range of cup sizes and specific activity levels. We also
tested six of the sports bras
at home ourselves, in our workouts and daily routines—by walking, jogging, jumping, and more. Our favorite options earned high scores for
fit, support, comfort, adjustability, durability, and value.
Another reason to trust our picks? We had a certified personal trainer, yoga instructor, and Pilates teacher from our
Review Board
review this article for accuracy and how to find a comfortable, supportive zip-front sports bra.

Why We Love It
Champion’s Motion Control Zip Front Sports Bra
provides
exceptional support
and compression with no spillage (even while jumping!) thanks to its racerback design, molded cups, and adjustable straps. Plus, the performance fabric is
breathable and moisture-wicking,
making it even more comfortable for
high-impact exercise
.
While a common issue with zip-front bras is that the zipper can slide down when you don't want it to, we found that this
zipper stays in place
because of the clever addition of a hook-and-clasp closure. Despite all that support and extra security, we love how comfortable the bra is—we even feel like the straps help to
evenly distribute weight
across our shoulders, helping to
improve posture
.
Potential Flaws
Those with smaller or larger breasts may prefer a different option, since sizing starts at 34B and caps at 42DD for this bra.
After a few wears and washes, we found that the inner tag started to feel scratchy. Just be sure to follow care instructions, and cut the tag off if it starts to happen to your bra.
Who It's For
Best for those with medium to large breasts who need a lot of support during high-impact workouts—especially if jumping is involved.

Care:

Our Overall Rating:
4.8/5
Why We Love It
SHEFIT designs its offerings with inclusivity in mind—all its sports bras are available from XS up to 6Luxe (what it calls 6XL). We love
SHEFIT’s Low Impact Sports Bra
because it provides security and avoids spillage for all sizes from 28A to 50I. Thanks to its double racerback and
thick shoulder straps,
we felt equally supported while doing yoga, lifting weights, walking outdoors, and more.
In addition, the straps are
adjustable via Velcro,
so we were able to easily customize our fit without having to take the entire bra off. We also found that the clasps at the top of the bra work really well to ensure that the
zipper doesn’t slip down
.
Potential Flaws
We found that the ribcage band may run large for some, causing the fabric to ride up during intense workouts.
We recommend washing this one by hand, because we found that the pads came out in the laundry and were hard to put back in afterwards, as they're rather large.
Who It's For
Best for support and comfort during low- to medium-impact workouts.

Our Overall Rating:

Why We Love It
SHEFIT’s Ultimate Sports Bra
features adjustable shoulder straps and an adjustable ribcage band that secures in place via strong Velcro closures. We tested this bra while running, lifting weights, doing agility drills, and more without having to make any adjustments mid-workout. Plus, we found that there is
no bounce or slippage
, thanks to the
high-tech, two-way stretch fabric.
With the Ultimate, wearers of 28A through 50I who need more customization than the brand's
Low Impact
model can provide can find the right fit and level of adjustable support for their needs. And we noticed that the
fabric and structure is super durable,
showing no signs of wear and tear after many sweaty workouts and cleaning cycles.
Potential Flaws
We love this pick for workouts, but the high compression may be too intense for casual, all-day wear.
This bra is not machine washable, so post-wear washing will require more time and effort than other options.
Who It's For
Best for medium- to high-impact workouts and a wide range of chest sizes.

Our Overall Rating:

Why We Love It
A leader in the activewear space, lululemon is well-loved for its durable, high-performing, and fashion-forward pieces. Though more expensive than other winners on this list, testing proved to us that
lululemon’s Enlite Front-Zip Bra
is well worth the investment. Its
secure and comfortable fit
, high-level support,
long-lasting construction
, and stylish design do not disappoint. It's also available in A through DDD (sometimes referred to as E) cups, making it a great option for a range of sizes.
Made with the company's signature
silky-soft, sweat-wicking fabric
(a blend of nylon and Lycra), the double straps offered us two layers of security without digging into our skin. We wore it while jogging, hiking, lifting weights, and using cardio machines without experiencing any bounce or spillage. Plus, we love that the
zipper locks into place
for added security.
Potential Flaws
The straps aren’t adjustable, so we recommend trying this bra on before you buy.
We wish that the bra came in more than two colors, but we still found the available options—Black and Dark Olive—to be super sleek and stylish.
Who It's For
Best for wearers who want a comfortable, long-lasting, and stylish sports bra for medium- to high-impact workouts.

Why We Love It
Available in sizes XS through Luxe (or Large), the plunging neckline on
SHEFIT’s Exhilarate Sports Bra
delivers a flattering look for sizes up to 36DD(E) without sacrificing
compressive support
or security. Unlike many push-up bras, we found that this one gave us a lift and
prevented excess bouncing and spillage
. Plus, we loved the
adjustable shoulder straps
and ribcage band that helped us find the perfect fit.
During testing, we wore this bra during low-, medium-, and high-impact workouts, all the while feeling equally comfortable and secure. And we appreciate the
breathable fabric
blend, of nylon and spandex, that moves with us during all activities. We think this stylish and supportive bra is worth the purchase because it’s
durable and long-lasting
.
Potential Flaws
Compared to other options on our list, the shoulder straps are quite thin and dug into our skin during some activities.
The fabric is breathable, but not super sweat-wicking. We would not recommend this bra for
heated classes
or
hot-weather workouts
.
Who It's For
Best for low- to medium-impact workouts—especially if you want a flattering push-up style.

, and
non-removable foam pads
deliver extra support and coverage, without causing you to overheat.
Plus, we love that the four-way stretch material
wicks away moisture and dries quickly
—making it a great choice for sweaty, high-impact workouts—and that there's a zipper lock to prevent the zipper from sliding down during intense movement. We also appreciate that the
thick, supportive ribcage band
appears well-equipped to limit bounce and spillage.
Potential Flaws
If you have smaller breasts or don’t want a lot of support, you may not like the non-removable pads.
The back straps may dig into your skin during mat-based workouts.
Who It's For
Best for high-impact, high-sweat workouts, and those who need a lot of support.

Why We Love Them
Whether you're twisting into
crow pose
or
finishing in savasana
, you’ll want a
sports bra for yoga
that moves with you and
feels like second skin
.
ohlya’s Women's Zipper Front Closure Sports Bra
is our top pick for yoga because it's
lightly padded
but has supportive cups for those fast-paced sequences.
We love that the bra comes with hidden safety hooks,
removable pads
, and a
breathable racerback design
. Its soft, wide lower band will prevent chafing and feels lightweight. Made of
moisture-wicking materials
, this sports bra can survive even the most intense hot yoga sessions.
Potential Flaws
The straps are not adjustable, so it may be difficult to achieve a 100% perfect fit.
This bra is not supportive enough for high-impact workouts.

Victoria's Secret's Knockout Front-Close Sports Bra
. Its combination of compression and encapsulation support allows
maximum support
with lightly padded,
hidden underwire cups
. The cups are secured with a front closure, and the zipper holds it all together.
We like the

quick-drying material
that make this an extremely wearable underwire option. It's perfect for high-impact activities like running, HIIT, or
boxing
.

Only available in packs

Support Level:

Strap Style:

Why We Love It
AKAMC’s Zip Front Sports Bra
is one of the best-designed out there, and it’s sold in
budget-friendly
three- and five-packs to boot. It features a flexible padding, and double zipper clasps—as well as
soft, four-way stretch fabric
that
absorbs sweat
and maximizes comfort while lounging, walking, or participating in other low-impact activities.
We love that the
padding is removable
for customizable coverage. And because the bra doesn’t have any clasps or closures on the back, it’s a
great option for mat-based workouts
. Plus, it comes in a
variety of colors
—some without zip-front closures, though—and in sizes S through 3XL (which can fit bra sizes from 32A to 42F, with some band sizes as small as 28 inches). This makes it easy to find the right fit for your size and style.
Potential Flaws
Since the straps aren’t adjustable, this isn’t ideal for high-impact workouts.
This style is only available in three packs which is great for your budget, but not if you only want one bra.
Who It's For
Best for mat-based or low- to medium-impact workouts—especially if you want several bras at a budget-friendly price.
Three types of sports bras.

What We Look for When We Test Zip-Front Sports Bras
To find the best zip-front sports bras, we’ve wear-tested six options from trusted activewear brands at home during our workouts and in our regular daily routines. In order to test sports bras, we evaluate each one based on the following key attributes:
Fit:
A
sports bra
should be snug but not constrictive—you should be able to fully breathe (after all, you’re going to be exerting yourself). A good test is to slide two fingers under the sports bra to see if it cuts off your circulation. When wear-testing, we pay attention to how well each sports bra fits the unique contours of each of our bodies. Are we able to fit two fingers between the straps and our shoulders? Is there any looseness or pinching? Sports bras score high in this category if they fit snugly without being overly constrictive, and if they don’t require a break-in period.
Support:
Choosing a sports bra
with the proper support level is vital for not only comfort and focus but also
to avoid any potential injuries
during your workout.
High-support zip-front sports bras are best for high-impact activities, while medium- or light-support bras work for lounging, all-day wear, and low-impact activities. We test each sports bra by completing a variety of activities at various intensity levels—walking, running, jumping jacks, and more. We prioritize sports bras that hold our breasts in place and don’t result in spillage or discomfort, even when we start to sweat.
Comfort:
Whether it's a low-impact or
high-impact sports bra
or a
plus-size sports bra
, if your bra isn't comfortable, you won't wear it, says Marcellus. During testing, we first pay attention to how the fabric feels against our skin, and then how that initial comfort level evolves after several wears and washes. We also take note of how comfortable the compression and support feel during and after working out: Are we distracted during our workouts? Are there any marks left behind on our skin after?
Adjustability:
To ensure that the sports bras offer enough versatility and customization, we take note of whether or not we can easily adjust each bra’s size, support, and coverage. Some zip-front sports bras are made with adjustable straps and back closures. We prioritize options that are adjustable at the shoulder straps and ribcage band.
Durability:
Choosing a sports bra that's made with durable, sweat-wicking, performance fabrics is essential for long-lasting wear. Throughout testing, we make sure to wear and wash each sports bra several times to see how well the structure, fabric, and quality endure. Sports bras that show little signs of wear and tear after vigorous testing earn high scores for durability.
Value:
After testing each product, we look at its price and compare it to the average cost of other sports bras on the market. We determine whether or not we believe it’s worth the price based on all other key attributes we tested for. We prioritize sports bras that we would consider paying that price, or even more.
Our Experts
Before our research, testing, and reporting, we consulted experts to identify the materials and features that set the best zip-front sports bras apart. Our experts, including fitness gurus and a dermatologist, provided valuable insights into various fabrics and constructions, helping us determine which bras are best suited for different activities. While we always make our product selections independently, the guidance from our experts helps shape our recommendations.

Frequently Asked Questions
When should I wear a sports bra?
Opt for a sports bra during all types of workouts—from low to high impact—to avoid straining, hanging, sagging, and even pain, says Marcellus.
How should a sports bra fit?
A sports bra should fit tighter than a regular bra, with no gaps or extra room, but should not feel constrictive. Most of the support comes from the band, which should be wide enough to avoid uncomfortable compression.
How do I measure myself for a sports bra?
First, measure your band size. Using a measuring tape, measure your rib cage right where the band of a bra would sit.
Then, measure your bust size—around the fullest part of your breasts—with the measuring tape.
Finally, calculate your bra size. Subtract your band size from your bust size.
The difference tells you your cup size (0=AA, 1=A, 2=B, 3=C, and so on). For example, if your band size is 36 inches and your cup size is 38 inches, 38 - 36 = 2—so your bra size is 36B.
Why should I choose a zip-front sports bra?
If you’re looking for a supportive and comfortable sports bra that still looks great, a zip-front sports bra may be right for you. Marcellus thinks zip-front sports bras are the superior choice because they avoid distracting clasps and are fully supportive. Plus, the stylish look delivers a boost of confidence during your workouts.
What is the difference between encapsulation and compression sports bras?
Encapsulation sports bras hold each breast in a separate cup, while compression bras secure both breasts against your chest, restricting movement.
Some hybrid sports bras offer a combination of the two.
Do sports bras contain BPA?
In May 2023, the Center for Environmental Health (CEH) announced that, after testing, it had found high levels of BPA in certain activewear pieces containing blends of polyester and spandex, including some sports bras.
We stand by our recommendations on this list, as these products have not been recalled and the science on transdermal absorption of BPA is still not settled. As a precaution, it is best to limit the amount of time you spend in activewear by changing out of it when you are finished working out.

Verywell / Jessica Juliao
Great workout leggings are a must-have for anyone who likes to exercise. And they’re not quite the same as lounge leggings. While lounge leggings can be soft and cozy, workout leggings should be
stretchy
,
breathable
, and
quick-drying
, says fitness instructor
Jess Paris, NASM, CPT
. They should also be
supportive and comfortable
and stay in place during workouts.
To find the best workout leggings,
we tested 98 pairs

and at home. We wore, worked out in, and washed the leggings, assessing them for

lululemon Align High Rise Pant with Pockets

$128 at Lululemon
Pros
Supportive, lightly compressive fit
Stay in place during workouts
Many size, length, and color options
Cons
Some visible underwear lines
Pricier than other options
lululemon’s Align High-Rise Pant With Pockets earned a perfect score (5 out of 5) in every key category we tested for—and they’re Paris’s all-time favorite leggings. Soft, stretchy, and breathable, the leggings are great for various workouts and are
our favorite lululemon leggings out of the 23 we tested
from the brand. They’re also opaque, durable, and packed with pockets.
Made of soft Nulu fabric (a nylon-lycra blend), the leggings are cozy enough to lounge around in. And they stayed secure during every workout. The lightly compressive fabric didn’t sheer during squats and kept us supported during cardio. And we loved that the leggings were lightweight and breathable, even if that made them a little thin. (While the leggings proved opaque, they didn’t obscure underwear outlines.)
The cherry on top? The leggings have three built-in pockets. And they come in a range of sizes, lengths, and colors. They might seem pricey at a higher price than many on our list. But we think they’re worth the investment: They feel amazing right out of the box. And after several wears and washes, they still look as good as new.

Pros
Stretchy performance fit
On-trend cut
Many size, length, and color options
Cons
Waistband feels too thick
Feel varies by colorway
ODODOS’s Cross-Waist Yoga Leggings
were the budget-friendliest leggings that impressed us the most during testing. Made of a sturdy performance fabric, the leggings are stretchy, smooth, and comfortable to work out in. And their on-trend crossover waistband makes them great for everyday wear.
Though the leggings cost considerably less than our overall favorite, they don’t skimp on quality. They’re moisture-wicking and machine-washable. And they’re fully opaque, even in the lightest colorways we tested. Though the crossover waistband is comfortable—never bunching up or digging in—it feels thick compared to the other leggings we tested. And we noticed that the feel of the leggings changes from colorway to colorway.
Given the budget-friendly price point, these felt like minor issues. (For the price of our overall favorite, you could buy five pairs of these.) And since the leggings come in various sizes, lengths, colors, and prints, they’re the perfect thing to stock up on.

Pros
Sweat-wicking and quick-drying
Stretchy but supportive
Seven pockets
Cons
Pricier than other options
Deep pockets may be uncomfortable to use during workouts
lululemon’s Fast and Free High-Rise Tights are a favorite among running coaches and some of our
favorite running leggings
. And the leggings also wowed us during our tests. Made of lightweight Nulux fabric (a nylon-lycra blend), the leggings wick sweat, dry quickly, and provide plenty of airflow. They also offer the perfect blend of stretch and compression.
Since they’re stretchy and squat-proof, we’d happily wear them during any workout. But we think they’re especially great for runners. Thanks to their cool-to-the-touch feel and adjustable drawcord waistband, they keep us comfortable on hot days and never slip out of place. We love that they have seven pockets, though we find the side pockets too deep to comfortably use when working out.
The leggings are also machine-washable, making them convenient to clean between runs. And since they’re available in a range of sizes, lengths, and colors, it’s easy to find a pair worth investing in.

Pros
Adjustable waistband
Breathable and moisture-wicking
Versatile
Cons
Some visible underwear lines
Pricier than other options
Beyond Yoga’s Spacedye Love the Bump Maternity Midi Leggings fit like a dream. Made of a stretchy polyester-elastane blend, the leggings feel soft and comfortable. And they seamlessly transition from activity to activity, so you don’t have to change between errands and exercising.
This pair is designed with an over-the-belly waistband that you can fold up or roll down during different trimesters. And they feel tight and supportive without being constricting. The leggings never sagged, dug in, or needed readjustment during our tests. And they always stay in place, whether we’re lounging on the couch or tackling a 45-minute yoga class.
They’re breathable, moisture-wicking, and machine-washable. And they’re designed with two spacious pockets. The only place the leggings lose points is opacity: While they aren’t sheer or see-through, we occasionally spot some panty lines. But we still feel comfortable wearing them everywhere, and we’d happily spend more money on another pair.

ZUTY 7/8 Leggings

$28 at Amazon
Pros
Stretchy performance fit
Thick and squat-proof
Many size, color, and print options
Cons
Run one size too big
Only one inseam option
ZUTY’s Ankle High-Waisted Leggings With Pockets come in a wider size range (XS-5X) than any leggings we tested. And they’re genuinely great. While other
size-inclusive leggings
have fit, feel, and opacity issues, these are comfortable, stretchy, and totally squat-proof.
Made of polyester and spandex, the leggings are thick and moisture-wicking. And they passed our squat test, concealing any underwear we paired them with. The leggings also boast a supportive high-rise waistband, deep side pockets, and a U-shaped gusset that cuts down on cameltoe. But they run one size too big. And their rise (the distance from waistband to crotch seam) is a bit too long, so we often have to wear them extra-high.
For the price, we’re happy to deal with these tradeoffs. And we’re excited to find great leggings in many sizes. We also love that the leggings come in 18 shades and prints—though we’d like to see more inseam options too.

Best for Spin
Gymshark Legacy Leggings

Pros
Flexible fit
Lightweight and breathable
Squat-proof, even in light colors
Cons
Thighs thin with wear
No pockets
The brand's Legacy Leggings stood out when
we tested 12 pairs of Gymshark leggings
. And we especially love them for spin class. Though the leggings are sturdy and squat-proof, they’re also lightweight and breathable. So they’re perfect for cycling and other fast-paced activities.
While some workout leggings are supportive and compressive, these feel more flexible. And they give you the range of motion to tackle a
spin class
. They’re also lightweight, breathable, and great at wicking sweat. And even in their lightest colorways, the leggings proved opaque—never sheering during squats or plyo box exercises.
When we washed the leggings, they thinned a little in the thighs. But even then, they didn’t lose their opacity. And for the sake of versatility, we wish they had pockets. Still, these leggings offer some of the best value on our list. They feel like an absolute steal at their current price—and they’re perfect for high-intensity exercise.

Pros
Intense graduated compression
Mimic the feel of kinesiology tape
Moisture-wicking and quick-drying
Cons
Run 1–2 sizes small
Pricier than other options
CW-X’s Stabilyx Compression Leggings aren’t just
great compression leggings
. While the leggings are some of the tightest and most intense we’ve tested, they’re also designed to support and stabilize your joints. And we found they delivered on that promise.
Made of an ultra-tight performance fabric, the leggings feel intensely compressive. And they’re lined with seams and panels that mimic the feel of
kinesiology tape
. We feel that support when we wear them during workouts: The leggings gently align our hips and stabilize our knees. They’re also moisture-wicking, fast-drying, and machine-washable.
Like other compression leggings, these run really small. And depending on the fit you’re looking for, you might want to size up. But once you score the right fit, they’re a standout find—well worth their premium price point. We’ve never experienced anything like them. And the moment our initial testing period ended, we immediately ordered a second pair.

Pros
Integrated storage belt
Pockets lie flat (no bulk or bouncing)
Sweat-wicking
Cons

Limited size and inseam options
FlipBelt’s Mid-Weight Leggings aren’t just packed with pockets. They’re also designed with an integrated storage belt that comfortably holds as much as a
fanny pack
.
Made of polyester and spandex, the leggings fit like a glove. And they’re stretchy, sweat-wicking, and squat-proof during every workout. But their real selling point is their storage capacity: They have two side pockets, a front pocket, and an around-the-waist storage belt. That storage belt holds as much as a fanny pack but lies flat. And even when we put large items in it, it doesn’t stick out or bounce around.
Since the leggings are so thick, they’re not very breathable. And we’d love more inseam and size options to choose from. But we like that these allow you to go on jogs, run errands, and head to the gym bag-free.

Pros
Squat-proof and sweat-proof
Breathable, sweat-wicking, and quick-drying
Many size, length, and color options
Cons
No pockets
If you’re looking for opacity,
fleece-lined leggings
are always a great bet. And Under Armour’s ColdGear Authentics Leggings deliver. The leggings proved completely squat-proof, staying opaque in every situation. And they showed no signs of moisture, even when sweat pooled behind our legs.
This pair is made of a dual-layer fabric that’s smooth on the outside and cozy on the inside. And they were some of the most breathable fleece-lined leggings we’d ever worn. The leggings kept us warm on cold days but didn’t overheat us during workouts. And we love that they’re sweat-wicking, quick-drying, and easy to move around in.
They come in a range of sizes, colors, and lengths—which is good because we found their inseam too long. And naturally, we wish they were designed with pockets. But we’re happy with their quality and their price. Given the quality, we’d expect them to be much more expensive.

Pros
Stretchy performance fit
Lightweight, sweat-wicking, and quick-drying
Many size, length, and color options
Cons
Too thick for warm weather
When
we tested 25 pairs of Amazon leggings
, ODODOS’s High-Waist Yoga Leggings With Pockets won out. The leggings are on offer for a budget-friendly price. And given their quality, stretch, and opacity, we think they punch above their weight.
They’re made of performance fabric, so they wick, sweat, and dry quickly. And they offer the perfect balance of stretch and rebound. They’re also soft, lightweight, and comfortable to work out in. And despite their second-skin feel, they provide plenty of coverage: They passed our squat test in broad daylight, even when we wore them in a light colorway.
At times, the leggings felt a little heavy. But there’s nothing else we’d change about them— they feel like a steal. And since they come in two lengths, 38 colors, and an inclusive range of sizes, they’re dangerously easy to stock up on.

Pros
Supportive, compressive fit

Many size, length, and color options
Cons
Too thick for warm weather
When we tested lululemon leggings, the brand’s Wunder Train Leggings earned a perfect score (5 out of 5) in every key category. They’re comfortable, supportive, and easy to clean—and they’re some of the best workout leggings that lululemon sells.
The leggings are made of Everlux fabric, a nylon-lycra blend that wicks sweat and dries quickly. And they feel ultra-supportive, thanks to their compressive fit. They held up during every workout: They didn’t sheer during squats or deadlifts and stayed in place during high-impact exercise. But since they’re so thick, they might be too heavy for hot-weather workouts.
The leggings come in a range of sizes, lengths, and colors. And we love that you can toss them in the washer and dryer. Compared to our Best Overall pick (another pair of our favorite lululemon leggings), these aren’t quite as versatile. But they’re cheaper—and truly perfect for high-impact workouts.

BUBBLELIME High Waist Bootcut Yoga Pants

Pros
Stretchy performance fit
Stay in place during workouts
Five inseam options
Cons
Fabric bunches in the crotch
Limited pocket space
When shopping for leggings, long inseams are hard to find. A few of our favorites have 35-inch-long inseams, and most are much shorter. But Bubblelime’s High-Waist Bootcut Yoga Pants come in five lengths, including an extra-long option with a 37-inch inseam.
This length sets the leggings apart, but it’s not the only reason we love them. Made of a nylon-spandex blend, they’re thick, stretchy, and great for any situation. They stay in place during workouts and emerge from the wash looking as good as new. They’re thick and opaque, so we can comfortably wear them while running errands.
The leggings never pinched, rolled, or dug in during our tests, but they did bunch in the crotch. And while they have one small pocket, we wish they offered more storage space. For their reasonable price, we’re happy to tolerate these tradeoffs. And we appreciate that they come in several sizes, colors, and prints.

Pros

Cons
Not stretchy
Tight, uncomfortable gusset
It’s tough to find flare leggings in petite sizes. But Yogipace’s Bootcut Yoga pants come in 10 inseam lengths, including short inseams that range from 25 to 28 inches and petite inseams that range from 29 to 30 inches.
Made of nylon and spandex, the leggings are thick and sturdy. And they proved opaque in every situation. They also wick sweat, hold their shape, and show no signs of wear after several workouts and washes. But they’re not quite as stretchy as other leggings we’ve tested. So we think they’re best for low-impact workouts and lounging.
Though the leggings showed no signs of thinning, stretching, or pilling, they didn’t feel very high-quality. And we found their double-layer gusset tight and uncomfortable. Still, for their budget-friendly price, we think they’re a worthwhile buy for petite exercisers. And since they come in several sizes and colors, you can find them in a style you love.

Pros
Snug, supportive fit
High-quality feel
Stay in place during workouts
Cons
Waistband feels mid-rise (not high-rise)
Fabric bunches in the thighs
There’s a lot to love about Gap’s GapFit Sky Power Flare Leggings. They’re comfortable, flexible, and supportive. And since they’re made of spandex and recycled polyester, they’re a great option if you want to shop sustainably.
Though mostly made of recycled fabric, they’re as sturdy and supportive as our other favorites. And the moment we slipped them on, they felt high-quality. The leggings feel soft to the touch and have a snug, supportive fit that’s ideal for exercise. They’re also thick and durable, so they passed our squat test and held up in the wash.
We had some trouble with the cut of the leggings: Their high-rise waistband didn’t sit very high, and their legs were so long that fabric bunched around our thighs. But they never dug in or slipped out of place—and we’d happily buy a second pair.

Pros
Stay in place during workouts
Maintain stretch in the washer and dryer
Breathable, sweat-wicking, and UV-protective
Cons
Extreme high-rise waistband
Only one inseam option
Beyond Yoga’s Spacedye High-Waisted Midi Leggings aren’t just stretchy, snug, and supportive. They’re also washer- and dryer-safe. After weeks of wear and washes, they still feel as tight as they did the first time we wore them. And since lots of stretchy materials lose shape in the washer and dryer, that’s remarkable.
The leggings are made of Beyond Yoga’s signature Spacedye fabric, a polyester-elastane blend that feels buttery-soft. And since they’re stretchy, sweat-wicking, and breathable, they’re a joy to work out in. The leggings are also UV-protective, and they stay in place during workouts. But since their high-rise waistband is a whopping 11 inches long, we have to pull them up really high.
They come in a range of colors and sizes. And while they’re pricier, we think their quality and longevity make them a perfect investment piece.

CRZ YOGA Capri Leggings

Pros
Stretchy performance fit
Lightweight second-skin feel
Many size and color options
Cons
Some visible underwear lines
Seams fray when washed
If you want a pair of cropped leggings you can wear during any workout, CRZ YOGA’s Naked Feeling Workout Capri Leggings get the job done.
Made of polyamide and spandex, the leggings are incredibly stretchy. And they feel like a second skin. They never pinch, bunch, or dig in; their high-rise waistband always stays in place. Despite their lightweight feel, the leggings also pass our squat test—though we noticed that you could see panty lines through them.
Unfortunately, this pair is hand-wash-only. And when we gently machine-washed them, they started to fray at the seams. They also run large, so we had to size down to find our perfect fit. To us, these issues felt minor. And at a budget-friendly price, these still offer some of the best value on our list. We’d happily buy them in several more colors. And since they come in 33 shades, that’s easy to do.

Under Armour’s HeatGear High-Waisted Pocketed Leggings are designed to keep you comfortable on hot days. And they really do. During our tests, the leggings proved incredibly sweat-wicking and fast-drying. And their lightweight fabric didn’t weigh us down in the heat.
Made of a performance blend of polyester and elastane, the leggings wick sweat, dry quickly, and offer just enough compression. They also pass our squat test and hold up in the wash. As fans of high-rise leggings, this mid-rise pair sits lower than we’re used to. But their waistband stays in place during every workout. And though the leggings have an ultra-tight fit, we still needed to size down.
We love the side pockets that hold small valuables and that this pair is available in several sizes, lengths, and colors. Given their quality, we’d happily wear them on any hot day.

Eddie Bauer’s Crossover Winter Trail Adventure High-Rise Leggings are some of our favorite fleece-lined leggings. And they’re especially great for hiking. This pair is made of a performance fabric that wicks moisture,
offers sun protection
, and reduces odor. And they’re lined with brushed fleece for added warmth.
Though the leggings feel thick and cozy, they’re not bulky. And they proved opaque in every situation. Throughout our tests, this pair never showed signs of wear. And though they run a little big, we don’t mind: They still feel comfortable and stay in place during workouts.
They’re also lined with pockets, including a zip-up pocket perfect for small valuables. And they come in several sizes, lengths, and colors. This pair is pricier compared to other options on our list. But we think they’re worth the price. They’re comfortable and sturdy—the kind of thing you can buy now and wear for years.

Pros
Supportive, compressive fit

Cons
Hard to put on

When we tested 12 pairs of Gymshark leggings, these Vital Seamless 2.0 Leggings impressed us—and ultimately earned our top spot. The leggings are stretchy, sweat-wicking, and durable. And while we comfortably wore them during a range of workouts, their snug, supportive fit makes them especially great for strength training.
Made of polyester and elastane, the leggings feel tight and compressive. And while they’re breathable enough for a sweat session, they’re also squat-proof enough for a strength-training workout. They’re versatile, seamlessly taking us from studio classes to cross-training exercises. And they held up in the wash, never sheering, thinning, or losing their shape.
Since the leggings are so form-fitting, we found them hard to slip into. And naturally, we wish they had pockets. But this pair is sturdy, comfortable, and versatile and offers incredible value.

We Also Tested
After testing 98 pairs of workout leggings, we found a bunch worth recommending. And there were some leggings we really loved that didn’t make our final list. These leggings lost points in one or more key categories—or they didn’t fit a superlative as perfectly as another pair. But we’d be remiss not to mention some of our runner-ups:
90 Degree by Reflex’s Fleece-Lined Leggings
were our favorite budget-friendly fleece-lined leggings. They earned a perfect score in every key category, proving comfortable, durable, and squat-proof. But we found them a
little
too tight in the waist.
Stretchy, supportive, and squat-proof,
Gymshark’s Adapt Camo Seamless Leggings
proved great for a range of workouts. But they bunched in the knees, and their crotch area thinned in the wash.
If you want to wear flare leggings in cold weather,
Outdoor Voices’s FrostKnit Flare Pants
are a perfect pick. The leggings kept us cozy and held up in the wash, but they’re a little pricey and don’t come in different lengths.
Copyleaf’s Flare Yogo Pants
molded to our body the more we wore them, becoming more comfortable with every wear. Unfortunately, they bunched in the crotch and pilled in the wash. But since they’re so budget-friendly, we didn’t really mind.
If there were more room for maternity leggings on our list,
STORQ’s Signature Maternity Leggings
would’ve made the cut. The leggings felt incredibly soft, stretchy, and supportive. But the belly area became slightly less opaque when stretched.
How We Tested the Workout Leggings
To help you find great workout leggings, we tested 98 pairs in The Verywell Testing Lab and at home. We assessed a range of flare, fleece-lined, maternity, Amazon, Gymshark, and lululemon leggings. And we conducted a separate test for each category.
When we first put on the leggings, we checked them for fit and feel. And we tested how they held up to different exercises and activities. Did the leggings stay in place during stretches, walks, and HIIT sessions? Did they look opaque during squats? Did they still feel comfortable after hours of wear? We then wore them for weeks, noting whether they pilled, thinned, or stretched after several workouts and washes. We considered price, style, features, and variety (color, size, and inseam options) when assessing value.
In the end, we scored the leggings between 1 (would not recommend) and 5 (highly recommend) in a range of key categories, like quality, fit, feel, opacity, durability, and value. Then, we compared them based on score, style, and use case.
Our Experts
Before beginning our search for the best workout leggings, we interviewed two personal trainers for expert insight into what key features make for the best pairs for each activity. Both experts also shared some of their favorite brands to look out for.

What to Look for in Workout Leggings
Five key features to look for in leggings.
Verywell Fit / Michelle Parente
Fabric
Many workout leggings are made of performance fabric blends. These blends often contain nylon (also called polyamide), polyester, or elastane (also called lycra or spandex). And the specific fabric blend determines how the leggings feel: Nylon is smooth and strong, polyester is lightweight and sturdy, and elastane is stretchy and flexible. Ultimately, feel is a matter of personal preference. While Paris likes her leggings to be stretchy, breathable, and long-lasting, you may want yours to feel thick, cozy, or sturdy.
Some polyester-spandex leggings may also contain high Bisphenol A (BPA) levels. BPA is a chemical found in some plastics. And exposure to high levels of it has been linked to health complications like obesity, hormonal imbalance, and uterine cancer. Scientists are still studying whether transdermal exposure to BPA has the same effects. So, for now, the jury’s still out. And since those leggings haven’t been recalled, we may recommend them or products like them.
Function
Before buying workout leggings, consider how you like to exercise. While some leggings are versatile enough for lounging and hitting the gym, others are designed for specific activities, like running, cycling, or weightlifting. For running, Paris recommends breathable, pocket-lined leggings with waistbands that stay in place. For cycling, she likes lightweight leggings that are easy to move around in. For strength training, she wears leggings with more compression. And for yoga, Pilates, and other low-impact workouts, she likes leggings with a soft feel and cozy fit.
Fit
Exercise leggings should fit comfortably, so you can focus on your workout. When leggings are too loose, they bunch up, roll down, or slip out of place. And when they’re too tight, they pinch, dig in, or leave you feeling constricted. To check the fit of your leggings, Paris and Hammond recommend a squat test: When you squat in the leggings, they shouldn’t pinch, shift, or sheer.
Length
Great leggings don’t just fit right in the waist, hips, and thighs. They’re also the right length. So
before buying leggings
, check their inseam length (the distance from gusset to ankle), and compare it to your own. Because inseam lengths vary from
legging brand
to brand, you can’t always rely on terminology (like petite, standard, and tall). Instead, focus on numbers—you’ll find your perfect fit much faster.
Rise
Just like leggings come in different lengths, they also come in different rises. Rise is the distance from waistband to gusset: High-rise leggings start above your belly button, mid-rise leggings start just below it, and low-rise leggings sit lower on your hips. Hammond likes high-rise leggings because they’re flattering and supportive. And we do too. Most of our top picks have comfortable high-rise waistbands, though we also fell in love with a few mid-rise pairs.
Frequently Asked Questions
What is the difference between running and gym leggings?
Many workout leggings are versatile: You can wear them while running or hitting the gym. But if you want activity-specific leggings, you can find them. Paris says that
running leggings
tend to be lightweight, stretchy, and sweat-wicking. And they’re often lined with pockets that store small items. Gym leggings, on the other hand, may feel tighter and more compressive, giving you the support you need to lift weights or tackle HIIT workouts.
How tight should workout leggings be?
Your workout leggings should be tight enough to stay in place but not so tight that they feel uncomfortable. If your leggings are too tight, they may pinch, shift, or sheer during squats and other exercises, Paris and Hammond say. And if they’re too loose, they may bunch up or fall down. If your leggings fit right, they should feel comfortable and supportive—and you shouldn’t have to readjust them every time you move.
How do I know my leggings size?
For the most part, your leggings size will be the same as your pants size. But since size can vary by brand, it’s worth checking the size chart before ordering. And if you’re
buying compression leggings
, you may want to size up. Compression leggings tend to run small and tight. And if you don't want intense compression, your normal size may feel too small.
What should you expect to pay for a quality pair of workout leggings?
After testing 98 pairs of leggings, we can confidently say: There are great workout leggings at every price point. Many of our favorites cost between $100 and $130. And they feel genuinely high-quality, proving comfortable, squat-proof, and long-lasting. But we also found great leggings that cost $20 to $60. Some had problems (inconsistent textures, itchy details, or easily worn fabrics). But they still offer incredible value.
Should I be concerned about BPA in my leggings?
In May 2023, the Center for Environmental Health (CEH) announced that it found high levels of BPA in some polyester-spandex leggings.
BPA (Bisphenol A) is a chemical found in certain plastics.
And research has found that high exposure to it can cause health complications like obesity, hormonal imbalance, and uterine cancer.
We would never knowingly recommend products that cause harm. But right now, scientists are still studying the transdermal effects of BPA, and none of the leggings the CEH cited have been recalled. Ultimately, none of those leggings made our final list. But we may recommend products like them.

Why Trust Verywell Fit
Verywell Fit / Alexander Huang
Whether the temps are cool or downright freezing, a good pair of running pants will help keep you cozy, comfortable, and chafe-free on your run or
walk in cold weather
. From joggers to leggings to track pants, the best running pants are made with
soft, stretchy materials
that are
breathable and moisture-wicking.
And many come with convenient features, like pockets for stashing your phone or reflective details for
running in low-light conditions
.
To find the best running pants on the market, we started by asking four experts—including three running coaches and one personal trainer—for their advice on what
key features to look for
when shopping. Then, we
tested 24 running pants
from top, trusted activewear brands in our regular running routines. We wore each pant while running in various cool to cold weather conditions. Our top picks earned high scores for
fit, comfort,
performance, warmth, durability, and value.
For additional guidance, we had an RRCA and USATF-certified running coach from our
Review Board
assess this article's accuracy, including the best ways to shop for and evaluate running pants.

Sizes:
Women’s XS to XXL |
Materials:

Our Overall Rating:
4.8/5
Who They’re For
Best for runners who value comfort, durability, and ample storage in their leggings.
Why We Love Them
The
lululemon Swift Speed High-Rise Tights
offer the perfect blend of comfort, stretch, and support, easily earning them a spot as our top choice for women’s running pants. When we first tried them on, we immediately noticed their
compressive fit,
which still allows for effortless, unrestricted strides. The material feels
soft and cozy
against the skin and is
completely opaque
, ensuring total squat-proof confidence. Despite their full coverage, we still found the leggings to be
breathable and moisture-wicking.
Featuring a flat,
high-rise waistband
with an internal, continuous drawcord, these tights offer a secure hold and customizable fit. We also love the
reflective details
for enhanced visibility, as well as the
two side drop-in pockets
and a
rear zippered pocket
for convenient storage. If you’re looking for high-quality leggings that can be worn alone or layered, these are hard to beat.
Potential Flaws
We appreciate the drawcord in the waistband for its ability to keep these leggings from sagging, but we found it necessary to occasionally adjust it before our runs to ensure the perfect fit and optimal hold.
Most Valuable Insight
"These have a drawstring! Genius. Whenever I felt that these might slide down, I tightened it and it worked like magic."

Who They’re For
Best if you prefer full-length coverage but want a cooler, lightweight feel, particularly for running in moderate weather.
Why We Love Them
When your body starts to heat up mid-run, you’ll appreciate
breathable
and
moisture-wicking
pants like
On’s Running Pants.
During our runs, we found that the blend of performance materials—polyester and elastane—kept us cool and quickly wicked away sweat.
Ventilation panels at the knee
further enhance airflow, ensuring our comfort and focus on the road.
With
two front zippered pockets,
there’s room to securely stash your essentials. We also like the
mid-rise adjustable waistband
for a customized fit and secure hold, along with
ankle zippers
for easy on-and-off wear. The soft, stretchy material promotes comfort and unrestricted movements. And we appreciate the
high-quality, durable construction
that endured many wears and washes throughout testing.
Potential Flaws
Although we appreciate the breathable, lightweight material for cooler runs, these pants fall short in providing adequate protection for cold weather.
Most Valuable Insight
“The materials used are top-notch, and the design and construction are well thought out. These are great for moderate climates where cold air and a little rain wouldn't be much of an issue."

Who They’re For
Best for running or other outdoor winter activities, as well as casual wear.
Why We Love Them
If you want a premium pair of tights that blends comfort, support, and breathability for cold weather wear, we recommend
Athleta’s Rainier Tights.
The soft, stretchy blend of polyester and Lycra moves effortlessly with your body, making these versatile for both short and
long-distance runs
, as well as gym sessions and casual wear. During test runs, the fabric quickly
wicked away sweat and dried fast.
These tights
kept our legs warm,
even when running in frigid, windy weather, ensuring lasting comfort.
We like that you can easily layer on top of the Rainier Tights for added protection in rain or snow. The
light compression
strategically supports, while the
mid-rise, no-slip waistband
offers a secure fit. Plus, the
side and back zippered pockets
prove convenient spots for carrying your phone,
energy gels
, and more on the run. We also appreciate that these come in regular and
plus sizes,
as well as
three different lengths,
ensuring a perfect fit for every wearer.
Potential Flaws
While we like the mid-rise waistband, some runners may prefer a higher rise for more coverage and support.

Who They’re For
Best for runners seeking plus-size leggings that are comfortable, supportive, and flattering.
Why We Love Them
For leggings that offer flattering coverage,
Nike’s Therma-FIT High-Waisted 7/8 Plus-Size Leggings
are our top pick.
During test runs, both short and long distances, these leggings maintained a
secure yet comfy fit
without slipping or rolling down. The
soft, stretchy
blend of polyester and spandex provides
light compression
while allowing for a full, free range of motion.
The
high-rise, contoured waistband
features a subtle V-shape on the back, delivering a
smooth and flattering silhouette.
The waistband also includes
two hidden pockets
for storing your essentials—one large enough to accommodate your phone. Additionally, we discovered that these leggings not only kept us warm in cold conditions but also
wicked away sweat and kept us cool
as we heated up on our runs.
Potential Flaws
While these leggings offered warmth during cold weather, we found that they lacked sufficient protection for
running in windy conditions
.
Most Valuable Insight
“These are more comfortable than more expensive brands and feel as soft as lululemon's Align line. I will definitely be purchasing these again and would recommend them.”

Who They’re For
Best if you want running tights that feel like second skin.
Why We Love Them
For tights with a
sleek look
and
second-skin feel,
On’s Performance Tights
are a surefire choice. During our wear tests, we were immediately impressed by the
soft, smooth, and stretchy material
—a blend of polyester and elastane— which delivers a secure yet exceptionally comfortable fit. Moving freely in these tights, we felt confident that they wouldn’t slip down during our runs.
The fabric is
breathable, ultra sweat-wicking, and quick-drying,
ensuring ongoing comfort and effective temperature regulation. Despite their minimalist design, this pair offers practical features like a
covered rear pocket
for simple storage and
ankle zippers
for effortless on and off. Even after numerous wears and washes, these
durable and high-quality
tights showed no signs of wear or fading.
Potential Flaws
While we appreciate the lightweight, breathable material for cooler weather, these tights don’t offer adequate protection or warmth for very cold or windy conditions.
Most Valuable Insight
“I actually felt that this was one of the most comfortable pair of tights that I've worn. The material is so soft, smooth, and stretchy enough to fit my body without feeling too tight or too loose when running.” —

Who They’re For
Best if you brave frigid temperatures and don’t want to spend much on fleece-lined leggings.
Why We Love Them
If you’re looking to gear up for winter running,
Baleaf’s High-Waisted-Fleece Lined Leggings
are a low-budget yet high-quality option. During our test runs, they felt like a
second skin,
providing comfort without restricting our strides. The
high-rise waistband
also helps keep the leggings in place and provides a streamlined silhouette. Plus, a
fleece lining
kept us warm, even in the most frigid conditions.
Despite their affordable price tag, this pair proved
remarkably durable.
Even after multiple washes, the leggings maintained their shape, color, and warmth. We also appreciate the
buttery-soft, smooth material
—a polyester and spandex blend—that rivals more expensive options, making them an
exceptional value for the price.
Potential Flaws
We love that these leggings have a back pocket for small essentials, but wish there was a large pocket to fit your phone or larger items.
Most Valuable Insight
“They are SO worth it—they feel like lululemon fleece-lined dupes. I would 100% buy these again in different colors.”

Who They’re For
Best if you want a top-quality pair of
fleece-lined leggings
for warmth and protection on runs, outdoor activities, and daily wear.
Why We Love Them
Under Armour’s ColdGear Authentics Leggings
stand out as a go-to cold-weather option thanks to their fleece lining, which provides
warmth and thermoregulation.
Throughout our testing, this pair consistently kept our legs comfortable and dry, even when we started to sweat. This was thanks to the
soft, moisture-wicking material.
They fit, feel, and
move like a second skin,
which is exactly what you should look for in a pair of running leggings.
Designed to provide ample warmth and protection, these leggings are
suitable for temperatures ranging from 10 to 35 degrees Fahrenheit
—but they never feel heavy or bulky. And in even colder temperatures or for snowy
activities like skiing
, they
can be worn as a base layer.
We also appreciate that they come in
three different lengths,
ensuring the right fit for tall and short wearers.
Potential Flaws
We would appreciate it if these leggings had at least one pocket, but you can always strap on a
running belt
for on-the-go storage.
While these leggings are labeled as mid-rise, we found the waistband to be slightly low, and the crotch area felt short. Depending on body type, some individuals may prefer a higher waistband for enhanced coverage.
Most Valuable Insight
“I like how these aren’t overly bulky or heavy even though they are fleece-lined.” —

Who They’re For
Best if you
run outside in the early morning
or late at night.
Why We Love Them
If you often
run in low-light conditions
, choosing
reflective running gear
, like
Tracksmith’s
Turnover Tights,
is essential to ensure safety on the road.
Designed with runners in mind, these tights proved easy to stride and sprint in during our test runs. The
comfortable high rise
keeps them in place, preventing any distracting riding up or sagging at the back.
Constructed from a blend of nylon and elastane, we found the fabric breathable,
preventing overheating and sweat buildup.
These tights provide enough protection for moderate temperatures and can easily
double as a base layer
in harsher conditions. We also love the
rear zippered pocket,
which allows for secure, bounce-free transport of your running essentials.
Potential Flaws
Although we appreciate the comfy and secure fit of these tights, we noticed some minor irritation from the inner thigh seam during our runs.
Most Valuable Insight
“The inside of the tights were really soft and buttery but stretchy. And the reflective parts of the leggings are great if it’s early morning or after the sun goes down.”

Who They’re For
Best if you prefer to carry your phone, wallet,
protein bar
, and other essentials on your runs.
Why We Love Them
If pockets are a priority for you, consider
Baleaf’s Laureate Thermal Water-Resistant Leggings,
which have ample room for all your
running essentials
.
During test runs, we found the
four side pockets
to be well-suited for securely holding a phone and other items, without any bouncing. Meanwhile, a
zippered back pocket
proved ideal for stashing credit cards, cash, and keys.
The polyester and spandex fabric blend delivers a
soft, stretchy, second-skin feel
. And an added
fleece lining
offers protection during cold runs. Plus, these leggings are
water-resistant,
making them an excellent choice for snowy or
rainy conditions
. This
budget-friendly
pair feels so incredibly comfy that we even found ourselves wearing them for lounging around the house.
Potential Flaws
While some runners may prefer high-waisted leggings, we found that the waist on this pair felt higher than most.
We notice some minor fraying around the seams after several wears and washes, likely attributable to the budget-friendly price point.
Most Valuable Insight
“Super warm! These leggings would be best in really cold temps, like sub-30 degrees Fahrenheit. The lining is warm but not too thick, and they are waterproof, so I would trust them in the snow.” —

Why We Love Them
Do you often find yourself struggling to keep your pants in place or constantly needing to make adjustments?
Hoka’s ColdSnap Run Tights
offer a superb solution to this issue. Throughout our testing, the
lightweight, compressive
fabric provided a
secure, snug fit,
complemented by a flattering
high-rise waistband
complete with an
inner adjustable drawcord
for even more hold.
The polyester and elastane fabrication
effectively wicks away sweat

offer warmth and protection
in cool to cold temperatures and can be
easily layered
for harsher conditions. We also appreciate the
two pockets
for storing small essentials—one can even fit a phone.
Potential Flaws
While we appreciate the secure fit that minimizes the need for adjustments during our runs, we found that these leggings felt quite tight during extended wear.

Running Pants We Also Tested
In total, we tested 24 pairs of running pants but only included 10 in our final list of recommendations. While these products performed well in some areas, they didn't stand out enough for us to include them as a top pick.
Outdoor Voice’s Women's FrostKnit 7/8 Leggings
are soft, warm, and moisture-wicking. They provide a snug and secure fit. However, we discovered that the fabric snags easily and lacks durability compared to other options. Additionally, the reflective detailing left uncomfortable imprints on our skin.
We appreciate
Hoka’s Novafly Run Tights
for their soft, moisture-wicking material and excellent storage options. However, we found the fit to be awkwardly loose at the ankle. Ultimately, we believe the price does not reflect the product's features and overall value.
Featuring a cozy fleece lining,
Brooks' Momentum Thermal Tights
offer warmth and protection from the elements. However, we found the fit to be less secure than desired, with a slouchy waistband that requires frequent adjustment. We also wish the pocket was large enough to accommodate a phone.
Adidas’ Ultimate Running Winter Long Leggings
provide comfort and durability, and we appreciate how well they stay in place during long runs. However, we found the zippers at the ankles to be uncomfortable and distracting.
Where We Stand
After
testing 24 pairs of running pants
,
lululemon’s Swift Speed High-Rise Tights
and
On Running's Men's Running Pants
are our clear winners for women and men. As we continue to test running pants at home, we will update this list of recommendations if we find anything significant that we haven't already mentioned here.
Verywell Fit / Kristen Geil
What to Look for When Shopping for Running Pants
Type:
Popular types of running pants include leggings, tights, joggers, track pants, or semi-fitted ones. Leggings and tights are form-fitting, usually offering at least some compression. Joggers, track pants, and semi-fitted running pants aren’t body-hugging but have a tailored, tapered cut so the material doesn’t bunch or get in the way of your stride.
Function:
While shopping, consider the conditions you’ll be running in. If you tend to run in mild-to-cool weather, you’ll want pants that are made of lightweight, moisture-wicking materials. For colder, more blustery conditions, you need reliable protection with thicker pants that are water- and wind-resistant.
Materials:
Choose from performance fabrics—like polyester, nylon, elastane, and spandex—that are sweat-wicking, breathable, stretchy, and built to last.
Lululemon leggings
, for example, are prized for having these qualities which make them extremely wearable. Polyester and nylon are great for keeping sweat at bay, while elastane and spandex give the four-way stretch you need for unrestricted movements. Most running pants are made from a blend of performance fabrics.
Fit:
You’ll want to try your running pants on to ensure a snug and secure fit that doesn’t feel too tight or restrict your movements. Whether you opt for a form-fitting or semi-fitted style, your pants shouldn’t feel too constricting or too baggy. To find a customizable fit, look for drawstrings or straps for adjustability.
Features:
Many running pants come with additional features, like zippered or drop-in pockets to hold your phone and other essentials. If you run in low-light conditions, you may want pants with reflective elements to improve visibility. Adjustable drawcords or zippers at the ankles make it easier to customize the fit and get the pants on and off.
Weather Protection:
If you don’t let inclement weather interfere with your outdoor running, look for pants that are wind- and water-resistant to keep out the cold and moisture. Just be sure that they also have some ventilation or breathability so you don’t overheat.
Verywell Fit / Sara Michael
How We Tested the Running Pants
To find the best running pants, we tested 24 options from top, trusted activewear brands. During testing, we evaluate each pair of pants based on the following critical criteria:
Fit:
When we first try the pants on, we pay attention to how they fit. We are checking to make sure they're comfortable, providing a snug and secure fit that’s not too tight or restrictive. Then, during our run tests, we assess whether the pants stay in place or require constant adjustments. We also take note of any adjustable features (like drawstrings or straps) that help us find a customized fit.
Comfort:
While running in the pants, we evaluate how comfortable they feel. Does the fabric feel soft against our skin? Are there any seams, tags, or closures that cause discomfort or chafing? Did the pants effectively wick moisture away and provide adequate ventilation to prevent overheating?
Warmth:
Running pants offer different levels of warmth, depending on the conditions they’re crafted for. We wear each pair of pants in various conditions—cool, cold, rainy, and even snowy—to evaluate their level of insulation. We also pay attention to whether the pants provide consistent warmth or if there are cold or warm sports. Finally, we consider if they’re best for very cold or more moderate temperatures.
Performance:
Throughout the testing period, we pay attention to how the pants enhance our running performance. Are they breathable and moisture-wicking? Do they allow for a full range of motion or restrict movements in any way? Is it easy to layer them with other clothing? Do they have any added performance benefits, such as water- or wind-resistance properties or reflective detailing?
Durability:
After multiple wears and washes (per manufacturer care instructions), we examine each pair of pants for any signs of wear and tear, such as fraying, fading, or pilling. Do they maintain their shape, color, and warmth over time?
Value:
To give each pair of pants a fair value score, we wait to look at its price until the end of the testing period. Then, based on performance in each of the above categories, we determine whether we think the pants are priced fairly. We give high scores to pants that cost less than or the same amount as what we would consider paying for them.

Frequently Asked Questions
What type of pants are best for running?
The best running pants are comfortable, move with you, fit well, and are made from moisture-wicking, quick-drying, and breathable fabrics. While there are many different types of running pants—from tights and leggings to joggers and track pants—the best ones for you will suit your preferences and needs.
What is the best material for running pants?
The best materials for running pants are lightweight, breathable, stretchy, and moisture-wicking. Many running pants are designed with nylon, polyester, spandex, or a blend of these fabrics, making them ideal for providing moisture control and a good range of motion.
How much do good running pants cost?
In general, high-quality running pants cost between $35 and $170, depending on added features and brand names. The most budget-friendly opinion we tested is often available for about $33, while our most expensive pair costs about $168.
Is it better to wear tight or loose clothes when running?
Making sure your running pants fit well and let you move freely is important, but choosing between a snug or relaxed fit ultimately boils down to personal preference. For added support,
compression leggings
or tights are a solid choice, whereas others may gravitate towards the more casual feel of joggers or semi-fitted pants.
Are joggers good for running?
Joggers, also known as
jogger pants
, generally feature a relaxed fit and an elastic band at the ankles, lending them a tapered look. Designed with ample flexibility in mind, they offer excellent range of motion, making them ideal for running. Just make sure they’re made from lightweight, sweat-wicking fabrics.

Frequently Asked Questions
Why Trust Verywell Fit
Verywell Fit
From
silky yoga sports bras
to
breezy tank tops
, there are hundreds of ways to express your style while staying comfortable at the gym. But when you’re tackling an intense workout, you need a sports bra that’s ultra-supportive. The best high-impact sports bras provide the highest level of bounce control for running, high-intensity interval training (HIIT),
plyometrics
, and more. Wearing full-coverage designs with high compression, adjustable straps, and wide bands will keep you comfortable and focused on your fitness goals.
To find the top options, we first spoke with experts (including a bra fit specialist and a physical therapist) to learn which
key features to look for
. Then, we
tested 61 expert-approved sports bras
from top fitness brands. Our favorites received high scores for
fit, comfort, support, adjustability, durability, and value.
For more guidance, we had a certified personal trainer from our
Review Board
review this article for accuracy and even more shopping tips.
Which Sports Bra Is Best for High-Impact Activities?
The best sports bra for high-impact activities is equipped to support your breast tissue through
multi-planar movements
, like jumping, running, bending, and lifting. Look for sports bras made from comfortable, durable materials. Other nice-to-have features include encapsulated cups; high compression; wide, adjustable straps and bands; and underwires. According to physical therapist Jackelyn Turner, PT, DPT, this extra support helps protect your breast tissue by cutting down on excess movement. It also reduces pain and discomfort—plus, it can even improve your posture and
range of motion
, she adds.

Who It’s For
Best for most high-impact workouts, especially if you tend to sweat underneath your sports bra.
Why We Love It
lululemon’s Run Times Bra
is our top overall pick because it has a
comfortable, supportive fit
made from
soft, breathable fabric.
We worked up a sweat testing this stylish bra while rowing, running, weightlifting, and more. During each activity, we noticed that the
perforated front panel
allowed air to flow where sweat often accumulates, keeping us cool and dry.
Built for high-impact workouts and running errands alike, this bra has
four-way stretch
that moves with you for a barely-there feel—similar to
your favorite lululemon leggings
. We love how the
adjustable band
never pinches or rides up in the back. Plus,
encapsulated molded cups
keep your breasts separated and supported.
One of the most
comfortable
high-impact bras we tested, the Run Times Bra has
wide, adjustable straps
that are lightly padded (so they won’t dig in). It’s also
easy to put on and take off.
For an all-around high-impact bra, we think this one is unmatched.
Potential Flaws
We only wish this bra was also available in A cup sizes, for a more inclusive size range.
The lululemon Run Times Bra High Support is a soft high-impact option that features a perforated front panel for breathability, molded cups, and wide, comfortable straps.

This lightweight, supportive bra is easy to adjust and has two perforated panels around the back to promote airflow.

Who It’s For
Best for people who do intense workouts multiple days per week, especially if you want a flattering sports bra.
Why We Love It
Alo Yoga’s Power Play High Impact Bra
provides
exceptional support, comfort, and coverage
for those with larger breasts. We love the
wide, adjustable cross-back straps
and
encapsulated cups
that keeps our chests contained and lifted during testing. Plus, the band has three rows of hook-and-eye closures for a snug fit.
During all types of high-impact activities, we noticed zero spillage. In fact, this bra was so comfortable,
we forgot we were wearing it.
The soft lining and
breathable fabric
wick moisture away well, while the durable construction holds up to frequent wear. Even better, it creates a
flattering silhouette
—complete with a
contoured underbust
and a
keyhole detail
in the back.
Potential Flaws
The cross-back straps make this bra a little complicated to put on and take off, but we think it’s worth the extra effort for how well it performs.
The Alo Yoga Power Play High Impact Bra is made of a breathable fabric and features supportive, comfortable padded cups, and adjustable cross-back straps.

Who It’s For
Best for anyone who’s sick of fighting with their sports bra.
Why We Love It
Tired of wrestling your sports bra over your head? We recommend
lululemon’s Enlite Front Zip Bra.
The zipper in front is
strong and secure,
tucked underneath protective fabric for durability. Complete with a
high scoop neck
and a
strappy back,
this bra is just as functional as it is stylish.
With
soft, four-way stretch fabric,
this bra offers top-notch moisture and motion control. During testing, it felt comfortable and supportive as we ran, cycled, hiked, and weight-trained. We love the
smooth, snug band
and
breathable cups
that help control bounce without adding unnecessary bulk. You can wear it multiple times a week—based on our findings, it will still retain its color, shape, and fit after each wash.
Potential Flaws
While this bra isn’t adjustable, we like that it comes in a wide range of traditional bra sizes for a close fit.
The lululemon Enlite Front-Zip Bra High-Support offers exceptional support, thanks to its four-way stretch fabric, breathable, padded cups, and high-quality band.
PHOTO: Verywell Fit
While this bra isn’t adjustable, it comes in many sizes, plus, its strappy back offers a secure, yet comfy fit that won’t stretch out, even during high-impact activities.

Who It’s For
Best for all types of runners, whether you prefer
sprints
or
long distances
.
Why We Love It
With unique design features and plenty of support,
Reebok’s Running Essentials High-Impact Sports Bra
is designed to meet runners’ demands. During testing, we found it had
the perfect amount of compression
to hold everything in place without placing strain on our backs, shoulders, or ribs.
Stride after stride, this bra’s
high neckline
and
snug band
remained comfortable to wear. Even on longer runs, we were completely covered and bounce-free.
Soft, moisture-wicking materials
and a
mesh panel
in the back prevent sweat from building up over time. Plus, it has
reflective details
for running safely at dawn or dusk.
Potential Flaws
Similar to lululemon’s Enlite Front Zip Bra, this sports bra isn’t adjustable.
Since it’s fairly compressive, it can be tough to slip this bra on and off over your head. But we think the amount of support it provides is a fair trade-off.
The Reebok High-Impact Sports Bra feels supportive and compressive, plus, its thick band remains snugly in place, even during long-distance runs.
PHOTO: Verywell Fit
This breathable bra is made of moisture-wicking materials, which helps the wearer stay cool and comfortable.
PHOTO: Verywell Fit
While it’s not adjustable, this bra comes in a variety of sizes, plus its thick straps remain comfortable and won’t dig in, even with all-day wear.

Who It’s For
Best for larger chests, especially if your workouts involve lots of running and jumping.
Why We Love It
With a zipper in front and two types of straps,
Champion’s Motion Control Zip Sports Bra
is the most supportive high-impact bra we tested. It features
high compression, molded cups,
and a design that kept our chests comfortably contained. And we love that the hybrid straps evenly distributed the weight of our chests across our shoulders and backs.
This
breathable, moisture-wicking
bra is easy to wear, even during your most demanding days. Through cycling, weight training, and physical therapy sessions, it
fit well
and
retained its shape.
Another bonus? During testing, we noticed this bra
lays incredibly smoothly
underneath tops. We think it’s worth collecting in a few different colors.
Potential Flaws
Although the straps are adjustable, the band is not.
The hook-and-eye clasp that secures the front zipper can be tricky to attach. But we like that once it's closed, it stays secure and prevents the zipper from touching your skin.
The Champion Motion Control Zip Front Sports Bra is a highly supportive option, thanks to its high compression, padded cups, and thick band.
PHOTO: Verywell Fit
Unlike other options which must be put on over the head, this bra fully opens up and is easily put on one arm at a time, like a jacket.

This bra features molded, breathable cups that retain their shape and work well for those up to size 42DD.

Who It’s For
Best for most body and bust types—if you haven’t found the perfect racerback bra yet, we recommend giving this one a try.
Why We Love It
Available in a wide range of sizes,
All in Motion’s High Support Embossed Racerback Run Sports Bra
is our pick for the most versatile high-impact bra. The straps and band are
highly adjustable,
with sliding buckles and a hook-and-eye closure for easy wearing. But unlike most other bras on our list, this one has
buckles in the front,
so you can easily shorten or lengthen the straps while you’re wearing it.
The sewn-in molded cups provided comfortable coverage
without any gapping or spillage
during testing. And the
high neckline
offers additional coverage while you
bend and stretch
. Wear and re-wear it often—it’s sturdy and machine-washable, with a
durable design
that we found holds up over time.
Potential Flaws
This bra isn’t as easy to take off as some others on our list are.
The All In Motion High Support Racerback Bra is a breeze to put on and adjust since its buckles are located in the front, instead of the back.
PHOTO: Verywell Fit
This washable bra feels super comfortable and has a high neckline, offering full coverage and solid support during various exercises, including strength training.

This lightweight bra is thin, yet supportive, thanks to its sewn-in molded cups, plus it lays smoothly underneath clothing.

Who It’s For
Best for larger chests, especially if you’re looking for a bra with straps that can hide underneath most workout tops.
Why We Love It
Two bras for the price of one?
Oiselle’s Queen Bra
has
convertible straps
that can hide underneath almost any top. We love that you can customize the design depending on your needs or outfit. But it doesn’t skimp on
coverage, compression, or adjustability
—while running and doing
high-intensity interval training (HIIT) workouts
, we still felt secure and contained.
If
breathability
is important to you, you’ll appreciate that the Queen Bra is made with
perforated fabric
that has an
airy mesh lining.
Sewn-in molded cups
and a band with four rows of hook-and-eye closures lift and support larger chests. Choose from a range of
bright patterns and colors
that will add an edge to your workout wardrobe.
Potential Flaws
This bra comes in a more limited size range than others on our list do.
When the straps are crossed, we noticed it’s a little tougher to remove this bra after a tough workout.
The Oiselle Queen Bra feels breathable and secure during high-impact exercises, thanks to its sewn-in molded cups, mesh lining, and thick band.

Who It’s For
Best for hot yoga, exercising outdoors in warm weather, or other extra-sweaty workouts.
Why We Love It
Intense, high-impact workouts are often the sweatiest, which is why we love the breathable design of
Brooks’ Dare Crossback 2.0 Sports Bra.
Made from
moisture-wicking fabric,
it effectively prevented chafing and other uncomfortable irritation during testing. We also like the
stylish, laser-cut ventilation
around the straps and band, which allows air to flow while you exercise.
We particularly loved wearing this bra during runs and HIIT workouts. The
compressive fit
and
encapsulated cups
provided support, while the
wide band
offered superior stability. Moreover, it doesn’t have any removable pads that can curl up in the wash or poke unflattering creases through your shirts.
Potential Flaws
This bra isn’t adjustable, but we like that it comes in traditional bra sizing for a closer fit.
We noticed during testing that this bra tends to hold onto odor after several wears. A gentle vinegar soak quickly fixed the issue—still, we recommend removing and washing it immediately after workouts.
The Brooks Crossback Run Bra 2.0 offers a seamless, compressive fit, and provides excellent support, thanks to its sewn-in molded cups.
PHOTO: Verywell Fit
This bra features non-adjustable, wide crossback straps that won’t dig in, plus, laser-cut ventilation around the band to help keep the wearer cool.
PHOTO: Verywell Fit
This high-quality bra features laser-cut ventilation in the front between the molded cups, providing excellent breathability during intense workouts.
PHOTO: Verywell Fit
This bra lays smoothly against the skin, works well beneath clothing, and feels comfortable enough to wear all day long, however, it does tend to hold onto odors fairly easily.

Who It’s For
Best for runners, especially if you prefer a bra with lots of compression.
Why We Love It
Another solid option for
hitting the treadmill
or trails,
Brooks’ Plunge 2.0 Sports Bra
is one of the most stylish sports bras we’ve tested. With
plenty of compression
and a
secure band,
it supported us through runs, Spin classes, weightlifting, and more.
We like that this
moisture-wicking
bra has a
mesh panel
in the front that’s not only eye-catching—it also allows extra airflow to sweat-prone areas.
Removable padding
allows you to customize your preferred level of coverage. Meanwhile, the
sleek, strappy design
in the back looks modern underneath your favorite top or on its own. Choose from a range of monochromatic and color-blocked options to find colors that suit your style.
Potential Flaws
We wish the straps and band were adjustable.

Our Overall Rating:

Who It’s For
Best for people with a large cup size and a small band size, especially if you’re looking for a sports bra that won’t overly minimize your chest.
Why We Love It
Sometimes, compression isn’t enough—that’s where
Wacoal’s Simone Sport Underwire Bra
comes in. It has an exterior underwire that lifts and stabilizes without rubbing or chafing. Unlike many sports bras that can overly flatten your chest, we loved how this bra’s
soft cups
lifted, separated, and supported our breasts. The final product:
even support
and a
more sculpted silhouette.
With an
adjustable band and straps,
we appreciate that this bra is easy to customize for the right fit. It’s also made from
thick, opaque fabric
that provides
solid coverage
and wicks away sweat. Available in multiple colors in sizes ranging from 32C to 42I, there’s an option for almost every wearer and workout.
Potential Flaws
We noticed that the band felt tight, even on the loosest setting, so we’d recommend ordering one band size up from your usual.
During testing, we realized that this bra is too supportive to wear for long periods of time. If you have a long day ahead of you, we suggest changing into
your favorite two-piece workout set
after exercising.

Who It’s For
Best for anyone who dreads “uni-boob.”
Why We Love It
If you’re looking to invest in a high-quality, stylish sports bra, we recommend
Knix’s Catalyst Bra.
When we put it to the test, we found that its
molded, encapsulated cups
and
high compression
supported our chests comfortably at all impact levels. It
lifts, separates, and reduces motion
to keep you feeling covered and confident.
During testing, we noticed that the fabric is surprisingly
thick and soft,
even without removable padding in the cups. The
wide sides and band
provide lots of coverage to prevent spillage. And adjusting it is a breeze, using the
large buckles
and
five-row hook-and-eye closure.
All of these features (plus
a zip-front option
for easier wearing) make this bra a solid buy, in our book.
Potential Flaws
Knix’s unique sizing system can take some time to understand. But the brand’s website features a helpful conversion tool so you can find the right fit.
The brand notes that this bra feels ultra-compressive at first, since it’s designed to loosen up slightly over time. We also noticed this during testing, so you may want to order up one size to ensure your bra isn’t too tight.

Who It’s For
Best for anyone who still struggles to find the perfect sports bra—no matter your cup size.
Why We Love It
While many of our top picks are adjustable,
SheFit’s Ultimate Sports Bra
is completely customizable to fit your unique body shape perfectly. Designed so you can alter the fit instantly (even mid-workout), this bra has
strong, convertible straps
that are
adjustable from the front
and a
zip-front closure
that locks securely beneath protective fabric tabs.
We love that, unlike many other bras on our list, this one has
customizable compression,
thanks to its unique construction. During testing, it held up through runs, weightlifting sessions, and
complex agility drills
. We also like that it’s highly breathable, with
moisture-wicking materials
and
mesh panels
that help sweat evaporate quickly.
Potential Flaws
Unlike most of our other top picks, this sports bra has two-way stretch instead of four-way stretch. It may feel a little stiffer.
Verywell Fit
High-Impact Sports Bras We Also Tested
We tested 61 sports bras, but only 12 made it onto our final list. While these other options impressed us in some ways, they didn’t quite meet our expectations.
Although
Under Armour’s UA Infinity High Sports Bra
is supportive and well-made, we found that it felt stiff and uncomfortable. The straps and band were also too tight, causing the bra to ride up in the back.
Maaree’s Solidarity High-Impact Sports Bra
offers exceptional coverage and support. However, we noticed that the adjustable overband across the top of the bra irritated our underarms. It’s also pricier than many of our other top picks are.
We like that
Syrokan’s High Impact Sports Bra
feels light and airy, but the straps and hook-and-eye closure on the band were challenging to adjust.
Where We Stand
After
testing 61 sports bras
,
lululemon’s Run Times Bra
is our favorite high-impact option. We love that it's comfortable, supportive, and highly breathable. The buttery soft material moves with you for a barely-there feel. We continue to test each high-impact sports bra at home, and we’ll update our recommendations if we notice anything significant that we haven't already mentioned here.
Verywell Fit
What to Look for When Shopping for a High-Impact Sports Bra
Fit:
According to our experts, a high-impact sports bra should feel snug in the band, with cups that lay flush against your chest (meaning no visible gaps). Also, check that you’re not spilling out the sides or over the top of your bra. Note that while the band of your sports bra should feel snug, it shouldn't be too tight, as a recent study suggests that wearing a too-tight sports bra could negatively impact running performance.
When in doubt, look for adjustable straps and an adjustable band, and use the brand’s size chart to help you find the right fit, says Marissa Renelt, assistant merchant at Bare Necessities. She also recommends buying sports bras that are sold in traditional bra sizes.
Support:
Look for support features that go above and beyond to prevent excess movement. A bra with high compression will hold your breasts close to your chest wall. Another major plus: encapsulated cups, which isolate, lift, and stabilize each breast. If you have a larger chest, you may prefer bras with an underwire or a high neckline for even more support; or perhaps a
plus-size sports bra
might be a better fit.
Straps:
Wide, padded straps help distribute the weight of your breast tissue evenly along your shoulders and back to prevent strain.
Adjustability:
Adjustable straps and bands provide a customizable fit, which can be especially helpful for larger busts, our experts say. Just make sure the straps aren’t the only feature holding up your chest, explains bra fit specialist Heather Laporte.
Materials:
Choose a bra made from soft, breathable materials that wick away moisture, like nylon, elastane, spandex, or polyester. Avoid scratchy hardware and itchy seams, says Lauren Sheu, RRCA, a certified running coach. She also suggests steering clear of cotton because it retains moisture and dries slowly, trapping bacteria and odor.
Care:
To get the most out of your sports bra, always follow the manufacturer’s care instructions. Our experts recommend closing all of a bra’s fasteners and placing it in a mesh laundry bag. Then, wash it on a delicate cycle using mild detergent. Avoid fabric softeners to preserve your bras’ moisture-wicking properties and never put them in the dryer—our experts say this can compromise the elasticity. Instead, hang them to dry.

How We Tested the High-Impact Sports Bras
To find the best high-impact sports bras, we’ve tested 16 expert-recommended options from top brands. During testing, we evaluate each bra based on the following key criteria:
Fit:
When we first try the bra on, we check to see if we can comfortably place two fingers between the straps and our shoulders. Does the band rest parallel and snug around our ribcage without being too tight? Do the straps or band pinch, leaving red marks? We also prioritize bras that provide even coverage, with no spillage or gapping.
Comfort:
While wearing the bra before, during, and after workouts, we note how comfortable it feels. It is soft and breathable, or scratchy and tight? A bra earns a perfect score for comfort if we forget we’re even wearing it, after an hour or two.
Support:
During each test, we wear the bra for four different workouts: a 30-minute jog, a 30-minute dance workout, a 30-minute HIIT workout, and a 15-minute
jump rope
workout. Is it compressive enough to hold our breasts in place without feeling restrictive? We look for bras that keep our chests fully contained, without any spillage or pain in our shoulders or backs.
Adjustability:
A high-impact sports bra should be adjustable, for a closer fit. Can we adjust the straps, band, or both? What kind of closures does the bra have, and are they easy to use?
Durability:
At the end of the test, we check to see if the bra has maintained its structure after multiple wears and washes. Has it started to pill, fade, or stretch out? Bras with a high durability score show little to no signs of wear and tear.
Value:
To rate each sports bra’s value, we don’t look at the price until the end of the testing period—after we’ve evaluated it in all other categories. Based on how the bra performed, do we think the price accurately reflects its value? Would we pay that much for the bra, or would we only buy it if it went on sale?

Frequently Asked Questions
What’s the difference between high-impact and low-impact sports bras?
Low-impact sports bras are designed with light support for casual, non-strenuous activities, when comfort and style are your main priority. High-impact sports bras hold your bust firmly in place during vigorous activity and sudden bursts of movement—plus, they’re usually more adjustable and offer more coverage.
When should you wear a high-impact sports bra?
High-impact activities where your feet simultaneously leave the ground (like running, jumping, HIIT, and court sports) all require a high-impact sports bra. When in doubt, opt for a more supportive bra for long-term wear to prevent discomfort, Turner says.
Can you wear a high-impact sports bra all day long?
It depends: Wearing a high-impact sports bra all day could cause back or shoulder pain, especially if it’s very compressive or you’re wearing the wrong size. If it gets wet with sweat, you should change out of your sports bra immediately to prevent skin irritation or breakouts.
How many high-impact sports bras should I own?
It depends on how often you work out and how frequently you do laundry. If you enjoy the occasional intense workout, you may only need two—but daily runners may need four or five.

Why Trust Verywell Fit
Verywell Fit / Alli Waataja
Originally known for fashion-forward yoga gear, Alo Yoga has grown into a major apparel brand offering
high-quality activewear
that can take you from the studio to the street. Alo's leggings are a fan favorite for their style, fit, and versatility: There's a pair for every workout, whether you prefer restorative yoga or
interval training
. Although they're priced at a premium (similar to other top brands), our expert fitness professionals confirm they're more than durable: Nancy Ruggeri, owner and lead instructor at CycleBar, loves her Alo leggings because they wear and wash beautifully.
The best Alo leggings for you depend on your height, your preferred fit, and which workouts you enjoy doing. You may also want to consider care instructions—some pairs hold up best with gentle cycles or hand-washing only. To find the best Alo leggings on the market, we asked a yoga teacher and a spin instructor which
key features
every pair should have. Then, we
researched dozens of leggings
from the brand and considered their
fit, opacity, hold, durability, additional features, and overall value.
We also had a certified personal trainer from our
Review Board
review this story for accuracy, shopping tips, and which Alo Yoga leggings are best for different workouts.

Who They're For
Best for long days when you don't have to time to change after hitting the gym.
Why We Love Them
Alo’s Ribbed Airlift High Waist 7/8 Enchanted Legging
tops our list, thanks to its combination of
style, function, and fit
. The Airlift fabric is a favorite among Alo fans for how
breathable
it is, with just enough
compression
to smooth and support without feeling too tight.
We like the
7/8 length
, which is designed to hit most wearers at or slightly above the ankle. (If you're petite, it's a great full-length option that won't leave you with lots of extra fabric around your feet.) A
wide, high-rise waistband
helps the Enchanted Legging
stay in place
, whether you’re jumping, squatting, or perfecting your
Downward-Facing Dog
. And we love the
stylish ribbed detailing
that makes this pair ideal for
studio-to-street wear
.
The Enchanted Legging not only
wicks away sweat
during more intense workouts, but the
opaque material
also
keeps you fully covered in any yoga pose.
Side pockets
allow you to store a smartphone or other small essentials while you're on the go. To get the most out of your purchase, we recommend washing these on cold, then tumble drying them on low or hanging them to dry.
Potential Flaws
Some wearers have found that these leggings are on the thicker side. You may prefer a thinner pair for exercising in warm weather or in heated studios.

Who They're For
Best for working up a sweat, especially if you prefer
compression leggings
.
Why We Love Them
Alo’s 7/8 High Waist Airlift Leggings
are famous for their ability to hold up to sweat and movement, making them a perfect choice for
sweltering hot yoga classes
. They're
lightweight
(but not see-through!) and
wick away sweat
like it’s their job (it is)! Made of
smoothing, compressive fabric
with an
extra-wide, high-rise waistband
,
it’s no wonder they’re a fan favorite.
Jamie Adams, MS, RDN, RYT200, RPTY, a prenatal yoga teacher, loves that these leggings layer well over
workout underwear
and stand up to tough workouts. Plus, we like that they're available in
more colors and sizes
than most other Alo leggings are. With
four-way stretch
and a
slightly shimmery finish
, the 7/8 High Waist Airlift Leggings will keep you feeling stylish and supported from the start of class to your final pose.
Potential Flaws

Who They're For
Best for walking, running errands, or grabbing lunch with friends.
Why We Love Them
Alo’s Airlift High Waist 7/8 Charmer Legging
is our top pick if you're looking to add some flare to your activewear collection. The
ruched belt with a chrome buckle
gives these leggings an edge, and we love that you can pair them with the
Airlift Charmer Bra
to create
a sleek, two-piece workout set
.
Made from Alo’s signature Airlift high-compression fabric, the Charmer Legging is
moisture-wicking, sculpting, and lifting
,
for bottoms that work from barre class to brunch. Even better, they have
side-slit pockets
and
four-way stretch
, like some other leggings on our list. If you already own a few Airlift pairs but want something new and different, we highly recommend the Charmer Legging.
Potential Flaws
The belt is built in and can't be removed during high-impact workouts.

Who They're For
Best for running, spin class, or
high-intensity interval training (HIIT)
.
Why We Love Them
For leggings that blend compression with breathability, we recommend
Alo’s High-Waist Camo Vapor Leggings
. We like that the
lightweight
Vapor material, made from nylon and Lycra, is
breathable, moisture-wicking
, and
odor-resistant
. Even better, the wide, high-rise waistband and
four-way stretch
keep these leggings in place no matter how fast you're moving.
Alo's Camo Vapor Leggings are
full-length
, designed to hit right at your ankle. Buttery soft to the touch, they're also
compressive
to provide support right where you need it. Another reason these will become your go-to pair: They're made with
minimal seams
to limit itchy irritation.
Potential Flaws
Since these leggings don't have pockets, you may want to pair them with
a functional fanny pack
that can hold your essentials.

Who They're For
Best for medium-intensity workouts, especially if you want your leggings to work as hard as you do.
Why We Love Them
For confidence-boosting compression,
Alo’s 7/8 High Waist Airbrush Legging
is our top pick. The Airbrush fabric is made from nylon and spandex that
sculpts, lifts, and smooths
, creating sleek, supportive bottoms for most
medium-intensity workouts
.
Even though they're one of Alo's
thicker pairs
,
these leggings are still
breathable, moisture-wicking, and odor-resistant

Our experts love these leggings because they have
stretch
that helps them stay in place, and they never feel constricting. We also appreciate that they
don't have any side seams
, for a polished look while running errands or grabbing coffee. Available in a wide range of colors and sizes, these leggings are also more
budget-friendly
than many other pairs on our list.

Who They're For
Best for working out in warm weather.
Why We Love Them
Alo’s High-Waist Airbrush Capri
has everything we love about the 7/8 High Waist Airbrush Legging in a shorter length. These classic capris
smooth and lift
for a
stylish silhouette
with slightly less coverage. If you usually struggle to find shorter inseam lengths that are still flattering, we highly recommend trying this pair.
The Airbrush material is
durable, sweat-wicking
,
and
odor-resistant
.
Although they're a little thicker than other leggings on our list, they’re still

Alo’s High-Waist Alosoft Lounge Leggings
—they're made with
buttery soft, four-way stretch material
that's ideal for lounging or practicing
restorative yoga
. We love the
ribbed waistband and cuffs
that set these apart (and help them double as sleek work-from-home pants when needed).
These leggings are
full-length
, with a 28-inch inseam that will fit taller wearers well. A
contouring seam

Who They're For
Best for low- to medium-impact exercise, especially if you prefer low-rise bottoms.
Why We Love Them
Alo’s Super Shine Low-Rise Bootcut Legging
has a thin, low-rise waistband that makes it stand out from most of the brand's other styles. We love that, despite their
shimmery, shiny look
, these are made with the same Airbrush fabric the brand is known for. This means they still have
four-way stretch
and a
sculpting silhouette
.
From your go-to weekend fitness class to coffee with friends, these leggings stay
breathable and comfortable
. We appreciate that you can throw them
in the washer and the dryer
—a huge bonus if you plan on wearing them regularly. These can even be worn with heels or platforms on rest days, making them a multi-functional athleisure staple.
Potential Flaws
The 32- to 33-inch inseams may be too long for some.
The waistband is fairly thin, meaning these leggings aren't as supportive as some others on our list are.
Where We Stand
After researching dozens of leggings
and sorting through feedback from wearers and experts,
Alo's Ribbed Airlift High Waist 7/8 Enchanted Leggings
are our top overall choice for their sleek design and compressive, breathable fabric. We also love that they have pockets to stash your phone during your workout. We're always searching for the best activewear, and we'll update this list if Alo Yoga drops any new leggings that we think are worthy of consideration.
How We Selected the Best Alo Leggings
With so many fabrics and silhouettes to choose from, finding the best Alo leggings can be a challenge. We first asked a yoga teacher and a Spin instructor for their advice on how to shop for leggings. Then, we researched Alo Yoga's leggings and fabrics, comparing different styles and lengths. To narrow down our list, we evaluated each pair based on the following criteria:
Fit:
Finding the right fit is essential for comfortable and distraction-free workouts. Adams recommends looking for leggings that feel like a second skin—make sure they aren't too tight or too loose. Most Alo leggings fit true-to-size. If you’re unsure which size to order, the brand's
size guide
can be a helpful tool.
Opacity:
Opacity refers to how thick the leggings are. The best Alo leggings are completely opaque, meaning no underwear lines, colors, or patterns show through. We look for sturdy fabrics that aren't sheer, ensuring all of our recommendations are secure and squat-proof.
Hold:
No one likes wearing leggings that constantly need to be pulled up. A legging with great hold has a waistband that doesn't slip, sag, or fold over. We also look for leggings that are stretchy, meaning they won't need to be readjusted throughout the day.
Durability:
To assess how durable leggings are, we check their care instructions. Are they machine-washable, or do they need to be washed by hand? We also consider which materials they're made from (more on this below).
Additional Features:
We note if the leggings have any special features, like pockets, mesh panels, or belts, that make them stand out from other pairs.
Value:
We compare the price of each legging to additional pairs from Alo Yoga and other popular fitness brands. How does the price stack up to other leggings on the market? Are the leggings budget-friendly and easy to stock up on or are they pricier, making them an investment piece?
Our Experts
We asked experts for their advice at every stage while researching and reporting this story. These fitness professionals shared which key features set Alo leggings apart from the rest. They also provided important shopping tips and shared which Alo leggings they wear most often (plus why they love them). We choose products independently, but we use expert input to influence our choices.

What to Look for When Shopping for Alo Leggings
Materials:
Alo leggings are made from one of five signature fabric blends—Alosoft, Airlift, Airbrush, Vapor, and Seamless. The best choice for you depends on your activity level and personal preference.
Alosoft
is a stretchy blend of polyester and spandex that’s soft and breathable—great for yoga, Pilates, lounging, or casual wear.
Airlift
fabric is a breathable, lightweight, move-with-you combination of polyester and spandex that lifts and sculpts.
Airbrush
fabric is the most compressive option. It's a blend of nylon and spandex that sculpts and smooths, with a matte finish. Made from nylon and Lycra,
Vapor
is moisture-wicking and odor-resistant. It's also designed to compress and lift, making it perfect for
high-intensity workouts
. Finally,
Seamless
fabric is a soft, airy blend of cotton, nylon, and spandex. We recommend it for yoga, Pilates, hiking, or lounging.
Rise:
Most Alo leggings have a low- or high-rise waistband. High-rise leggings offer more coverage, support, and security during workouts where you're moving, stretching, and bending a lot—such as yoga or
bungee fitness
. Low-rise leggings are great for walking, hiking, lounging, or daily wear.
Inseam Length:
The inseam length refers to the distance from the legging's crotch to the bottom of the ankle. Alo offers a range of inseam lengths, including cropped, 7/8, and full-length.
Alo’s size guide
will help you figure out where each length will hit you based on your height.
Frequently Asked Questions
Are Alo or lululemon leggings better?
According to Adams, the two brands are comparable in quality, durability, and price. When shopping, consider your weekly workout routine—Alo offers more leggings that are designed for yoga, while lululemon has more sport-specific styles for running, weightlifting, and more.
Should you size up or down for Alo leggings?
Most Alo leggings fit true to size. Adams suggests sizing down for more compression and support and sizing up for a relaxed fit.
How do Alo sizes compare to lululemon?
Both brands' sizing is similar. If you're trying to compare Alo Yoga and lululemon, use both brands' size charts to make sure you're purchasing the same numerical size (usually from 00 to 18).
Are Alo leggings high quality?
Yes, Alo Yoga leggings are known for their high-quality fabrics and designs. The experts we spoke with both wear Alo leggings frequently and note how well they stand up to regular wear and tear over time.
Do Alo leggings show sweat?
Most Alo leggings are double-knit and fully opaque—in other words, they're designed not to show sweat. But if you know you’ll be working up a sweat, we recommend the brand's Vapor, Airlift, or Airbrush fabrics because they're the most breathable and moisture-wicking.
How much should you expect to spend on Alo leggings?
Alo leggings may cost anywhere from $80 to $150, depending on their design, length, and materials. If you're looking to score Alo leggings for less, check out the brand's
sale section
, where you can find some styles for up to 40% off regular price.

Stability—it’s a byword of athletes of all types, from weightlifters to yogis. And nowhere is having firm, steady balance—especially in your feet and ankles—more important than in running. But having flat feet or feet that tend to pronate or turn inward can seriously compromise your stability when you run, potentially putting you at higher risk of injury or simply making running uncomfortable.
Fortunately, stability running shoes can help. With a combination of the right alignment, arch support, and cushioning, this form of specialty footwear helps hold your feet and ankles steady. This way, you can go on a run with a lower likelihood of pain or injury.
Here’s an in-depth look at what stability shoes have to offer, who they’re for, and what to look for when selecting them.
What Is Pronation?
Pronation
occurs when the foot and/or ankle roll inward when you run or walk. It’s an extremely common issue and is typically is due to pushing off the ground with your big toe and second toe. Though it may not sound like a major problem, when pronation—or
over
pronation—happens with each footfall over multiple miles, it can put excess strain on your arches. This results in ankle or shin pain. Eventually, overpronation can even cause your
feet to flatten
.
The research on whether pronation leads to directly to injury is somewhat mixed. Anecdotally, many runners find that the instability of an inward-rolling foot makes them more prone to strained muscles or falls. But a study in the
British Journal of Sports Medicine
determined that foot pronation was not associated with increased injury risk in novice runners wearing non-specialty shoes.
On the other hand, a small 2019 study in
Frontiers in Physiology
found that foot pronation contributed to joint loading, or an increased stress on the joints, of the lower limbs after long-distance running.
This extra stress could be a factor in the development of osteoarthritis.
In contrast to pronation, some people experience the opposite problem—supination. Supination occurs when the ankle or foot rolls outward from center. This, too, can cause pain or injury, since it increases the likelihood of ankle rolls or sprains.
We Tested the Best Running Shoes for All Types of Runners, Here Are the Top 14
Features of Stability Running Shoes
Stabilizing your feet and ankles for safer, more efficient running typically isn’t a matter of willpower—it’s a matter of gear. Selecting stability running shoes with the right features could make a major difference in how you feel post-run. Those with weak ankles, for instance, should look for
ankle support shoes
with motion control, arch support, and grippy traction. Stabilizing shoes often offer the following structural supports.
Arch Support
A firm, high arch support is a common feature in stability running shoes. If your arch is supported, it’s less likely to turn inward.
Midsole Cushioning
Much like arch support, cushioning the entire mid-section of the foot can help hold it steady. For example, in
walking shoes for flat feet
, you'll find extra supportive cushioning in the midfoot to help prevent further arch collapse. You may see stability running shoes that advertise bars, rails, or medial posts to help maintain balance and reduce pronation.
Heel Cups and Counters
A deep heel cup sits under your heel, aligning your foot and ankle in a straight line. Heel counters, meanwhile, are hard plastic inserts that reinforce the back of a running shoe, increasing overall support and holding the foot in place.
Wide Base
A wide platform underneath your foot is one more key to preventing the inward rolling of overpronation. It's also a common feature of
walking shoes for seniors
and
running shoes for bad knees
that provide stability for those challenged with balance issues.

How to Choose the Right Stability Running Shoes
While
browsing online or shopping in person
for stability running shoes, an overabundance of options may give you decision paralysis. But take heart—
selecting the best shoe
for your pronation issues doesn’t have to be overly complex.
At many athletic supply stores, you can start with an in-store
assessment of your gait
, foot shape, and running style. Or, if this isn’t available to you, you can consider these factors on your own as you try various shoes on.
Overpronators will want to look for a shoe that has at least some of the features listed above—arch support, midsole cushioning, heel cups and counters, or wide base. If you have narrow or
wide feet
, seek out shoes made specifically for these issues.
And don’t forget that, in any running shoe, comfort is priority number one. Your feet should feel firmly supported with no pinching, your toes shoes have plenty of wiggle room, and you should be able to lace up without too much hassle.
Benefits of Wearing Stability Running Shoes
Stability running shoes are not only a fun addition to your athletic wardrobe—they may come with benefits for your performance as well. A well-cushioned, well-fitting stability shoe can enhance your comfort as you run, making your workouts more enjoyable.
When you can run without pain, you’re more likely to achieve your best times and stick with running in the long term. Plus, a stability shoe that prevents overpronation can improve your
running form
as it holds your feet and ankles steady. Having proper form allows you to run faster and more efficiently.
And again, though research is not completely conclusive about the effects of stability shoes on injuries, some studies have shown promising results. A 2021 study in the
Journal of Orthopaedic and Sports Physical Therapy
explored the potential of
motion-control shoes
—which are somewhat more stabilizing than stability shoes—on running injuries. The authors concluded that these shoes might reduce the risk of injuries related to overpronation.
Another older study in the
British Journal of Sports Medicine
compared stability shoes to neutral and motion control shoes in female runners with various degrees of foot pronation. Those who ran in stability shoes had the fewest missed days of training—an indicator that they experienced fewer injuries. However, it’s worth noting that those who wore stability shoes reported more pain while running than those who wore neutral shoes.
Bottom Line
Because of their stabilizing effects on feet and ankles that roll inward, stability running shoes might be the solution you’re seeking for post-jogging pain and injuries. The only way to find out is to try them for yourself! If you know you tend toward pronation, consider selecting a pair of stability shoes to help correct it. Look for footwear with sturdy arch support, plenty of cushioning throughout the midsole, heel counters, and a wide sole. These features can nudge your gait toward straight.

How to Wash and Care for Lululemon Leggings
Common Mistakes to Avoid
Lululemon leggings are a popular wardrobe staple for many people. What makes this brand so desirable is the fact that their clothing is based on the “science of feel,” which is easily understood once you slide your legs into a pair of their buttery-soft leggings. However, Lululemon leggings are not cheap. In fact, the majority of these leggings cost between $98 and $128, but fans of the brand say they are well worth the hefty price tag.
These leggings are made from high-quality fabrics that hold their shape well over time—top of mind for anyone seeking out the
best workout leggings
. Plus, the company also claims to “brush” each item with a special mechanical treatment that ensures softness. They also test each lot of fabric for efficacy before it leaves the mill.
Needless to say, if you own a pair of Lululemon leggings, such as the
Align High-Rise Pant
, you want to ensure that they stand the test of time, not only because you love them, but because you spent your hard-earned money on them! To keep your Lululemon leggings from losing their luster over time, you need to take good care of them.
The first step to caring for Lululemon leggings is to recognize that their complex design and high-quality fabrics require a bit more TLC than the average pair of leggings. Here, we’ll dig into the nitty-gritty details about how to properly clean and care for your
favorite Lululemon leggings
and avoid common pitfalls that can lead to damage.
Verywell / Jessica Juliao.
How to Wash and Care for Lululemon Leggings
Of course, you’ll need to wash your leggings frequently, but be wary when doing so, as
Lululemon leggings
require special washing treatment. Here's what you need to know about washing these leggings.
Preparing for Washing
The first step is to prepare your leggings for the wash. You’ll want to sort through your laundry to make sure that you separate the Lululemon clothing from everything else—including
Lululemon joggers
, tops, and jackets.
You’ll also want to turn the gear inside out and make sure that any zippers or Velcro are not facing outward. It is also helpful to double-check the clothing for any stains that you can rinse off prior to washing so that these marks don’t transfer to the other items in your wash.
Washing Lululemon Leggings
You can wash Lululemon leggings in the machine or by hand. But, Lululemon recommends using the least amount of detergent possible. Any excess soap may inhibit certain qualities in the material that help repel water.
While the type of detergent doesn’t matter as much, it can be beneficial to use one without fragrance, as it contains fewer ingredients. You might also consider using a sport laundry detergent formulated specifically to clean technical fabrics (e.g. sweat-wicking material). Most Lululemon leggings require that you wash them with cold water, but it’s a smart idea to scroll down to the “Material and Care” section online for the specific pair you’re washing to make sure.
Drying Lululemon Leggings
While you can use your machine to wash your Lululemon leggings, the company recommends air drying instead of machine drying. This helps protect the longevity of the LYCRA® fibre and helps maintain the desirable shape and stretch of your leggings. Additionally, machine drying your leggings could lead to shrinkage over time, so it’s in your best interest to air dry whenever possible.
Storing Lululemon Leggings
How you store your Lululemon leggings doesn’t matter as much as how you wash and clean them. But folding them properly can help protect them from damage. It’s also a smart idea to stack your leggings together in one area of your drawer so that they are rubbing up against like fabric instead of other fabrics that could potentially cause pilling.
When packing Lululemon leggings for travel, it’s a smart idea to use the same method. Pile like fabrics together and even consider using packing cubes so that they are separated from other clothing or items.
Verywell / Jessica Juliao.
Common Mistakes to Avoid
As you care for your Lululemon leggings, it can be helpful to avoid common and seemingly harmless mistakes that can compromise their quality. Here are some common mistakes to avoid.
Washing Leggings with Rough Fabrics
Make sure you’re washing your Lululemon leggings with only like fabrics and, ideally, only Lululemon clothing items, since they are made with a special LYCRA® fibre. Be careful not to throw anything textured into the wash with your Lululemon leggings such as towels, Velcro materials or terry cloth, as this can cause abrasions and lead to pilling.
Using Fabric Softeners or Bleach
Fabric softeners and bleach can ruin the quality of the fabric in Lululemon leggings over time. So, it’s a good idea to avoid adding anything but detergent to your wash, whether you’re hand washing or machine washing.
Washing in Hot Water
Cold water is best when it comes to washing Lululemon leggings, according to the company, because it helps maintain the integrity of the fabric, prevent the color from fading and maintains the desired shape of the leggings.
Machine-Drying on High Heat
Lululemon recommends air drying their leggings instead of machine drying. If you don’t have time to air dry, you could opt to air dry in your dryer or on the lowest and coolest setting possible to avoid compromising the quality of your leggings.
Bottom Line
If you own Lululemon leggings, it is important to properly care for them in order to maintain their shape and quality. Just make sure you wash them with like fabrics in cold water and avoid the dryer if you can. Doing so, will ensure your leggings stand the test of time with limited pilling, stretching, and fading.

Any form of physical activity, including exercise, is linked with preventing several diseases including metabolic disorders, cancer, and mood disorders. Beyond benefits, its therapeutic activity is inconclusive in terms of types, intensity, and individual training status, and this could be a major research for prescribing exercise as a therapeutic strategy. Exercise and its myriad forms occupy the space on clinical recommendation, which implies that quantifiable benefits of the same have been proven. Further, the benefits of exercise and its impact have also been found to have a genetic underlying interaction, which has created a niche of personal genomics, wherein apart from diet, an exercise regimen also becomes tailorable for every individual. Many subjective well-being reports highlighted daily exercise to keep mental and general health in excellent conditions, and the uncertainties around it. Thus, adopting an exercise behavior and inculcating it as a routine has been recommended. Further, the kind of benefit that can be extracted out of exercise and training is to a great extent influenced by genetic markers around fat, obesity, hunger, as well as satiety. Genetic markers can also impact the body temperature during exercise, making the entire experience of training either comfortable or unpleasant. Thus, there is an overwhelming amount of scientific evidence that has gathered around the benefits of exercise, which has become a pressing need from the 21st century when the belief in the value of exercise started waning, and that spiked up the era of lifestyle and noncommunicable ailments.
Introduction
Physical exercise has a proven and documented effect on mortality, wherein its preventive impact on diseases like cancer has entitled it to be therapeutic, beyond a healthy habit. For example, exercise has been demonstrated to cause 60% reduction in tumor incidence and growth in several mouse models, and this may be due to exercise-induced influx of immune cells in tumors (
Kujala et al., 1998
;
Idorn and Straten, 2017
). The longevity benefit of exercise has also been proven in large cohort studies that found adherence to physical activity (PA) recommendations to be beneficial (
McGLory et al., 2018
). Further, the exercise-induced longevity benefits threshold is obtained at a level three to five times higher (450–750 min/week) over the minimum recommendations among adults (
Arem et al., 2015
). The first PA recommendation guidelines were released in the year 2008 by the federal government, which recommends that a 150–300 min of moderate-intensity or 75–150 min of vigorous-intensity of aerobic exercise can provide substantial health benefits (Physical Activity Guidelines Advisory Committee). Studies have also assessed the impact of environment toward the development of exercise tendency in childhood, wherein influence of parents, peers, and coaches have been documented toward contribution for a motivational climate (
Allen and Hodge, 2006
;
Keegan et al., 2009
). Studies have also discussed intrinsic and extrinsic motivation models, wherein parents are the global influence, whereas peers and coaches exert motivation in both contextual and situational levels (
Vallerand, 1997
). Exercise has also been reviewed and proven as a promising adjunct intervention for mood disorders, including bipolar and major depressive disorder (MDD) (
Hearing et al., 2016
). However, several factors of exercise are inconclusive such as type, intensity, duration, and training status of the individual, thus recommending exercise as major therapeutics to prevent or control diseases has bigger challenges. Therefore, this review focuses on the benefits of exercise from psychological response to genetics.
Psychological Impact of Exercise
Exercise has been evaluated as an adjunct intervention for mood disorders including MDD and bipolar disorder. The Healthy Body Healthy Mind Feasibility Study involved engaging youth between 15 and 25 years of age with MDD in a multimodal exercise intervention plus usual care to evaluate the magnitude of impact on psychological, physical fitness, and biomarker outcome. The exercise program involved a single session of motivational interviewing to enhance adherence, followed by a 1-h exercise session three times a week for 12 weeks. Depression assessment was done at 12 weeks by the Beck Depression Inventory, the mean scores of which showed a decrease from 31.9 ± 9.1 to 13.1 ± 10.1 (Cohen
d
effect size = 1.96). The positive impact highlighted by this study motivates recognizing the use of exercise as a powerful adjunct tool (
Adriana et al., 2020
). The prevalence of child and adolescent mental illness, including all mental disorders, was found to at 13.4% (
Polanczyk et al., 2015
). The updated World Health Organization (WHO) estimates on mental disorders identified the prevalence to be 22.1% (depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and anxiety) at any time point among conflict-affected populations. The age-standardized and mean-comorbidity-adjusted prevalence was 13% for mild forms and 4% for moderate forms (
Charlson et al., 2019
). MDD is the third greatest disease factor for disease burden the world over, and with the existing psychosocial and pharmacological intervention, the rate of relapse of the quality and functioning of life among affected has been recorded to be impaired (
Rapaport et al., 2005
). Scientific reports have demonstrated moderate to higher intensity exercise as an effective adjunct treatment for improving depressive symptoms (
Lawlor and Hopker, 2001
;
Daley, 2008
;
Schuch et al., 2016
). The association between depression and quality of life has been well established, and even with pharmacological treatments, less than 50% on adequate dose experience significant clinical response (
Sinyor et al., 2010
). The underlying mechanism of action involving exercise as an intervention for anxiety and depression includes regulation in the production of the brain-derived neurotropic factor, hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis, neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, D-β-hydroxybutyrate, and the GSK3β/β-catenin pathway. The HUNT cohort study involving a healthy cohort of 33,908 adults was followed up for 11 years and it identified regular leisure-time physical activity (LTPA) to reduce the incidence of depression (
Harvey et al., 2018
). Further, postadjustment for confounders, the population attributable fraction suggested that when the relationship is assumed to be causal, 12% of the future cases of depression becomes preventable by engaging in at least 1 h of PA every week, thus proving that LTPA of any intensity becomes protective against future depression (
Manger and Motta, 2005
). Aerobic exercise has also been studied in relation to symptoms of PTSD. Studies that examined the impact of a 12-week aerobic exercise program involving 30 min of jogging/walking between 60 and 80% maximum heart rate indicated a significant reduction in the symptom of PTSD. Another study involving 33 PTSD-affected were subjected to 2 weeks of stationary biking aerobic exercise of six sessions, and 89% of the participants reported significant reductions in severity after 2 weeks (
Fetzner and Asmundson, 2014
). With reference to studies on depression, a dose-dependent relation between exercise and depression scores have been found. One such study assessed the benefit of low-frequency exercise involving one aerobic session/week compared with high-frequency exercise involving three to five aerobic sessions/week and found a significant reduction in depression scores among participants in the latter group (
Legrand and Heuze, 2007
). Thus, promoting exercise in primary care centers, based on guideline recommendations, can provide scientifically proven benefits for a wide range of mood disorders and work as an effective adjunct for symptom management.
Impact of Genetics on Exercise Benefits
The physiological as well as psychological impact of different forms of exercise and physical exercise has been associated with key genetic markers, which can modulate the outcome to a great extent (
Figure 1
). Scientifically established relation exists between risk genetic markers and their impact on attenuation by exercise regimen tailored as per impact linked genetics. To cite an example, one study among Taiwanese adults assessed the impact of aerobic exercise and badminton on levels of high-density cholesterol and its relation with the genetic variant rs328 in the lipoprotein lipase gene. This study involving 3,742 men and 4,071 women between the ages of 30 and 70 were subjected to no exercise, aerobic exercise, and badminton. Individuals engaged in the aerobic and the badminton exercise group exhibited higher levels of good cholesterol, high-density lipoproteins (HDL), and were also carriers of the rs328 genotypes (
Nassef et al., 2020
). Studies have also investigated the impact of genetic variants in leptin (
LEP
) and
LEP
receptor (
LEPR
) on habitual PA, and the body composition response to a unilateral upper body resistance training (RT) program. The variants rs2167270, rs1137100, rs1137101, rs1805096, and rs8179183 were studied. Carriers of the GG genotype of rs2167270 exhibited more kcal per week in vigorous-intensity PA and sports recreation compared with “A” allele carriers. In case of RT carriers of the
LEPR
“G” allele for variant rs1137101 exhibited greater gain in arm muscle and subcutaneous fat volume (
Walsh et al., 2012
). The fat mass and obesity-associated gene (
FTO
) is the first and widely studied obesity loci identified through genome-wide association studies. The variant rs9939609 has been widely reported, wherein each additional minor allele increases the risk of obesity by 20–30% (
Frayling et al., 2007
). Studies have correlated the impact of PA to attenuate obesity risk through
FTO
variant rs9939609. One such metaanalysis study, involving 45 studies on adults and nine on children, identified the minor allele “A” of rs9939609 to increase odds of obesity by 1.23-fold/allele. Further, the risk was also shown to be attenuated by PA, wherein the risk odds reduced to 1.22/allele, when compared with the inactive group with odds risk as 1.30/allele, thus exhibiting a risk reduction of 27% among the physically active (
Kilpeläinen et al., 2011
).
FIGURE 1

Physical exercise influences physiological, psychological, and genetical changes, which results in producing various benefits, including preventing metabolic and mood disorders.
Aerobic exercise benefits on physiology among sedentary adults have also been evaluated with genetic markers. One such study involved participants in a 30-min submaximal aerobic exercise session and found two variants in the
FTO
gene,
viz
rs8044769 and rs3751812, to change positively during exercise (
Karoly et al., 2012
). The
CREB1
gene variants,
viz
rs2253206 and rs2360969, were linked to change in body temperature during exercise and with maximal oxygen capacity (VO
2
max). The variant rs1379659 (
SLIT2
gene) and rs1935881 (
FAM5C
gene) were linked to changes in norepinephrine during exercise, whereas the
OPRM1
variant rs1799971 was linked to changes in norepinephrine, lactate, as well as the rate of perceived exertion during exercise. This highlights the impact of genetic markers in determining the outcome and benefit of aerobic exercise (
Cagnin et al., 2019
). Studies have also identified heritability to affect VO
2
max response to exercise training by 47% (
Jones et al., 2016
). More than a dozen genetic variants have been linked to exercise-related traits and outcomes, and this paved way for the development of genetics-based algorithms for personalized training programs. One such study report highlighted an algorithm that facilitated the achievement of better results in response to high- and low-intensity RT program by predicting the potential of the athlete for power and endurance by studying 15 genetic markers linked to performance. This algorithm development included two studies involving athletes from different sports and soccer players who were subjected to 8-week low- and high-intensity RT with genetically matched and mismatched. The athletes in the matched group exhibited a significant increase in countermovement jump (CMJ;
p
= 0.0005) and aerobic 3-min cycle test (Aero3;
p
= 0.0004), whereas those in the mismatched group hardly exhibited any improvement. Further, among the soccer players, the matched group exhibited better improvement in CMJ and Aero3 (
p
< 0.0001). The frequency of nonresponders in this study was found to be 82% from the mismatched group. This reiterates the effectiveness of genetically-tailored exercise programs (
Jones et al., 2016
). Study literature till date reports on the presence of 36 genetic markers from mitochondrial DNA, Y chromosome, as well as autosomal genes to be linked to elite athlete status, whereas 39 genetic markers from 19 genes and mitochondrial DNA have been linked to interindividual variability in response to endurance/strength training (
Ahmetov and Rogozkin, 2009
). These findings highlight the significance and need to include genetic signature analysis when utilizing exercise as an intervention for risk, disease, as well as treatment management in known cases.
Conclusion
The benefits of long-term exercise, which include better endurance capacity, stamina, as well as improved oxygen supply to the muscles, have been well documented. However, the kind of benefit that can be induced to alter the genetic status of the individual, including genetic markers are less reported. Genetic markers can also impact the body temperature during exercise, making the entire experience of training either comfortable or unpleasant. Thus, there is an overwhelming amount of scientific evidence which has gathered around the benefits of exercise, which has become a pressing need from the 21st century when the belief on the value of exercise started waning, and that spiked up the era of lifestyle and noncommunicable ailments.

Summary
Regular exercise is one of the best things you can do for your health. It has many
benefits
, including improving your overall health and fitness, and reducing your risk for many chronic diseases. There are many different types of exercise; it is important that you pick the right types for you. Most people benefit from a combination of them:
Endurance, or aerobic,
activities increase your breathing and heart rate. They keep your heart, lungs, and circulatory system healthy and improve your overall fitness. Examples include brisk walking, jogging, swimming, and biking.
Strength, or resistance training,
exercises make your muscles stronger. Some examples are lifting weights and using a resistance band.
Balance
exercises can make it easier to walk on uneven surfaces and help prevent falls. To improve your balance, try tai chi or exercises like standing on one leg.
Flexibility
exercises stretch your muscles and can help your body stay limber. Yoga and doing various stretches can make you more flexible.
Fitting regular exercise into your daily schedule may seem difficult at first. But you can start slowly, and break your exercise time into chunks. Even doing ten minutes at a time is fine. You can work your way up to doing the recommended amount of exercise.
How much exercise you need
depends on your age and health.
Other things that you can do to make the most of your workouts include:
Choosing activities that work all the different parts of the body, including your core (muscles around your back, abdomen, and pelvis). Good core strength improves balance and stability and helps to prevent lower back injury.
Choosing activities that you enjoy. It's easier to make exercise a regular part of your life if you have fun doing it.
Exercising
safely
, with proper equipment, to prevent
injuries
. Also, listen to your body and don't overdo it.
Giving yourself goals. The goals should challenge you, but also be realistic. It's also helpful to reward yourself when you reach your goals. The rewards could be something big, like new workout gear, or something smaller, such as movie tickets.

Abstract
Background
Obesity is a significant and growing public health problem in high-income countries. Little is known about the relationship between resistance exercise (RE), alone and in combination with aerobic exercise (AE), and the risk of developing obesity. The purpose of this prospective cohort study was to examine the associations between different amounts and frequencies of RE, independent of AE, and incident obesity.
Methods and findings
Participants were 11,938 healthy adults ages 18–89 years with a BMI < 30 kg/m
2
at baseline who completed at least 2 clinical examinations during 1987–2005 as part of the Aerobics Center Longitudinal Study. Self-reported RE participation in minutes/week and days/week was collected from a standardized questionnaire. Incident obesity was defined as a BMI ≥ 30 kg/m
2
at follow-up. Incident obesity was also defined by waist circumference (WC) > 102/88 cm for men/women and percent body fat (PBF) ≥ 25%/30% for men/women at follow-up in participants who were not obese by WC (
n =
9,490) or PBF (
n =
8,733) at baseline. During the average 6-year follow-up, 874 (7%), 726 (8%), and 1,683 (19%) developed obesity defined by BMI, WC, or PBF, respectively. Compared with no RE, 60–119 min/wk of RE was associated with 30%, 41%, and 31% reduced risk of obesity defined by BMI (hazard ratio [95% CI], 0.70 [0.54–0.92],
p
= 0.008), WC (0.59 [0.44–0.81],
p <
0.001), and PBF (0.69 [0.57–0.83],
p <
0.001), respectively, after adjusting for confounders including age, sex, examination year, smoking status, heavy alcohol consumption, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes, and AE. Compared with not meeting the RE guidelines of ≥2 d/wk, meeting the RE guidelines was associated with 18%, 30%, and 30% reduced risk of obesity defined by BMI (hazard ratio [95% CI], 0.82 [0.69–0.97],
p
= 0.02), WC (0.70 [0.57–0.85],
p <
0.001), and PBF (0.70 [0.62–0.79],
p <
0.001), respectively. Compared with meeting neither guideline, meeting both the AE and RE guidelines was associated with the smallest hazard ratios for obesity. Limitations of this study include limited generalizability as participants were predominantly white men from middle to upper socioeconomic strata, use of self-reported RE, and lack of detailed diet data for the majority of participants.
Conclusions
In this study, we observed that RE was associated with a significantly reduced risk of obesity even after considering AE. However, meeting both the RE and AE guidelines was associated with the lowest risk of obesity.
Author summary
Why was this study done?
Although many people know that aerobic exercises like brisk walking or jogging can help prevent obesity, it is not clear whether resistance exercises can also help prevent obesity.
This study was conducted to determine the relationship between resistance exercise and the risk of developing obesity, even after accounting for participation in aerobic exercise.
What did the researchers do and find?
We identified 11,938 adults without obesity who reported their participation in resistance and aerobic exercises as well as several other demographic and lifestyle variables.
Participants were followed for an average of 6 years to determine who did and did not develop obesity as determined by body mass index, waist circumference, and percent body fat.
Compared to individuals who did not perform resistance exercise (71% of participants), those who performed 1–2 hours/week or at least 2 days/week of resistance exercise had a 20%–30% reduced risk of obesity, even after adjusting for aerobic exercise.
Resistance exercise was associated with a reduced risk of obesity defined by body mass index, waist circumference, and percent body fat, although the strongest relationships between resistance exercise and obesity were consistently observed for obesity defined by percent body fat.
What do these findings mean?
Resistance exercise may reduce the risk of obesity, especially obesity characterized by higher body fat percentage.
These results suggest that resistance exercise should be promoted alongside aerobic exercise as part of comprehensive physical activity programs to prevent obesity.

Introduction
The prevalence of obesity in the United States (US) is projected to grow from 40% to 50% by 2030 [
1
,
2
]. This increase in obesity over the next decade would contribute to an excess of 8 million diabetes diagnoses, 7 million cardiovascular disease diagnoses, and 0.5 million cancer diagnoses [
2
]. Obesity is typically treated through lifestyle modifications, such as diet and exercise, that induce a caloric deficit. Modest weight loss (approximately 5% body weight) is associated with significantly improved cardiovascular and metabolic health [
3
,
4
]. However, more than 50% of individuals do not sustain a ≥5% weight loss for more than 5 years, highlighting the considerable challenges of treating obesity in the long term [
5
]. Considering the rising obesity rates, the comorbid and costly diseases that often follow obesity, and the difficulty of sustained weight loss, identifying effective strategies that prevent obesity in the first place is critical.
There is strong evidence that physical activity (PA), particularly aerobic exercise (AE; e.g., running), helps prevent weight gain [
6
]. However, the relationship between resistance exercise (RE), a major component of the US physical activity guidelines [
7
], and obesity is not clear. In general, RE is associated with a lower prevalence of obesity from cross-sectional studies [
8
–
10
]. RE is also often included as part of weight-loss trials to preserve metabolically active lean (muscle) tissue [
11
,
12
]. Thus, the available evidence suggests that RE may also be an effective obesity prevention strategy, although there are limited data.
Body mass index (BMI) ≥ 30 kg/m
2
is the most commonly used metric to define obesity [
13
,
14
], but BMI has a clear limitation in that it provides no information on body composition and adipose distribution. Investigating other adiposity measures, such as waist circumference (WC) or percent body fat (PBF), may have valuable clinical implications and allow a more comprehensive understanding of the relationship between RE and incident obesity. Therefore, we investigated 3 adiposity measures (BMI, WC, and PBF) in this study. The purpose of this study was to examine the long-term associations between RE, independent of and combined with AE, and incident obesity in a large cohort. We hypothesized that RE would be independently associated with a reduced risk of developing obesity, but that combined AE and RE would be associated with the lowest risk of obesity.
Methods
Study participants
This study is reported as per the Strengthening the Reporting of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (STROBE) guideline (
S1 STROBE Checklist
). Participants were 15,094 men and women 18–89 years old from the prospective Aerobics Center Longitudinal Study (ACLS) who had complete data from at least 2 clinical examinations at the Cooper Clinic in Dallas, Texas, during the period 1 January 1987 to 31 December 2005. Each clinical examination included anthropometric and body composition measurements. Participants were excluded if they had a history of heart attack, stroke, or cancer that would significantly affect RE participation and/or body weight at baseline (
n =
1,194) or if they had a baseline BMI ≥ 30 kg/m
2
(
n =
1,962). For the WC- and PBF-specific analyses, we further excluded participants if they had obesity defined by WC (
n =
2,448) and PBF (
n =
3,205), respectively, at baseline. The final samples included 11,938 in the BMI, 9,490 in the WC, and 8,733 in the PBF analyses.
Demographic characteristics (i.e., age and sex), lifestyle behaviors (i.e., smoking, alcohol consumption, and PA), and personal medical history (i.e., hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and diabetes) were determined using a standardized medical history questionnaire. Participants were categorized as either current smokers or never/former smokers. Heavy alcohol drinking was defined as >14 and >7 drinks/week for men and women, respectively [
15
]. Responses to the aerobic PA questions (e.g., frequency, duration) were transformed into metabolic equivalent (MET)–minutes/week, and participants were categorized into 4 AE levels based on whether they accumulated 0, 1–499, 500–999, or ≥1,000 MET-min/wk. Participants were also categorized as meeting the 2018 PA guidelines for AE if they accumulated ≥500 MET-min/wk of activity [
7
]. Hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and diabetes are common chronic conditions that may have a bidirectional relationship with weight gain [
16
,
17
]. Presence of hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and diabetes was identified through self-report of physician diagnosis or by measured values of blood pressure ≥ 130/80 mm Hg [
18
], total cholesterol ≥ 13.3 mmol/L [
19
], and fasting glucose ≥ 7.0 mmol/L [
20
], respectively. The Cooper Clinic Institute institutional review board provided oversight of the study, and written informed consent was obtained from participants at each time point. Additional details regarding the ACLS study sample and methods have been described previously [

Assessment of resistance exercise
Participants were asked if they were “currently involved in a muscle strengthening program,” and if so, they reported their average frequency (days/week) and duration (minutes) of RE at baseline. Exposure categories were based on the total amount (0, 1–59, 60–119, 120–179, or ≥180 min/wk) or frequency (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or ≥5 d/wk) of RE. Meeting the RE guidelines was defined as ≥2 d/wk [
7
].
Assessment of obesity
The primary outcome was obesity defined by BMI, WC, or PBF. BMI was calculated by dividing body weight (kilograms) by height (meters) squared. A BMI ≥ 30 kg/m
2
was considered obese for both men and women [
13
,
14
]. WC (centimeters) was assessed by trained researchers using an inelastic tape measure at the level of the umbilicus. Abdominal obesity was defined as having a WC > 102 cm for men or >88 cm for women [
24
]. PBF was determined through either hydrostatic weighing or skinfold measurements following standardized protocols previously described [
25
]. When both were available, PBF derived from hydrostatic weighing was used over skinfold estimates of body fat. Given there are no widely accepted risk categories or cut points for PBF, we followed the methods of previous studies in this cohort and considered ≥25% for men and ≥30% for women as PBF-defined obesity [
23
,
26
].
Statistical analyses
The ACLS was designed to examine the associations between various health indices and behaviors, specifically cardiorespiratory fitness and PA, and numerous health outcomes over time. All analyses were prespecified, but the study did not have a written analysis plan. Descriptive statistics of the sample were calculated by categories of weekly RE time. Cox proportional hazards regression was performed to compute hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for incident obesity defined by BMI, WC, or PBF across weekly RE times and frequencies. Follow-up time was calculated between baseline and the earliest follow-up exam when participants developed obesity (cases) or their last follow-up exam (non-cases). Cox regression was also used to test for linear trends across exposure groups by including RE exposure categories as continuous rather than categorical variables. Regression models were adjusted for age, sex, and baseline examination year in model 1; additionally for smoking status, heavy alcohol drinking, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, and diabetes in model 2; and then additionally for AE in model 3. Covariates were selected based on their inclusion in prior observational studies of PA and obesity as well as their recognized associations with PA and obesity [
8
,
26
–
28
].
Stratified Cox regression was also used to test the potential effect modification of RE on each obesity outcome by subgroups based on sex, age (<50 years or ≥50 years), current smoking, heavy alcohol drinking, presence of at least 1 chronic medical condition (i.e, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, or diabetes), follow-up time (<5 years or ≥5 years), and meeting the AE guidelines. Participants were also dichotomized into groups based on whether they met neither, either, or both the AE (≥500 MET-min/wk) and RE (≥2 d/wk) guidelines [
7
] to examine the joint associations of each combination of meeting the guidelines with incident obesity.
Finally, we conducted sensitivity analyses. In the first sensitivity analysis, we considered another common alternative cut point of ≥35% body fat for women in PBF analyses [
29
,
30
]. In the second sensitivity analysis, we investigated the potential effects of baseline body weight as well as baseline BMI, WC, and PBF by additionally adjusting for body weight (kilograms, continuous) in the final model or through stratified analysis, i.e., analysis of the association between RE and incident obesity stratified by categories of BMI, WC, and PBF. For the BMI-stratified analysis, participants were categorized as having normal weight (<25 kg/m
2
) or overweight (25–29.9 kg/m
2
) at baseline. For the WC-stratified analyses, strata were based on the risk categories for metabolic disorders identified by the International Diabetes Federation, where <80 cm for women or <94 cm for men is considered low risk, and 80–88 cm for women and 94–102 cm for men is considered moderate risk [
31
]. Since there are no well-established cut points for body fat percentages and health outcomes, a sex-specific median split of baseline PBF was used to define the lower and upper PBF strata. In the third sensitivity analysis, we investigated the effect of total energy intake (kilocalories) as a covariate in a subsample of 4,002 participants (34%) who had complete 3-day diet records available.
We tested the proportional hazards assumption by examining log–log survival plots grouped on the exposures, and no violations were found. All analyses were 2-sided with a significance level of
p <
0.05. Analyses were conducted using SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, US).
Results
The baseline characteristics of the sample by weekly RE time are shown in
Table 1
. On average, participants were 47 years old with a normal-weight BMI (mean = 24.8, SD = 2.7 kg/m
2
) at baseline. Most participants (71%) did not participate in any RE. After an average follow-up of 5.6 years (SD = 4.5; interquartile range 2–8), 874 (7%) of the 11,938 participants developed obesity defined by BMI. In the WC subsample, 726 (8%) of the 9,490 participants developed obesity defined by WC during an average follow-up of 5.6 years (SD = 4.5; interquartile range 2–8). In the PBF subsample, 1,683 (19%) of the 8,733 participants developed obesity defined by PBF during an average follow-up of 5.5 years (SD = 4.4; interquartile range 2–8).

We found similar results in the sensitivity analyses when we used the alternate PBF cut point of ≥35% in women. After additionally adjusting for baseline body weight in the final model, the association between RE and obesity defined by BMI was no longer significant (
p
> 0.05); however, the associations of RE with WC- and PBF-defined obesity outcomes remained significant. Stratified analyses based on subgroups of baseline BMI and WC indicated there were no significant interactions, with non-significant risk reductions ranging from 10% to 17% for obesity among the groups performing RE compared with no RE. The lower and upper 50th percentiles of baseline PBF were associated with significantly reduced risks of 24% and 18% of developing obesity, respectively, among the group who performed RE compared with no RE (
S3 Table
). In the subsample of 4,002 participants with total energy intake data, all HRs remained below 1.00, but the BMI and WC results became non-significant in all 3 models, before and after adjustment for total energy intake, possibly due to the smaller sample size. However, even with the smaller sample size, RE was associated with a significantly reduced risk of obesity defined by PBF in the final model (HR [95% CI], 0.76 [0.63–0.93]) after further adjusting for total energy intake.
Discussion
The primary finding from this study is that participating in RE was associated with 20%–30% reduced risk of developing obesity defined by BMI, WC, or PBF. A 20%–30% risk reduction is comparable to the 20%–30% reduced risk of cardiovascular disease observed when adults from the general population with average cholesterol levels are prescribed short-term statin therapy [
32
]. The associations between RE and obesity were consistent among various subgroups (e.g., men/women, older/younger participants) and persisted after adjusting for several potential confounders, including AE. Compared with no RE, performing RE for 1 to 2 h/wk (mean = 78 min/wk; median = 80 min/wk) was associated with the lowest risk of developing obesity, suggesting that additional amounts of RE might not be necessary to help prevent obesity. Meeting the current RE guidelines of ≥2 d/wk was also associated with a similar obesity risk reduction (20%–30%). In the joint analysis, meeting either AE or RE guidelines was associated with a significantly lower risk of obesity compared with meeting neither guideline, but meeting both guidelines was associated with the lowest risk of incident obesity.
A unique aspect of this study was the use of multiple adiposity measures, which revealed consistent, but somewhat nuanced, associations between RE and obesity. For example, high amounts of RE (e.g., ≥3 h/wk or ≥5 d/wk) were not associated with a reduced risk of obesity defined by BMI. However, these same high amounts of RE were significantly associated with a reduced risk of obesity defined by WC or PBF. Thus, it is possible that individuals regularly performing high amounts of RE and possibly increasing their muscle mass may be classified as obese according to BMI, which does not take into account fat distribution and body composition, as WC and PBF do. The dose–response associations between RE and obesity were the strongest for PBF, further highlighting the protective potential of RE against “excessive fat accumulation,” which is the physiological definition of obesity that may be more strongly associated with adverse clinical outcomes [
13
,
27
,
33
,
34
]. There is preclinical evidence supporting the notion that regular RE may increase the likelihood that a modest caloric surplus (e.g., consuming calories in excess of the body’s caloric requirements) will support lean mass growth (e.g., muscle hypertrophy) preferentially over fat tissue accumulation [
35
,
36
]. The robust associations between RE and obesity defined by PBF even in the various sensitivity analyses may also represent the important role that RE has in maintaining a favorable body composition, including maintaining/increasing lean mass and minimizing fat gain with age [
37
]. Maintenance of lean mass is particularly critical to prevent sarcopenia and maintain quality of life and independence in later life [
38
], which could also promote greater PA participation and better long-term weight management.
Since there are limited prospective observational studies on RE and incident obesity, we are unable to directly compare our findings with other studies. However, in our earlier cross-sectional study in a nationally representative sample of nearly 400,000 US adults, we found that more frequent RE was associated with a lower prevalence of obesity [
39
]. Likewise, a cross-sectional study in a national sample of 1.7 million US adults found that meeting either the RE or AE guidelines was associated with lower prevalence of obesity, and the lowest prevalence of obesity was observed among those who met both guidelines, which is similar to our findings [
8
]. Another cross-sectional study found that the prevalence of obesity was significantly lower among women who met both guidelines compared with those who met only the AE guidelines [
9
], which aligns with our joint analysis results suggesting that those who met both guidelines had a lower risk of obesity when those who met only the AE guidelines were the reference. Our findings are also consistent with a prospective study in over 10,000 men that found AE and RE were inversely associated with WC changes over 12 years, although incident obesity was not assessed [
28
]. Finally, in our earlier study in men, we found that muscular strength, a fitness parameter often used to reflect recent participation in RE, was linearly associated with a reduced risk of WC- and PBF-defined obesity [
26
].
There are several potential mechanisms through which RE might help prevent obesity. RE may increase basal metabolic rate, which constitutes the largest portion of daily caloric expenditure [
40
,
41
]. This is because RE helps preserve or increase metabolically active lean mass (e.g., muscle) that typically decreases with age [
37
]. Performing RE also requires increased caloric expenditure, although not typically to the same magnitude as an equivalent duration of AE [
42
]. However, RE increases basal metabolic rate for up to 24 hours after an exercise session [
43
,
44
]. The prolonged effects of RE on basal metabolic rate may partially explain why those who met only the RE guidelines and those who met both the AE and RE guidelines had relatively lower risks of obesity than the those who met only the AE guidelines. Furthermore, RE may stimulate muscle hypertrophy, which has been found to cause reductions in fat mass, potentially due to increases in glycolysis and fat oxidation throughout the body [
45
,
46
]. This may explain why the associations between RE and obesity were weaker using BMI as the outcome, which takes into account only crude body mass, including muscle.
Limitations
This study has the following limitations. First, generalizability is limited as participants were primarily white, non-Hispanic, and well-educated individuals of middle to upper socioeconomic standing, so the results cannot be generalized to more diverse populations [
47
]. However, the homogeneity of the sample minimizes the potential effects of differences in race or ethnicity, education, and income on the results, which are factors associated with obesity [
1
,
48
,
49
]. Furthermore, the prevalence of RE participation in this sample is similar to that in other nationally representative data [
50
,
51
]. Second, the results are likely influenced by unmeasured confounding factors such as mental health or time spent in sedentary behaviors; of particular note is the lack of dietary data for the entire sample, since diet is a strong contributor to weight gain and obesity. In the subsample of 4,002 participants with diet data, adding total energy intake as a covariate did not change the associations between RE and obesity, although many results, even in the basic model, were not significant, possibly due to the smaller sample size. Also, 11,439 participants (96%) had available data on “number of meals per week,” which was significantly correlated with total energy intake (
p
< 0.001) in the dietary data subsample. When including meals per week as a proxy for total energy intake in the final model with the larger sample size, the associations between RE and obesity outcomes remained either significant or not significant as they were in the primary analyses, suggesting that the potential confounding effects of diet-related factors on the associations were similar across the RE groups. Research generally shows that food consumption patterns are fairly stable within individuals although there have been population-level patterns of increased caloric consumption over time that would be similar across all participants in all groups [
52
,
53
]. Nonetheless, more active individuals tend to have healthier diets [
54
,
55
], so our results should be interpreted with caution. To provide more robust estimates of the associations between RE and obesity in the future, large observational studies may want to consider using a more rigorous dietary data collection method, such as the Automated Self-Administered 24-Hour (ASA24) Dietary Assessment Tool developed and supported by the National Institutes of Health [
56
]. Third, this study used self-reported PA as the exposure, which is typically overestimated compared to objective measures [
57
]. Thus, it is possible that the associations between RE and obesity in this study could be underestimated compared to results derived using objective measures of RE, although objective methods to assess RE participation at the population level are extremely limited at this time. Furthermore, our measure of RE did not capture perceived intensity of RE, which may also affect the observed associations. Other demographic and lifestyle variables such as smoking and alcohol consumption were also self-reported and could be prone to recall or social-desirability bias. Finally, this was an observational study, indicating that causal relationships between RE and obesity cannot be inferred.
A major strength of this study is its prospective design, which allowed us to examine the long-term association of RE with incident obesity in a large population, which has not been previously reported. The ACLS has data on objectively measured BMI, WC, and PBF in both men and women, which expands upon many previous studies that used solely BMI. However, it should be noted that WC measured at the umbilicus in this study may underestimate the true waist circumference compared to other measurements (e.g., top of iliac crest). Our large sample also has detailed data on both weekly total amount and frequency of AE and RE, making it possible to compare the relative importance for the risk of obesity of meeting the AE and RE components of the 2018 PA guidelines.
Conclusions
Obesity in high-income countries including the US has been increasing at an alarming rate over several decades. We found that RE was independently associated with reduced risk of developing obesity using 3 adiposity measures (BMI, WC, and PBF). Specifically, meeting the 2018 RE guidelines of ≥2 d/wk or 1–2 h/wk of RE was associated with a reduced risk of developing obesity regardless of whether individuals met the AE guidelines. While it is still not clear if RE alone is sufficient to reduce the risk of developing obesity at the population level, these results clearly suggest that performing both RE and AE may be the best approach to prevent obesity. However, 71% of participants reported no engagement in RE. This might be due to the fact that in contrast to AE, RE has rarely been a focus of PA promotion [
58
]. There may also be additional perceived or actual barriers that RE requires a gym membership, expensive equipment, or more instruction or education to perform it safely, and indeed, our previous study showed that those with a gym membership were more likely to meet the RE guidelines [
59
]. However, effective and practical RE can be performed with minimal equipment (e.g., resistance bands) or body weight exercises with simple guidance that is freely available through a variety of sources (e.g., online instructional videos). Future studies as well as health promotion strategies should consider these potential barriers in order to determine the relative effectiveness and accessibility of various RE programs (e.g., body weight exercises and weight machines) to improve health, manage weight, and prevent chronic disease.

Fitness is a broad term that can mean a lot of different things to different people. For some, it can mean a fitness program and for others, it can refer to their fitness level. But regardless of whether you are considering improving your personal fitness level or looking for an effective fitness program, the key is that fitness is a vital part of an active, healthy, and balanced lifestyle.
Plus, there are a number of
benefits to incorporating fitness into your daily life
. Physical exercise can boost your energy, reduce the risk of health problems, and improve mental health.
So, whether you are just embarking on your fitness journey or you are a seasoned exerciser, you will find trusted information here on working out safely and effectively and making physical fitness a part of your everyday life.
Frequently Asked Questions
What is fitness and why is it important?
Generally speaking, fitness involves not only defining your exercise goals and executing your plan, but it also refers to your level of fitness or the measure of your physical abilities like
endurance
, strength, balance, and flexibility. In other words, your fitness level is unique to you, as it is your body's ability to withstand a physical workout and recover in a timely manner.
Exercising consistently is one of the most important ways you can improve your fitness levels. In fact, regular physical activity not only impacts your physical strength, heart function, and endurance, but it also can improve your brain health, help you manage your weight, and reduce your risk of disease. It also can
strengthen your bones
and muscles and improve your ability to complete everyday tasks and activities.

6 Weeks to Fitness for Absolute Beginners
How much exercise should you get each day?
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), adults should get at least 150 minutes of
moderate-intensity activity
or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity activity—or a combination of the two—each week. Examples of physical activity include walking, running, swimming, and cycling.
The CDC also recommends that two days a week, you work to strengthen your muscles. Whether that involves using bodyweight exercises, dumbbells, gym equipment, or
resistance bands
, these activities should work all the major muscle groups of your body—legs, hips, back, chest, abdomen, shoulders, and arms. What’s more, these muscle-strengthening activities should be done in addition to your physical activity.

For instance, you should choose some endurance or aerobic activities to help improve your heart and lungs as well as some strength or

5 Health-Related Components of Fitness
Key Terms
Strength Training
Cardio Exercise
FIIT Principle
Strength Training
Strength training—which is sometimes referred to as resistance training or weight training—is a form of exercise intended to
increase muscular strength
and endurance. It involves exercising muscles using some form of weight or resistance such as your body weight, hand weights, machines, and more.
Strength training is designed to increase your strength and endurance, but it has a number of other benefits, too, like increasing bone density,
boosting metabolism
, building muscle, and even improving mental health.
What Is Strength?
Cardio Exercise
Cardio, also known as cardiovascular exercise, is generally any activity that increases your heart rate. Whether that is walking, running,
cycling
, dancing, or swimming, these rhythmic activities help to strengthen your heart and lungs. What’s more, cardio has a number of health benefits.
Aside from improving heart function and lowering blood pressure, consistently fitting cardio into your weekly routine can help you sleep better, improve cognitive function, and boost your overall sense of well-being. The Physical Guidelines for Americans recommend that you fit in about 150 minutes of moderate physical activity each week.
What Is Cardio?
FIIT Principle
The FIIT principle—which stands for frequency, intensity, time, and type of exercise—is a guideline you can use to revise and improve your workout plan. When evaluating and creating your workouts, you will need to consider these four elements. Doing so will help put you on the path to achieving your fitness goals.
Additionally, these principles can be used to evaluate your existing fitness program and determine where changes need to be made. Sometimes, you will need to
adjust your program
—especially if you have hit a plateau—by making sure the elements of your workout are still meeting your physical needs.

Do You Need to Lose Weight?
SMART Goals
Achieving Your Goals
Sample Plan
Figuring out how much weight you want to lose is the first step on a new weight loss journey. There are many different ways to come up with a long-term goal that's both realistic and aspirational. Setting your sights on the future can help fuel the motivation needed to make healthy changes. Here's how to get started.
Do You Need to Lose Weight?
A lot of people feel like they should lose weight, even if that's not always the case. It's not uncommon to have an unrealistic view of what a healthy weight really is. There are broad parameters to determine whether weight loss is recommended for health reasons. In general, a good candidate for weight loss may have the following measurements:
BMI
: Greater than 25
Waist circumference
:
Abdominal girth
measurement of more than 35 inches in women and 40 inches in men
Waist to hip ratio
: Higher than 0.8 for women and higher than 1.0 men
Body Mass Index (BMI)
is a dated, biased measure that doesn’t account for several factors, such as body composition, ethnicity, race, gender, and age.
Despite being a
flawed measure
, BMI is widely used today in the medical community because it is an inexpensive and quick method for analyzing potential health status and outcomes.
If you're losing weight for your health, a modest goal of 5% to 10% of your current weight can begin to improve important markers like blood pressure and blood sugar levels.
Other benefits of even a moderate weight loss can include more energy, a boost in self-confidence, improved fitness, and better mobility.
However, sometimes our goals are based on other factors, like the desire to fit back into old clothes or look a certain way. As long as our goals are realistic and don't veer into a dangerous underweight category, there's nothing wrong with setting a vanity goal.
Together with your health care provider, you can decide whether or not it's a good time to set a weight loss goal.
How to Set and Plan Weight Loss Goals
SMART Goal Setting
The key to
setting weight loss goals
is to follow the standard of goal setting, which means it needs to be SMART. A SMART goal stands for the following characteristics:
Specific
: Be clear about your intention by putting some numbers and details into your goal.
Measurable
: How will you keep track of your progress? Will you measure body weight, waist circumference, or exercise performance?
Attainable
: Do you have the time, resources, and motivation to reach your goal?
Realistic
: It's OK to set an ambitious goal as long as it's possible and within reach.
Time-bound
: Set a deadline for your goal. Break it up into shorter-term milestones to stay on track for the long haul.
The main thing to remember is that sustainable weight loss takes time.
How to Set and Plan Weight Loss Goals
Achieving Your Goals
Once you've determined that you're ready to lose weight, you'll need the proper tools to set your plan in motion. Keep in mind that a
healthy rate of weight loss
is 1 to 2 pounds per week.
Losing weight at this slow and steady pace gives you the best chance of maintaining your progress long term.
It's helpful to get an idea of how many
calories
your body requires to lose or maintain weight. This weight loss calculator will help you set a
daily calorie target
to achieve your weight loss goals.
This calorie deficit can be achieved through a combination of mindful eating and increased physical activity. Focus on making healthy choices each day and give it time to see progress on the scale or in your body measurements. Consistency is the key to success. Also, it can be helpful to track your progress and jot down new goals along your weight loss journey in
a fitness journal
.
Creating a Calorie Deficit in Your Diet
Sample Weight Loss Plan
Here's what a sample weight loss plan (using SMART goal objectives) might look like:
Mary is 5'7" tall and weighs 160 pounds. Her goal is to lose 10 pounds in 12 weeks. To do that, she would need to cut back or burn off 300 to 500 calories each day. Using a combination of healthy eating and exercise is the best way to lose weight since dieting alone can cause you to lose muscle mass.
Muscle mass is more metabolically active than fat (meaning it burns more calories).
Keeping the muscle you have and building more through resistance training will help support your ultimate weight loss goals.
Mary's plan to reach her goals:
Replace her morning Egg McMuffin (300 calories) with a bowl of oatmeal (about 180 calories).
Replace one Coke (150 calories) with sparkling water (0 calories).
Walk for at least 30 minutes at 3.5-4.0 mph, 3 days a week (approx. 180 to 240 calories burned).
Strength train
2 days a week for 30 minutes (approx. 140 to 280 calories burned)
With this plan, Mary will create a calorie deficit of 270 to 550 calories each day (depending on whether she exercises). By measuring her weight each week or so, she can determine if these changes are sufficient to get her to reach her long-term goals.
Calculating the Calories Burned During Exercise
Looking at this example, you can see that these are fairly modest changes. Mary isn't revamping her entire life, she's simply picking a few things she can change to get started.
What's interesting is that, as she continues with her healthy behaviors, she may start to do even more, not just because she wants to lose weight but because she's going to start feeling better, stronger, more confident.
Try breaking down your goal into specific steps like this and track your progress. Just remember to adjust your plan if your results start to stall or if you are struggling to be consistent.

A Word From Verywell
If you're
not losing weight
as quickly as you had hoped don't get discouraged. Remember, your goal needs to be attainable, so be willing to adjust and set new goals if the old ones aren't working for you. Even a little bit of progress can benefit your overall health and well-being. Focus on small changes that add up over time.

How Our Review Board Process Works
Every article created by our team of expert writers that contains verifiable facts or medical information makes its way through our comprehensive Review Board process and gets assigned to a specialist based on their area of expertise. Even our custom illustrations go through the Review Board.
When you see this check mark on a Verywell Fit article, you can trust it meets the high standards of our Review Board.
The Verywell Fit Review Board members confirm each piece of content they review is up-to-date, thorough, and authoritative—containing unbiased facts and guidelines that reflect the latest in evidence-based research (not just the latest fads), as well as practical healthy living advice you can use right away.
If the Review Board suggests improvements, those are shared directly with our editorial staff so our editors can make any changes needed. Once a piece of content is approved, it receives the Review Board stamp in the byline—and you’ll know exactly who reviewed it and when.

Independence and Impartiality Policy
Verywell Fit is committed to independent, impartial, fair journalism. Our editorial content is not influenced by our advertisers. Every Dotdash Meredith staff member and contributor is held accountable to a high standard of honesty and transparency.
We maintain a strict separation between advertising and editorial content. Our “Sponsored Content” is labeled to make clear that such content is provided by or on behalf of an advertiser or sponsor.
In line with our mission to provide useful information that helps people find answers, solve problems, and get inspired, we are dedicated to publishing unbiased, comprehensive reviews of products and services. Our product and service reviews are wholly independent and based on robust research and product testing. When readers visit “affiliate links” within our content, Dotdash Meredith may receive commissions from purchases, but we never receive any compensation or consideration for the content of our recommendations.
Dotdash Meredith writers and editors are prohibited from giving preferential treatment to any outside resource (company, publication, video, affiliate, website) based on their relationship with the person or company who authors or owns that resource.
All of our writers and editors are responsible for disclosing any potential conflicts of interest—any relationship, financial, or personal, with any source or resource that may compromise their ability to provide fair and impartial information.
As with many publishers, our writers and editors are sometimes provided with complementary products or services for review purposes. We are transparent and disclose when any valuable products or services are provided to our editorial teams. Our editorial staff and editorial contributors must not solicit gifts or services for personal purposes.
Originality Policy
Our goal at Verywell Fit is to provide original, useful, and unbiased content. All information must be verified, properly attributed, and may not infringe the copyright or anyone’s intellectual property rights. Any suggestion of plagiarism is investigated fully and is grounds for dismissal.

Accuracy and Corrections Policy
The accuracy of our verified information and news articles is core to Verywell Fit.  So too is our commitment to accountability to our readers and transparency about our accuracy and corrections practices.
Our rich library of “evergreen” educational service content is routinely updated, reviewed by our professional review boards, and fact-checked to ensure ongoing publication of accurate, complete, relevant, and up-to-date useful information. Following our rigorous and systematic updating and verification process, articles in our content library are date-stamped to indicate to readers that the information is complete and accurate. News articles often cover a distinct event in time and are not part of our routine update process.
At Dotdash Meredith, we are committed to telling readers when an error has appeared, and to correcting it. When we discover a significant error of fact, we will correct the article as quickly as possible and append a correction note. All corrections will be clearly labeled, dated, and include information about what was corrected.
We welcome our readers’ participation in our ongoing commitment to accuracy and fact-checking.

Our Editorial Process
There’s no one-size-fits-all model for healthy living. Let us help you find a way to eat well and stay active that works best for you, wherever you are on your journey.
The small, everyday choices you make about your diet, fitness, and overall well-being have the power to transform your life. But that doesn’t mean they’re always easy to sustain. We understand you’re an individual with specific goals and we’re here to support you with trusted information and tools to help you feel your best.
Online searches for nutrition or exercise topics can be overwhelming and result in a black hole of bogus fads and false claims. You need easy-to-understand and credible advice that cuts through the clutter—advice that’s written by experts who know what they’re talking about and who genuinely care. Every year, we help 120 million people who come to Verywell Fit seeking answers to their health questions.
It’s our duty and responsibility to make sure you’re getting science-backed facts with clear, actionable steps suited to your needs. We work hard to break down complex health terms, reflect the latest research, and present the most accurate information in a way that motivates you to take an active role in your diet and fitness. We’re here to cheer you on, not scare you off.
Our mission is simple—empower you to reach your diet and fitness goals.
Subject-Matter Expert Writers
Our writers are notable voices in their respective disciplines, from registered dietitians to certified personal trainers to physicians. These leading experts are specifically selected for their extensive knowledge and real-world experience, as well as their ability to communicate complex information in a clear, helpful, and unbiased way.
At Verywell Fit, we aspire to provide the highest quality content produced by humans, for humans. It is against our guidelines to publish automatically generated content using AI (artificial intelligence) writing tools such as ChatGPT.
Diverse Voices
We have a renewed commitment to help all people navigate their health and well-being—regardless of race, gender identity, sexual orientation, age, religion, culture, geography, body type, ability, or experience. We are invested in working with BIPOC health writers, Review Board members, expert sources, illustrators, photographers, and more to create, edit, and enhance our content—not just on isolated topics of race, but across our brands’ coverage. Read
Verywell’s Diversity and Inclusion Pledge
to learn more about our promise of diversity, inclusion, and equity.
Editorial Team
Our highly-skilled editorial team manages all of the content you read. Each individual article has several people behind it working to make sure it’s responsible, accurate, understandable, helpful, trustworthy, comprehensive, up-to-date, and inclusive.
Review Board
The Verywell Fit
Review Board
, comprised of board-certified physicians, registered dietitians, personal trainers, and more, vet content containing statements of medical fact or health claims. They work tirelessly to provide the necessary critique that guarantees our information is accurate and current.
Content is assessed by a reviewer whose specific area of expertise aligns with the content topic. A reviewer will confirm that a piece of content—whether article, illustration, video, tool, or other resource—is thorough and contains facts and guidelines that reflect the latest in evidence-based research and health information.
If improvements are suggested, they are shared directly with our editorial team to be addressed and implemented immediately. It is only when a reviewer approves a piece of content that it is officially stamped as such in the byline of an article.
Fact Check
Our team of qualified and experienced fact checkers provides a critical step in our commitment to content integrity. Fact checkers rigorously review medical statements, claims, and recommendations for accuracy and timeliness. We rely only on the most current and reputable primary references, including peer-reviewed medical journals, government organizations, academic institutions, and advocacy associations. Sources are listed both inline and at the bottom of every article.
News
Now, more than ever, people are going online for their news. It is our responsibility to ensure that every piece of news published on Verywell Fit is held to the highest standards of clarity, accuracy, thoughtfulness, and trustworthy reporting.
We rely on primary sources, input from credentialed medical experts, and a team of conscientious news writers and thorough fact checkers to provide you with the latest and most important updates in the world of fitness and nutrition. From groundbreaking research to the latest guidelines, Verywell Fit goes beyond breaking news—we provide the context and insights needed to keep you and your family informed.
References, Sources, and Citations
We fact-check medical statements, claims, and suggestions with the most current primary references, including peer-reviewed medical journals, government organizations, academic institutions, and advocacy associations. Sources are listed both inline and at the bottom of every article.
(Verywell favors human research and proven treatments, though relevant animal research and experimental/alternative treatments may be reported if that’s all that’s available to promote an understanding of a topic.)
Up-to-Date Information
Times change and so does information. With help from our subject-matter experts and Review Board, our editorial team routinely evaluates our existing content every few months to ensure all information is updated and reflective of the most current research, guidelines, and statistics.
If needed, content is re-worked, re-edited, and re-certified by our Review Board. If you happen to come across any inconsistencies or outdated facts, please don’t hesitate to
reach out
.
The Verywell Voice
We pride ourselves on being part of the revolution that is redefining what “being fit” really means, and we make sure to infuse that into all of our content. The information, advice, and very words that we use are all rooted in one goal: to help you learn how to live a happier, healthier life that’s free of diet culture driven fads and weight phobic trends. And we do that by offering a space that cuts through all the complications, confusion, and unrealistic expectations that are perpetuated by today’s media.
It is vital to us that you feel supported along your health journey, and we take that responsibility very seriously. To learn more, read about

Verywell’s 2025 Diversity and Inclusion Pledge
January 7, 2025
To our readers—
It’s important to us that we’re providing you with accurate, reliable health information, and that you feel welcome no matter what your background is.
As a health website that reaches more than 38 million readers per month, we are uniquely positioned to create positive change. That starts with covering topic areas we have ignored, empowering voices we have neglected, and representing those we have overlooked. Our goal continues to be creating inclusive content that spans the geographic, racial, gender, and body diversity of our readers.
Since 2020, we have focused on these three areas: building a diverse team of contributors, reviewing and updating our content, and creating partnerships. We recommit to that in 2025.
People: We will recruit and amplify Black, Indigenous, People of Color (BIPOC) staff and contributors across Verywell.
In order to be the most complete and inclusive health information and news resource, we must have a diverse group of people working on Verywell.
We have made a concerted effort to increase the number of people of color (POC) sharing their voices on our sites, but there’s room for improvement. We will work with more BIPOC health writers, Medical Expert Board members, expert sources, illustrators, and photographers, to create and enhance our content—not just on isolated topics of race, but across our brands’ coverage.
This work includes improving our recruiting initiatives to ensure equality of opportunity for roles at Verywell. We expect, over time, to see that outcome in the makeup of our staff and contributors.
We are committed to reaching our goal of at least 25% BIPOC staff. BIPOC staffers currently make up 17% of the Verywell Health, Verywell Mind, Verywell Family, and Verywell Fit teams. This includes editorial, commerce, sales, research, and marketing.
Additionally, we aim to gather and report on accurate contributor demographics quarterly. We’ll do this by maintaining our database of contributors and a consistent and comprehensive response rate from these freelancers.
Content: We will improve the inclusivity and representation in our written and visual content.
Dotdash Meredith’s
Anti-Bias Review Board
was formed in 2020 to review and evaluate content bias and inclusivity. We regularly work with the Anti-Bias Review Board to ensure that our content and images continue to reflect the diversity of our readership and modern society.
The Anti-Bias Review Board has provided us with anti-bias editing guidelines, including guidance on making pregnancy and menstruation content gender-inclusive, removing ableist language, remediating stigmatizing language, and highlighting disparities in access to care. These learnings continue to promote the ongoing education of our staff and contributors on the issues of diversity and inclusion.
Together with the Anti-Bias Review Board, we will continue to identify specific areas of improvement in the topic areas we cover and update and remediate content to be accurate, affirming, and inclusive of more experiences and identities.
On Verywell Fit, we focus on addressing weight bias across all of our content. We have revised
our core values
to reflect this and are actively working with our review boards to talk about weight, bodies, and BMI in a more inclusive manner. We've published a dedicated
Diet Culture taxonomy
, which explores all topics related to weight bias, body positivity, and weight neutrality.
We pledge to review and remediate articles that account for 10% of our traffic with the Anti-Bias Review Board, in addition to the 33% reviewed in 2024 and 54% already reviewed in 2023. This includes a focus on editing articles to update language, errors, oversights, and incorrect information.
We will also continue to maintain diversity in the visual assets of our content library, including illustrations, photographs, and videos for new content.
Community: We pledge to explore and develop partnerships with other brands, organizations, and leaders that promote inclusivity within the health industry.
Over the past four years, we’ve partnered with organizations including
Let's Talk Menopause
,
WomenHeart
,
The White Dress Project
, and
Allergy & Asthma Network
as part of our Health Divide series on health inequities. We will continue to pursue partnerships with a variety of organizations to spotlight their work and share stories of real people across all backgrounds and life experiences.
Our Pledge to You
Our pledge and commitment to these goals are part of the ongoing work of our team to listen, learn, and help our readers best care for their physical and mental health.
In order to do so, our team will remain dedicated to building an anti-racist brand and community, recognizing the racial inequalities that impact the core content we create, and taking actions to address inaccuracies and narratives that harm the most vulnerable among us.
Please continue to hold us accountable and trust that we are doing the same within our team. We want to hear how you feel you are, or are not, represented in what you see across the Verywell brands. Your feedback is valuable and helps us continue to improve and grow, with the aim of working together, not creating shame that may cause more division.
Please email us at
contact@verywellfit.com
.
We make these changes today and we will remain committed to them tomorrow and every day that follows. Thank you for being a part of the Verywell community and joining us in our efforts to do better.
Sincerely,
The Verywell Editorial Team

What are Our Third-Party Data Collection and Online Advertising Practices?
General
We, and our third-party partners, use information that we receive about you (e.g., that you provide to us or about your use of the Services, or that we receive from third parties) to serve advertisements more relevant to your interests, the content on which the ads will appear, or audiences similar to you, to optimize marketing and advertising campaigns more broadly, as well as to generate analytics and provide marketing/advertising-related services such as reporting, market research, and measurement/attribution. These third-party partners may include online advertising networks or exchanges, measurement/attribution companies, ad fraud verification companies, social media companies, or other advertising technology services (e.g., demand-side or sell-side platforms, ad servers, clean room providers).
How We Collect This Information
The information used for these advertising practices is typically collected through tracking technologies, such as cookies, web beacons/pixels, SDKs, APIs, embedded scripts, location-identifying technologies, logging technologies, and similar technologies, which recognize the device you are using and collect information, including clickstream information, browser type, time and date you visited the Sites, mobile ad ID or other digital identifier (e.g., iOS IDFA, Google AAID, cookie ID, click ID, other proprietary IDs such as open-source “universal IDs” or other ID solutions), geolocation, and other information, such as the advertising/advertising measurement data discussed further above in this Privacy Policy.

We may share this information using mechanisms such as API, direct file upload, server-to-server transfer, or integrating the tracking technologies of those partners (e.g., pixel).

We display targeted advertising to you through social media platforms, such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, LinkedIn, and other social media platforms.  For example, these companies have interest-based advertising programs that allow us to direct advertisements to users who have shown interest in our services while those users are on the social media platform, or to groups of other users who share similar traits, such as likely commercial interests and demographics.  As mentioned in the section above, we may share a unique identifier, such as a user ID or hashed or encrypted email address or phone number, with these platform providers or they may collect information from our website visitors through a pixel (or other mechanism, such as API, direct file upload, or server-to-server integration), in order to direct targeted advertising to you or to a custom audience (including “look-a-like” audiences, such as audiences that are similar to you or other users) on the social media platform.  These advertisements are governed by the privacy policies of those social media companies that provide them.  If you do not want to receive targeted ads on your social networks, you may be able to adjust your advertising preferences through your settings on those networks.

Opt-Out Rights
Under State Privacy Laws, you have the right to opt-out of “sales” and “shares” of personal information, “targeted advertising,” and certain use/disclosure of “sensitive” personal information.

Further, under certain State Privacy Laws, you may appeal our decision to not take action on your rights request. All appeals should be submitted by emailing
privacy@dotdashmdp.com
, along with a copy of the decision that you are appealing.
Authorized Agents
In certain circumstances under the State Privacy Laws, you are permitted to use an authorized agent to submit requests on your behalf (using the mechanisms for submitting requests above), to the extent we can verify the authorized agent’s authority to act on your behalf.
For requests to access, delete, or correct personal information, we may require the following for verification purposes:
(a) a power of attorney from you or your authorized agent that is valid under the laws of the applicable state where you reside; or
(b) sufficient evidence to show that you have:
provided the authorized agent signed permission to act on your behalf; and
verified your own identity directly with us or directly confirmed with us that you provided the authorized agent permission to submit the request on your behalf.
For requests to opt-out of “sales,” “shares,” or the processing of your personal information for “targeted advertising” under the State Privacy Laws, we may require a signed permission demonstrating your authorized agent has been authorized by you to act on your behalf.
Deidentified Information
Where we process “deidentified information” (as such term is defined under the State Privacy Laws) and are required to keep such information deidentified, we commit to maintain and use the information in deidentified form and will not attempt to reidentify the information, except in instances where necessary for determining whether the deidentification process we used satisfies the requirements under applicable law.

Fitness is a broad term that can mean a lot of different things to different people. For some, it can mean a fitness program and for others, it can refer to their fitness level. But regardless of whether you are considering improving your personal fitness level or looking for an effective fitness program, the key is that fitness is a vital part of an active, healthy, and balanced lifestyle.
Plus, there are a number of
benefits to incorporating fitness into your daily life
. Physical exercise can boost your energy, reduce the risk of health problems, and improve mental health.
So, whether you are just embarking on your fitness journey or you are a seasoned exerciser, you will find trusted information here on working out safely and effectively and making physical fitness a part of your everyday life.
Frequently Asked Questions
What is fitness and why is it important?
Generally speaking, fitness involves not only defining your exercise goals and executing your plan, but it also refers to your level of fitness or the measure of your physical abilities like
endurance
, strength, balance, and flexibility. In other words, your fitness level is unique to you, as it is your body's ability to withstand a physical workout and recover in a timely manner.
Exercising consistently is one of the most important ways you can improve your fitness levels. In fact, regular physical activity not only impacts your physical strength, heart function, and endurance, but it also can improve your brain health, help you manage your weight, and reduce your risk of disease. It also can
strengthen your bones
and muscles and improve your ability to complete everyday tasks and activities.

6 Weeks to Fitness for Absolute Beginners
How much exercise should you get each day?
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), adults should get at least 150 minutes of
moderate-intensity activity
or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity activity—or a combination of the two—each week. Examples of physical activity include walking, running, swimming, and cycling.
The CDC also recommends that two days a week, you work to strengthen your muscles. Whether that involves using bodyweight exercises, dumbbells, gym equipment, or
resistance bands
, these activities should work all the major muscle groups of your body—legs, hips, back, chest, abdomen, shoulders, and arms. What’s more, these muscle-strengthening activities should be done in addition to your physical activity.

How Much Exercise Do You Really Need?
How can you improve your fitness?

This means selecting activities you enjoy and are able to do consistently. Plus, research indicates that most people benefit from doing a variety of things in order to improve their fitness.
For instance, you should choose some endurance or aerobic activities to help improve your heart and lungs as well as some strength or
resistance training
activities to help your muscles get stronger. Even adding in some balance and flexibility exercises can help improve your fitness level.

5 Health-Related Components of Fitness
Key Terms
Strength Training
Cardio Exercise
FIIT Principle
Strength Training
Strength training—which is sometimes referred to as resistance training or weight training—is a form of exercise intended to
increase muscular strength
and endurance. It involves exercising muscles using some form of weight or resistance such as your body weight, hand weights, machines, and more.
Strength training is designed to increase your strength and endurance, but it has a number of other benefits, too, like increasing bone density,
boosting metabolism
, building muscle, and even improving mental health.
What Is Strength?
Cardio Exercise
Cardio, also known as cardiovascular exercise, is generally any activity that increases your heart rate. Whether that is walking, running,
cycling
, dancing, or swimming, these rhythmic activities help to strengthen your heart and lungs. What’s more, cardio has a number of health benefits.
Aside from improving heart function and lowering blood pressure, consistently fitting cardio into your weekly routine can help you sleep better, improve cognitive function, and boost your overall sense of well-being. The Physical Guidelines for Americans recommend that you fit in about 150 minutes of moderate physical activity each week.
What Is Cardio?
FIIT Principle
The FIIT principle—which stands for frequency, intensity, time, and type of exercise—is a guideline you can use to revise and improve your workout plan. When evaluating and creating your workouts, you will need to consider these four elements. Doing so will help put you on the path to achieving your fitness goals.
Additionally, these principles can be used to evaluate your existing fitness program and determine where changes need to be made. Sometimes, you will need to
adjust your program
—especially if you have hit a plateau—by making sure the elements of your workout are still meeting your physical needs.
