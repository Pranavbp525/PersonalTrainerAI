Reporting Guidelines
Men's Health
asks all editors and writers to follow strict reporting protocols to ensure the accuracy of all information reported in the magazine and on site. Studies must be reviewed before being cited in stories, and all factual information must be attributed to a reliable source. Editors rely on interviews with expert sources to substantiate all articles, and each story is reviewed and fact-checked by at least two editors before being published. Articles are then regularly reviewed and updated to include the newest information available on the topic.
.
Generative AI Policy
While we are big believers in technology that helps us innovate and makes our work better, all editorial content produced by
Men's Health
is human-generated by the editors shown above. We never use AI to report or write or fact-check, although it may be used for research purposes. We’ll continue to monitor the development and uses of these tools across the industry.
.
Editorial Independence
Men's Health
receives support from advertisers. However, all content is produced independently. Any content produced in conjunction with an advertiser, or paid for by an advertiser, is clearly marked as such on the site.
.
Affiliate Links
Men's Health
participates in affiliate marketing programs—meaning that purchases made by readers who visit our site and then go to retailers and products recommended by our editors may result in paid commissions. The products we feature are always chosen by editors based on brand standards.

This Lower Body Workout Will Jump Start Your Body Recomp Goal
This Lower Body Workout Will Jump Start Your Body Recomp Goal
We're giving you Day 1 of our Ultimate Body Recomposition Workout, a leg day designed to build big-time muscle.
By
Andrew Gutman
Published: Jan 30, 2025 2:25 PM EST
Save Article
THERE ARE MANY
ways to train, but it’s tough to beat the basics if you’re striving to build muscle and lose body fat at the same time. That lofty goal is called
body recomposition
, which you
can
accomplish using the right plan. Take the leg day below, provided by
Men’s Health
’s fitness director
Ebenezer Samuel, C.S.C.S.
as part of our Body Recomp
Ultimate Workout video
.
The workout is built upon a foundation of tried-and-true muscle-building principles. You’ll use
compound movements
to target multiple muscles at once, lift heavy weights within a rep or two of failure to stimulate
hypertrophy
(muscular growth), and rest long enough to ensure you can tackle each set with ferocity. As long as you’re
consistently eating
in a slight
caloric deficit
, you’ll build new muscle tissue while slowly stripping body fat from your frame.
This is just Day 1 of the whole plan, which runs for four weeks. To access the entire program, you'll have to be a
Men's Health
MVP Premium
member.
Body Recomposition Workout Details
Expect to spend anywhere from an hour to an hour and 15 minutes in the gym for this workout, delegating about half that time to rest—a key to getting the most out of this session. Before you screenshot this workout and give it a try, there are a few things you should know:
Stick to the rest time recommendations
. Below, you’ll see rest times as short as zero to 30 seconds and as long as two and a half minutes.
Research
has shown that both short (less than 60 seconds) and long (more than a minute) rest times are effective for building muscle, but longer rest times will allow you to lift heavier weights for your next set. Which brings us to the next point:
Lift heavy weight
. One of
the keys to building muscle
is using heavy weights—that's especially true if you’re eating in a caloric deficit, according to Samuel—so choose a load that has you reaching failure within the rep range of your final set. And by failure, we mean
technical failure
, which is defined as not being able to do another repetition with perfect form.
Use
lifting straps
. The goal of this workout is to stimulate your muscles for growth, not lifting as much weight as possible. Grip strength will usually be the first point of failure in these heavy lower body lifts; your back and hamstrings will always be able to support more weight than your forearms. We suggest you
use lifting straps for this routine
to remove your grip from the equation so you can focus on hitting the muscles you’re actually trying to train.
The Day 1 Body Recomposition Workout
FIRST EXERCISE:
Barbell Romanian Deadlift (RDL)
The RDL is a hip hinge movement that hits your back, hamstrings, glutes, and taxes your core. Samuel advises that perform this movement with a barbell, so you can load up as much weight as you can handle. “Think of your first two sets where you’re building to that top set where you’re going to go as heavy as you possibly can for six to 10 good reps,” he explains.
How to Do It:
Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and abs engaged, holding a barbell with both hands.
Hinge forward, pushing your hips back and lowering your torso. Stop when your torso is parallel to the floor or your hamstrings are tense.
Pause, and then return to the start. That's 1 rep.
Sets and reps:
3 sets of 6 to 10 reps; 2 to 2:30 minutes rest each set
SECOND EXERCISE:
Dumbbell Walking Lunge
You’ll move onto a quad-dominant movement next—and we’re not talking about the back squat. Instead, Samuel wants you to perform walking lunges. “I want you to use heavy dumbbells…think about going up to 40-, 45-, even 55-pound dumbbells on each side,” he says.
Why the lunge and not the squat? “In real life, I don’t get to stand here, talk to you, and never move," he says. "We want to do something in the gym where we’re going from place to place and getting in that locomotion and acceleration.”
How to Do It:
Hold a dumbbell in each hand. Wear lifting straps so your grip isn’t a limiting factor of how much weight you can lunge,
Take a step forward and simultaneously squat down, driving the knee of your lead leg over your toes. Both of your legs should form roughly 90-degree angles.
Drive up, bringing your back leg forward so it’s in front of your lead leg.
Sets and reps:
3 sets of 6 to 10 reps per leg; 90 seconds rest each set
THIRD AND FOURTH EXERCISE:
Leg Extensions and Seated Leg Curl
You’ll end the workout by isolating the muscles in your quads and hamstrings, using machines and minimal rest times to really push your limits. If you don’t have access to a seated leg curl machine, you can use a lying leg curl machine—but Samuel likes the seated machine as it “leaves a lot less room for you to cheat and involve other muscles.”
How to Do It:
Set both the seated leg curl and leg extension so the ankle and knee pads are properly aligned with your joints.
Start with the seated leg curl. Lean forward so your legs are extended and you feel a deep stretch in your hamstrings. Hold onto the handles and curl your legs as far as the machine will let you. Slowly raise your legs until they’re extended, holding the stretched position for one second. Do 10 reps, and then rest briefly as you move to the other machine. seconds.
Sit in the leg extension machine. Lean back to extend your range of motion and place more tension on your quads. Extend your legs until they’re completely straight. Take two to three seconds to lower the weight. That’s one rep. Do 10 reps and then rest 30 seconds before returning to the leg curl.
Sets and reps:
3 sets of 10 to 12 reps for both exercises; 0 to 30 seconds rest between each exercise

BICEPS CURLS ARE
a top-tier muscleman exercise. Step foot into any self-respecting gym, head to the free weight floor, and watch for just a few minutes. Inevitably, someone will grab a set of dumbbells and get to pumping. But doing the same movement over and over gets stale—and there are different factors lifters can tweak to level-up their arm day workouts. One reliable way that pump-chasers can put a new spin on their curl session is by taking on an underrated variation that will allow you to pull double-duty to train the forearms, too. We're talking about the Zottman curl.
The Zottman curl isn't some hyper-technical, new-age innovation, either. The exercise has been around since the 19th century, when old-time strongman George Zottman developed it to target the biceps,
brachialis
, and forearms in one go.
Once you put it into practice, you'll reap even more gains out of your curl workout. The catch: you'll have to be patient and focus on all phases of the lift. You should already do that with every exercise, but it's even more important with the Zottman curl, which has a different orientation for the
concentric and eccentric parts
of the movement.
To master the subtleties of the exercise, take notes as
Men’s Health
fitness director
Ebenezer Samuel, C.S.C.S.
and senior editor
Brett Williams, NASM-CPT
reintroduce you to this classic double-powered arm-builder.
How to Do the Zottman Curl
Stand holding a pair of dumbbells in a neutral position. Squeeze your shoulder blades and glutes while using your abs to drive your ribcage down and closed.
﻿Curl the dumbbells up, rotating your palms and turning your pinkies upward, squeezing your biceps at the top.
Pause for a count, then twist the dumbbells forward so your palms are facing out, rotating only at the forearms. Fight to keep your elbows still as you move your wrists.
Lower the weights back down to the starting position slowly, taking two or three seconds.
Men's Health

Benefits of the Zottman Curl
Unlike most other curls, which only directly target the biceps muscles (and in some cases like the
hammer curl
, the brachialis), the Zottman curl is designed to engage your forearms as well. Direct forearm training  is too often ignored in standard workout splits, which is unfortunate since the muscles are essential for proportionately-developed arms and because strong forearms are the key to a strong grip.
To target your forearms, you'll need to turn your palms and emphasize the eccentric (lowering) portion of the lift. Once you flip your palms, you'll be in the right spot. Along with giving your forearms some much-needed attention, this focus will also help you to slow down for the eccentric phase, a principle you should apply to other exercises to keep yourself from rushing, too.
﻿﻿You also make this a true biceps
isolation exercise
﻿, since you'll focus on pausing and emphasizing the squeeze at the top of the lift. Don't skimp on this aspect of the exercise just because you'll also be training your forearms.
﻿Muscles Worked By the Zottman Curl
Like other curls, the Zottman is a great way to target your biceps muscles. But you'll also hit your forearms—more specifically, your brachioradialis muscle. That will come once you rotate the weights at the top of the first part of the movement, then will be emphasized with the slow eccentric descent.
Common Zottman Curl Mistakes  ﻿﻿
The most common mistake here is moving too fast. “If people are going to curl up, they're going to twist quickly and they're going to lower down way too quickly, then you lose that eccentric effect, you don't get the most out of curl,” Samuel says.﻿
﻿Make sure that you move slowly with each step—lift and supinate, squeeze your biceps at the top, rotate slowly, then lower on a two to three second count. Never just drop the weight. If you can't control your descent, use lighter dumbbells.
﻿How to Add the Zottman Curl to Your Workouts
Since this is a forearm-focused movement, don’t try and lift heavy with this accessory move. Grab weights that are 10 to 15 pounds less than you normally would in a curl for about eight to 10 reps.
“You don't want to have to rush through a bunch of reps,” Samuel says. “I'd rather you get eight to 10 good reps and really appreciate that eccentric—feel it in your forearms and feel it in your biceps.”

BELIEVE IT OR
not, the skullcrusher isn't the name of a pro wrestler's signature move. It's actually a classic muscle-building exercise to isolate the triceps, the big muscles on the back of your arms. As beloved as the skullcrusher is, there's one key component missing in the way that even the most seasoned gym-goers approach the movement. Thankfully, there's a simple way to fix that flaw.
Most guys do skullcrushers with free weights, using dumbbells or barbells to perform the movement. These tools allow you to have "great tension when our triceps are stretched," says
Ebenezer Samuel, C.S.C.S.
,
MH
fitness director. But there's a catch: "Unless our form is perfect and our upper arm is leaning just the right way, we don't often get that squeeze at peak contraction," he continues.
A simple implement swap can fix that. Set this move up with a cable machine and incline bench instead of free weights and a flat bench, and your triceps will get that extra stimulus at the top of the squeeze—a vital portion of muscle growth. Here's how.
How to Do the Cable Skullcrusher:
Men's Health
Bring the attachment point of the cable machine down to its lowest setting and clip on a rope attachment. Set up a bench so that the top of it is close to the cable machine and adjust to a 15 degree angle.
Lie down on the bench, but extend your legs so you're situated higher up. This will allow you to pull your wrists down and back without hitting the head of the bench. Drive your feet into the ground and contract your glutes and abs, creating full body tension.
Grab onto the rope closer to the base.
Keeping your palms facing each other, bend the elbow down and back to find that stretch through the triceps. Lower your wrists as close as you can to your shoulders based on your mobility.
Squeeze up until your elbow is fully extended, keeping it stacked on top of your shoulder. Don't allow them to flare outward.
Squeeze for one to two seconds before lowering back down.
Benefits of the Cable Skullcrusher
AT THE TOP
of dumbbell or barbell skullcrushers, the wrist and elbow stack on top of the shoulder, aligning with gravity. You lose tension across the muscle when this happens, unless you perfectly situate your form so that your elbow is a bit past your shoulder. That can work, but it's tough to properly evaluate your form in this position.
Using a cable machine allows tension to maintain throughout the entire exercise, creating the proper stimulus for muscle and strength building. Plus, you'll be able to get a little deeper into the stretch on the triceps. When done with barbells and dumbbells, the equipment is likely to hit your forehead before you get sufficient stretch.
One important note: This variation is best deployed as a compliment to the free weight skullcrusher within your routine, not as a wholesale replacement. You'll be able to use heavier weights with dumbbells and barbells, so keep a place for those variations in your program.
What Muscles Power the Cable Skullcrusher?
LIKE A TRADITIONAL
skullcrusher, the cable variation hammers both heads of the tricep: the long and short head. The shoulder muscles will help stabilize the position of your upper arm, and your core will help brace the rest of your body.
How to Add the Cable Skullcrusher to Your Workouts
IF YOU'RE FACTORING
this in as an accessory move on a full upper body day, think about keeping it lighter with more reps. Aim for 3 sets of 10 to 12 reps. If you're using it as a lead move or in a super set, try 3 sets of 8 to 10 reps with a heavier weight.

How to Do Strict Curls for Smarter Biceps Training
How to Do Strict Curls for Smarter Biceps Training
This exercise helps to reinforce perfect form so you'll reap even more gains when you get a pump.
By
Brett Williams, NASM
Published: Jul 16, 2024 5:12 PM EDT

WE LOVE
BICEPS
curls
. The weight room staple one of the simplest, most reliable exercises any given gym-goer has in their tool kit for building arm muscle (not to mention one of the quickest paths to
a pump
). But as much as we love the curl, there's denying it's also one of the most abused moves when it comes to form. Guys will swing, hike, and row the weights up to eke out reps—and that won't result in the gains they want. To keep your form (and results) on point, add the strict curl to your routine.
The strict curl does what the name implies: Puts your body into a position from which you'll be forced to move using only strict form. That might mean that you won't be able to work with the same heavy weights you do when you're using not-so-buttoned-up form—but the reinforcement will yield results.
There's more to the strict curl that just backing up against a wall and raising weights up—there's a whole second variation using a cable machine. Take these cues from Men's Health fitness director
Ebenezer Samuel, C.S.C.S.
and senior editor
Brett Williams, NASM
to learn how to strict curl for next-level gains.
How to Do the Strict Curl
﻿THERE ARE TWO
variations of the strict curl you can use to level-up your form.
The Wall Strict Curl
How to Do It:
Grab a pair of dumbbells and stand against a wall, with your feet shoulder-width apart. Lean into the wall, maintaining three points of contact: squeezing the shoulder blades, driving the shoulders into the wall, and putting your butt on the wall.
Squeeze your abs and glutes to create full-body tension. The back of your arms should be pressed against the wall.
Moving only at the elbows, curl the weight up as high as you can. Pause and squeeze your biceps at the top.
Lower the weight back down with control.
Cable Strict Curl
﻿﻿
How to Do It:
Sit down on the floor in front of a cable machine. Getting into the start of a situp position. Your feet should be flat on the floor, with your knees bent. Hold the machine's handle in both hands so that there is some tension in the cable. You elbows won't be in contact with the floor, but that's okay.
Moving only at the elbows, curl the weight up. Pause at the top and squeeze, actively squeezing the biceps.
Lower the cable back down under control.
Benefits of Strict Curls
﻿THE STRICT CURL
reinforces good curl form, which can be important for beginners when they're first learning and more experienced trainees who've lost focus. Far too often, exercisers get sloppy, and either swing or row the weights up to count heavier reps than they can handle with proper, fundamental form. The biceps curl should be all about elbow flexion, and that means moving only at the elbow joint. When you introduce the body positions of the strict curl, you'll get closer to that ideal. And with better form comes better size and strength gains.
Which Muscles Strict Curls Work
﻿LIKE OTHER CURLS
you'll be training your biceps. Your forearms will also be involved, especially if you focus on really squeezing the handles of the weights. The
brachialis
, the muscle that lies beneath the biceps that helps to give the arm muscles a "3D look," are hit as well.
When you really dial-in your form, there are two muscle groups that you'll contract
isometrically
. These are you abs and your rhomboids. Your abs will help you prevent arching your back and using your hips, while your rhomboids will keep your posture on point.
Common Curl Mistakes
﻿YOU NEED THE
strict curl to address the major mistakes lots of guys use when they train the biceps from standard stances. The two most common of these are hinging at the hips, which often leads to using the lower body to produce power,  and curling with the elbows behind the torso, which can turn the movement into a row.
How to Add the Strict Curl to Your Workouts
﻿ADD THE STRICT
curl to your arm day workouts when you need to reinforce good form. Start with 3 sets of 8 to 10 reps and emphasize the squeeze at the top of each rep.

Stop Doing These Time-Wasting Triceps Exercises. Do These Moves Instead.
Stop Doing These Time-Wasting Triceps Exercises. Do These Moves Instead.
Don't just follow gym trends if you want to build big arms.
By
Cori Ritchey, C.S.C.S.
Published: Jul 12, 2024 11:57 AM EDT
Save Article
YOU WON'T BE
able to
build big arms
without training smart. Getting the right muscle-pumping stimulus means doing more than hundreds of biceps curls—you'll need to target your triceps, too.
When you train those big upper arm muscles, you'll do much better if you know what you're doing. Smart training is much more than just following the social media hype train. "We can't just attack our triceps with the latest and greatest exercise off Instagram," says
Ebenezer Sameul, C.S.C.S.
"Very often those are the exercises that simply don't work."
You'll do much better for your big arm gains if you focus on fundamental, effective movements instead of just working out the way you see other guys in the gym and online. That's why Samuel is breaking down the five triceps exercises that simply aren't worth your time—and what to try instead.
5 Triceps Exercises You Need to Stop Doing
Cross-Body Skullcrusher
Even though Arnold does this move doesn't mean you should, too. The cross-body skullcrusher might isolate your triceps, but you could be putting yourself at risk of shoulder injury. The movement requires substantial
internal rotation at the shoulder
—a movement you want to avoid when possible.
Do This Instead: Classic Dumbbell Skullcrusher
Instead, stick to the standard
dumbbell skullcrusher
. Tuck your elbows in tight to the sides of your body, and get into external rotation. You'll still get the elbow extension you're looking for, without the long-term risks.
Weighted Bench Dip
"Yes, this is a great ego exercise, and it's certainly an exercise that you think you can do anywhere," Samuel says. "But again, we're running into this issue of internal rotation."
Add some plates to your lap, and that's a ton of tension at the wrong angle on your shoulder joint.
Do This Instead: Weighted Close-Grip Pushup
If you want to stick with a weighted exercise, try a weighted close-grip pushup. You're still getting the elbow extension you're looking for (and the ego-boost of loading on plates), but you'll be able to get it through a much better range of motion with less stress across your shoulders.
Dumbbell Kickback
The
dumbbell kickback
is great for getting a healthy squeeze on our triceps, but it's not working your triceps through its full range of motion. You only really start to hit tension when the dumbbell in your hand starts to fight gravity—at the bottom of the movement, absolutely nothing is happening for your triceps.
Plus, it's really easy to rock into position and use momentum to power the move.
Do This Instead: X Pressdown
Try the X pressdown instead. The movement is executed with a cable machine, so there's tension throughout the entire contraction. With the crossbody position, too, you get loads of mid-back squeeze.
Dumbbell Overhead Extension
The issue of internal rotation returns with the dumbbell overhead extension. Plus, once you reach the top of the movement, there's no more tension across the triceps once the joints get to a stacked position.
Do This Instead: Cable Overhead Extension
Instead of using a dumbbell, try swapping this out with a cable machine and an incline bench to support you. The cable overhead extension will give you a great stretch at the bottom, and the cable continues to apply pressure at the top as you squeeze.
Diamond Pushup
"The worst exercise when it comes to training your triceps is an exercise you think you can take anywhere but it just doesn't travel as well and just isn't as useful as you might think—and that is the diamond pushup," Samuel says.
The closeness of your hands here makes it very easy to slip into internal rotation, even if you are able to get a healthy squeeze on your triceps.
Do This Instead: Close-Grip Pushup
Correcting this exercise just takes a slight change of grip. Separate the hands out ever so slightly until they're a little closer than shoulder-width apart. You get all the benefits without placing your shoulders at risk.

This Workout Plan Helps You Train for a Spartan Race in the Gym
You'll prep for an obstacle course run by targeting the most common weak point for competitors: grip strength.

SPARTAN RACES ARE
anything but easy. That much is implied by the competition's namesake, the legendarily tough Greek city-state and its warrior ethos. Competitors run, jump, and climb through an obstacle-filled course, making normal road runs look like a walk in the park. Racers will need strength, stamina, and grit to make it through one of these contests in one piece.
There's one specific area where most competitors fall short on the course, according to
Spartan DEKA
co-creator/Senior Director
Yancy Culp
: grip and pull strength. The obstacles require racers to haul themselves up and over barriers and swing on ropes and monkey bars. Forearm and upper back fortitude is essential to crushing a Spartan race—and you can actually train to improve in that department without needing to recreate a full course at your local gym.
Culp has a simple two-part workout to hone your grip and pull strength, using vertical and horizontal pulling exercises and grip work. You'll also be able to scale these movements to adjust the level of difficulty depending on your ability, so this can be useful for exercisers from all walks of life.
Grab a towel or a rope, then loop it around a pullup bar for the
assisted pullups
. Use a Smith machine or a barbell placed in a rack at a challenging height for you for the
assisted rows
. For the
farmers carry
, make sure to grab weights that will challenge you without breaking your form.
The Spartan Race Prep Workout
Part I
Perform 10 reps, then rest as needed to reset. You can take longer than the five seconds Culp outlines in the clip above, but keep your non-working time to a minimum. For the next set, perform 9 reps. Continue down the ladder until you hit 5 reps.
Assisted Pullup
Assisted Row
Part II
Start by performing a
farmers carry
for 40 yards. Once you've finished the walk, move over to the pullup bar for a pair of assisted pullup reps. Rest, then repeat for 3 total rounds.

The Poliquin Raise Challenges Your Shoulders and Builds More Muscle
The Poliquin Raise Challenges Your Shoulders and Builds More Muscle
This two-part exercise lets you work with more weight to get more gains.
By
Jeff Tomko
and
Brett Williams, NASM
Published: Oct 18, 2024 1:38 PM EDT

WRAPPING AN UPPER
body workout with a few sets of
lateral raises
is a common tactic for guys aiming to build up strong shoulders. But there’s another underrated exercise that you should consider the next time you want to develop your delts while will give you an even better shoulder session: the Poliquin raise.
This variation, created by the late muscle scientist Charles Poliquin, allows you to use heavier weight than you would with a standard lateral raise to yield greater gains. The way you'll perform the moment will ratchet up the
time under tension
, too—another key for muscle growth.
The key, according to
Men’s Health
fitness director Ebenezer Samuel, C.S.C.S. and senior editor Brett Williams, NASM, is to pay attention to the finer points of the exercise.
How to Do the Poliquin Raise
Start standing holding a pair of dumbbells in a neutral grip. Raise the dumbbells so that your elbows are at a 90 degree angle, with the weights in front of your torso.
Lift your arms up to just below shoulder height, keeping your elbows bent. Keep your arms in the scapular plane (just in front of your torso rather than directly at your sides).
Pause for a beat, then straighten out your arms (this is the same position as a standard lateral raise).
Hold your arms extended for a second, then slowly lower your arms to your sides, taking three to four seconds.
Men's Health
Men's Health
Poliquin Raise vs. Lateral Raise
The
lateral raise
have long been a shoulder-shaping gold standard that work to pack on size to your delts. Performing the exercise is relatively routine: Raise your arms out in your scapular plane, hold for a brief pause, the lower back down with control.
The twist with the Poliquin raise, according to Samuel, is adding more time under tension while focusing on
the eccentric portion
of the movement (or lowering the weight) and fighting the resistance from gravity. “That's the challenge of the Poliquin raise,” Samuel says. “And by doing that, we're going to get to move even heavier weights than normal.” Cutting the raise changes your efforts drastically—but that allows you to focus your attention elsewhere.
The key to this is in the starting position. By beginning with your elbows at a 90-degree angle, you make the initial movement—the raise itself—more manageable. "Instantly, what we've done is we have cut our shoulder levers,” Samuel continues, “which places a lot less stress and tension on the shoulders.”
Once you straighten your elbows at the top of the movement, the lever has become much longer. That's when the real work begins as you resist gravity to keep yourself from just dropping your hands to your sides.
Muscles Trained By the Poliquin Raise
You'll train your lateral (or side) delts with the Poliquin raise, making this a key shoulder exercise.
Common Poliquin Raise Mistakes
The biggest mistakes you can make with the Poliquin raise is rushing the eccentric portion of the movement and using more load than you can control. You should be working with heavier weights than a standard lateral raise—but if you're not able to hold that eccentric contraction for three to four seconds, you're not making the most of the movement. Make sure that you lower down at that tempo for maximum gains.
How to Add the Poliquin Raise to Your Workouts
Since the Poliquin raise won’t be the heaviest exercise in your shoulder workout, it’s good to fit the exercise in toward the end of your routine, if not the final exercise to finish. “You've hit your heavy shoulder presses, you've done some lateral raises, maybe you've done some windmills, by now your shoulders are tired,” Samuel says. “This move allows to get in few extra of eccentric contractions at the end of your set."
Start with three sets of six to eight reps. Just focus on keeping that time under tension for three to four seconds, which could be up to 30 additional seconds of work per set.

fitness director. If you're just starting out in the gym, this move helps you understand and prime the proper shoulder blade movement you need to gain control of your back muscles. If you're a seasoned vet, the cable row also provides a safe way to stack on heavy weight.
Here, Samuel talks us through everything there is to know about the cable row. ﻿
How To Do the Cable Row
For many exercises, proper form is fairly rigid. There are rarely several ways to do a move correctly. That's not the case for the cable row. Depending on where you are in your fitness journey, there are two ways you can utilize this move to get achieve back gains.
Beginner
If you're just starting out, it's important to learn the movement of scapular retraction—the act of squeezing your shoulder blades back and down. This version of the cable row will help you do just that.
How to Do It:
Take a seat on the machine with your feet planted, a little wider than shoulder width. Drive the heels, and squeeze the glutes. Grab onto the cable handle.
Sit up tall with a slight bend through the knees. Tighten up the abs and low back to maintain a perpendicular angle to the floor with your torso.
Roll the shoulders back and down. Squeeze them together as you row, thinking about pinching a pencil in between them. As you do this, pull the handle back towards you, landing right above your belly button.
Pause here for a moment before returning the handle, still squeezing the shoulder blades. Once you've returned the weight to the stack, then allow the shoulder blades to relax, without pulling the torso forward.
Repeat to go for another rep.
Advanced
After a good two to three months of priming your rhomboid strength by working through the beginner version of the cable row, then you can move into a more complete range of motion with the advanced version. Similar movements, like the bent-over row, require you to keep the spine rigid to avoid placing stress across the lower back. With the seated cable row, you'll be able to stretch the spine and the lats to allow for a bigger range of motion through the pull.
Men's Health
How to Do It:
Take a seat on the machine with your feet on the holders, a little wider than shoulder width. Drive the heels, and squeeze the glutes. Grab onto the handle.
Lean slightly forward and round out the upper back. Think about pulling the shoulder blades apart as much as possible.
Aim to get a good stretch through the lats. As you row, pull the shoulder blades down, back, and together just as you did in the beginner version. Row the handle bar in, landing just above your belly button.
You should finish in the same position as the beginner row: perpendicular with the floor, spine straight, with the shoulder blades squeezed together.
Repeat to go for another rep.
Muscles Trained in the Cable Row
No matter which version of the seated cable row you're doing, you're going to narrow in on two of the major muscle groups in your back. The first one, the rhomboids, sit just between your shoulder blades, and pulls them together when activated. The second, the
latissimus dorsi
, or the lats, are big, fan-like muscles that run from the shoulders all the way to the pelvis.
But that's not all; the cable row is a sneakily effective exercise. Not only will you narrow in on your back muscles, but you'll also challenge your biceps and grip strength more than you'd think. Once you progress into the advanced version of the row, your low back extensors also play a role.
Benefits of the Cable Row
Builds Back Muscles
This movement really targets the rhomboids and lats, two of the largest back muscles in the body. It build strengths that translates into loads of other exercises, such as pullups and deadlifts. Building strength through our back muscles helps us maintain proper posture and protect the spine. The aesthetics of building a bigger back don't hurt, either.
Helps Shoulder Health
Understanding proper scapular retraction will help prevent potential
shoulder injuries
. When you pull your elbows back without pulling through the shoulder blades, you'll "create a shoulder girdle position that's going to invite the head of the humorous (the top of the shoulder) to travel forward, and this can be a mechanism for injury," Samuel says.
Takes the Low Back Out of Bent-Over Rows
The cable row mimics a similar movement pattern as the
bent-over row
, but flipped 90 degrees. Instead of placing our weight through our feet, we're seated. Being seated rather than standing takes out potential stress on the
low back
, allowing us to load on the weight and challenge our mid-back muscles even more.
Common Mistakes With the Cable Row
Progressing Too Quickly
Don't be afraid to utilize the beginner format for a number of months, "especially if you have a desk job," Samuel says. "You're saddled with years of poor shoulder blade movement, so being deliberate with how you move can help you build the critical muscle that will serve you later."
Control the Tempo and Stretch
In the advanced version of this move, people often move too quickly without deliberate movement. Think about stretching through the upper back as you stretch forward, not the lower. Stretching through the lower back too much can create a rocking motion you don't need. Take your time to think about it as you do it—don't rep these out as quick as possible.
Don't Lean Too Far Back
"Don't turn this into a deadlift," Samuel says. If you create a large angle with your torso relative to your thighs, you're working less mid-back and have transferred the work into your glutes and low back like you would in a deadlift. Finish the movement with your torso at 90 degrees relative to the ground.
How to Add to the Cable Row to Your Workouts
No matter which version of the cable row you use, this should always be a high volume exercise. Aim for 3 to 4 sets of 10 to 15 reps, Samuel says. Schedule the movement for your upper body or back-focused workouts.

5 Must-Do Exercises to Strengthen Your Lower Back
5 Must-Do Exercises to Strengthen Your Lower Back
Build up this essential spot for more overall strength.

Cori Ritchey, C.S.C.S.

IT'S EASY TO
forget about your lower back—until you get to the point
where it's hurting
. To avoid that pain, you need to be strengthening your core.
The core is
more than just your abs
, after all—it
enables movement and supports the spine
. Your
lower back is part of this muscle group
. But if you walk around the gym, you're more likely to see other guys repping out situps, crunches, and leg lifts to train the core. They're focused on targeting the
rectus abdominis
, or six-pack muscles. For a complete core workout, you should be targeting lower back muscles, too.
Worries about
pain and soreness of the low back
may divert people from actually targeting it, says
David Otey, C.S.C.S.
and
Men's Health
Advisory Board member. If we don't train this crucial spot, though, "the weakest point will begin to give out," which may cause more problems in the long run. Here, Otey and
Ebenezer Samuel, C.S.C.S.
,
MH
fitness director guide through 7 exercises we can add to our routine that will help strengthen the lower back.
5 Exercises Your Low Back Needs
45 Degree Extension
3 to 4 sets of 15 reps
Men's Health
The low back and the hips work in tandem, and this exercise emulates that. The key to allowing the hip to engage is ensuring that you maintain a bit of rigidity through the spine. Focus on not allowing your spine to round out so that almost all of your movement comes through low back and hip extension. "It's a baseline exercise to work on getting that lower back moving from folding forward to getting all the way up through extension, but it's going to play a huge role in a lot of other lifts that we do," Otey says.
It's important to identify the difference between the feeling of fatigue and the feeling of pain in this movement. It's safe and okay to work through feelings of fatigue, as that's how we gain strength. If there's any kind of shooting pain or aches, then see a specialist to get an individualized evaluation.
Bird Dog
3 to 4 sets of 8 reps on each side
Men's Health
There's value in simplicity. This is a simple movement that may not look like much, but it creates great baseline strength throughout the lower back. This will build stability throughout the spine and low back, ultimately allowing you to perform more athletically in other movements. This movements "sets the foundation" that allows us to add weight to other exercises down the road, Otey says.
"The goal here is basically to make the move look easy," Samuel says. Stay mindful through each bit of this motion, making sure that you're not allowing your hips to drop to one side when the leg gets extended out. Take your time to stay conscious about these things.
Good Morning
3 to 4 sets of 6 to 8 reps
Men's Health
The good morning is a hip-hinging motion that will place significant stress on the lower back when loaded up with a barbell or kettlebell. As you descend down, the low back has to work extra hard to maintain control of the force pressing against your mid-back by the weight. Similar to the bird dog, take these slow and steady to get a feel for loading weight.
Romanian Deadlift
3 to 4 sets of 8 to 12 reps
Men's Health
This is where things pop up a notch. We're going from loading just a little bit to being able to move big weight to build strength. The lowest portion of the movement, when the hips are flexed backwards, is when the most stress will hit the low back. Hang out in this position for a few seconds, Samuel says, to understand the tension being held before standing back up. That small portion of time is where you're going to build the most strength through your low back, as the glutes power a majority of the energy needed for the drive that returns you to standing.
Kettlebell Swing
3 to 4 sets of 30 seconds, aiming for 8 to 10 reps
Men's Health
The lower back supports more than just slow, steady lifts. Many quicker movements depend on it as well. Samuel notes that the lower back plays a big role in acceleration (the speeding up) and the deceleration (the slowing down) of the flexion and extension of our hips and spine. That makes the kettlebell swing a great exercise for training the dynamic aspect of low back strength.
The weight you're working with will determine how you approach your sets. If you have a lighter kettlebell, think about working for 30 seconds rather than aiming for a rep range. If you have a heavier kettlebell, only work to about 8 to 10 reps.
Side Planks
2 to 3 sets each side for 40 seconds
Just like the bird dog, the side plank will help you build a solid foundation. The strength of your oblique muscles, or the muscles along the sides of your core, contribute to the strength of your lower back. “Side planks strengthen the deep core muscles which strengthen the lower back by stabilizing the spine,” says
Dan Giordano
, P.T., D.P.T., of
Bespoke Physical Therapy
and
MH
advisor.
Side planks are a move you can do anywhere, anytime. Make sure the hips stay lifted, keeping the spine as straight as possible. If you’re just starting off, bring down the intensity by bending the bottom leg at the knee.
Glute Bridge Marches
2 to 3 sets for 12 to 16 alternating reps
Start with the basics before you jump into heavy deadlifts or squats—especially if you already experience some level of low back pain. Start with glute bridge marches, says Giordano. “Alternating leg lifts while maintaining a bridge position can help you improve pelvic stability, which helps strengthen the lower back.”
Get into a glute bridge position. Lift the hips, and slowly shift all your weight onto one side and pick up the other foot off the ground. Hold there for a second before slowly returning that foot to the ground. Take your time moving through the reps. Try to keep the hips as stable as possible as you swap legs.

How to Do the Cat Cow Stretch for Better Movement
How to Do the Cat Cow Stretch for Better Movement
This staple stretch can help you feel loose and ready to go. Make sure you know how to do it right.

EVERYONE COULD USE
a bit more spinal mobility in their lives. You don't need a long, drawn out routine for this though—if you're in a pinch, there's just one move you can use to make your back feel great. The exercise is called the cat-cow, a simple on-the-spot back stretch done on all fours that resembles both feline and bovine movements.
Once you figure out its simple subtleties, you’re on your way to a healthier spine for your next gym session or just getting through the day.  The cat-cow is not a rep-based exercise, so there’s no need whatsoever to rush your movements. What you’re looking for is slow, controlled movement while focusing on spinal protraction and retraction. And since you’re not moving any load, it’s safe to round your back while in cat cow.
What does  it all mean? According to
Men’s Health
fitness director
Ebenezer Samuel, C.S.C.S.
, and senior editor
Brett Williams, NASM
, when you’re in cat-cow, you want to create movement across your spine and your shoulder blades for maximum gains.
How to Do the Cat-Cow
Get in a tabletop position (hands, knees, and feet on the ground), with the shoulders above your wrists. Your knees slightly wider than hip width.
Round your back as much as possible, while spreading your shoulder blades and bending in your neck as much as possible
Look up to slowly begin arching your back, taking two to three seconds to create as much spinal extension as possible while squeezing your shoulder blades.
Continue alternating between extension and flexion, moving for 2 to 3 seconds per each rep.
Men's Health
Men's Health
Benefits of the Cat-Cow
WHAT MAKES THIS
move so useful is that it’s a subtle reminder us that our vertebrae can indeed move independently, and movement doesn't only take place at the waist. The cat-cow also allows you to really focus on spreading those shoulder blades as far as you can. Then when you arch your back, you want to squeeze your shoulder blades nice and tight.
“That way we can really feel the range that's within our spine at the time,” Samuel says. “The more and more you do this, your movement is going to get better and you're going to be more in touch with your spine.”
Common Cat-Cow Mistakes
THE BIGGEST MISTAKE
you can make when you do the cat-cow is to rush through the movement, which won't allow you to take advantage of your spine's whole range of motion. Really concentrate on taking your time on both ends so that you're able to create movement across your spine and shoulder blades.
How to Add the Cat Cow to Your Workouts
THERE
’S REALLY NOT
a wrong time to do the cat-cow, either as a pre-workout warmup or just as a quick wake-me-up first thing in the morning. And again, there's no need to rush this for reps, so think about going for 40 seconds on 20 off for about three or four sets.

GUYS TEND TO
think of
training their chest
as zero-sum game. The broad consensus is that you need to
bench press
—more specifically, to barbell bench press—as much weight as possible, and let the gains pile up. In reality, that's not an effective way to build your chest. It's not even the smartest way to build a stronger bench press. To do that, sometimes you need to change implements (and even your base of support) to focus on different aspects of the lift with exercises like the floor press.
The principle behind the floor press is simple, and right there in the name: You're moving from the bench to the floor. In doing so, you'll be doing more than just shifting your position. You'll be cutting the exercise's
range of motion
drastically—which allows you to emphasize and strenghten aspects of the lift that will pay off when it comes time to move back up to the bench.
There's more to the floor press than just hitting the deck and pressing up. To make the most of the movement, you'll need dialed-in form. Let
Men's Health
fitness director
Ebenezer Samuel, C.S.C.S.
and senior editor
Brett Williams
guide you through the cues you'll need to master the floor press, saving you from the bad habits that are keeping you from unlocking your strength and muscle gains.
How to Do the Floor Press
Sit on the floor, holding a set of dumbbells in your propped on your hips. Rock back and lie down, hiking the weight up to shoulder height, with your upper arms on the floor at a 45 degree angle relative to your torso. (If you're using very heavy weights or a barbell, have a partner hand you the weights).
Squeeze your shoulder blades, abs, and glutes to create full-body tension. Your heels should be flat on the floor. (You can also press from
a hollow body position
, but you'll need to drop down in weight.) Don't arch your back, even if you're fighting to complete a rep.
Press the dumbbells straight up, squeezing your chest.
Lower back down to the starting position with control. Pause at the bottom before the next rep; don't allow the back of your arms to bounce off the floor into the next one.
Take note of these additional cues from Samuel to shore up your floor press form:
Abs and Glutes Tight
Eb says:
You're on the floor for a floor press, but you're not lying down on the job. You still want to create tension through your core and glutes, just as you would when on the bench press, because you're using this to train your bench press. Don't relax on the floor. Stay tight.
Arms Down Slowly
Eb says:
The floor press isn't an excuse to skip out on the good eccentric contractions. Slowly lower the dumbbells (or barbell), letting your elbows touch the ground softly. If you don't do this, you're missing out on one of the best parts of the movement.
Once you learn it, you get to go heavy with the floor press, challenging yourself with potentially greater loads than you might normally bench, and owning the negative gives you a chance to assert control over that load. That'll translate to greater control when you do the classic bench with larger weights.
Explode Upwards
Eb says:
The floor press is a great way to work on heavy-weight lockouts at the elbows for your standard bench press. Take advantage of that and be powerful and strong firing upwards on every rep.
Explosion is key, so don't be slow. If you're too slow, you're wasting the opportunity to hone your bench press.
Benefits of the Floor Press
THE FLOOR PRESS
is a great exercise for you to program into your chest day for a few reasons. The shortened range of motion from the standard bench press (your elbows can't go past your shoulders since the floor is in the way) makes the exercise much friendlier for anyone with shoulder issues. You'll still be able to perform a horizontal press with a heavy load and protect your shoulder joints. There's another benefit to that shorter range of motion: You'll be able to work with heavier weights to hone the lockout portion at the end of the press. That can make your standard press even stronger, while also providing a stimulus for muscle growth.
Muscles Worked By the Floor Press
THE FLOOR PRESS
is, as a horizontal press, going to recruit your chest muscles (the pectorals). Your triceps will assist with elbow extension as well. If you shift into the hollow hold position, you'll also be training your core muscles.
Common Floor Press Mistakes
THE FOCUS ON
the floor press should always be on form—not on gutting out the heaviest reps possible. If you're working with heavy weights, you're most likely focused on strengthening the lockout of your standard bench press. Since that's the case, don't compensate your form to finish out a rep by arching your back. Make sure to maintain full-body tension by squeezing your core and glutes and driving your heels into the floor. When you perform multiple reps, don't bounce your arms off the floor to move into the next one.
To keep your shoulders in a safe position, you should also make sure to avoid pressing with your arms straight out, in line with your shoulders. Your elbows should be at a 45 degree angle relative to your torso.
How to Add the Floor Press to Your Workouts
WHEN YOU WANT
to do the floor press with heavy weights as a principle movement in your chest day routine, aim for 3 sets of 8 to 10 reps. As a secondary move to compliment a standard bench press (or from the hollow body position), work with lighter weights and start at 3 sets of 10 to 12 reps.

GUYS LOVE THE
bench press
, and for good reason. The compound exercise allows you to push big-time weight and build chest muscle, checking boxes for both performance and aesthetic goals. If you want to level up your chest day workouts and fine-tune both your muscle and strength gains, it pays to change up the angle. That's what you do with the dumbbell incline press.
By pressing from the incline position, you're not just messing around with your adjustable bench settings for variety's sake. When you adjust the angle you press from, you'll shift the focus to the upper part of your chest. This will make your standard bench press even stronger.﻿
Before you grab a set of dumbbells, hit the bench, and get pressing take note that it's extremely important to pay attention the movement here. Using the proper form is essential to make sure you're getting the most out of the exercise—particularly because of how easy it is to cheat the angle and how common it is for guys to put their shoulder health at risk. Let

guide you through the cues you need to know to do the dumbbell incline press right.
How to Do the Dumbbell Incline Press
Sit on the incline bench set to a 45 to 60 degree angle holding a set of dumbbells.  Drive your feet into the floor, drive your glutes into the seat, squeeze your abs, and drive your shoulders into the back pad.
Raise the dumbbells to your shoulders. If the weight is too heavy, use your knees to kick the bell up. Your forearms should be perpendicular to the floor.
Press the weight straight up, keeping your upper arms perpendicular to the ground.
Once the weight is up, drive your shoulders down to create tension. Shift the angle of your arms by turning your hands slightly in.
Lower the weight back down toward your chest as your chest flexibility allows, at least until your elbows are below your shoulders.
Men's Health
Follow these tips from Samuel for more detailed form cues.
Abs Tight
Eb says:
You'll see a lot of people arching their backs when they bench-press period — and it's that much more important on the incline press. If you're aiming to hit the clavicular fibers of your chest (your upper chest), you need to create a wider upper arm angle relative to torso. The incline press does that if you keep your core tight and don't arch your back.
But arching your back closes that upper arm angle (and cuts the distance of the actual press too), and that defeats the purpose of the press. So keep your core tight and glue your butt to the bench. These are common bench-pressing rules in general, but they need reinforcement when you're on the incline press.
Forearm Angle
Eb says:
One of the most common mistakes on the incline press occurs when people slightly press out in front of them instead of pressing straight up. This happens because they misunderstand the purpose of the press. Again, you're here to open up the upper arm angle relative to torso, not to just simply lie on the bench in different fashion.
So set up for this the way you would for any bench press: Dumbbells directly above shoulders, then drive your shoulders hard into the bench (to tighten your shoulder blades). Turn your elbows slightly forward and you're ready to go.
Don't Overdo the Depth
Eb says:
Yes, it's great to touch the dumbbells to your chest, but don't fixate on that idea. Depending on your shoulder mobility, you may or may not be able to do this. Your goal should be to lower the dumbbells as until your elbows are below your shoulders at least, and you should be able to own and control this position.
But if you can't touch your shoulders, it's OK. Once your elbows have dipped below your chest and you've proven you own this position, press back up explosively. You're here for the press back up explosively, and the squeeze at the top of each rep. If you wanted to stretch your chest fibers? You'd just do a chest stretch.
Benefits of the Dumbbell Incline Press
﻿BY CHANGING UP
your pressing angle, you'll target the muscle fibers in your upper chest, according to Samuel. You'll build strength and muscle in a slightly different way than you would with the standard flat bench press.
Muscles Targeted By the Dumbbell Incline Press
YES, THE DUMBBELL
incline press will work your chest—specifically, the fibers in the upper region of the muscle group. But that's not all. Since it's a pressing movement, your triceps will be involves, as will your shoulder muscles like your front delts. Work to keep the focus on your upper chest by maintaining the proper posture on the bench.
How to Add the Dumbbell Incline Press to Your Workouts
MAKE THE DUMBBELL
incline press the second movement in your chest day workout after a flat bench. Try starting with 3 to 4 sets of 8 to 10 reps.

How to Improve Your Cable Crossover for Better Chest Gains
How to Improve Your Cable Crossover for Better Chest Gains
The exercise is well-known for targeting the inner chest. But, it's not the most effective way to build strength and size.

THE CABLE CROSSOVER
might be top in your arsenal of
chest exercises
. The traditional way of doing them, though, might not be optimal for gaining chest size and strength, contrary to what all the gym bros will tell you.
"It is the most well-known inner chest exercise. It is not, however, the best way to train your inner chest," says
Ebenezer Samuel, C.S.C.S.,
Men's Health
fitness director. "It's not the best version of the cable fly, especially if you want to keep your shoulders healthy, and if you really want that chest development."
Here, Samuel explains why the classic cable crossover might not be the best way to build your chest, and how to improve the move to make it work for your goals.
Limitations of the Cable Crossover
IN A TRADITIONAL
cable crossover, you'd set the stack to its highest point, then grab both handles, and hinge at the hips to put your torso at an angle. With a slight bend through the elbows, you'd then squeeze your chest together and cross your arms over one another when they get to the center.
The first issue with this style of cable crossover is there's not a ton of stability for controlled, quality muscle contractions. The torso angle is also not consistent since it's not supported by anything, which may cause you to tilt more forward to get a better angle on heavier reps. There's no check to ensure the torso angle is staying the same so that you're able to chart legitimate improvement. And there's a bigger problem too, says Samuel.
"The biggest issue with this though is the shoulder risk," Samuel says. At the squeeze of this movement, the humerus and clavicle potentially get close, closing up all the joint space. "This is a recipe for shoulder issues in the long term."
How to Improve Your Cable Crossover
TO MAKE THE
cable crossover more effective and safe, you're going to bring a bench into the set up. Pull it in between the two cables, and set it to the highest possible height. Drop the cable height down to the bottom of the stack instead of the top. The bench will help assist with stability, which will help you push yourself to fatigue.
How to Do It:
Grab the handles. Stand in front of the bench, leaning against it. Ensure your shoulder blades are up off the top of the bench.
Lean back a little bit to open up the chest.
With a slight bend through the elbows, squeeze the chest and think about driving the elbows together to bring the arms up. Lead with your pinkie fingers.
Do not cross the arms over one another, only come to where the hands are close together. Focus on that squeeze at the top.
How to Incorporate the Cable Crossover Into Your Workouts
THE BEST WAY
to include this improved cable crossover into your workout is to put it at the end of your chest or upper body day. Aim for 3 sets of 10 to 12 reps. You'll get a really good pump through the inner chest after your main lifts.
The other, more advanced way to incorporate it is to use it as a pre-fatigue exercise. Do 3 to 4 sets of a super set, lead off with 8 to 10 reps of this exercise to fatigue the chest a little bit. Then move into another multi-joint exercise like a flat bench press or incline dumbbell press for 6 to 8 reps.

Perfect Your Pushup by Avoiding These 3 Mistakes
Perfect Your Pushup by Avoiding These 3 Mistakes
You might be cheating yourself out of quality reps.

PLENTY OF GUYS
use their
pushup max
as a bragging right. But if they tell you they're scoring 50, 75, or 100 consecutive reps, don't automatically assume they're strong. Very often there's a different reason for the big numbers, and it comes down to pushup form.
"Everyone thinks they can do a whole bunch of pushups," says
Ebenezer Samuel, C.S.C.S.
,
Men's Health
fitness director. "But nine times out of ten, the people who tell you they can do a lot of push ups are just cutting corners."
There are a handful of mistakes people make when doing pushups that might make them feel stronger in the moment, but in many of these instances, they're ditching quality movement and short-circuiting the true muscle-building and strength-training effects of the pushup. Here, Samuel explains the three stealthiest pushup cheats that people use when they're trying to pile up reps.
3 Common Pushup Mistakes
Mistake #1: You're not finish your reps.
You'll often see guys in the gym repping out pushups as fast as possible. If you look closely, you might notice them only completing about 75 percent of the rep, stopping just short of the full lock out of the elbows. This makes the reps easier because there's less time under tension in every rep. It also takes out a lot of the work from the triceps (most involved in the act of locking out the elbow), which is skipped when you cut reps short.
Mistake #2: You're not going all the way down
This is the reverse of the first mistake: you'll often see people not lower their chest all the way to within an inch of the ground, cutting out a portion of the bottom of the rep. This low portion of the rep is the most challenging portion, where you get the maximum stretch on the chest.
"This time it's almost worse [than the first mistake], too—because I'm  cutting time under tension in that critical stretch portion of the rep," Samuel says.
Mistake #3: You're raising your hips as you fatigue
In a set of all out pushups, your chest likely starts to fatigue 30 or 40 reps in. To combat that fatigue, you might accidentally start hiking your hips up (in a perfect pushup position, your body is set up in a flat line from your heels all the way up through your shoulders). This takes a bit of the tension off the chest by changing the angle at which you're pushing, and requires less output out of the core.
How to Do a Perfect Pushup
Now that we've seen what mistakes not to make, let's take a look at the proper way to do a pushup. To avoid all of these mistakes, take your time with every rep. Hold at the bottom and top of the motion for at least a second each. That probably means you won't be able to rep out 100 pushups—that's okay. It's better to do high-quality reps for a shorter amount of time than low-quality for longer.
Men's Health
How to Do It:
Start in a high plank position, hands stacked directly below your shoulders.
Squeeze your shoulders, glutes, and core to create full-body tension. Your spine should form a straight line, with a neutral spine.
Bend your elbows to descend to the floor, stopping with your chest about one inch off the ground. Your elbows should be at a 45-degree angle relative to the torso. Hold here for one second.
Press back up off the floor, raising up to the top position with your elbows fully extended. Hold here for one second before going into your next rep.
Sets and Reps:
Aim for 3 to 4 sets of 12 to 15 reps, without cheating your form.

3 Useless Chest Exercises to Avoid—and 3 Muscle-Building Moves to Do Instead
3 Useless Chest Exercises to Avoid—and 3 Muscle-Building Moves to Do Instead
Don't fall for flashy social media trends. Take these training tips for real-life gains.

IN THE AGE
of
peak fitness influence
on social media, there's no shortage of exercises circulating your feed. While it's nice to have a vast library of movements to keep your days in the gym interesting, many of those influencer-designed options are better served to gain clicks than they are for building muscle. Chest-focused training, in particular, has seen a particularly problematic influx of questionable content.
While there is some value to having a diverse range of movements—you do need more than just basic bench pressing and pushups here, since
your chest will grow from the focused squeeze that comes with adduction
—there is such thing as too much. Men's Health fitness director
Ebenezer Samuel, C.S.C.S.
, says that his time on fitness social media has exposed him to some of the dumbest
chest exercises
he's ever seen.
"We're talking about exercises that aren't really going to stimulate our chest, that aren't going to push us to our goals, and they're just not really going to help us get that good mechanical tension that we need to build chest size and chest strength," says Samuel.
Many of these exercises have the right idea in mind, but ultimately execute in a non-optimal way. Here, Samuel provides a few small tweaks that can make them effective.
3 Chest Exercises to Avoid
Prayer Press
In theory, the prayer press is meant to stimulate chest adduction by squeezing two plates together and lifting and lowering in a similar pattern to a traditional bench press. This exercise can be performed standing or lying on a bench.
Neither option optimally loads the chest, though. If your perform this movement standing, gravity places more load on the shoulders to control the weight. If done lying down, the plate cuts the range of motion, neglecting a proper stretch through the chest before contraction. Thus, more of the work is applied to your triceps.
Plus, progressively overloading this movement is hugely challenging, Samuel says. The bigger the plate, and the more you slap together, the more awkward and difficult it is to situate.
Prayer Press Alternative: Bench Supported Cable Fly
So, what can you do instead? The bench supported cable fly is an underrated exercise that properly loads up chest adduction.
Men's Health
How to Do It:
Place a bench in between two cable machines. Set the bench up to where it's at an angle of 30 to 45 degrees. Set the anchor of the cable to the bottom.
Grab onto both handles and lean against the bench. Create about a 30 degree bend through the elbow, and slowly lower your arms out wide until you find a healthy stretch through your chest.
Exhale and squeeze to pull your arms together into your midline.
Sets and Reps:
Aim for 3 sets of 10 to 12 reps
Hex Press
The hex press is very similar to the previous exercise in that the goal is to squeeze the dumbbells together as you're pressing the weight upwards in an attempt to train adduction while also pushing. As you hold the two dumbbells in a neutral grip with your elbows close to your torso, however, you lose the optimal angle to create true mechanical tension in your chest. The tension here instead is going through your triceps, rather than your chest.
Hex Press Alternative: Banded Dumbbell Press
To get the best of both worlds, grab a resistance band and loop it around your back. The placement of the band really emphases a squeeze at the top of the motion.
How to Do It:
Place a resistance band around your back, and loop it through your palms. Grab your dumbbells.
Lie back, and bring your dumbbells up over your chest. Slowly lower your elbows down, creating a 45 degree bend through your armpit.
Find a good stretch through the chest before exhaling and pressing the dumbbells up towards the sky. Squeeze at the top to fight the extra resistance provided by the bands.
Sets and Reps:
Aim for 3 sets of 8 to 10 reps.
High Incline Press
The high incline press is typically used to place an emphasis on the upper chest. When the bench incline goes north of 30 degrees, however, the line of gravity runs more through the shoulders than it does your chest.
High Incline Press Alternative: Single-Arm Incline Press
Men's Health
The single-arm incline press allows you to hit that upper chest, so long as you keep the angle of the bench to 30 degrees. The exercise provides other big advantages: Moving one arm at a time allows you to focus on the
mind-muscle connection
, and dial in on working though
a full range of motion
, which will help to maximize your muscle building.
How to Do It:
Situate your bench to an incline of 30 degrees.
Grab one dumbbell, and press the weight arm straight over your chest. You can extend your off arm out to the side for balance. Squeeze your abs and glutes to maintain your posture on the bench.
Slowly lower the elbow down, a little bit off the ribcage. Find a good stretch in the chest before exhaling and pressing back towards the ceiling.
Sets and Reps:
Aim for 3 to 4 sets of 8 to 10 reps.
What Makes a Good Chest Exercise?
THERE ARE A
few criteria for determining what makes a chest exercise effective. The first thing to look for in an exercise is that it can be progressed. "We've got to be able to go heavier in these exercises. That way, as we get better at them, we can load them up more," Samuel says. This will lead to muscle gains, too.
The second is that the exercise needs to create significant mechanical tension through the muscle group you're looking to target. With many of these exercises, the influence of gravity and the external load ends up puts more of the mechanical work on other close-by muscles, like your shoulders and triceps. You want to make sure the focus is squarely on the pectoral muscles as much as possible.

How to Bench Press the Right Way
How to Bench Press the Right Way
Everything you need to know about one of the most popular strength training exercises.

Brett Williams, NASM

THE BENCH PRESS
is one of the all-time great strength training exercises. For most guys, bench pressing means one thing: getting underneath a barbell loaded with as many plates as possible and eking out as many reps as they can. That can be one way to build a big, strong chest—but it's not the only way, and it's certainly not the safest, most effective way for everyone. If you want to make the most of your workout, you'll have a diverse approach to the bench press.
Start by swapping the heavy barbells for dumbbells. This might sound like gym heresy—but there are important questions you need to answer before you shut down this strategy. Why are you including the bench press in your routine? Is a barbell bench press PR your ultimate goal? Do you have aspirations to enter a powerlifting competition? Or are you mostly working out with the aim to build massive muscles? Maybe even just healthy movement is your goal.
If your response to the first two questions is no (or even that you're not sure), the barbell isn't an absolute
must
for your bench press plan. You can train your chest muscles with the bench press using dumbbells, giving you a more forgiving implement to work with on chest day.
Let
Men's Health
Fitness Director Ebenezer Samuel, C.S.C.S.
, guide you through the subtleties of the bench press, saving you from the bad habits that are keeping you from unlocking your fitness potential. We'll cover the styles of bench pressing, when it's best to swap out your implements, and different bench press variations you can use to build strength and size in your chest.

Best Weight Benches
The 2 Barbell Bench Press Styles
Not every bench press is created equally, and your reason for benching should drive your technique, says Samuel. “Are you looking to build chest muscle? Or do you want more overall power and to pile up reps?” says Samuel. “There are subtle differences in style for both goals. There are two general schools of thought when it comes to bench pressing, both motivated by the purpose of the move.
The Powerlifting Style
Powerlifters will frequently create large arches in their backs, glutes just touching the bench, chest driven high. This does two things. First, it allows for more space for the shoulder blades to move during the bench press. “Much like a pushup, you need your shoulder blades to squeeze together as you lower the weight,” says Samuel. “That doesn’t happen as easily if your torso is too flat on the bench.”
The large arch allows that to happens, and allows your lats to help push the weight upwards. It does another thing, too. “Your chest is higher, so it starts closer to the bar,” says Samuel, “and that ever-so-slightly reduces the range of motion you have to use on the bench. If you’re chasing max weight instead of total chest development, that makes the move slightly easier.” Translation: You can move more weight.
The Bodybuilding Style
Paolo Testa
Those in pursuit of chest hypertrophy, often bodybuilders, arch their backs only slightly, keeping a flatter torso. “I’m keeping a bit more core tightness if I’m using this style,” says Samuel. “But I still have a slight back arch, because I want my shoulder blades to not feel pinned and restricted of movement.”
This setup does something else too: If you do it right, you’ll get a more well-rounded chest pump. “The shift to a powerlifting style can actively shift the angle of your torso to something similar to a decline press angle,” says Samuel, “depending on your arch. That shifts the focus of your chest development slightly. Avoid doing that, and you’ll focus on your overall chest a bit more.”
You’ll also insulate your chest against injury. “Arching your back too much shifts the angle and, if you’re not experienced you can shift into internal rotation at the shoulder joint,” says Samuel. “Under serious load, that can be a mechanism for shoulder injury.”
Which Should You Pick?
If you’re new to the bench press game, start with the bodybuilding style of bench press. “This will at least help you learn correct form and technique,” says Samuel. “You can play with other approaches later.”
Need more proof? Samuel points to the classic pushup and compares it to the bench press. "The bench press is, at its core, a more loaded version of a pushup," says Samuel, "and you'd never ever arch your back on a pushup. Instead, you'd push for core and glutes tight. You need to mirror that on the bench press, at least to start, to get the best total-body results."
A bonus of this approach: You'll get underrated ab and glute work while on the bench.
The Rules of Bench Pressing
Christopher Kimmel
//
Getty Images
Whether you're using dumbbells or barbells (or kettlebells!), you'll want to set your body up to bench press for success. Follow these form cues, and you'll be in proper position.
Feet Flat on the Floor
You'll see a lot of people being lazy with their feet, or putting their feet on the bench — a lot of things they don't need to do. "The action of your lower body is critical on a bench press, especially if you're dealing with a barbell and pushing heavy weight," says Samuel. "Take the time to learn that lower body action now and develop good habits."
That means feet flat on the floor, driving through your heels. You want your glutes squeezed and contracted on that bench, too. Then tighten up your core; think about using your abs to pull your ribcage tight to your torso. That all sets the stage for a clean, aggressive bench that can help you grow a serious chest.
Shoulder Position
"This is critical," says Samuel. "Shoulder injuries are common on the bench, and very often, that's because of poor shoulder position."
Start in the correct position; when the dumbbells are directly over your shoulders, thinking about driving your shoulders into the bench, and flexing your mid-back muscles. As you lower the dumbbells toward your chest, keep flexing those back muscles; it should feel like you're pulling the dumbbells to your chest.
The approach works regardless of whether you use dumbbells or barbells.
Elbow Position
Never let your elbows become parallel to your shoulders when you bench. Think about keeping your elbows at a 45-degree angle, lower than your shoulders. This will help protect your shoulders and rotator cuffs in the long term. And that's not it.
"Think about turning the pits of your elbows toward your head," says Samuel. "This will turn on your lats, and it will further protect your shoulders. And it's critical if you want to showcase a strong, potent bench press."
Hand Position
Whether you're using a barbell or dumbbells, the width of your hands is a critical bit on the bench press. Your goal: Keep your forearms perpendicular to the ground for the entire life of each bench press set.
"This is key," says Samuel. "If your hands get too close, you'll lose this angle, and that places more stress on the elbows." If your hands are too wide, there are other issues: You'll place stress on your shoulders and fail to get the aggressive chest contraction you really want."
But how do you find your hand position? Samuel says it's different for everyone. And the best way to do it: Start from the bottom. "It's easy to have your forearms perpendicular to the ground at the top of each rep, but you have to maintain it at the bottom. So if you're unsure, start with an unloaded barbell or a pair of dumbbells at your chest, and find the right position that allows your forearms to be perpendicular to the ground at this point," says Samuel. "Then you're good to go."
Do You Need to Barbell Bench Press?

Back to the dilemma we posed at the top of the story. We have to admit that the barbell bench press is the gold standard of bench press variations, challenging you to press a heavy single bar over your chest. And yes, it can drive serious chest and triceps development.
But barbells
force you to work from a fixed position
, which might not be ideal for guys with shoulder issues or other anatomical challenges. You'll give a little in terms of weight, but you'll make that up with range of motion gains—which can be great for size and functional goals.
It also might not be the lift you need most. “Barbell pressing is great,” says Samuel, “but it’s also the most advanced form of the flat bench press, and it requires a bit more than pressing the bar. You also need to twist the bar aggressively, something called ‘breaking’ the bar, to do it safely.”
Not everyone needs to do that, and it’ll depend on your fitness goals. It also isn’t one or the other, says Samuel. “You can prioritize your training around barbells and insert dumbbells here and there. Or you can do it the other way around. It helps to know both tools, but the one you build the majority of your training around should be carefully selected for your training goals.”
Why You Should Build Around Barbell Press
Max Strength.
If you’re chasing pure strength and power, you’ll want the barbell press in your arsenal. Over time, you’ll be able to move heavier loads with a barbell than you can with the dumbbell. So if the goal is to eventually set a bench press PR, you want to involve barbells. If your bench press max matters to you, you’ll need this tool.
Competition.
If you’re planning to enter a powerlifting competition at some point, you’ll be working with heavy barbells in that situation, so you’ll need the practice in your own training.
You Want Uncommon Amounts of Muscle.
If you aspire to be a pro bodybuilder in a heavyweight class, you’ll need serious strength and muscle. And that means you’ll need to integrate barbells into your training in a big way. Why? “You can go heavy with dumbbells, but point blank, you’ll get more chances to move serious weight with barbells,” says Samuel. “And if you want mountains of muscle, you need that load to grow.” Additionally, training heavy builds a reservoir of strength and power that can serve you well even when you’re aiming to focus on hypertrophy with lighter weights.
Why You Should Build Around Dumbbell Press
Shoulder Safety.
If you’ve had shoulder issues, the dumbbell press is the way to go. Yes, you’ll have to learn to manage the instability of the dumbbells, but they’re less restrictive than the barbell, too. “If you move a bit differently on one side of your body than the other, the barbell isn’t friendly to that,” says Samuel. “A pair of dumbbells can be friendly to any natural asymmetries you may have.”
Core Tension.
Using dumbbells to press can do plenty for your technique, including challenging your core and other stabilizing muscles. “Take advantage of this,” says Samuel. “Your smaller shoulder stabilizers will fire to keep your arms stable in the dumbbell press.”
You're New to the Gym.
"The dumbbell press is the best way to learn to press," says Samuel. The reason: You get to work on controlling your stabilizing muscles and finding your most natural arm position. "If you start on the barbell, you can easily develop bad habits, or let the bar dictate your arm position," says Samuel. "Dumbbells force you to figure out how to get stabilizing muscles working, and find your proper forearm slot."
Bench Press Variations
Once you've mastered the basics of the flat bench press, there are a host of variations you can play with. Try some of these to spice up your training, and to add challenge without necessarily adding weight.
Incline Press
Why:
Doing dumbbell or barbell presses on an incline press forces a slightly greater range of motion and can help develop your upper chest.
How to Do It:
Sit on an incline bench with a pair of dumbbells. Squeeze your abs and glutes and drive your feet into the floor. Your back should be flush to the bench.
Raise the dumbbells to shoulder height (use your knees to 'kick' them up if you need).
Drive your shoulders into the back pad of the bench, then press the weight straight up. Keep your arms perpendicular to the ground to keep the proper arm angle.
Lower the weight back down to the starting position under control. Lower until your elbows are below your shoulders—don't worry about touching your chest with the dumbbells.
Sets and reps:
3 to 4 sets of 8 to 10 reps.
Floor Press
Why:
You can work with even more weight without worrying about the shoulder joint issues you might struggle with on the bench. The floor provides an immediate end to that range of motion—just make sure you don't bounce your arms off the ground to power your reps.
How to Do It:
Start sitting on the floor, holding a pair of dumbbells. If you're going heavy, consider asking someone to help you with the weight. If not, roll back into a lying position so that you're holding the weights with your upper arms flat against the floor.
Squeeze your shoulder blades, abs, and glutes to create tension. Your back should be flat on the floor (don't arch), with your feet planted as well. Make sure your arms are at a 45 degree angle relative to torso.
Press the weight straight up.
Lower the weight with control until your upper arms rest against the floor. Pause at the bottom before the next rep.
Sets and reps:
3 sets of 8 to 10 reps
Half-Bench Single-Arm Press
Why:
This variation is doubly challenging. First, you'll work unilaterally, meaning that you'll have to keep your form super tight to avoid falling off balance. Secondly, your position at the edge of the bench makes that even tougher, so your core is working in overdrive to keep you from failing.
How to Do It:
Start by lying down on a flat bench holding a single dumbbell. Press the weight straight up.
Shift yourself so that the side of your body holding the dumbbell—half your head, your shoulder blade, your leg—is off the bench.
Squeeze your shoulder blades, abs, and glutes to create tension and stay balanced.
Lower the weight down to your shoulder with control. Keep your elbow at a 45 degree angle relative to torso. Maintain your core tension to avoid losing proper form throughout the movement.
Sets and reps:
3 sets of 10 to 12 reps per side
Close-Grip Bench Press
Why:
This bench press variation is all about your triceps, the most important secondary muscle for most of these exercises. By narrowing the grip, you put more onus on the triceps—which will have strength payoffs when you shift back out to the standard version of the move.
How to Do It:
Start by lying back on the flat bench, driving your shoulders into the pad and squeezing your abs and glutes. Your feet should be flat on the floor.
If you're working with a barbell, shift your grip in. Your hands should be slightly closer together than shoulder-width. If you're working with dumbbells, shift to a neutral grip (your palms facing each other) with your hands closer than your shoulders.
Press the weight straight up, keeping your forearms vertical.
Lower down to your ribcage. Don't allow your elbows to flare out.
Sets and reps:
3 sets of 8 to 10 reps

Get those chest gains without getting yourself hurt or smashing up your dumbbells.

CHEST DAY WORKOUTS
generally fall into one of two camps. The first (and most prevalent) is pressing exercises, like the all-important bench press and pushup, since your chest is responsible for pushing movements. That's not the only function of the chest, however; the big muscle group at the top of your torso is also responsible for
adducting your arms
, the movement of your arms toward the midline of your body. One of the most common exercises that harnesses this function is our focus here: the fly.
There are multiple fly variations, depending on the gear you have on hand and the position you take to perform the exercise. The simplest (and most likely you'll see out on your gym floor) is the dumbbell chest fly. The classic bodybuilding staple has been used for years to develop chest size and strength, working that essential function of the chest that's too often overlooked in favor of big bench press sessions.
Just because the dumbbell chest fly is simple, however, doesn't mean it's without subtleties. There's more to the movement than just kicking back on the bench and flapping away with a set of dumbbells in each hand. Check out this guidance from
Men's Health
fitness director
Ebenezer Samuel, C.S.C.S.
and fitness editor
Brett Williams
to find out how you can fit the fly into your workouts—or if there might be a better way for you to build up that chest.
Benefits of the Bench Dumbbell Chest Fly
﻿THE DUMBBELL CHEST
fly allows you to add chest adduction to your training plan. This concentrated squeeze can be the key to muscle growth, most specifically helping to target the inner part of the chest, which isn't as much a focus on pressing movements.
That said, the bench dumbbell chest fly might not be the best option for you to work that chest adduction into your routine. The exercise can be riskier and less effective than other exercises—when you put your shoulder joints under so much stress, you're putting your long-term health at risk. Before adding the dumbbell chest fly to your routine,
consider what alternatives you might try first
.
How to Do the Bench Dumbbell Fly
FOLLOW THESE FORM
cues to learn how to do the bench dumbbell fly. Once you've read the step-by-step directions, follow along for some higher-level tips from Samuel to dive deeper into the exercise.
Lie back on the bench, then press the dumbbells up above your chest with a neutral grip.
Drive your shoulder blades back into the bench to set your shoulders. Keep your feet on the ground and squeeze your glutes and abs to create full-body tension.
Move your hands to turn your pinkies toward each other. This will help to create some external rotation at the shoulder joints.
Bend your elbows slightly, then lower the weights down to the sides, moving only at the shoulders. Lower down only to a comfortable point for your range of motion, when you feel a stretch on your chest.
Squeeze your pecs to raise the weights back up to the starting position. Don't slam the weights together at the top—instead, stop with the weights just slightly apart, continuing to squeeze the chest. That should be the major point of focus for the exercise.
Squeeze at the Top
Eb says:
The true benefit and magic of the dumbbell fly happens not when your arms are at their widest, but when you bring your arms together. It's here that you get the chance to squeeze your pectoral fibers and really promote chest growth. Focus on this squeeze, thinking of lingering at the top for a good one second to get the most out of the fly.
Avoid touching the dumbbells at the top, too, because doing so removes that chance to really squeeze your pecs. Just as importantly, if you're driving the dumbbells up so quickly that they're clanking together, you're doing the motion without the precision and control required to really get that chest squeeze. Take your time with each rep.
Never Lower Too Deep
Eb says:
Remember: The magic of the fly occurs at the top of the movement, not the bottom. So don't try too hard to overstretch your pecs by lowering your shoulders extra-deep.
Aim to get your upper arms parallel with the ground, but don't worry about going too deep on them. This isn't an exercise for flexibility; you're using the movement to build size, strength, and definition. And not every person has perfect shoulder range of motion, especially if you work a desk job. So lower the dumbbells only until you feel a slight stretch in your chest; if you feel this in your shoulders or biceps, you're over-stretching. A good starting point: Think about lowering until your upper arms are parallel with the ground or just a few degrees deeper.
Never Stop Squeezing Your Shoulder Blades
Eb says:
Start each set of dumbbell flies by driving your shoulder blades into the bench, and think about squeezing them as you lower the weights. This will help protect your shoulders. As you begin to fly up, though, continue to squeeze your shoulder blades together. This does two things. First off, it will once again help you protect your shoulders. It's really easy to compromise joint space in the shoulder as you fly up, giving your rotator cuff tendons less space to move. By squeezing your shoulder blades, you help maintain that.
Even better, if you continue to squeeze your shoulder blades together when you finish the dumbbell fly, you'll challenge your chest to really squeeze at the top of each rep. The difference is subtle: If you release your shoulder blades, you can essentially bring the entire shoulder complex along for the ride at the top of the rep. But if you keep squeezing hard on that rhomboid, it forces your shoulder blades to stay tight and keeps your shoulders down. That means the finishing squeeze on the dumbbell fly winds up coming purely from a pectoral contraction. Even if this feels like it cuts your range of motion, it's not actually doing so. It's simply forcing your pecs to fully work through their natural range, instead of pointlessly over-extending the movement.
How to Add the Dumbbell Chest Fly to Your Workouts
ADD THE DUMBBELL
chest fly to your workouts once or twice a week at most, shortly after you finish your big time compound pressing exercises. On that note, the dumbbell chest press is not a move to do with heavy weights. Samuel suggests starting at about half the amount you're using for dumbbell bench presses, then adjusting from there as you focus on nailing the form. Begin with three sets of 10 to 12 reps, working to emphasize the chest squeeze at the top for every single one.

How to Add the Incline Pushup to Your Workouts
How to Add the Incline Pushup to Your Workouts
This is a valuable move for beginners—but even the strongest guys can benefit by adding some elevation.

SOMETIMES THE ABUNDANCE
of barbells, dumbbells, free weights, machines, and even “smart gym” equipment capable of creating a killer chest pump can be so overwhelming that many gym-goers overlook one of the most basic and versatile upper body exercises:
the pushup
. There are many variations of this bodyweight staple, and of the easiest methods for
elevating your pushup skills
—for gym-goers of all skill levels—is by actually changing the elevation of your position. This variation is known as the incline pushup.
By placing your hands up on an elevated platform (put more simply, at a higher position than your feet) the incline pushup becomes a more accessible option for those just learning the move and building up their strength. Once you've moved beyond the beginner stage, the incline pushup can still be valuable. The position offers an opportunity to create a powerful chest contraction, giving you a valuable chance to target the the lower part of the chest—and a valuable move to slot at the end of a brutal workout.
"If you're advanced, keep it in your back pocket, you never know when you'll be in a situation where you just want to hit a little bit of superset work and get that lower chest pump, this can help," Samuel says. "And if you're a beginner, this is how you're going to get to your basic pushup, and you're going to get that mastered.
Benefits of the Incline Pushup
THE INCLINE PUSHUP
allows beginners to learn how to do pushups without needing the strength required for the standard version of the exercise. Trainers often encourage beginners to start by
doing pushups on their knees
, which doesn't allow for the full-body tension needed to pull off a perfect rep. The incline pushup removes some of the challenge by changing body angle while still allowing for that full-body tension.
Incline pushups aren’t just for weight room rookies. While pushup pros may not be challenged by variation as much as they'd like, the incline pushup can be utilized as an effective finishing move, particularly as part of a superset in which you’re able to focus on the contraction of the lower chest and building a strong mind-muscle connection.
Whichever category you fall under, the incline pushup is going to target your upper body, with your chest, triceps, shoulders, and core.
Who Should Do Incline Pushups?
THE INCLINE PUSHUP
can find a home in any athlete’s routine. The angle takes off some of the load of your body, so beginners can find this pushup version a less difficult starting point for learning the form. You can gradually progress over time by lowering the elevation point.
As mentioned above, advanced exercisers can also use the elevated pushup to home in on their lower chest, and as a means to add volume once they exhaust their ability to perform standard pushups with perfect form in drop sets.
Muscles Used for Incline Pushups
Chest
Triceps
Shoulders
Core
How to Do the Incline Pushup
HERE’S HOW TO
set up for the incline pushup.
Place your hands on an elevated surface—a bench or plyo box or chair would work—hands about shoulder-width apart and your feet at a slightly narrower distance.
Create core tension; your abs, rib cage and glutes should be nice and tight.
Widen your hands slightly—your shoulders should be aligned directly above your hands. Focus on keeping your shoulders directly above your hands (your arms and torso should not form a 90-degree angle at the top of the movement).
Think about turning the pits of your elbows forward. This will help activate your lats  into the movement while keeping your shoulders in a safer position.
From there, bend at the elbows to lower your chest down just above the platform, pause to feel the contraction, then drive back up.

E YOU’RE REDUCING
the load with the elevated hand positioning, the incline makes it a simpler strategy for pushup execution. The more you improve, however, you’ll be able to progressively lower the elevation.
To maintain a solid mind-muscle connection as you work on creating the lower chest contraction, keep a few things in mind:
Remember to exaggerate “screwing” your hands into the surface as you perform the exercise. This is going to help emphasize that desired chest squeeze throughout the movement.
Think of a “fly” motion as you “scoop” your elbows into the movement. As you twist your pinky fingers, your elbows should begin to slightly drive inward toward your chest. This will help focus on getting that extra squeeze on your lower chest.
How to Add the Incline Pushup to Your Workouts
THERE'S LITTLE UPSIDE
to effortlessly knocking out rep after rep of incline pushups if you're already strong enough to string together sets of standard pushups. However, adding incline pushups as part of a superset with other chest movements like cable flys or archer pushups can give you another way to challenge the end of your chest day workout.
Beginners will use this to learn how to do a pushup with good form. Start at three sets of eight to 10 reps. The goal is to continue with
your progression
by lowering the elevation over the course of several weeks or months, until you can do 10 to 15 standard reps without failure.

MOST GUYS THINK
that pushing heavy weight is the only way to build a superhero-sized chest. But you won't be pushing yourself to your full potential—both in terms of aesthetics and function—without harnessing your explosive power. You need movements like the plyo pushup to do that.
Power
is your body's capacity to create force—i.e., the ability to push a bar away from yourself as explosively as possible. You can’t hone this ability from standard reps of your typical exercises alone. A great place to start is by incorporating some
plyometric training
, movements that include jumps and throws that challenge your muscles' stretch reflex to hone power.
Unlike traditional pushups, a few explosive reps of plyo pushups—in which you will push your hands off and away from the floor—will help train your upper body to become as powerful as possible. This is a valuable characteristic inside the weight room and in real-life situations as well, according to
Men's Health
fitness director
Ebenezer Samuel C.S.C.S.
“We're focusing solely on creating power, and on being explosive and being fast, three things that we want both for the overall functionality in your chest and to make us better at all of our chest exercises,” Samuel says.
Who Should Do the Plyo Pushup
EVERYONE.
FROM BEGINNERS
to top-level athletes, plyo pushups are a normally a safer and effective exercise to build power. The movement can easily be modified as well for any skill level (by adding a bench, for instance).
If you're just starting, plyo pushups are perhaps going to be the most challenging exercise you’ll be performing for your chest, as the move may requires more explosive strength to separate yourself from the floor than you would normally use with free weights.
For the more advanced lifter, the way the plyo pushup hits the fast-twitch muscle fibers make for a great complementary exercise to the heavy bench presses and other movements you do for your chest.
Which Muscles Are Used for the Plyo Pushup
Chest
Shoulders
Triceps
Serratus muscle
Core
The difference between standard pushups and the plyo kind aren’t the muscles being utilized; the plyo still incorporates the chest, shoulders, triceps, etc. The difference is going to be
how
those muscles are trained. By adding the plyometric training element, you end up training with much more speed and force.
The plyo pushup also requires a greater focus on the
serratus anterior muscles
—the wing-like muscles along the rib cage. To successfully complete the plyo pushup you'll need extra focus to how these muscles move and operate.
How to Do the Plyo Pushup
IN ORDER TO
work on the speed element of the plyo pushup, we need to first learn how to do these with actual speed. For beginners (and even advanced) lifters, a good starting point is to place your hands on a box or bench to initially decrease the difficulty level before progressing to the floor version. This will alleviate some early struggles, allowing you to focus solely on the speed and power elements of the plyo pushup.
Place your hands on a box. Set up slightly away from the box, almost creating a right angle between your upper arms and torso.
Squeeze your glutes and abs tight. Lower yourself down into the rep, keeping your elbows tight to your torso on the way down.
Press your hands to “explode” from the bench, straightening your elbows to drive as hard as you can away from the bench.
When your hands regain contact with the bench, slowly lower yourself in a controlled manner, then repeat.
Use the same form when you perform reps from the floor.
How to Do the Plyo Pushup in Your Workouts
THE OBJECTIVE OF
the plyo pushup is to explode, not grind through a ton of reps. Keep it in the four- to six-rep range. Any more and you’ll lose that peak explosion, which is what the move is intended for.
Long story short: Your last rep should mimic your very first rep—fast and explosive.
Because plyo pushups require power and explosiveness, and those are the first things that go in your workout, it doesn’t always make a great finishing move. Unless you already have a strong upper body, keep plyo pushups near the front of your routine.

ON CHEST DAY
, lots of guys work with the sole aim of piling as much weight as possible onto a barbell in order to
bench press
. The strength training staple is one of the premier exercises that will consistently be one of your heavier training lifts.
But you should also remember that the bench press is powered by more than just your chest muscles—you'll recruit the shoulders, triceps and even your core to an extent in order to pull off your max lifts. Knowing how those muscles play a role in performing a solid bench press, and which muscle group may be the cause of your failure to bust through a sticking point, say
Men’s Health
fitness director
Ebenezer Samuel, C.S.C.S.
, and Advisory Board member
David Otey, C.S.C.S.
“We tend to neglect how much bracing foot contact five points of contact throughout the bench feet and hands,” Otey says. “They play such a critical role and we can learn a lot of this stuff through some of these extra exercises that will put us in a better position for that barbell.”
In other words, mastering the king of chest exercises takes full-body effort. So it’s important to get acquainted with other accessory exercises that can help enhance your bench press and find a way to add them to your routine.
5 Exercises to Help Boost Your Bench Press
Half-Kneeling Overhead Press
3 to 4 sets of 8 to 10 reps
Oftentimes shoulder pain or instability drive people away from performing bench presses, so it would make sense to work on strengthening your shoulder muscles. The half-kneeling overhead press is a great unilateral exercise to really focus on a precise pressing motion and concentrate on just your shoulders.
The half-kneeling position forces to you to think about stabilizing the pelvis and also keeping the rib cage down and abs tight—which adds a bit of core training to the move as well. Be aware, however of not arching your back—stay straight and think about keeping this move a vertical press, not incline.
Pushup with Band Resistance
3 sets of 8 to 12 reps
If you can regularly knock out 25 to 30 reps of pushups, you’re going to be in need of a greater challenge to your chest. Adding a bit of resistance to your pushups will help you make greater bench press gains. By adding a resistance band, you’re going to be working on adding acceleration and explosion to your pushups—which should translate to a more powerful bench press down the road.
Once again, keeping your core activated throughout the movement is important—remember you want to be transferring energy from the ground up for an explosive bench. A resistance band will help achieve this. Burnout is not the goal, instead, work toward continuing to master the lockout form. Some good options include working these as a drop set on a bench press day or even thrown in on an accessory work day.
JM Press
3 to 4 sets of 6 to 8 reps
If increasing your bench press load remains difficult, there’s a good chance your triceps are lacking in the strength department. One unique exercise to help fix this is called the JM press—a
close-grip bench press
and
skull crusher
hybrid variation that’s going to give lifters a unique opportunity to explore pressing away from the body.
The JM press allows you to lift a little heavier than other triceps exercises—which makes it an equally effective arm day workout as well.
It could be done with a barbell or dumbbell, and could be a bit tricky at first, so be aware of these setup steps.
Be sure to stack your elbows, shoulders and wrists over your chest.
Dumbbells should be placed more toward your eyebrows space.
Create shoulder tension to stabilize a little more.
From there let the elbows descend toward the sides of your ribcage—do not flare your elbows—as the weight drops toward your chin ad collarbone.
Chest-Supported Incline Row
3 to 4 sets of 8 to 12 reps
Adding chest support to a row, the standard pulling movement, allows you to focus entirely on your posterior chain. While that might strike you as being unrelated to the chest-centric exercise, it's actually a key (and often overlooked) accessory to improving your bench press.
This exercise is going to strengthen your lats, which play a key role when it comes to bench pressing when it comes time to stabilize yourself on the bench. The goal is to grab the bar, and place your shoulder blades in an optimum position in order to explode the weight off your chest. But if you don't have that proper posterior chain placement, the negative effects may carry over to your front.
This chest-supported row allows you to arch in our thoracic spine, allowing your chest to possibly come off the bench. It also allows you to target your middle and upper traps, which comes to play when it comes to a tighter setup on the bench.
One great benefit of the chest-supported row is that you’ll discover after a while how and where should be placed alongside your torso. This is a key element that will carry over to your bench press form.
Floor Press
4 sets of 6 to 8 reps
Sometimes not utilizing a full
range of motion
can be useful—and there’s no greater example of this than the
floor press
.
This variation is safer for your shoulders, allowing you to lift heavy without as much risk of injury as the standard form of pressing, and it can be performed with a variety of implements (dumbbells, barbells, etc.). The movement hits your triceps, and works great as means to improve the "lockout" portion of the bench press. A similar variation—the pin press—is another effective exercise that you can load weight and work through that shorter range of motion, and is a great post-bench press accessory move.

CHEST DAY
ENTHUSIASTS
, we see you.
Bench presses, dumbbell flies, and pushup
variations
can be some of the most rewarding movements in a training split—there's nothing like a good
chest pump
at the end of an upper-body focused lifting session. But if you ever feel like a heavy day of chest training has you hunched forward, you're not alone.  Chest tightness can round out your upper back by pulling the shoulders forward.
Dan Giordano, DPT, CSCS
of
Bespoke Treatments
shares some of the best chest stretches you can do to help make the post-gym hunchback feeling a thing of the past.
What Are The Chest Muscles?
THE
CHEST
IS
made up of two muscles, your pectoralis major and your pectoralis minor. They originate at the shoulder and attach at different points across the sternum, ribs, and collar bone. These muscles are responsible for pulling the arm up, forward, and across the body.
Who Would Benefit From Chest Stretches?
SPOILER ALERT: EVERYONE
If you love piling on reps of bench presses or pushups, your chest may be tight after your training days. This can be part of what causes the hunch. Our shoulders get pulled down and forward—and if you don't work to even out the effects of these movements with exercises that target your back and stretching, you can become unbalanced.
Desk workers can also benefit from chest stretches. The default position of being bent over a computer or hunching over to look at a phone screen can be an issue too—so anyone who sits in that way can do with some chest TLC.
These stretches from Giordano can give everyone, lifters, desk workers, and phone obsessives, some much-needed balance. When trying new stretches, only move to the point where you can feel the stretch. These moves shouldn't cause pain, so don't push beyond your own range of motion.
The 4 Best Chest Stretches
Seated Chair Stretch
This movement is super easy to add in between emails—you don't even have to stand up. Rep out a few of these during your next Zoom meeting.
How to Do It:
Interlock the fingers behind the head.
Pull the elbows back until you feel the stretch through the chest.
If you struggle to get your fingers behind your head— assume the goalpost position, with the fingers pointed up and the elbow at 90 degrees. It will do the trick.
Hold for about 3 to 5 seconds. Aim for 10 reps.
Single-Arm Chest Stretch With Rotation
Here's another easy seated stretch to pop into the middle of your workday. You can also program this move in between sets at the bench press. Just have a chair or bench handy for this movement whenever you choose to get your stretch on.
How to Do It:
Take a seat, and grab onto the bottom portion of the chair on one side.
Puff your chest out, and rotate away from the arm holding the chair.
Hold for about 3 to 5 seconds. Aim for 10 reps each side.
Quadruped Kneel Pectoral Stretch
Giordano recommends this movement as a warm up or a cool down for your chest day.
How To Do It:
Start in a quadruped position on all fours.
Extend one arm straight out to the side.
Push the shoulder towards the floor while rotating away from the extended arm. Make sure the hand stays flat and still on the floor.
Sink to a depth that is comfortable.
Hold for 3 to 5 seconds. Aim for 10 reps.
Scorpion Chest Stretch
This is the most intense out of all of these stretches, so try out the other ones first before progressing to this one.
How To Do It:
Lie flat on the ground, with your arms out 90 degrees to your side.
Lift one leg up and rotate other the other until the foot is touching the floor, creating that scorpion position.
Keep the non-moving leg still, and the arm on that same side flat to the ground with the palm facing down.
Use the other arm to support the rotation by pressing lightly into the floor to further deepen the stretch.
Hold for 3 to 5 seconds. Aim for 10 reps each side.

THE CORNERSTONE SUPPORTING
every successful chest training workout is a heavy press. There’s a fairly extensive list of pressing exercises to add to your routine.
One of those options is the machine chest press, a versatile and underrated piece of equipment that can be a great fit for many lifters’ chest day checklist. The apparatus allows lifters to load up heavy and press with confidence, without the need for a spotter in case of failure. You can also end a workout with a high-rep finishing set that will absolutely torch your pecs.
But is the machine chest press make it a great exercise for everyone? Not exactly, says
Men's Health
fitness director
Ebenezer Samuel, C.S.C.S.
For weight room newbies whose early goals should include mastering technique as much or more than moving heavy loads, the most optimal press is to focus early and often on the bread and butter bench press basics with the barbell and dumbbells.
“If you're a beginner I want you doing dumbbell presses and barbell presses and learning that because we've got to bring that over to the machine press,” Samuel says. “We've got to bring that good form over to the machine press to really take advantage of it.”
Who Should Use the Machine Chest Press
Bodybuilders
Athletes
The machine chest press is best suited for experienced lifters who already have barbell and dumbbell moves mastered, or at least a good working knowledge. Bodybuilders and athletes can obviously benefit from the machine press by being able to stack on heavier weight in order to pack on more size and strength.
Functional athletes can turn to the machine press as a challenging alternative to dumbbells and barbells. The machine press allows you more safely push to fatigue and failure each set if needed.
But again, beginners will be better served by getting acclimated to barbells and dumbbells. Improve your form on all the essentials—like the bench press, dumbbell press, even pushups—to get a better understanding of what your body mechanics should feel like. Nailing these mechanics early will help your carry your form over to the machine press.
Which Muscles Are for the Machine Chest Press
WHEN YOU’RE PERFORMIN
G machine chest presses, you’re targeting the same muscles that you would hit with dumbbells or barbells. These include:
Chest
Triceps
Shoulders
Benefits of the Machine Chest Press
ONE OF THE
unique benefits machine presses provide that you don’t normally get with other implements is the difference when it comes to force curve. Unlike dumbbells or barbells, with the machine chest press, you get more resistance at the top of the movement. This is a great way to get extra pressing work in.
Another benefit is that machine presses provide a greater arc movement, unlike the straight A to B movement free weights give you. This arc flows with the body’s chest fibers, providing greater muscle development for the user.
Common Machine Chest Press Setup Mistakes
DESPITE WHAT YOU
may think, performing the machine chest press isn’t as easy as just sitting down and moving weight. There’s a little more to it than that, and that starts with your positioning. Two common mistakes include:
Setting the Seat Too Low
You might find it easier to knock out a few extra reps or lift heavier weight with the seat lowered to the floor, but those minimal gains come at the expense of much needed range of motion within your chest and transferring some of the work to your shoulders, which is something you don’t want.
Moving Your Butt
Your glutes should be secure in one spot: firmly on the seat, with your lower back against the rear pad. Lifters often cheat and start sitting too far forward to find a spot that’s nice and comfortable to create a better angle or arch to push more weight. Range of motion becomes compromised, and once again your chest muscles lose out in the long run. Remember, there's no one keeping track of your max chest press—this one is all about muscle growth.
Two Fixes
Higher is better for the bench position. Your best move is to raise to about one notch higher than you probably want. From there, wedge yourself into the machine, keeping your butt tight toward the back pad.
Grab the handles tightly. Your best position is to have your shoulders about an inch or two above the handles. Also think hard about keeping your butt against the pad.
How to Do the Machine Chest Press
Align your seat to the point where the handles are about two inches below your shoulders.
Keep your shoulder blades tightly squeezed against the back pad, and your glutes and lower back wedged into the pad as well.
Drive your elbows down and tight, while pushing into the floor with your legs.
Press forward, squeezing at the top. That’s one rep.
How to Incorporate the Machine Chest Press Into Your Workouts
MACHINE PRESSES AREN
’T
meant to be a primary chest day exercise. Stick to dumbbells and barbells for that. However, machines are a great option toward the end of your session when you still want to move more weight and go all out till fatigue. Three sets of 12 to 15 reps—maybe even push to failure every now and then—should be the finishing formula.
If you’re in the early stages of your training, hold off on the machine press momentarily. Place your focus on other moves like dumbbell presses, incline presses, and even pushups. Getting your form right early on—from squeezing glutes and shoulder blades properly—will be the springboard to better chest gains.

ONE WORD SERVES
as a shorthand for punishment and pain for exercisers across gyms and many fitness disciplines. When a trainer says the word, you'll know that your workout will likely leave you doubled-over, heaving to catch your breath. It's synonymous with struggle, and you probably guessed it already: burpee.
The burpee is one of the most infamous exercises in fitness, a heart rate-raising maneuver that some trainers swear by and others avoid like the plague. The bodyweight movement is simple, but doing it the right way can present more of a challenge than you might expect. There's much more to the burpee than just throwing yourself down on the floor and popping back up to your feet.
Take a moment to learn the subtleties of the movement from
MH
fitness director
Ebenezer Samuel, C.S.C.S
. and senior editor
Brett Williams, NASM
so you won't find yourself in a world of pain.
How to Do Burpees Safely
Paolo Testa
Start standing with your feet shoulder-width apart.
Squat down, placing your hands flat on the floor inside your feet.
Leap your feet back into a pushup position, squeezing your shoulder blades, abs, and glutes. Your feet should be slightly wider than shoulder-width apart.
Bend at the elbows to lower your chest down to the floor. Control this movement rather than throwing yourself straight down.
Press back up into the pushup.
Leap your feet forward back to the initial squatting position.
Explode straight up into the air powerfully, with
triple extension
through the ankle, knee, and hip.
Land back on the floor under control.
Use this extra insight from Samuel to inform your reps:
Jump Efficiently
Eb says:
When you're doing burpees, think of getting off the ground as "efficiently" as possible. Note that I didn't say "quickly." If you focus only on quickness, but you're not hitting efficient positions, you're going to leak and waste energy. By default, you won't get up as quickly as you want to. And if you're wasting a ton of energy on each rep, it'll slow you down and fatigue you faster as you pile up reps and work time.
Hit the Ground Strong
Eb says:
Never be a jellyfish on the ground when doing burpees. Remember that that straight-body position, which you hit once when you put your hands and feet on the ground and then again when you lower your chest to the ground from there, is meant to be a plank. That means your abs are fired up and your glutes are contracted. You'll be much faster through both phases if you keep your core fired up, and you'll be protecting your spine and staving off any lower back injuries, too.
Keep a Wide Base
Eb says:
Always think "feet wide" when doing burpees—as in, at least shoulder-width apart at all times. Essentially, you want your feet constantly at a width from which you can jump. So when you lower your torso to the ground, and you're in that plank, they're wide. When you leap your feet back towards your hands, they're wide, too. Do this, and when it's time to jump, you won't have to waste any time getting into optimal position to jump -- because you're already there.
Own Your Jump
Eb says:
Own the jump on the burpee. That doesn't necessarily mean jumping sky-high, but it does mean really jumping (as opposed to the bunny hops I see too many people doing. Explode from your ankles, knees, and hips on every jump. A burpee is a valuable opportunity to train triple extension (the same thing that athletes train, and the same thing you train when you're doing a power clean), so don't waste that in the quest to do zounds of reps faster than everyone else.
Paolo Testa
How the Burpee Was Created
The movement itself, a brutally efficient bodyweight exercise that demands you to get down on the ground, then back up again as quickly as physically possible, has taken on an outsized reputation as a grueling conditioning tool used in everything from CrossFit WODs to group fitness classes. That's slightly surprising given its origin—the exercise
was named after its creator, physiologist Royal H. Burpee
, as a protocol to test fitness and physical capacity. Later on, burpees were used by the US military as a benchmark test for incoming recruits.
Now, the burpee has taken on an outsized reputation as one of the toughest moves you can include into your workout, in part because of the deviations from its creator's original template. Most common burpee variants consist of a jump and pushup, a much more active exercise than
the four-part standard laid down in the late 1930s
that didn't include those two powerful movements.
Benefits of Burpees
Trainers like including burpees in their workouts because the movement is a surefire method to raise the heart rate. This can be an effective conditioning tool for athletes. All of this activity makes the exercise a major calorie-burner, too. Finally, this is a multi-joint, multi-step movement, and if you're performing it properly you'll hone body control and coordination and express explosiveness and
power
, too.
This is the type of move that you need to understand before you put yourself in a situation where you might be asked to perform reps at volume, like a group fitness class or a similar workout setup. There are some coaches and trainers who do know how to mete out burpee reps responsibly—but there's a much greater number who are more inclined to put you in harm's way with mindless sets without a second thought.
Downsides of Burpees
Most people think of burpees as a high-capacity conditioning drill instead of the fitness test it was developed to be, one that exercisers perform for a long string of reps in order to ramp up the heart rate and cause exhaustion. The more explosive elements have also helped to make the burpee controversial among
some fitness pros
, who
contend that the burpee is often programmed dangerously
—or that it is an inherently dangerous movement—especially for beginners.
The issue many trainers have with burpees stems from
breakdowns in form and intent
. If the exerciser isn't experienced or if they're too tired from the accumulation of reps, they might be at risk of injuring their wrists or elbows if they're not able to control the way they hit the ground during the first part of the movement, which can become especially dangerous if there's a time-cap to the workout.
If a trainer teaches the burpee as an exercise that is more focused on throwing oneself on the ground and getting up again as quickly as possible instead of a multiple-part maneuver, there's even more risk. Avoid these workouts if you find yourself working with such a trainer.
How to Include Burpees in Your Workouts
Don't fall prey to the temptation of performing burpees as fast as you possibly can until you drop or for minutes on end. Instead, be smart with this conditioning tool. Think about perfect form on every rep. Start with 3 to 4 rounds of 20 seconds on, 40 seconds off.
6 Killer Burpee Variations
Once you master the basic form, try these variations for another challenge.

This variation is all about the jump.
How to Do It:
Start as you would for a standard burpee—squat down with your hands on the ground inside your feet, kick back into a pushup position with your feet wide and hit the deck.
Then leap your feet forward, but focus even more on exploding upwards out of the hole than you typically would in a normal rep.
As you leap, bend your knees and bring them to your chest, tucking at the top, before extending your legs to land safely.
Hand Release Burpee
Why:
You’ll slow down and focus more on your time on the floor with this variation—which can be a great tendency-breaker if you’re rushing through your standard reps. You’ll also add some back work to the burpee, engaging lats and rhomboids when you lift your hands off the ground and squeeze your shoulder blades. If there’s a criticism with the burpee, it’s that the move can batter your shoulders, but the hand-release moment helps offset that.
How to Do It:
Move through the first steps of the standard burpee, but pause once your chest hits the deck.
Raise both hands off the floor for a full beat.
Press back down into the floor to raise up through the jump.
Burpee to Jump Lunge
Why:
Swap out the pure explosiveness of the standard burpee for a more controlled jump lunge. You'll get a unilateral challenge and add an extra step for more movement.
How to Do It:
Perform a standard burpee rep.
Once you’re back on your feet, hop and cycle one leg forward, the other back, allowing your knee to lightly tap the ground (for your own sake, avoid slamming the floor).
Immediately jump and switch your legs to the opposite side and repeat.
Single-Leg Burpee
Why:
This one is a toughie, and an even more difficult unilateral challenge.
How to Do It:
Do all the same steps as the standard burpee. You’ll do the entire exercise on one leg, challenging your balance and unilateral strength.
Understandably, you might not squat as low as you would in a standard rep to get into position.
Make sure to move more slowly and deliberately here to stay steady on that one foot and focus on control; don’t let your knee cave inwards at any point.
Burpee Switch
Why:
The Switch will put your coordination to the test, especially when you string several reps together in a set.
How to Do It:
Go through all of the movements of the standard burpee, up until the jump.
Instead of jumping straight up, jump to turn around 180 degrees, then land cleanly facing the other side.
Jump straight back to face the front.
Lateral Jump Burpee
Why:
You’ll need even more floor space to take on this variation, but you’ll be doing something people don’t do often enough and incorporating lateral work into your training.
How to Do It:
Perform a standard rep, until you get to the jump.
Instead of leaping upwards, spring laterally to the side.
Immediately squat down into the next rep—but then, instead of using your jumps to travel even further around your gym, leap back to the starting spot.
Try This Smart 5-Minute Burpee Workout
Skip out on aimless sets of burpees (and the potential risk of injury that can come with unfocused work) and try this well-designed workout from fitness coach
Kurt Ellis
. Rather than ripping through reps at a breakneck pace, you'll be challenged to perform the hand release variation described above.
How to Do It:
Start a timer for 5 minutes.
For the first minute, you'll perform a single pushup to loaded beast rep immediately followed by 10 hand release burpees. Rest for the remainder of the period.
For Minute 2, add a rep to the first movement, while removing a rep for the second (so, two pushup to loaded beast reps, nine hand release burpees).
Continue with this ascending-descending ladder structure through to Minute 5.

How to Master the Bulgarian Split Squat to Grow Your Leg Muscles
You're probably getting into position for this leg crusher incorrectly. Here's how to fix that.

MOST MOVEMENT DOESN'T
occur with both feet planted on the floor. You walk by putting one foot in front of the other, you go up stairs one at a time, and you might even hop over a puddle on a rainy day by springing forward off one foot. To build truly strong legs, you need to incorporate exercises into your strength training routine that challenge your limbs independently. That's why movements like the Bulgarian split squat (a.k.a. the rear foot elevated split squat) are essential to your training.
The Bulgarian split squat puts you in
a unilateral position
, meaning you'll be working one side of your body at a time. This is key. Not only are you addressing muscle imbalances that your standard squats might mask, you'll also have the chance to
hone your athleticism
as you fight to maintain your position throughout each rep.
While the Bulgarian split squat is a great exercise for all types of trainees, it is slightly more technical than the average squat. Here,
Men's Health
fitness director
Ebenezer Samuel, C.S.C.S.
, explains best way to do the Bulgarian split squat so you can get to gains even more quickly. ﻿
How to Do the Bulgarian Split Squat
Follow these form cues to learn how to do the Bulgarian split squat. Once you've read the step-by-step directions, follow along for some higher-level tips from Samuel to dive deeper into the exercise.
Start on the floor in front of the bench (or whatever stable platform you have on hand).
Place one foot up onto the bench, then get into a position where your front foot is planted on the floor with a vertical shin (in relation to the ground). Your thigh should be parallel to the ground, forming a 90 degree angle at the knee.
Grab the weights off the floor.
Tighten your core and drive your ribcage in. Keep your neck neutral, looking straight ahead. Squeeze your shoulder blades to create tension.
Stand up, hinging forward slightly to avoid overextending your back.
Lower yourself down, working to keep your shin in that vertical position. Don't allow your back knee to hit the ground; stop an inch from the floor if you can.
Squeeze your glutes hard to keep your knee in the proper position, then press your front foot off the floor to drive up.

More Tips for Mastering the Bulgarian Split Squat
Start At The Bottom
Eb says:
The biggest mistake I see with the Bulgarian split squat is the setup, and if you setup wrong, you'll never get the Bulgarian split squat right. If your leg is too close to the bench, you wind up with a bad front knee position that's going to contribute to knee pain. If it's too far, you won't get the proper stretch on your back leg and you'll miss half the beauty of the Bulgarian. So find your position on the ground first, then stand up.
Back Knee Never Touches
Eb says:
﻿The Bulgarian split squat is best used as an exercise that demonstrates controlled movement, not explosion, so think about owning the eccentric (lowering phase)—and work to own the bottom of each rep, too. To own that bottom position, don't let your back knee hit the ground. Once that back knee touches the ground, this basically becomes a loaded couch stretch.
We want it to be something more than that so you can build leg and glute strength. So force yourself to stop an inch before your back knee hits the ground, and pause in this position for a split second. This will also force you to demonstrate control in that bottom position instead of relying on a bounce out of the hole.
Glutes On
Eb says:
﻿You have to pay attention to plenty of factors in the Bulgarian split squat, and the movement pattern itself will take some getting used to, but don't let any of that be an excuse to not keep your glutes active, as they should be on any squat or deadlift motion.
Letting your glutes relax during a Bulgarian leaves you open to letting your front knee track inward, a potentially damaging position. Keeping your glutes on will prevent this from happening, and also help you derive optimal benefit from the Bulgarian split squat. When you power out of the hole in a Bulgarian, it's very often almost all glute that drives that charge.﻿
Benefits of the Bulgarian Split Squat
The Bulgarian split squat is effective at building muscle and strength, hitting the glutes, hamstrings, and quads. Plus, it's a unilateral exercise that helps to address muscle imbalances and hone athleticism. The split stance helps train mobility and flexibility on the rear leg. Plus, you can use multiple forms of load to execute the move—dumbbell, kettlebells, or barbells.
What You Need to Do the Bulgarian Split Squat
To pull off the Bulgarian split squat, you'll need a stable raised platform (like a weight bench or if you're at home, an ottoman or couch) to prop your elevated foot. You can do the exercise without weights and still get a solid workout, but you'll reap the most strength and muscle gains by using weight. You can use dumbbells, kettlebells, or barbells held in a variety of different grips, like the suitcase hold at your sides, racked, and more.
How to Add the Bulgarian Split Squat to Your Workouts
There are a few different ways you can add this move into your workouts.
Start by mastering the move with just your bodyweight. This will help you nail down the correct form. Since they’re unloaded, you can add these in as a finisher to your leg day to really burn out your quads and glutes. Don’t be afraid to really jack up the reps when you program them like this, Samuel says. Aim for 3 sets of 15 to 20 reps on each leg.
Slowly start to incorporate weight once you feel you have the form mastered. This is a big compound movement that requires a lot of energy so keep it early in your workout so you can push it on fresher legs. Sandwich it between your heavy-load moves like squats or deadlifts, and your safer, machine-isolated isolated movements like leg extensions. If you’re loading them, keep the volume a bit lower, Samuel says. Aim for 3 sets of 8 to 10 reps.﻿﻿

This variation gives you some key differences from the standard exercise that can pay off for your gains.

THE STANDARD BARBELL
deadlift
is widely esteemed as a strength training essential. For good reason, too: The
compound lift
fires up the hamstrings and glutes, while engaging other muscles through your quads, back, and abs. For most guys, deadlift day begins and ends with the Olympic (or straight) barbell. This unforgiving implement is generally how most strength sports (like powerlifting and strongman) engage with the deadlift, and it is a useful tool to build strength and size—but it might not be the most functional way to train the movement. That distinction goes to another piece of gear:
the trap bar
.
The trap bar shifts your grip from the front of your body to the sides, which is a much more natural way to lift a heavy load off the floor. When you’re hinging over to pick up a heavy load of groceries, you’re probably not ending up with the bags in front of your thighs—but that’s the way that you lift when you do the barbell deadlift. You’d struggle to walk those bags into the house if you hold them in that same position. We’re used to carrying loads on our sides, so why not train our deadlifts the same way? The hexagonal shape of the trap bar puts the load at your sides.
Still, doing the trap bar deadlift isn’t as simple as just pulling the weight off the floor. Like other variations, the trap bar deadlift requires the proper mechanics, says
Men’s Health
fitness director
Ebenezer Samuel C.S.C.S.
, as he and senior editor
Brett Williams, N.A.S.M.
, demonstrate the essentials that can keep your heavyweight lifts safe and effective.
How to Do the Trap Bar Deadlift
Position yourself inside the trap bar, with your shins aligned with (or just in front of) the center of the bar.
Push your butt back as far as possible, bend your knees, and reach down to grip the handles. Grip as tightly as possible.
Keep your head in a neutral position, keeping your gazed fixed at something in front of you. Squeeze your shoulder blades to create tension, and turn the pits of your elbows forward, facing out.
Make sure your hips are lower than your shoulders, then prepare to initiate the lift.
Push your feet through the floor to stand straight up, squeezing your glutes at the top.
To finish the rep, push your butt back as far as you can, then bend your knees to set the weight down.
Follow these more detailed cues from Samuel to avoid common mistakes nail the form properly.
Men's Health
Know Your Position
The first key to a proper trap-bar deadlift, Samuel says, is aligning yourself with the bar: Make sure your shins are lined up directly with the center of the trap bar. You want to keep the weight in front of you—not behind you—so make sure to be a little bit in front of the bar to create optimum leverage. “Instantly you've got the weight out in front of you,” Samuel says. “And we want that weight center so that all we have to do when we deadlift is stand up.”
The second step in proper positioning is pushing those glutes back as far as possible, then bending your knees before you approach the bar. From there, it’s critical that you get a good and hard grip on the bar. “Be aggressive, don’t let this hang in your fingers,” Samuel says. “You’re going to need all the strength and stability in this position, and holding the bar tightly is a major component.”
When it comes to head and neck positioning, a few options are available. While it’s not necessarily wrong to be looking up throughout the lift, Samuel says it could potentially lead to some neck discomfort. Instead, look to create a more neutral head position. (An additional tip, Samuel says, is to have a partner place a broomstick on top of you to find that proper deadlift alignment.)
Create Tension
Now that you have your glutes and grip set, create proper tension by protecting your shoulders and biceps. Samuel suggests squeezing your shoulder blades tight, then turning the pits of your elbows forward. “You’ve instantly turned on your rotator cuff musculature on, your lats. Now you want to carry all of this tension into the deadlift,” Samuel says.
Before you finally begin that pull, another tip Samuel suggests is to make sure your hips are lower than your shoulders. Get your hips higher than your shoulders, your back becomes the lever for the deadlift. “We don't want that to happen,” Samuel says. “We want our hamstrings and glutes to drive this motion. And to do that, we've got to make sure that hips stay lower than shoulders.”
There’s one final point to mark off your checklist, an important one, Samuel says. Do
not
sabotage your setup by “diving down” with your arms in a misguided attempt to create more power. “There's no point in doing that,” Samuel says. “As soon as you drop your arms, you lose your back position, your hips are higher, and you’ve lost all the tension you worked to create. You wasted everything you did before the rep.”
Don’t Neglect the Descent
The back half of the lift is equally as important as the front half. If you lower the bar back down in an incorrect position, tension will roll into the low back, making injury possible. But, gym bros everywhere slam weight down and forget to maintain proper positioning on the descent.
Start this movement by pushing the butt back, maintaining the straight line through the spine until you feel as though you can’t push back anymore, Samuel says. This mimics the positioning at the front of the lift. Once you hit the end point (which will feel like a deep stretch in your hamstrings), drop the hips by bending at the knee until the bar is lowered to the ground.
“Don’t be afraid to treat this like a focused eccentric movement. Take your time getting down there so you can learn the motion,” Samuel says.
Determine Your Method
There’s two methods to determine the pacing of your reps. The “touch and go” method does exactly as it sounds— the bar taps the floor, and you quickly push into the next rep. A more traditional approach involves releasing the weight to the ground and resetting position before popping into the next rep.
It’s important to decide which method you’re taking before you begin your lift, because the touch and go method requires more conscious core activation, says Samuel. Know which route you plan to take before starting— if you choose to touch and go at the last second, your core may not be ready, transferring tension into your low back.
Samuel recommends starting with the traditional method when you’re first learning technique. This way, your body has time to get a feel for proper mechanics before trying touch and go.
Benefits of the Trap Bar Deadlift
﻿YOU'LL HAVE A
more natural motion when you lift than when you use the standard barbell. “It's going to be a lot easier and a lot more natural for you to pick up in the trap bar," Samuel says. "You're going to be able to get explosive with this, use it for power and still move some serious load.”
This can be extremely useful for people who have anatomical issues that aren't ideal for the standard version of the exercise (people with long legs, low back issues, etc).
Once you master the form, you should also be able to lift more weight with the trap bar deadlift than any other exercise in your arsenal. This can be useful for building strength and muscle.
Common Trap Bar Deadlift Mistakes
JUST BECAUSE
be working within a more natural position than your conventional deadlifts you shouldn't ease up on fundamental hinge mechanics and proper posture. Make sure to keep your neck in a neutral position by keeping your gaze fixed on the ground slightly in front of you (in other words, don't look up when you lift).
Another common mistake is engaging in the lift with your hips above your shoulders. Then, the back becomes the lever for the movement, and you'll put yourself at risk of injury.
Samuel also warns of losing tension created by your posture by dipping your arms and bending your elbows before you initiate the lift. Also be wary of your hips—if you start the movement with your hips, you won't be engaging your glutes and hamstrings properly.
Who Should Do Trap Bar Deadlifts
THE TRAP BAR
deadlift is a great movement for people who have issues with the standard straight bar deadlift. This is also a potentially better choice for lifters who are more focused on building muscle than sport-specific performance (bodybuilders vs. powerlifters, CrossFitters, or strongman competitors who perform barbell deadlifts in competition). That said, the trap bar can also serve as a great supplement to standard deadlifts for those strength sport athletes.
How to Use the Trap Bar Deadlift in Your Workouts
﻿AGAIN
, THE TRAP
bar deadlift should be a heavyweight movement. You should program it as a leadoff for your lower body or pull workouts, especially if you want to push weight, so you come to it as fresh as possible.
Still, you shouldn't just pile on the plates right away. Samuel recommends that beginners start with four sets of eight to 10 reps to start. Once you're confident in your pulls, you can add more weight and work in configurations like four sets of three to five reps and even single rep sets.

3 Hip Thrust Variations to Upgrade Your Glute Gains
3 Hip Thrust Variations to Upgrade Your Glute Gains
Level up from bodyweight moves and build your lower body by adding weight, changing your tempo, and getting explosive.

THE BODYWEIGHT HIP
thrust is one of the best starting exercises to train your glutes, says
Men’s Health
Fitness Director
Ebenezer Samuel, C.S.C.S.
Once you're ready to progress for more gains, however, there are multiple variations at your disposal to help you grow your glutes.
Samuel and the Editor-in-Chief of
Women’s Health
,
Liz Plosser
, demonstrate three hip thrust alternatives to upgrade your next leg day. The following exercises will help you overload the glutes, train one leg at a time, and express more power.
All you need is a willingness to learn, a little patience, and a few pieces of equipment (a
barbell
,
weight bench
, and
weight plates
). You'll do more than just add weight here—these smart exercises will use different tempos and techniques to build more muscle and even train explosiveness, too
How to Do the Bodyweight Hip Thrust
Men's Health
Get down on the ground, with your back facing the bench. Place your shoulder blades against the bench.
Pick a point directly in front of you to focus your gaze to help to keep your spine in a neutral position.
Lift your hips up to find the proper position for your feet. Your shins should be parallel with the floor, with your feet about hip-width apart.
Drive your hips up, squeezing your glutes as much as possible. Open your knees up as you drive to help protect your knees. Pause at the top, emphasizing the contraction.
Lower back down to the start.
3 Hip Thrust Variations
DON
’T DO ALL
three of these exercises as a single workout. Instead, add one into your current leg day, swapping it in for your current hip thrust variation or the most glute-dominant movement in your routine.
Barbell Hip Thrust
Men's Health
Why
: “Now we’re starting to load [the hip thrust] a little bit, which gives us more chance to push our glutes a little bit further,” says Samuel.
How to Do it
:
Sit in front of a bench that’s perpendicular to your body with a loaded barbell set across your legs.
Roll the barbell so it’s sitting in the crease of your hips and place your upper back on the bench. Thrust the weight up; place your feet far enough out so that your thighs and shins form a 90-degree angle at the apex of the movement.
Squeeze your glutes at the top of the rep.
Slowly lower the barbell back to the floor.
Sets and Reps
: Try 3 sets of eight to 10 reps
Eccentric Overload Hip Thrust
Men's Health
Why
: This variation introduces two training principles to ramp up the muscle-building potential: an
eccentric overload focus
and a
unilateral setup
. “You’re going to hip thrust up with both legs, and then we come down with a single leg,” says Samuel. “That’s a lot of challenge on your single glute and a really good way to add more overload to your hip thrust."
How to Do it
:
Set up the same way you did for the barbell hip thrust.
At the top of the rep, drive your right knee to your chest and lower the weight back to the ground.
Complete all eight to 10 reps. Rest for 10 seconds before working your left leg.
Sets and Reps
: Try 3 sets of eight to 10 reps on each leg
Plyometric Hip Thrust
Men's Health
Why
: “You’re driving up so powerfully that your foot comes off the ground, and you’re airborne for a split second,” Samuel says. “That explosiveness will contribute to athleticism and push your glutes further.”
How to Do it
:
Sit in front of a bench that’s perpendicular to your body.
Lean back so your upper back is on the bench and your legs form a 90-degree angle at the top of your hip thrust. Extend your arms to your sides and rest your forearms on the bench for extra support.
Raise one leg off of the ground. Now, drive your hips up as explosively, so your other foot comes off the floor.
Land squarely back on that foot, keeping your other leg raised.
Sets and Reps
: 3 to 4 sets of three reps on each leg.

BRIDGERTON
STAR JONATHAN
Bailey is saying goodbye to the toned and lean stature fans are used to seeing on his hit Netflix show, and is building up his biceps up as part of a major body transformation for a leading role in the upcoming
Jurassic World
film (which will also star Scarlett Johansson and Mahershala Ali, among others).
Bailey’s trainer, Rik Melling, shared images of Bailey’s new build to his Instagram story, as he lifted two  dumbbells in the midst of what appears to be seen as him repping out some
bicep curls.
Some fans had a lot to say about his new look, sharing their thoughts to X.

Jurassic World 3 Makes a Major Dinosaur Change
The actor
confirmed his participation in the next installment of the beloved dinosaur film franchise back in May on
The Tonight Show.
Some fans feel the decision for Bailey to beef up for the role is unnecessary. His transformation comes just as
attention has been at a high for stars with leaner/softer builds
, and there's also the fact that the stars of the original
Jurassic Park
—Sam Neill and Jeff Goldblum—weren't particularly ripped themselves.
The actor has had a busy couple of months, with the recent release of
Bridgerton
Season 3 on Netflix, his role in the
Wicked
adaption (due out later this year) and now his confirmed casting as one of the leads in the (still officially untitled) next
Jurassic World
movie. Bailey will definitely be seen in many household screens in the next upcoming months, and it is clear he's taking his roles seriously—starting by changing his body in ways that he sees fit.
The new
Jurassic
film will be directed by Gareth Edwards (
Rogue One, The Creator
)
and is expected to be released in summer of 2025.

Got a nude scene coming up? Alan Ritchson does. The actor shared a look at how he's preparing in the gym to go in the buff for the upcoming
season 3 of
Reacher
.
Ritchson has undergone a strict regimen for his role in the Amazon Prime show
Reacher
. Ritchson shared some of these tips with
MH
when we visited him at home,
from consuming up to 4,000 calories
a day, to his home workouts consisting of his beloved incline bench. The actor often showcases how he maintains “that beach body,” for his role on his social channels, giving his fans a behind the scenes look at how he attained his buff build and how he maintains it. In this short one minute clip, Ritchson demos the routine he took on just before he had to shoot a particularly steamy scene as Jack Reacher.
"I was squeezing this in before work," Ritchson wrote in text overlaid on the footage. "Clothes had to come off so I wanted to hit the whole body."
View full post on Instagram
Ritchson's latest workout consists first of  spending 16 minutes hiking up the
stair machine
, hitting a new PR. He then heads over to the cable machine machine and does four rounds of 25 reps of the
cable fly
. Without stopping, he pounds out four sets of 25 reps on of shoulder presses where he “threw in some
Arnolds
” into the mix. After that, he flipped the script to train his back muscles with another four sets of 25 reps of cable rows. At this point he shared with his followers “I'm pretty gassed at this point.” Ritchson ends his workout by shifting to lower body work, grinding through four round of 25 reps of leg presses and calf raises.
"Ran out of time for more (thank God)," he wrote after finishing the circuit.
No wonder Ritchson's character
Jack Reacher
is ripped. According to his captions, this was all before a full day of filming. But the most important news for Reacher fans: There's likely going to be a very naked, very jacked Jack Reacher hitting your TV screens in the near future.

Star Ernie Hudson Trains to Feel Good. Looking Good Is Just a Bonus.
The actor shares the "common sense" philosophy that keeps him fit at 78, and how he finally ghostbusted his belly fat.

This story is part of
This Is 50+
—an in-depth look at guys who are thriving later in life, with tips and tricks on how all of us can future-proof our bodies.
ERNIE HUDSON HAS
been a central part of the
Ghostbusters
franchise ever since its start in 1984, so it took the actor a little by surprise when his presence at the premiere of the latest sequel
Ghostbusters:
Frozen Empire
took the internet by storm
. Notably, his large biceps and just how virile he looked, as if he were one of the newer, younger members of the cast rather than the old guard.
"It's kinda strange, because this is the fifth
Ghostbusters
. I've been doing this for well over 50 years, and those same arms have been there all the time," he tells
Men's Health
.
You've probably seen the pictures by now: Hudson walking the red carpet in jeans and a fitted black tee-shirt, biceps on show, looking buffer than many people expected at the age of 78.
"I was actually a little embarrassed with the T-shirt, but my jacket had a smudge on it," he explains. "I wasn't flexing or anything, I didn't really think about it. But it's nice to be noticed. It's flattering in a lot of ways. But when the age thing comes up, it's like, 'oh we're surprised you're still alive!' It would be nice if they said I was sexy and
then
say I'm 78."
Dave Benett/WireImage
Ernie Hudson on the red carpet in March 2024, looking strong (at 78!).
Not that the actor known for work as diverse as
Oz, The Hand That Rocks the Cradle, Miss Congeniality
and
Quantum Leap
has much regard for any expectations and stereotypes around what it means to be a man of a certain age
.
He's seen too many friends place limits on themselves, and age prematurely as a result of that way of thinking.
"Their discipline changes," he says. "They think they can say whatever they want and be a jerk, or that they don't have to take as much responsibility. They think they have to do less physically, and so they do less. And you end up kind of diminishing yourself; you have no purpose. Whereas I think it has nothing to do with how old you are. There might come a time when I can't do as much; we're all getting older, these bodies aren't built to last, but there's no point in speeding that up, or using it as an excuse to be lazy or irresponsible."
You might assume that Hudson is extremely strict and regimented in his fitness and nutrition, but he says there are no absolutes in his world. When he was young (growing up in a very religious community), he would fast for several days at a time, consuming only water. He doesn't do that anymore, although he has found that his natural eating habits are a neat match for intermittent fasting; he tends not to eat anything before noon, or after seven p.m.
"We all have a little voice inside that reminds us who we are...maybe not so much as a voice as what I call a common sense factor," he says. "We can look for answers, read books, go to seminars, ask someone else to guide us. But if we're really honest with ourselves, we know what do. You know you should drink water. You know should eat fruits and vegetables. You know that fast food on a daily basis is not good."
He also hasn't had alcohol in years, after an incident at 19 when he blacked out and woke up in a drunk tank. "People had been throwing up in that cell, and the smell was so strong that I started throwing up. After that, every time I went to drink, the smell would turn my stomach, and I just couldn't do it for years. I just ask myself; do I need this? I get a little paranoid with marijuana—actually I get a
lot
paranoid
, and so I just feel none of that's for me."
Of course, his build doesn't come out of nowhere, and Hudson credits his broad shoulders and noticeable biceps to his first-ever job, shoveling dirt. That frame has served as a believable canvas when it then came to building the physique of a boxer, an FBI agent, a SWAT sergeant, or whatever else a role required of him. And those roles kept coming, with Hudson still being cast in a hunk-adjacent capacity well into his sixties thanks to projects like
Grace and Frankie
.
"When I turned 50, people said, your body's going to change," Hudson recalls. "Nothing changed. Sixties, nothing changed. Seventies... there was a change."
Get the plan
It was then, he explains, that he was "visited by Mr. Jiggles," his term for the stubborn belly fat that appeared and was seemingly there to stay. "Fasting didn't get rid of Mr. Jiggles. He just hung in there, you know, and he talks to you at night. He whispers:
we need to eat something
. And suddenly, I'm feeding Mr. Jiggles. So a couple of years ago, I thought:
I need to get to the gym
."
Despite never having really liked formal workouts in the gym—"I'm just not one of those guys"—Hudson has stayed consistent, training three times a week. On Mondays, he works on coordination and balance. On Wednesday, he does Pilates for mobility. "Ever since I was a kid, I've always made a point of being able to touch my toes," he says. "So at some point during the day, every day, I'll do a stretch to make sure I can still touch my toes."
Then on Fridays, he does strength training, which he has learned to enjoy more than he ever used to when he was workout out for roles. "You come away feeling really pumped, and that's sort of fun," he says. "I have this trainer who's in his twenties, and he pushes me like I'm in
my
twenties. And on the days I don't work out, I try to get in at least a half-hour walk at a nice pace, get the heart rate up over 110 BPM. That seems to be most effective for Mr. Jiggles!"

Just as impressive, about 35 years later (in Ghostbusters again, with Bill Murray).
And has Mr. Jiggles been busted like one of Hudson's on-screen monsters?
"He's been subdued," he says. "He hasn't totally left the building."
Following the recent thirsty response he's received post-
Ghostbusters: Frozen Empire
, appreciation for Hudson is at an all-time high: a nice place to be for a man who will be turning 80 next year. But that's not distracting him from what really matters.
"Remember Dick Clark? From
American Bandstand
?" he asks. "He always looked amazing. It seemed to me he looked like a perpetual teenager, until one day he didn't. And we don't know what the future holds. Maybe one day I'll wake up and, well, who knows. So I'm not concerned with living as long as possible. I just want to live as full and complete a life as I can, to enjoy the time I have, to live a
good
life, and be an example of what God can do."
This is just the beginning. See what else guys at 50+ are thinking, doing, and crushing here.

Watch David Beckham Crush an Ab Workout in Shirtless Gym Video
The soccer legend just showed off his impressive core strength.

DAVID BECKHAM HAS
been off the soccer field for over 10 years now, but he is still training like a pro athlete, and he has the physique to show for it. The ex-Manchester United legend just showed off his lean, tattooed torso—and impressive core strength—in a shirtless Instagram Reel captured during his latest workout.
In the video, Beckham can be seen completing a giant set of
hanging knee raises
, performing 20 repetitions before dropping back to the floor. Performance coach Bobby Rich can be heard correcting Beckham's form, shouting "knees up to your chest!" to ensure he doesn't cheat on those exhausting final reps.
View this post on Instagram
A post shared by David Beckham (@davidbeckham)
Hanging knee raises
absolutely light up your abdominals, but it's not just your core muscles that should be engaged during this move.
While you're hanging from a pullup bar, it's not a
dead
hang: you should be squeezing your shoulder blades nice and hard to maintain a fixed, stable position, which will stop your body from swinging and keep that momentum to a minimum
.
Then bend your knees and curl your legs all the way up, until your butt is visible from the front. "That ensures that we're not just moving at our hips, but our abs are driving the motion," says
Men's Health
fitness director Ebenezer
Samuel C.S.C.S. "That's because our abs are creating all this spinal flexion and all of this rounding—we're creating that and we're managing that as we're doing the motion."
Hold that position at the top end of the movement for a second to really squeeze the abs, before lowering your legs again.
And don't worry, you don't need to be doing sets of 20 reps like Beckham right away. The great thing about a hanging leg raise is that your abs are under tension for the entirety of the movement, so you're working them hard even during relatively short sets. Start by trying three sets of five.

Hugh Jackman Shared a Look at How He Built His Biceps for
Deadpool & Wolverine
The actor got back in superhero shape for the upcoming sequel.

HUGH JACKMAN IS
about to make his debut in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, after playing one of the most iconic X-Men characters on and off since the year 2000. He will co-star with Ryan Reynolds in the forthcoming third
Deadpool
movie, recently revealed to be titled
Deadpool & Wolverine—
and despite being
25 years older than he was when he first got the part of mutant Logan, he is committing to the superhero body once again.
"It's been five years and I'd really never thought I'd come back and I'm really, really excited about it,"
Jackman said back in 2022
, when it was first announced that he would be reprising the role. "I'm going to have the time of my life... I can tell you that I started back at the gym and I'm eating a lot."
Jackman added that he'll be playing a
slightly different take on Wolverine
than we've seen in previous movies, saying: "He's definitely angrier, sort of grumpy, and he's gonna take a lot of free shots at Ryan Reynolds. Physically, that is."
The Australian actor has shared plenty of insights into
his training for the movie
in the year and a half since, using the hashtag #BecomingWolverineAgain to document his progress—and repeatedly trolling his
co-star Ryan Reynolds
, with whom he has been in an
"arms race"
to see who can get in the best shape.

In his most recent Instagram post, a throwback to one of his Wolverine workouts from last summer, Jackman shouts out his trainer Beth Lewis for always being by his side throughout the physically grueling experience. In the clip, Jackman can be seen building his biceps with a set of barbell curls, cheered on by Lewis and her "trusted assistant," French bulldog Andy, who makes a brief appearance at the end of the video.
Deadpool & Wolverine
will be released on July 26.

I recently had a horrible training session where nothing went right. How can I bounce back after a bad workout?
-Just One of Those Days
EVERY SO OFTEN
when I’m in the gym, I’ll realize that I just don’t feel
right
. Sometimes it’s in the way I’m moving through my back squats, struggling to hit my typical depth no matter how low I tell myself I should be able to go. Other times I straight-up miss lifts I usually rep with ease—recently, I failed early in my bench press sets, stymied at the weight I easily pushed through the week before when my triceps just wouldn’t cooperate. On days like this, I worry too, fearing I’m doomed to regress. Are my gains really at risk?
The answer is, probably not. Bad days will happen. Thankfully, that doesn’t mean you’re doomed to lose your hard-earned PRs or that your muscles will suddenly deflate.
A
Sports Medicine
systematic review
investigating strength development and retention in athletes found that strength levels can be maintained without significant loss up to three weeks after detraining (which means a full break from regular workouts). What does this tell us? Even if you’re not on your A-game during a session, you’re probably not going to suddenly lose everything you’ve built after one (or even a few) bad days, as long as you’re consistently putting in effort.
Knowing this might help you to feel better when you’re looking at the big picture (as it should), but finding a way to reset for the workout following your bad one is important to stay motivated and consistent with your training. You need to be able to bounce back. I talked to a few experts to find out how.
Determine What Might Be Behind Your Bad Day
Bad days don’t just start when you walk onto the gym floor, so you should consider all the factors that could have contributed to your off day when you’re looking to bounce back. The old saying that you “slept on the wrong side of the bed” holds a bit more weight here than you might expect.
“Many factors contribute to sub-optimal performance, including the sleep and nutrition you had the day/night before, your overall stress levels and responsibility, and lastly, your age as an individual and as a lifter,” says
Men’s Health
Advisory Board member and trainer
Lee Boyce
.
A poor night’s sleep or a missed meal could definitely be the culprit behind your poor performance. How do you address that going forward? Simple: Get some rest and fuel up right before your next session. If you can’t control for those situations—maybe there’s a project for work cutting into your ZZZs, or you skip your breakfast in a rush to get out the door—keep these circumstances in mind as you approach your workout. You might not be physically capable of hitting 100 percent, so adjust your expectations accordingly.
One other significant factor that could play into your performance has to do with the types of workouts you’re attempting. Maybe you’re just starting out and you want to go as hard as possible. Or maybe you are experienced, but you’re still pushing yourself to train at peak capacity without the proper rest, recovery, and fueling plans in place. Either way, you’re setting yourself up for bad days if your program doesn’t match your level of preparedness. “It's easy to be overzealous with heavy lifting volume and intensity, which eventually fries the nervous system, causing it to revolt in the form of poor performance and a greater need for rest and recovery,” Boyce notes. “Instead, focusing on simple, effective programs that keep the ‘less is more’ mantra in mind is the key to being able to show up every day and crush it in the gym.”
Last year, I was training for a marathon and kept the same five-day strength training program I had in place I was doing before I added all the road mileage. My lifting numbers dropped and I felt like crap running, so I realized something had to give. Once I pulled back on the gym volume, switching to a three-day split, I felt better in the gym.
Identify What a Bad Day Means for You—and Make a Change
Bad workouts can be as much about your mental approach as any physical issues you’re having, according to Boyce. If you’re going into your training with a very limited or binary idea about what constitutes success—in other words, if your mindset is that if you miss a lift or fall short on a set, you fail—you’re not going to have a good time when even the smallest aspects of your plan don’t pan out.
“Taking an all-or-none approach to your goals, gains, or fitness is an easy way to end up disappointed at some point, and possibly derail your focus and mental health,” he says. “It's important to remember that everyone has bad days and every lifter has bad workouts.”
Your fix: identify what exactly constitutes a “bad” workout for you. Is it bad because you’re not able to do the exercises exactly as you planned, or because you’re just not feeling good in your body? I get discouraged when I can’t hit the same amount of weight I did for the same lift in the previous workout—but then I try to remember that
failure is in no small degree tied to success
, and is in some ways necessary for strength training progress. We won't always hit every rep of a workout. But we can learn a lot from these "failed" sets.
Learn How to Adjust
Once you've determined what is causing you to struggle, you'll need to shift your approach to avoid falling into the same negative patterns.
“Bad days are also more about perception than reality, so sometimes changing your entire approach to training can mitigate the feeling that you’re having a “bad day’” says
Men’s Health
fitness director
Ebenezer Samuel, C.S.C.S.
He suggests shifting your strategy from working for a set number of reps to instead using the method of “reps in reserve.” This means that you perform an exercise just as you would normally, but rather than hitting an arbitrary total rep count, you stop when you feel you could only complete one or two more reps with good form. “You’ll know from your best days exactly what 2RIR (reps in reserve) on a front squat feels like, and you’re working to that level of muscular fatigue instead of a number,” Samuel says. “Some days, that might look like a set of 10 at 225. Other days, it might not.” Regardless of the number of reps you’ve performed, you know you're delivering similar effort on both good days and bad.
Boyce takes this adjustment approach a step further, noting that you can—and should—feel empowered to switch up your program when you don’t feel 100 percent. He calls this training "intuitively." If something isn't working, says Boyce, you should consider tweaking your lifting volume or load, or even changing to a different exercise.
That’s a shift that I made recently the day my triceps failed me as I was benching. I still had a lot of presses left to complete the workout—so I picked up significantly lighter dumbbells when I moved from the barbell bench to the incline press. I focused more on my tempo than pushing pure weights, so I still felt strong.
Remember: even if you don’t love every single moment of your workout, fitness is supposed to be a positive aspect of your life. If your overall approach isn’t one that prioritizes feeling good, you need to adjust. “One key to any workout strategy is that you shouldn’t ever leave the gym feeling crushed, physically or mentally,” says Samuel, citing
MH
Advisory Board member Don Saladino. “Always aim to leave the gym feeling successful, even on your worst days.”
Use that as your guiding principle to beat the bad days. When you start to feel like things are flying off the handle, shift your approach to get back to the good. You are in control of your experience. Once you learn to adjust to your needs, the bad days will start looking more like opportunities.

Should I be taking pre-workout?
-Supplement Suspicious
WHEN I FIRST
started lifting weights, my friends and I talked almost as much about what was in our shaker bottles as we did about the number of plates we could stack onto a barbell. I would watch as they took bombastically labeled tubs of neon-colored powder out of their gym bags, bragging about how jacked up they were about to get before we hit the free weight floor. They were all chugging pre-workout, the gym supplement industry’s jet fuel, a mix of caffeine and other substances meant to provide an extra boost of energy and focus to power your workout.
I never joined them. Like you, I wasn’t sure if I should be taking the stuff. Rumors about sketchy side effects and banned products scared me off, and I wasn’t willing to shell out cash for more supplements than the discount protein powder if I wasn’t sure exactly what benefits I’d be getting from it.
I eventually established my own workout routine without my group of buddies, and pre-workout wasn’t part of it. Still, I’ve sometimes wondered if I was missing out. Could I supercharge my training with a few sips from the right shake? To get to the bottom of the bottle, I talked to some experts about the place pre-workout might have in a well-rounded training plan.
What Is Pre-Workout?
You might be wondering exactly what pre-workout
is
if your only source of information about it is jacked-up fitness influencers on TikTok or your most excitable training buddy. Generally, pre-workout supplements are drinks or powders meant to be consumed shortly before exercise to provide extra energy for your training session.
Men’s Health
Nutrition Advisor
Dezi Abeyta, RDN
, says that some key ingredients in many pre-workout supps are beta alanine, which can help to promote muscle endurance, L-arginine or L-citrulline, which can help to optimize blood flow, and of course,
caffeine
for extra energy. Pre-workouts also often include
electrolytes
, other
amino acids
, and
creatine
, all of which can help you perform your best in the gym and make major muscle gains. “People really love the pump, people really love that energetic feel of going to the gym,” Abeyta says. “The way that I would look at this is that a pre-workout can actually facilitate some really responsive and beneficial things.”
That sounds great—so is there a catch?
Are Pre-Workout Supplements Effective?
The biggest question I go back to about pre-workout is whether or not it can actually provide benefits I can't get elsewhere. According to Abeyta, that all depends on your habits and behaviors outside the gym.
“I always tell the clients that I work with that a supplement can't ‘out-supplement’ a really bad and imbalanced diet,” he says. If you’re chugging pre-workout after loading up on unhealthy foods—or without eating enough to fuel your session—you’re not going to get the benefits. “If you're under-fueling, your pre-workout is going to provide you with energy, but it's not actually going to give your body what it needs from an energy perspective as it goes into a workout and as it goes into that recovery period, where it needs you to be taking those nutrients and sticking to those recovery tactics to grow and to continue to perform.”
Men’s Health
fitness director
Ebenezer Samuel, C.S.C.S
., says that pre-workout can be effective—but that doesn’t mean you should depend on it to drive your training sessions. “Big-picture, you don’t want to grow over-reliant on the focus that comes from a bottle,” he says. “Half of training to build muscle is about building your own mental strength, developing a strong
mind-muscle connection
and an ability to push yourself, and, at least sometimes, you should work to develop that without pre-workout.” Think of this like wearing
a lifting belt
or grips: You should use it only once you’ve exhausted your own ability.
Another important factor to consider (
as you would with any other supplement
) is whether you can trust that you’re taking matches with the claims on the bottle and that it’s safe. Abeyta says that you should make sure that whatever you’re using is third-party tested, meaning it has a label from
Informed Choice
,
Informed Sport
, or
NSF Certified for Sport
.
How Should I Use Caffeine with Pre-Workout?
I drink a lot of coffee. Maybe you do, too, or you have some other caffeinated drink that you enjoy as part of your diet. That means we’re already consuming caffeine—and it’s important to make sure that we understand how that might fit with a pre-workout supplement.
Citing
FDA guidelines
, Abeyta says that around 400 milligrams of caffeine per day (about four cups of coffee) is considered “safe and moderate consumption.” “Going a step further, 200 milligrams is considered a safe single serving,” he continues. If your pre-workout caffeine content is above that limit, or if you’re stacking your intake shortly after a cup of coffee or soda, you’re putting yourself in a bad spot. “We want to make sure that the serving size is actually done in a way that is not only intentional, but mindful.”
One major factor you need to consider for taking pre-workout with caffeine is the timing, since intake later in the day can throw off one of the most important factors for your recovery:
sleep
. “We also know that as little as 100 milligrams [of caffeine] in the body can produce some bad sleep habits or some bad sleep quality,” Abeyta says.
He recommends instituting a “caffeine curfew,” or a hard cutoff for your intake. “Anywhere from two o'clock to three o'clock is a really good time to abstain from caffeine,” he says. Along with this more mindful intake, Abeyta also recommends working to establish a consistent bedtime routine and consistent meal times, so that you’ve established a healthy baseline of behaviors. If you're an evening lifter, this means that pre-workout won't be a good choice for your gains.
Should You Take Pre-Workout?
We’ve established that pre-workout can be effective, and that there are some major caveats you should know about its usage. That isn’t exactly a clear answer to the original question: should you be using it for your workouts?
The answer comes down to your foundation, according to both experts. “My general rule on pre-workout is this: It’s not bad, but it shouldn’t be a replacement for proper rest and recovery between workouts,” Samuel says. “Pre-workout doesn’t fix three hours of sleep last night.”
Abeyta is even more focused on the other pillars of your routines and behavior. “Before we even engage with this idea of taking a pre-workout, we want to make sure that the foundation is there,” he says. “Are you sleeping well? Are you eating well? Are you moving well? And are you getting to a place where you are engaging in stress management well?” Once you can say yes to those questions—and you’ve considered the timing of your supplementation—you can think about saying yes to pre-workout.
If that’s a bit too abstract for you, or if you are really desperate for a training boost, consider this plan from Samuel: limit your intake to once a week (or twice a week max, if you’re someone with a heavy training load). “Reserve your pre-workout usage for the workouts that you least want to do, or the days when you’re feeling wiped out,” he says. This will help in two ways, according to Samuel: You’ll maximize the effect of the caffeine, and you’ll force yourself to be attuned to how your body feels rather than depending on it as a matter of practice. Think of pre-workout as your own secret stuff, deployed when you really need a boost, and it won’t become your kryptonite.

I’m stuck on a deadlift plateau. How do I break it?
–Can’t Reach My Strength Summit
WHEN I FIRST
started strength training as a teenaged football player, the deadlift was not part of my program. I didn’t begin pulling big weights until after my playing career was over. When I did, I was able to progress very quickly, like others who experience rapid gains when they start strength training. This is largely due to
neurological adaptations (typically referred to as "newbie gains")
, as my brain and body became familiar with the lift. After a few months, however, I found myself in the same position you're in now. I stalled out, even though I felt like I should've been able to progress. My rapid advance had ended, and I was worried I would be stuck with a mediocre deadlift for the rest of my gym life. This was disconcerting for me, someone who considered myself an experienced lifter—but it happens to everyone.
Thankfully, that didn’t wind up being my fate. I was able to break through my plateau, and recently achieved my goal of a 500-pound pull—and you’ll be able to break yours, too. You and I are far from the only people who have struggled to progress past a sticking point with deadlifts. It’s not the only exercise that guys find themselves struggling with, either. “The plateau is a common part of training during any of your larger, multi-joint lifts,” says
Men’s Health
fitness director
Ebenezer Samuel, C.S.C.S.
“And the easiest way to get past that plateau is to deconstruct the lift, figure out your weakest point, and directly address that weak point.”
There are a few common weak points when it comes to the deadlift. You might struggle to get the weight off the floor at the beginning of the pull. Or, you might have a tough time with the lockout at the top part of the movement, when you need to depend on your glutes for the all-important hip extension. Just holding all that weight might also be a major problem for your progression. Check out
our form guide
as an overall refresher; this might also help to determine which part is your biggest issue.
Before addressing your weak points, you should also consider what your goals are—and establish a specific target that will give you something to aim to achieve. If putting an extra plate on the bar is your main concern (most likely the case when you feel you’ve plateaued), you’ll need to approach the deadlift differently than if your overall aim is to pack on muscle to your posterior chain. “If you’re training purely for strength, as opposed to aesthetics, it’s here that you’ll understand the value of accessory lifts,” Samuel continues. “They allow you to address our large-lift weak points.”
You can follow this three-point plan from Samuel—which were all, in some way, part of my own path to a PR—to break past your plateau to finally pull more weight. Each step is designed to address a particular point in your pull, so whatever your problem is, you’ll find it addressed here.
Deadlift Plateau Buster: Add Deficit Lifts
Actually lifting the weight off the floor might be your biggest deadlift pain point. For some people, that has less to do with strength and more to do with your ability to move.
“If you’re struggling at the start of the deadlift, it’s likely because you’re lacking hip mobility and power in the bottom position,” says Samuel. “The deficit deadlift forces you into a slightly deeper range of motion.”
To perform a deficit deadlift, stand on a raised platform—even a few normal plates stacked on each other or my go-to method, a bumper plate, will do—and use the extra height to descend deeper into the movement. Use less weight than what you’re training at typically; you’re working to develop your range of motion and leg drive from the bottom position rather than going heavy.
Samuel advises that you introduce deficits to your training plan as your main hinge motion for three to four weeks, working for four sets of three to five reps. Once you return to the standard from the floor version of the movement, he says you’ll have greater control, body awareness, and power.
Deadlift Plateau Buster: Use the Rack Pull
If you feel like you just can’t handle holding on to any more weight, take the opposite approach to the move above and shorten the range of motion. “This becomes an exercise where you can expose yourself to an incredibly heavy weight that you might not be able to barbell deadlift, and eventually it’s going to help translate, if we keep training our standard barbell deadlifts, to a stronger [one],” says Samuel. By exposing yourself to these heavier weights, you’ll train your grip and mid-back muscles, which might be what fails when you try to progress.
You can work from all types of heights with the
rack pull
, according to Samuel, but he recommends starting just below your knees. This is right at the level that you’ll need to activate your glutes and hamstrings, while still giving you an edge from the standard deadlift’s full range of motion. Add this to your workout by loading up more weight than you’re stuck on with your standard deadlift for four sets of three to five reps.
If you’re looking for another option to expose yourself to the heavier loads without taking over an entire squat rack, Samuel says that you can also try a simple farmer’s hold. Pull the dumbbells straight off the weight rack, then hold for 10 to 15 seconds.
Deadlift Plateau Buster: Finish With the Hip Thrust
My biggest problem when I was trying to nail my own PR was locking out the movement at the top. The first time I put 500 pounds on the bar, I pulled it off the ground without much grinding, held the bar fast as I lifted it up, and then, at the final moment, couldn't bring myself to a complete lockout to complete the rep. Finishing a heavy pull requires glute strength to drive hip extension as you stand up with the weight—something that I needed to develop before I was able to achieve my goal. Samuel recommends doing heavy
hip thrusts
to hone this aspect of the movement. “These focus on the tail end of hip extension, and the bonus of hip thrusts is that they’re much easier on your CNS than many other lower-body lifts,” he says.
One helpful tip: Opt for an EZ bar or shorter barbell rather than a standard barbell for your thrusts. Samuel says that you’ll have an easier time balancing the shorter levers to focus solely on the glute squeeze, especially if you’re just starting out with the exercise.
Add the hip thrust to your workouts while still doing deadlifts as part of your routine. Samuel recommends doing them three to four times per week with higher reps, around eight to 10 per set.
Just remember, your plateau isn’t permanent—but breaking through it won’t be immediate, either. Adding these additional exercises can be a helpful path forward, but you’ll also need to remain patient. Back off on your heavyweight attempts for a few weeks while implementing these approaches. Once you’ve reaped the benefits in the strength department, you’ll be ready to climb even higher on the path to your big deadlift summit.

My strength is increasing, but I don’t see a big difference in muscles getting larger. Why?
-Strong as a Horse, Small as a Mouse
WHEN I WAS
in college, I felt like I could squat a house. I was training for football, and my focus was to get as strong and athletic as possible so I could turn all those reps into touchdown runs. Since I was strong, I figured I would also build up the tree trunk thighs I was hoping to grow. Thing is, my legs didn't look bigger. Even more noticeably, my calves looked downright skimpy. My main objective wasn’t to get swole, but the lack of growth still bummed me out. All those hours in the gym were supposed to pay off for my physique somehow, right?
Not exactly. My issue—and it sounds like part of your problem, too—is that I was training for one very specific outcome while expecting another. Unfortunately, those two outcomes aren’t as compatible as we might hope. “Fundamentally, building muscle strength and building muscle size just are not the same thing,” says

My legs weren’t growing at the rate I was hoping for in part because I was tackling a program filled with sport-specific rep schemes designed to build strength and power. Since you’ve experienced strength gains, we can reasonably assume that you’re probably following a training program
designed for that purpose
, and that you’re
progressively adding more of a challenge
from session to session, too.
You may be missing the mark on two key factors when it comes to building mass. One has less to do with what you’re doing and more to do with what you’re eating. “When it comes to wanting to build more muscle, it first starts out with a nutritional component,” says
Men’s Health
Advisory Board member
David Otey, C.S.C.S.
“Are you taking in the necessary calories in order to build muscle, and are you taking in the protein in order to support and build muscle?” You can determine how much protein you need based on your current bodyweight. Start by consuming one gram of protein per pound of bodyweight—and if you're  chasing muscle growth, a bit more protein never hurts. Aim to get as much protein as possible from
real food sources
, then
supplement
accordingly.
On top of that, you need to understand the same thing I struggled with in my football days: Building strength and building muscle size just aren't the same. “Building ‘strength,’ especially on multi-joint movements like the bench press or deadlift can be illusory,” Samuel continues. “Strength as quantified by the amount of weight we’re putting up can change for three reasons that may not necessarily influence muscle size.”
Samuel cautions that you could shortchange your mass gains if you’re using poor form and allowing momentum to help you lift weight rather than focusing on good reps and the
mind-muscle connection
. He also notes that if you’re new to lifting, strength gains can be due to
neurological adaptations
. But that brand of progress will only last for so long, in part because it’s mostly about your brain. “For most people in the initial three to six months of working out, a lot of their changes within the body of strength are from the neurological perspective,” says Otey. Finally, Samuel says that your muscles might have grown, leading to  strength gains—but clearly not on the scale that you’ve been hoping to achieve.
Thankfully, there are steps you can take to increase your potential for size gains. But first, you'll need to reframe your approach, focusing less on gaining strength and more on creating what Samuel calls "mechanical tension." Start by using these three tactics.
Introduce Isolation Exercises
Samuel’s first step is adding more
isolation movements
into your workouts. “You’ll still want to keep some functional ideas, like deadlifts and squats, in your workouts, but isolation movements (think biceps curls and leg extensions) allow you to truly fatigue a muscle and push it to its limits (without drawing assistance from other muscles),” he says. “You’ll also be able to focus on the feel more, and mind-muscle connection is key to building muscle.”
Work in Higher Rep Ranges
As noted above, my college football workouts were often low reps with heavy weights—which is the classic blueprint for building strength and power. If gaining mass is your goal, you’ll need to adjust. “There’s a lot more room for other muscle groups to get involved, and then you’re not always truly loading the targeted muscle group you’re trying to grow,” Samuel says of these low rep ranges. “More reps at a lighter weight will help you stay focused on the muscle you’re aiming to challenge most, keep you attuned to form breaks, and let you aim for greater
time under tension
.” He says that you should shift your working sets to eight to 12 reps instead. Additionally, Samuel notes that you should focus on extending the time that your muscles are under tension (more on that in just a moment)—so those sets should take you from 35 to 40 seconds to finish.
Slow Down Your Movements and Feel the Pump
Explosive movements are useful for sport-specific training, but they’re not the best for packing on muscle mass, Samuel notes. “If you want to build muscle, focus on slower movements done at a 1030
tempo
,” he advises. That means you break down the exercise to a one second initial contraction (when you lift the weight during a dumbbell curl, for example), then slow down to take three seconds to lower down (the eccentric portion) for each rep. Otey says that another important aspect of muscle-building has to do with feel, which will only improve once you’ve slowed down. “You should, to a certain extent, chase the pump a little bit if you're looking for hypertrophy,” he says. “If you don't feel it in the area that you want to be feeling it in, then you're probably not seeing the effects in the area that you want to feel it in.”
Take this advice to start, but remember: Your fitness plan doesn’t have to be a zero-sum game. You can build muscle without totally abandoning strength—and your strength gains will only help you to build more mass. “Don’t be afraid to do a few exercises in lower rep ranges to keep increasing strength, advises Samuel. “If you get stronger, you’ll invariably be able to lift heavier loads during those higher-rep-range isolation moves that are more focused on growing muscle.”
Samuel says that you should think of your workouts using a 1:3 ratio: For every one move you do to gain strength  (and this should happen at the start of your workout—think big compound movements), do three moves that focus more on building muscle (think biceps curls, machine exercises, etc.).
This approach isn’t far off from what I’ve done in my post-football training life. Eventually, I did see my muscles start to grow. My back squat max isn’t quite what it once was—but I’m pretty happy about how my thighs look once the summer season hits. By making these changes, you can find a better balance, too.

I've been working out with a training partner for the last few months, but it's not working for me. They slow me down, and don't push me. How do I lose them without making it awkward at the gym the next few months?
-I’m Sick of My Swolemate
GOOD RELATIONSHIPS CAN
be hard, no matter where you are. The gym is no exception, even if it’s more associated with macho flexing than sharing feelings. The bond you can make with a training partner is a special one. Not only do you have a friend you can count on to share how you're feeling, both physically and mentally, you have someone in your life who (ideally) shares the same motivations, goals, and willingness to spend time working to achieve them. Some of my best friendships have been either established or bolstered by training together—after all, there are few more effective experiences for building trust than saving your buddy from getting crushed by a barbell with
a good spot
.
So when you're not feeling great about the dynamic you have with your training partner, you’ll be well served to take the same care that you would with any other type of relationship when you go about resolving your problems. Maybe you're not seeing eye-to-eye on when you want to work out, what your goals are, or you need someone who's more eager to motivate you to finish out a hard set. In this case, you’re going to have to prepare for one of the most difficult aspects of a partnership: ending it.
Breakups suck, no matter the context. There’s no good way to tell someone that you got the ick and you no longer want to spend time with them. To better understand how you should approach that tough talk, I spoke to
Shadeen Francis, LMFT, CST
, a certified sex therapist and licensed marriage and family therapist.
Francis says that you shouldn’t delude yourself into thinking that you’ll be able to get through the breakup without some sort of emotional response, both from your training partner and yourself.  You’re both people, even if you largely shut off your feelings in the gym to focus on your workouts. Francis notes that you especially can’t do anything about how your soon-to-be former lifting buddy will react to the news that you no longer want to be there to give them a spot.
“It's not within your control, nor is it your responsibility, to keep someone else from having feelings,” she says. “You could have the most perfect, clear, loving conversation with this person, and they might still not take it very well. That might make things uncomfortable for the two of you.”
Feeling uncomfortable is not a good reason to avoid the conversation, whether you take one extreme or the other. Ghosting out of the partnership guarantees awkwardness if you ever want to show your face at your gym again, and Francis says that having a conversation at least allows you to “create a meaningful off ramp,” out of the relationship. On the other hand, you might be setting yourself up for even bigger problems if you just stick with your training partner to avoid conflict. “You're not giving them a fair chance, because you're actually not in it anymore, you have left,” she says. “It doesn't actually move your relationship forward—it just makes you resentful.” Resenting the person you need to trust to save you with a good spot if you fail a lift isn’t ideal. You might also start dreading your workouts together and finding excuses to skip out.
“The costs are really high, because the relationship to fitness and movement and health and your body takes up a lot of psychological space,” Francis says. “If you're also not feeling present and engaged in this thing that you're doing for your overall well-being, what does that cost you down the road?”
When you’ve reached the point of no return with your training partner, taking a measured approach to the breakup might help to make the process less painful. Francis has a game plan you can use to talk through your issues with your soon-to-be ex-swolemate. Above all, she says you should make sure that you use two guiding principles in your approach to communicating your intention to end things: be clear and kind.
Check In
First, you should check in with your training partner to see how they’re feeling. Francis says that this is an especially useful place to begin if you’re not 100 percent sure that you really want to cut them out entirely. Here’s how she recommends you open that talk: “I haven't been feeling great about this workout plan that we have. I'm recognizing we work out at different paces and we have different levels of energy. I want to check in with you—how are you feeling about it? Is this working for you?”
From there, you can assess the situation and determine how you want to move forward.
State Your Needs/Desires
Remember, you are working out with this person because you decided at some point that was how you wanted to spend your time. That can change—and it’s important to remember your own feelings and wants are important and valid.
Francis recommends being crystal clear about that shift in sentiment. Maybe like this: “We started this out of a mutual desire. And now I'd like to change it because my desires have changed.”
These probably won't be the exact words you use, given the context of the situation—but you can use the specifics of your issue to fill in the blanks to make it more relevant to you.
Give Them the Floor
Once you’ve raised the matter and come clean about your feelings, you can’t just walk away from the discussion—literally or metaphorically—without giving them a chance to express theirs. “What often a lot of people do in this process is they get really clear and they craft their kind message, and they send it in a text, and they’re like ‘Great, I did it!’” Francis says. “That's not actually a conversation, and that is not always the best way to navigate a relationship.”
Even if you are communicating via text message—which Francis says is okay, since you’ll be able to be as clear as possible in describing your needs without IRL distractions—you can’t just leave their response on read (or unread). You need to be ready to hear them out and answer them, too.
Be Firm With Your Needs
If you’re not crystal clear about what your needs are or if you struggle to set boundaries with people, what comes next might be tough. Francis says that some people might take the suggestion that a relationship needs to change and end as feedback for how they can change to make things work. That might be all that’s needed in some cases—but if you’re absolutely done, you need to be ready to be firm about that.
If you’re a people pleaser, this can be especially difficult, but Francis offers two suggestions for this type of scenario. First, state what your intention for the outcome of the conversation is at the outset. “Name that this is the request that I'm making, or this is the action that I'm taking,” she says. This might be that you want to go to the gym with them at the same time, but not lift together, or that you're going to find someone else to spot you.
Second, you can practice how the other person might react beforehand, so you have an idea about how you can counter their suggestions. “Maybe even draft out some potential responses, if [you] have a sense that this person might do a little bit of rebuttal or boundary testing,” she says.
Don’t Be a Dick
This might feel like a lot of advice, but Francis says the breakup process can be boiled down to a simple TL;DR: “Do a vibe check and don't be a dick about it.”
Your approach
might
be a bit more nuanced than that if you were following along closely, but keep that simple statement in mind as you move forward to the end of your partnership. The Talk might not be as scary as you think it will be at the outset. After all, you’re not the only person in the partnership. They might be just as ready to end things with you, too. In that case, wish each other well, and go your separate ways. You can always meet up after your workout for protein shakes.

How often do I have to train to still make gains?
–Can’t Live in the Gym
STRENGTH TRAINING IS NOT
something you need to do every day to see results. You’ll actually be more successful with plenty of
rest and recovery
, which is great news for busy guys with jam-packed work schedules and personal lives that don’t revolve around muscle. Whether your gym time is limited by necessity or just because you have other priorities, it helps to understand how many days per week you actually
need
to hit the gym, and for how long.
This isn’t a concept only gym slackers want to understand. Trainers and strength scientists have been just as interested in determining how
little
you can get away with committing to a workout routine as they are in identifying
which exercises can be the most effective
for instant results. This has led to years of study to determine strength training’s “minimum effective dose”—in other words, how little training you have to do to see results in the form of muscle and strength gains.
A study
published in the American College of Sports Medicine’s Health & Fitness Journal in 2013 found that just seven minutes of intense circuit training could be effective for improving strength and endurance, while
another systematic review
found that just a single set of six to 12 reps performed three to four times a week with a high intensity of effort can build strength.
You, however, won’t be working out in a lab under the watchful eye of exercise scientists measuring every single parameter of your progress with clinical equipment. You also have real world issues that will determine the circumstances of your training plan—so you’ll need to know about the real-world application of this approach. I talked with some trainers who have had to make the most out of limited time and constrained schedules to understand exactly how you can build the most effective minimal plan and put it into action.
First, it might help to understand that a minimal amount of training is a great approach to ease someone into a new workout habit. Starting out slow can be the best plan for beginners, according to
Bespoke Treatments
Director of Rehab and Training
Dr. Cameron Yuen, DPT CSCS
. “There is a lower chance of getting injured, there is less muscle soreness, it is more time efficient, and it is more sustainable,” he says. “Jumping right into a high frequency/intensity/volume program can limit your progression, lead to overtraining, and stall your motivation.”
That’s good to know if you’re starting from scratch. Once you get going, you’ll need to determine the best ways you can maintain momentum and progress, so your muscles can keep adapting. “Doing anything with a level of consistency, even training once a week, can have benefits for muscle and strength gains,” says
Men’s Health
fitness director
Ebenezer Samuel, C.S.C.S.
“That said, don’t expect to add much muscle or strength with that approach.”
To go beyond the absolute bare minimum for real progress, Samuel has a base recommendation. “In general, for clients looking to build muscle and strength who are tight on time, I advise they dedicate a half-hour a day to training twice a week,” he says. “In order to build muscle and strength at an appreciable rate, you need to find ways to not only move and sweat, but also to incorporate ‘
progressive overload
.’ A 30-minute workout gives you time to warm up enough that you can confidently overload a movement (or maybe a few) for three to four sets.”
Men’s Health
Advisory Board member and celebrity trainer
Don Saladino
agrees—so long as you’re focused throughout the entire short session. “I believe that is very efficient, [if] that's someone coming in and putting the work in and utilizing their time,” he says. “In 30 minutes, you're gonna get a lot done.”
Like anything worth pursuing, you’ll need a consistent habit to see results over time—even if you’re only in the gym two or three times per week. Progression is the key to gains, so you need to focus on ramping up with effort and load in your short training periods as time passes. “In order to progress key movements over a period of weeks and months, you also need to expose yourself to those movements frequently enough to get better at them,” Samuel continues. “It can be tough for that to happen if you’re only doing an exercise once a week. Aiming to do it twice a week helps you build the
mind-muscle connection
needed to get more out of the movement and gradually push for new heights.”
You’ll be able to do this by ditching the bro science approach of focusing on individual muscle groups during each workout session for a more comprehensive approach. “From a practical standpoint, two to three full-body splits utilizing
compound exercises
with paired
supersets
work well here, as you work a lot of muscles at once with relatively high loads in a short amount of time,” says Yuen. That means you’ll pack in plenty of big muscle lifts—think
deadlift variations
,
heavy presses
, and
squats
—into your sessions, along with more focused accessory movements. Yuen says that you can also use “intensification techniques”—think rest-pause sets and
drop sets
—to wring even more gains out of a short session.
Structuring your plan is important, too. So that you can push as hard as possible when you do have the time to train, you need to rest and recover properly. That means eating right, too. “You should not follow this program on back-to-back days,” Yuen says. “There should be at least one day in between training sessions. There should also be a caloric surplus, with an emphasis on consuming more protein and carbohydrates for tissue building and energy.”
If you get to the point that you’re able to make more time for your training to go beyond the minimum effective dose, that’s great—but remember, finding the program that works for you is more important than just logging hours to feel like you’ve reached some arbitrary standard of commitment. Minimal, focused training is better than unfocused training—and the best workout plan is the one that will keep you coming back to the gym.
“If you stick someone on a six-day a week training program at 90 minutes a day, of course, they're going to get into good shape,” says Saladino. “But the reality is, are you going to stick with it after that? If you are on a specific term of training—whether it's a three-month plan, whatever it is—if you can't continue that, in my opinion, the program didn't work. The adherence is what's important.”
Putting all this advice into practice can get you the gains you want without spending half your life in the gym, but like all these experts are saying, you won't see any progress if you can't lock in and focus during those quick-hitting sessions. You'll only see the results if you're willing to put the work in for every single moment. Get in, go hard, and get out—and you'll have even more time outside the gym to enjoy the fruits of all that effort.

Which single exercise will get me the most visual results the most quickly?
-Anonymous
YOU KNOW THE DEAL
by now: Achieving your fitness goals is a marathon, not a sprint. So no, four or five (or even six) sets of a single exercise won’t instantly transform you into the next Incredible Hulk.
But there are actually a handful of exercises that can give you ultra-fast visual benefits. Their results aren’t permanent, and they can’t replace hours upon hours of hard gym work. If you’re chasing a Friday night pre-party pump-up, however, they get the job done. The key in your pursuit of some magical one-hit wonder workout is understanding exactly what you can accomplish with a single exercise. And there are two main points to focus on when searching for instant return, says
Men’s Health
fitness director
Ebenezer Samuel, C.S.C.S.
First off, says Samuel, you’ll want to focus on
the “pump.”
And no, this isn’t a bro-science term invented to excuse an obsession with biceps curls. It’s a sensation you get when targeted muscles become engorged with blood—and it’s an underrated key to building muscle. “It’s something you can feel,” says Samuel, “which is key to any quick-fix exercise.”
Your second goal in any instant-results exercise is more subtle. “You want it to address your postural muscles,” Samuel says. Exercises that address your mid-back muscles, glutes, and abs can instantly help you stand taller, a dramatic effect if it’s not typically something you train to address.
My go-to maximum return move is the
kettlebell swing
. The exercise hits the two major points that Samuel outlined—my forearms feel pumped by the last rep of a set of swings, and the glutes, abs, and back are essential for good swing form—along with one additional benefit: I’m able to work with (relatively) heavy weight.
I do three quick sets of 20 reps, and that makes me feel like I’ve condensed a whole strength training session into just a few minutes. I’m standing taller after putting my glutes on blast, and the moment I roll up my sleeves, the veins in my forearms pop.
Samuel has a different pick:
the renegade row
. He says the hybrid push-pull exercise hits the arms (biceps and forearms), mid-back, and provides valuable stability and postural benefits.
Samuel recommends doing three sets of 10 reps (one rep is a row with both the right and left arm). “Try to pause a little bit when you get to the top of every single rep—that will give you that good mid-back squeeze,” he says. “It's gonna let our chest stand proud. And then on top of that, your abs are firing, and you really have to squeeze your glutes in order to keep your hips stable.”
Men’s Health
Next Top Trainer winner and Harlem Kettlebell Club owner
Jah Washington
takes a simple approach, opting for the pushup. “They hit your chest, your triceps, [you’ll] get a little bit of anterior delt,” he says. “Those are ‘show muscles’ on the front of the body that're gonna be more visible and get a quick pump immediately.”
There’s a low barrier of entry for pushups, too since you’ll need only your bodyweight. More advanced exercisers can also scale this exercise up (think: archer pushups and feet-elevated pushups), which Washington says ratchet up the core burn too. Washington suggests doing two to three sets of as many good-form reps as you can; regardless of the variation, you’ll get a healthy chest pump (and don’t sleep on the postural work you’ll get from owning the plank, either).
Not that every quick-fix move needs to hone your posture. Trainer
David Otey, C.S.C.S.
suggests the old-school dumbbell biceps curl, which can instantly leave your shirt-sleeves feeling extra-tight. “The fact of the matter is, when it comes to looking fit, there's only going to be a certain amount of areas that will immediately be an eye-draw,” says Otey. “There's a reason why all the twenty-somethings go to the gym to do arm day Friday night before going to the club.”
And no, don’t worry if you don’t have a ton of weight for these: Otey recommends focusing on volume, not weight during quick-pump curls (think: three sets of 15 to 20 reps), or slowing the tempo of every rep so you’re taking three to four seconds to lower the dumbbells. No dumbbells? Try curling a backpack full of books or a heavy grocery bag instead.
Any of these exercises will serve you well, so long as you remember to keep your expectations under control for what you’ll get out of short-term gains. Once you’re able to commit more time and effort to your training, you’ll be at a better baseline to start instead of jamming as much as you can into one brief moment. Still, we won’t judge you for knocking out a few pushups, swings, or curls before you hit the town. There’s nothing wrong with wanting a little preemptive pump.

My legs are my weakest muscle group. Tips?
-Andrew Hernandez
WE ALL HAVE
points of weakness, and for lots of guys (myself included), the lower half of their body is their biggest problem spot. My calves have long felt like the weak link in my body. Whether your issue is that your legs
look
weak or you actually struggle when you try to do lower body-focused exercises in the gym, it’s not an uncommon phenomenon.
But beating ourselves up about our shortcomings—or worse, totally ignoring them—won’t help to make them better. Your solution here isn’t to focus your gym time on your arms and back instead, transforming yourself into a top-heavy titan. Instead, we can focus our efforts on building our weak points so that they can become strengths (or at the very least, stronger than they once were).
The first thing to know is that you’re asking the right questions. Your weakness should be a point of focus. The second thing is to figure out exactly what you can do to address the issue. The simple answer is: Train your legs. But it certainly helps to have a better strategy for success after struggling for so long; you won’t get any better by just throwing more of the same at the problem. I talked to some experts—
Men’s Health
fitness director
Ebenezer Samuel, C.S.C.S.
and
MH
Advisory Board member
David Otey, C.S.C.S.
—to iron out a three-tiered approach that will get you started. And yes, we’re focused on the lower body here—but all of this guidance can apply to other problem areas.
Train Your Legs Differently
What do your lower body workouts look like? If your training sessions are always identical, we’ve found your first problem. Constantly doing the same rep schemes (whether that's high reps or low reps) doesn't give you a chance to find the rep scheme that'll help you build the
mind-muscle connection
you need to build your legs. “Not all people’s bodies respond to the same training stimuli,” says Samuel.
“If you’ve been training your lower body with higher-rep, lower-load ideas, reverse that and hit higher loads for lower reps,” Samuel continues. “If you’ve been doing the opposite, then shift it. This may help you develop a better mind-muscle connection, or subject your body to heavier loads that can spur the strength and size gains you’re missing. If you try this approach, make sure to try it for more than one workout. Keep at it for at least a full training block (four to six weeks).”
You’ll probably also want to switch up the types of movements that make up your workout. If both of your feet are planted firmly on the floor working together for the entirety of your leg day, you’re putting yourself in a bad spot. Otey says that his first concern when a client tells him their legs are weak is that they’re not doing enough
unilateral (single-leg)
work.
“Most exercise movements are group projects in high school,” says Otey. “So if you have five people, three or four of them kind of just hang around and wait for the one or two people to just do all the work for them. What you actually want to do is individual assignments. I want to individually assign [movements] so that this one leg needs to do its job, or this one muscle needs to do its job—or else. And if the body is put in that position, it's going to do the ‘or else’—it's going to really prioritize making you successful because your body doesn't want to fail.”
You’ll be able to suss out muscle biases and asymmetries by doing more unilateral exercises, Otey says—and in doing so, you’ll be in a great position to address some of the weaknesses that might be holding you back.
Train Your Legs More Often
Part of your problem might be that you’re not giving your legs enough attention within your workout program to see real results.
Samuel suggests developing a more consistent regimen to address your lagging legs. “If you’re only training legs once or twice a week, that may not be enough to develop the mind-muscle connection or movement mastery that you need to spur growth (especially for the once-a-week people),” he says.
Just be careful not to overdo it once you ratchet up the frequency. “That doesn’t mean training them hard-and-heavy three to four times weekly, because especially for legs that’ll fry your
CNS [central nervous system]
,” Samuel continues. “Instead, think of adding low-CNS options into your non-leg day sessions two to three times weekly.”
Good examples of these moves are
isolation exercises
like quad extensions and leg curls or bodyweight moves like lunge variations. The overall goal should be to develop a strong mind-muscle connection with your lower body, he says. This is a good idea for my problem specifically—according to Samuel, this is a solid approach for training those pesky calf muscles.
Make Leg Day Your Main Focus
If you’re really committed to improving your leg strength, you should make it a priority. Do you observe
International Chest Day
every Monday? It’s time to kick off your split differently. Your leg day should now take the lead-off spot in your training cycle.
“Make sure leg day is the dominant day in your program,” Samuel says. “So it should be your Day 1 of your training cycle, when you’re most optimized to go hard.”
This priority isn’t just a mental trick to give your lower body precedence. Think about how your week goes when you put other heavy lifting days ahead of a focused lower body session. Even if you follow a balanced program like a “push-pull-legs” split, you’ll have worn yourself down to some degree if you’ve been lifting hard. “At a base level, especially if you’re lifting hard, that means you have a little systemic fatigue on your lower body by the time you get to leg day,” Samuel says. “You want to be at your freshest and most badass-focused on leg day, if you’re trying to get them caught up. So make them Day 1.”
This increased focus can’t only be on the big-time movements. If you jump right into the meat and potatoes of your workout, you’ll be shortchanging your lower body’s ability to perform. As you prioritize leg day, prioritize your warmup, too. “A five-minute focus on range of motion and warming up could dictate the next 45 minutes of your leg workout,” Otey says.
“Missing a warmup specific to lower body activities might be one of the most critical things holding you back,” he continues. “When you try to perform any task, you want to have the full, uninhibited range of motion of that joint. And if your body hasn't done a lot of work with that joint—specifically through a full range of motion in the immediate amount of time you're talking about— it's not gonna be able to leverage the muscles the way that it needs to.”
Not sure exactly how to get moving the right way? Start with
this four-part series
. Give yourself plenty of time to crush your warmup, especially on that first day of the week. Just think—if you’re no longer fighting for your spot in the bench press line on Mondays, you’ll have plenty of space to give your legs the attention they need.

Why Trust Us?
IN A WORLD
where
home workout
trends change with the seasons, the exercise bike continues to stand the test of time. Its appeal lies in its ability to increase
cardiovascular health
through a low-impact approach, with limitless ability to take it up a notch. With a range of indoor exercise bike styles available, from
air bikes
to spin bikes, it can be difficult to choose the right style for your fitness goals and preferences.
Recent innovations in 'smart' bikes have expanded the exercise bike market even further, offering a wider selection than ever before. So we leveraged the extensive collective experience of
MH fitness editors
, as well as months of hands-on testing by certified trainers, to distinguish which factors set the top options apart from the rest.

How Men's Health Thoroughly Tests and Reviews Fitness Products
Each of these bikes in this guide can help users
burn calories
and improve overall fitness, but certain styles diverge in fundamental ways. Spin bikes, similar to what you might find at a SoulCycle class, engage your core and legs, while air bikes require you to use your upper body as well. Air bike enthusiasts appreciate their effectiveness for
high-intensity interval training
and circuit-style workouts due to their ability to deliver quick bursts of intense effort, while spin bikes are ideal for catering to a broader range of intensities, longer cycling sessions, and supplementing outdoor cycling routines.
To help you select the ideal exercise bike for you and your home gym, we've curated a list of the top exercise bikes we've personally tested, catering to all budget levels. From the ultra-high-end Peloton Bike+ to the most budget-friendly options available on Amazon, we've got you covered. Continue scrolling to discover the five best exercise bikes, according to fitness editors and certified trainers, but first a few things to keep in mind.
What to Consider
Air Bike vs. Spin Bike
In general, both devices can work for both high-intensity interval training workouts and long cardio. But how you prioritize your training will determine which bike is best for you. If you plan to focus on HIIT-based workouts, or want to mix weight training and bodyweight in with your bike work, the air bike is your jam. It’s easier to dismount the bike after a one-minute interval, then do a set of pushups, for example, making this ideal if you love Crossfit-style training.
If those steady-state workouts are your focus or you're using an indoor exercise bike to supplement outdoor riding, hop on a spin bike and get ready to pedal. And if you like doing cardio while watching TV, also opt for the spin bike; fan bikes are incredibly loud.
Resistance
Everyone has different fitness levels and goals, but not every bike can cater to these needs. Look for a bike with adjustable resistance levels, allowing you to customize the intensity of your workouts however you choose. This is especially important if you're planning to evolve the intensity of your workouts in the coming months and years.
Magnetic resistance is often the smoothest, more predictable option, which is what you can find in most spin bikes. This allows bike makers like Peloton to seamlessly integrate the resistance level with its online classes. While air bike options like Rogue and Assault use traditional methods of wheel fans and friction to challenge your endurance.
Display
The display should be easy to use and show all the essentials, including speed, distance, and time. Extra features like a heart rate monitor, Bluetooth connectivity, and USB ports can be nice to have, so decide if any of those are dealbreakers for you. For the higher-end spin bikes, the screens are more like full-service entertainment centers that can be used to watch a class with your favorite trainer or take you through a great cycling route in the Alps.
Workout Memberships
Some exercise bikes include preset workout programs, while others may offer a membership-based training app. Consider if having built-in programs is important to you, and if it is, if you want to consider a membership that would allow for a greater library of programs. There is typically a cost involved, so if you plan on using those features, be sure to confirm whether or not they are included. In some cases these bikes might work perfectly without those higher level subscriptions.
Dimensions
Consider the dimensions of the bikes you're shopping for, especially if you have limited space. Some bikes come with compact designs and foldable options for easier storage. If you'll need to stow the bike away when not in use, look for a lightweight frame on wheels.
Budget
Home gym equipment can get pricey. Set a budget and stick to it. Exercise bikes are available in a range of prices, so it's important to find one that fits your budget while still meeting your needs. As mentioned in the membership section, be sure you are aware of any continuing costs after you’ve paid for the bike, like subscriptions to classes or training programs.
Warranty
Because exercise bikes are such a big investment, budget and warranty go hand-in-hand. Many of the bike models we recommend offer a solid warranty of between one and seven years on parts, plus at least a one-year warranty on labor. This is totally reasonable, especially if you're spending north of $1,500 on a new machine. You should expect that your bike's frame and resistance mechanism should both be warrantied for the life of the unit.
How We Selected
Over the years,
Men's Health
fitness editors, as well as key fitness trainers from both
MH Advisory Board
and
MH Strength in Diversity Initiative
, have taken great care in researching and evaluating the wide pool of exercise bikes. We also enlisted the help of Maillard Howell of
Dean CrossFit
in Brooklyn, NY to test and assess how well these bikes performed in a real world scenario (read: a high-volume, high-traffic training facility). In addition, we sought insights from trainers from both our MH Advisory Board and our Strength in Diversity class for further anecdotal and experiential perspectives on the top exercise bikes.
Ultimately, we ended up with the below list that represents our top picks for the best exercise bikes we recommend in 2025.
Best Overall
Peloton Bike+
$2,495 at Amazon
$2,495 at Peloton

Pros
Beautiful, 24-inch HD monitor
High-tech design with next-gen features
Premium, industry leading online classes
Durable build
Free delivery and setup
30-day in-home trial
Compact footprint
Cons
Need to buy one of the monthly subscriptions to get the full value of your investment
Requires clip-in pedal shoes
By now everybody knows about Peloton, yet somehow still, not everyone has tried a ride. We're here to tell you there's a reason that the brand has become so popular. It combined a superbly designed, connected bike with a charismatic crew of trainers and ignited a fitness following.
The delivery is taken care of by Peloton, who unbox and mount the bike for you at your chosen location—an example of the high level of service that comes from the brand. The bike itself is fairly durable, and relatively simplistic outside of the 24-inch HD touchscreen. With the Bike+ you are able to rotate the screen, allowing you to utilize the open floorspace next to you to participate in strength classes as well.
The truth is, when you buy a Peloton you are buying more than a bike, you are buying a community. And you are getting a best-in-class library of instructor-led studio-style classes. From cycling to off-bike sessions like core workouts and hybrid strength classes, the variety of content is endless. The engaging live class offerings and fun gamification of your data makes the bike especially great for beginners or anyone who has difficulty maintaining a regimen.
On the downside, the initial investment can be a detractor, and the monthly subscription fee for access to Peloton's classes can also add up. However, if you fully utilize the platform and its library of classes, it can be a worthwhile expense.
The only other issue that our team had was instead of a traditional foot cage, the Peloton requires Delta-compatible cleats that clip into the pedals. Giving you another step, and another purchase, before you start your ride. This is to allow for the best experience with the programmed classes and resistance level changes, so it's an understandable ask. Peloton also offers a 30-day in-home trial with free delivery, setup, and, if needed, pickup and return. It's a commitment to customer satisfaction that helps protect your investment in this bike.

Pros
Oversized fan with unlimited air resistance levels
Much beloved design used in CrossFit Games
Super solid construction
Hefty, 350-pound rider weight limit
Cons
Chain drive system requires more maintenance than belt drive
The Assault AirBike Classic is the undisputed heavyweight champion of high-intensity exercise bikes for under $800. There's a raw, unapologetic simplicity about this bike that we can't help but admire. It's a no-nonsense machine that prioritizes the essence of a challenging workout without distractions.
The bike shows up in a box at your door about 85% built out, only taking about 45 minutes or so to attach the feet, arm pedals, and screen. It doesn't have flashy tech features and even lacks some basic finishes like water bottle holders, media trays, or touchscreen displays, but does what matters most extremely well—delivering an intense, muscle-pumping cardio workout.
Weighing in at less than 100 pounds, it's the lightest and most budget-friendly AirBike model from Assault. But don't mistake its lightness for weakness. This machine is a testament to sturdiness and durability; it can comfortably handle rigorous usage without breaking a sweat.
The bike can be loud though, so be prepared to not easily listen to your music or podcast during your sprints. The absence of a wind screen is also a minor and chilly inconvenience, especially when training in cold conditions in a garage or basement.
Compared to the
Pro X
and
Elite
AirBike models from the brand, the warranty on the Classic doesn't provide the same level of coverage as its higher-priced counterparts. The good news is that it has proved incredibly durable in our six+ years of testing, with only minimal signs of wear and tear emerging, like rust and corrosion.

Pros
22-inch Interactive HD Touchscreen Display
Rich library of on-demand studio classes
Whisper-quiet magnetic resistance
Sturdy design with a hefty, 350-pound rider weight limit
Cheaper than a Peloton Bike+
Easy to store
Cons
On-demand classes are not as premium as Peloton's
The NordicTrack S22i earned its spot on this list because it doesn't just deliver cutting-edge training technology to the user, it also delivers the world for those more adventure-minded riders.
Do you want to feel like you are cycling through the Swiss Alps or along the beaches of Hawaii? That's what the NordicTrack offers, and not just by showing pretty landscapes on it's 22-inch screen. Unlike the other bikes on this list, the S22i is able to replicate both incline and decline, so you feel like you are really winding up and down the hills of Switzerland.
The set-up is easy enough to do solo, but it helps if you have a person around to help you for some of the more involved moments of assembly. The bike is sturdy and robust, but also heavy, weighing over 200 pounds. So be sure that you build it in close proximity to where you are going to want to ride it, because it's not very easy to move around.
Like most NordicTrack equipment, the S22i comes with a year-long iFit membership.

Rogue Echo Bike
Shop at Rogue Fitness
Credit: Monica Dzik
Pros
Large, whisper-quiet fan
Smooth ride
Extremely durable, overbuilt construction
Low-maintenance belt drive system
High contrast LCD console
1-inch polyurethane wheels make for easy moving
Cons
Heavy weight can make it a pain to move
Looking for a bike that can handle years of punishment? Well, if the end of the world comes knocking, the Rogue Echo Bike will likely still be pedaling away. This thing is solid as a rock, capable of handling whatever you throw its way. This bike is a strength builder and a monster maker, demanding legit power from the user to make it move.
The bike arrives at your door well-packages and about 80% assembled. The screen, arms, pedals, and feel are all that you need to mount. The process can take about an hour to get your bike ready to ride.
Its belt drive system is consistent and essentially maintenance-free, meaning you can focus on your workout, not tinkering around with the machine. We've used this bike on and off for more than seven years, and have never experienced technical issues.
Beyond its durability, this bike rides like a dream. Pedaling is smooth and fluid in motion, and returns more resistance in response to the rider's effort.
We don't just recommend this bike; we swear by it. Years of firsthand testing have made it abundantly clear that if air bikes had Oscars, this one would be walking away with the golden statue, no doubt.
Another unique feature of the Rogue Echo Bike is its fan blades. It's crafted fan blades from thin gauge steel, cut them out, applied a powder coating, and welded them to a central hub within the fan cage. While this level of detail might seem unnecessary, it adds to the fan's long-term reliability and overall aesthetic.
Now, we won't sugarcoat it; this machine is heavy. But fear not, because it comes equipped with wheels at the front. So, even if you're not the Hulk, you can still shuffle it around to ensure it fits in your workout space.
The only other qualm we have with this bike is that it doesn't feature multi-grip handles like other air bike models do.

holders, 32 levels of resistance, toe-cage pedals, and a spacious touchscreen display, it boasts all the features you'd expect from a premium bike. And it's wrapped in a sleek, matte black finish that oozes style.
The assembly is fairly easy, taking about 45 minutes to set up. The bike arrives in a box about 85% built with just the feet, handles, and pedals needing to be mounted. The bike has a nice compact frame and takes up the least amount of space in the home. The brand found a way to cut down on the cost by removing the expensive touchscreen and giving you a platform to place your own mobile device or tablet and allowing you to follow any classes you want that way.
Whether we were sprinting or climbing out of the saddle during intense workouts, this bike offered unwavering stability. We never found ourselves wobbling or feeling uneasy on this machine. The elevated bullhorn handlebars aren't just about style; they provide an elbow rest that we found essential during grueling climbs. It's a thoughtful touch that we found enhances overall riding comfort. The competition-style seat on this bike strikes a balance between comfort and support that other bikes we've tested in this price range miss the mark on. It's designed for long sessions, providing that Goldilocks level of cushioning.
While this bike offers an all-around fantastic workout experience, especially for the cost, and is a great pick no matter your goals.

Benefits of an Exercise Bike
A
2019 study
showed that regular use of an exercise bike—alone or combined with strength training—can have a positive impact on aerobic capacity in as little as 3 months. Researchers also concluded that, like other forms of regular cardio, using an exercise bike can also contribute to a reduction in systolic and diastolic blood pressure—especially when combined with a heart-healthy diet.
Indoor cycling is also a low-impact form of cardio, resulting in less pressure on the joints than activities like running or jumping. Cycling is not a load-bearing exercise, says
Kate Heelan
, Ph.D., a professor of exercise science at the University of Nebraska at Kearney. This helps to minimize the risk of injury caused by malalignment, loss of balance, etc..
It's hard to beat the fresh air and sense of freedom an outdoor ride offers, but indoor cycling has a few unique benefits that can't be duplicated on the road.  Starting with the fact you can hit hills or flat road when and how you want, just with the press of a button.
Because you'll never quite be 'coasting' or riding downhill on an exercise bike, indoor cycling workouts can allow you to get the benefit of several hours worth of outdoor riding done in half the time.

Indoor Bike Compared to Outdoor Cycling
Cycling is an amazing way to get in shape and stay healthy, there's no doubt about it. But when it comes to choosing between indoor and outdoor cycling, what are the real differences?
"Broadly, both devices will burn calories and offer cardiovascular benefit," says MH fitness director Ebenezer Samuel, C.S.C.S. "But they’re not the same experience."
For starters, there's the convenience factor. Indoor cycling is ideal for those who are short on time or live in regions where the terrain or weather may limit getting a ride outdoors. It can be much easier to hop on an indoor bike at home or at the gym and get a great workout without having to worry about traffic, the environment, or safety concerns.
Both modalities lead to cardiovascular benefits and, like any activity, they both burn calories. But outdoor cycling challenges other qualities, says Samuel. "You’re actively moving through space when you cycle outdoors," says Samuel, "which challenges your muscles to decelerate, react, and constantly micro correct in ways it won’t on a stationary bike." The outdoor bike also offers a basic balance challenge that the indoor bike lacks.
Outdoors, the terrain and your pace set the challenge. Indoors, however, you can more easily customize your intensity, simply adjusting the resistance level on your bike. This (and the removal of the balance challenge) can make indoor cycling more beginner-friendly.
Many indoor bikes offer an interactive component now, like instructor-led classes and competitive leaderboards, which can be a great way to stay motivated and challenge yourself. These classes also provide a sense of community and support to stay motivated and hungry, even when you're working out alone.
Losing Weight With an Exercise Bike
Engaging in an intense indoor cycling session can elevate your heart rate, facilitate fat burning, and promote the development of lean muscle mass.
A
recent meta-analysis
on the benefits of indoor cycling was generally positive for improvements in lipid profile, body composition, and aerobic capacity, but the best results in the included studies also involved a dietary component.
But the key here, as with reaping the benefits of any form of exercise, is consistency. If you're new to cycling or an exercise bike, start slow. You can always increase the intensity of your workout throughout a session or over time, by adjusting the resistance or increasing your speed, to help you burn more calories and continue to see progress.
How to Avoid Getting Injured on an Exercise Bike
Exercise bikes are generally considered to be a low-impact form of exercise, and they're a joint-friendly way to burn calories. But it's still important to take precautions to avoid the potential of injury. Here are some tips to help you stay safe on an exercise bike:
Adjust the bike to fit your body
: Make sure the seat height, handlebar height, and distance between the seat and handlebars are adjusted to fit your body. This will help you maintain proper form and reduce the risk of injury from malalignment. See more below for a step-by-step on how to adjust your bike.
Warm up before your workout
: Spend 5-10 minutes warming up before you start your workout. Skip static stretches in this warmup and focus on creating bloodflow and raising your body temperature. You can do this off the bike with a few minutes of bodyweight moves (like lunges and air squats) or on the bike, with gentle pedaling.
Take breaks and listen to your body
: If you feel any pain or discomfort while using the exercise bike, take a break and assess the situation. If the pain persists, stop your workout and consult with a healthcare professional.
Stay hydrated
: Drink plenty of water before, during, and after your workout to help prevent dehydration.
How to Adjust an Exercise Bike
When it comes to using an exercise bike properly, fit is most important.
You can have all the tech and nice shoes, but if you’re not properly fit on your bike, not only will it be uncomfortable, but you run the risk of strained calve muscles, hip misalignment, and knee stress, among other things. Here's a 5-step process:
Set the handlebar and seat fore/aft adjustments to the neutral "0" position and tighten the dials securely.
Use the hip bone (iliac crest) as a guide to set the saddle to the correct height.
Adjust the handlebar to the correct height; ensure it's level with or slightly higher than the seat height.
Hop onto the bike and pedal for a minute to evaluate the seat and handlebar height.
If necessary, make any minor adjustments.
At the end of the day, there should be a slight bend in the elbows for a comfortable reach and a slight bend in the knee at the lowest (6 o’clock) pedal stroke position.  The saddle can be uncomfortable for new riders at first. Proper bike fit allows for the best experience and the most power generated.

Why Trust Us?
THE TREADMILL IS
one of the most basic and essential tools of a good cardio routine. Being able to move your own bodyweight from Point A to Point B is pretty critical in daily life as well, making walking and running the most functional exercises around. But what if you don’t want to drop money on a monthly membership for a gym 30 minutes away, just to use their banged up and outdated machines?
Now, with the temperatures starting to drop, a great treadmill is a powerful ally in helping you keep up your fitness and not miss a step in your training. We’ve put together a list of the best treadmills, tested by our editors (who happen to be certified trainers), that will help you
torch calories
and chase your fitness goals

If you’re planning to purchase a treadmill for your home, you should know that it’s no small investment. But with the high level of competition in the marketplace and more stock available than years past, now is a perfect time to take the leap. Whether you want to train for a
marathon
, build endurance with intense
weighted-vest
walks on an incline, get the blood pumping between errands, or all of the above, there’s a machine out there for you.
Out of all the treadmills we've tested, we believe that the
NordicTrack EXP 10i Treadmill
is a reliable choice for most people to use at home, given its durability, performance, and overall value. Its design is simplistic and user-friendly, with a modest touchscreen that offers preset programs and entertainment. For those seeking an added layer of motivation, an optional subscription for on-board workout content is available as an add-on. Keep reading to discover the six best treadmills for your home gym.
What to Consider
Dimensions
When you are building a home gym, space is a precious resource, and treadmills can take up a significant amount. Be sure to check the dimensions of any treadmill you're currently shopping. Be sure to add at least 1-2 feet in every direction and three feet or more behind the treadmill (the area you step on to the machine from) for maximum safety.
One thing buyers also tend to overlook is the height. You’ll want at least 15” inches above your own height when standing on the treadmill. So, if you’re 5’10” (70 inches), make sure your ceiling height is enough to accommodate 85 inches, plus the height of the treadmill belt. This is especially important if you’re planning to use your treadmill for running.
Lastly, be sure you are considering the amount of space you are going to need for storage if you aren’t planning for the treadmill to be left out when you aren’t working out. There are some great
folding treadmill
options, and models that can be moved or positioned easily, that can help you make the most of the space between runs.
Deck Size
Looking for a treadmill suitable for running? Or maybe you just want a reliable machine to walk on while you watch TV. Whatever you’re looking for, you’ll want to ensure the deck size suits your activity preferences (and your height). The industry standard for a walking treadmill deck is 55 inches by 20 inches, and at least 60 inches by 20 inches for running. You may be able to get away with running or walking on shorter decks, but this means altering your stride length, which means you’ll have to think about every step you take.
Stability
This might seem obvious, but double-check that all four corners of the treadmill are firmly in contact with the floor after setup. Many home floors aren’t 100% level (you'd be surprised). You want to make sure that your treadmill is well-planted to minimize the risk of slippage, shifting, or tilting.
Noise
Treadmills can—and often do—make a lot of noise, especially for your downstairs neighbors (if you live in an apartment) or housemates (if you live in a multistory house). If you think this might be an issue, consider a treadmill mat to help minimize the noise. These simple and usually affordable mats can help deaden the sound and vibration on the floor beneath a treadmill. However it won't quiet down the belt itself, and we’ve made a point to suggest models that won’t screech above your gym playlist.
Power Required
Treadmills—especially large and commercial models—can draw significant power. If your home’s electrical setup allows, dedicate one circuit to just your treadmill. This will help ensure that other power-hungry devices potentially on that same circuit don’t blow a fuse.
Speed & Incline
Nobody wants to drop the money for a treadmill that isn’t going to keep up with their workouts. Be sure to decide what kinds of speeds and inclines you are going to require for your training goals. The fact is treadmills will have different capacities when it comes to these features, and while 12 mph might be enough for some, it may not be enough for sprinters. The same goes with inclines. Most brands are transparent about the motor’s horsepower but some don’t disclose on the treadmill’s spec sheet. For reference, you should look for at least a 3.0 CHP motor if you plan to run or sprint regularly.
Warranty
The industry standard for a treadmill frame warranty is 15 years to life. This is the standard for mid- to high-dollar treadmills, but if you’re buying some random machine off of Amazon for $200, don’t expect this type of guarantee. We also recommend immediately registering your machine on the brand’s website after purchasing to make sure you’ll be able to cash in on the warranty if you ever need to do so.
How We Selected
For the past 24 months our
Men's Health
fitness team, comprised in part by former athletes, marathoners, and certified trainers, conferenced on the best treadmills for all types of use. Over the years, our dedicated editors have been rigorously testing treadmills from reliable, top-rated brands to evaluate them on their performance, user experience, size, durability, and overall value.
To ensure a comprehensive and thorough assessment of each product, the team has put each treadmill through the wringer with a variety of workouts, including sprints, long-distance runs, and tempo runs. This was done at home, in the
Men's Health
gym, and various training facilities around the world. Collectively, we've logged hundreds of miles on each tread, allowing us to gain valuable insights into how it stacks up against other options on the market. We also made sure we're up-to-date on industry standards (motor horsepower, warranty, incline/decline options, and speed) and the components that make up an excellent treadmill versus a ‘meh’ one. From that research and testing we deduced the front runners and best treadmills in the pack.

Cons
10-year frame warranty is subpar
The NordicTrack 1750 has been a long-standing favorite among
MH
fitness editors and hardcore indoor runners for years, and with good reason: It’s an all-around winner. The 16-inch touchscreen is responsive and compatible with iFIT programming, and the newest edition features both incline and decline.
The 1750 is one of the most stable treadmills we've ever been on, likely thanks to its durable build and powerful 3.5 CHP motor. The frame doesn't buckle or shake at all when you are putting in those hard miles. Other things to love include the 22-inch by 60-inch deck, which is outfitted with generous cushioning, and the new lower step up height, making it more accessible for all runners.
We enjoy how cushioned the landing feels with our feet being cradled with each stride. This treadmill offers speeds of up to 12 MPH and an incline of up to 12%, meaning it can keep up with most running goals. This treadmill is much quieter than other models that we've run on in the past. Whether we're doing incline jogs or finishing with sprints, it can handle it all.
NordicTrack's iFit content bring a lot of value, and the addition of this programming to your use of the treadmill can really elevate it. Most of the time, when you are getting technology with next-level technology, you have to be delicate with the machinery. But the 1750 is built like a tank, and in our testing was able to withstand our most punishing sprint sessions.
The only two things we'd change on this machine would be to extend the 10-year frame warranty (we'd love for it to be 15) and make the machine easier to move. Otherwise, this treadmill is a sure-fire winner.

Pros
Lifetime frame and motor warranty
Generously-sized 60” x 20” running deck
350-lb user weight capacity
Has 30 built-in running programs
Cons
Limited incline range
Not suitable for more advanced runners
Need an affordable treadmill that can satisfy tight space constraints? The XTERRA TRX3500 is the best machine we've tested that fits the bill, all for under $1,000. Even less if it happens to be on sale. Despite its low cost, it delivers a level of reliability that is uncommon in similarly-priced treadmills.
During our testing, we were surprised at how quiet the belt and motor performed when maxing out at 12 MPH and 12% incline, though the machine did whine a bit as it adjusted to ourdesired incline. It is extremely lightweight and compact, yet the steel frame feels solid, and the foldable design adds to its practicality for home use.
The 'Lift Assist and Safe Drop' mechanism exceeded our initial expectations, making it ridiculously effortless to fold and unfold the machine. It also has wheels. This is a machine that won't cause stress, a ton of logistical planning, and doesn't require multiple hands if you ever need to relocate from one room to another. One person could manage it alone, no problem.
Unlike treadmills with interactive touchscreens, this model is a little less tech-savvy, with a 6.5-inch LCD display. While it does offer some built-in training programs and Bluetooth connectivity for third-party apps that we found intuitive to work, it lacks the smart features and finishes of higher-end models. But after all, at this price point, it isn't pretending to compete in that class of cardio machines.
Above all, this treadmill boasts a great value. In our experience testing budget to premium treadmills, a lower price tag often comes at the expense of build quality, weight capacity, and deck size. The TRX3500 defies this trend. Its 350-pound user weight capacity surpasses the industry standard, the 60-inch by 20-inch deck offers ample space suitable for taller individuals, and it provides enough power to meet most training needs.

Pros

Simple quick touch controls
Easy-to-fold, space saving design
Cons
Lengthy assembly process

Belt runs a bit short
The NordicTrack EXP 10i takes the lead in the tech-forward, reasonably-priced EXP series. For those who would like a slightly smaller, less expensive version with all the same high-tech features that the Commerical 1750 comes with, this is the treadmill for you.
When using this machine, we were impressed by the solid build and easy-to-use controls. The touchscreen display is flanked by quick key buttons to adjust speed and incline to your likeness in one touch, instead of repeatedly pressing a button while trying to speed up or slow down.
Equipped with a 2.75 continuous Hp motor, this treadmill offers the industry standard speed of up to 12 MPH and an incline of up to 12%. Much like other models in the NordicTrack system, this piece of equipment handles impact well. Like the more expensive options from the brand, you feel cushioned and cradled with each stride.
One of the great features of this model is its storability, which comes without sacrificing a whole lot of features. But a factor to keep in mind is that the deck is 55 inches long rather than the 60-inch decks we see in the larger NordicTrack models. This may be a small hinderance for more seasoned runners. If you're tall or looking for a treadmill to log serious training on, this length might clip your stride short. But for most every day running and casual runners, the length won't be an issue.
This model also features a 10-inch HD touchscreen display that provides on-demand instructor-led classes and programs to guide your runs at any time. The touchscreen display is smaller than other high-tech models, but gets the job done.

Pros
350-lb user weight capacity

User-powered
Cons
Large footprint
Frame warranty is subpar
The AssaultRunner Pro presents a more budget-friendly alternative (yes, $3,000 for a manual treadmill qualifies as affordable in comparison) to some of the pricier curved treadmills available today. Plus, it's one of our favorite treadmills (manual or traditional) of all time.
You might already be acquainted with the AssaultRunner Elite, which is essentially the more premium version of this machine. However, we found that opting for the more cost-effective model from AssaultFitness didn't sacrifice much. We still enjoyed an exceptionally durable steel frame, backed by a 150,000-mile belt warranty, and Bluetooth connectivity.
When we say durable, we mean it. This manual machine can support users up to 350-pounds, and we never had to worry about its tech features glitching or lagging—because there aren't any. Since this machine relies entirely on the user's power (not an external power source), I could maneuver it on its wheels from the garage to the driveway for a breath of fresh air whenever I felt like it.
It's worth noting, however, that relocating this treadmill up or down a flight of stairs without multiple pairs of hands is not advisable. It weighs in at 373 pounds and lacks any folding or compacting capabilities, meaning it requires a team to unbox and setup, as well as a permanent space ready to house this beast.

Doesn’t fold
The Peloton Tread takes on the familiar feeling of a live studio experience, initially popularized by the Peloton Bike and compatible app. We recommend the Peloton Tread for those that like a group class environment from the comfort of their own home.
We found that the massive 23.8" HD touchscreen simulates the camaraderie of running in a race better than any other machine, fostering a competitive-yet-supportive class environment. This experience helps to increase how much people actually use their treadmills. Translation: Sure, this baby is expensive, but it’s worth the money. It’s an experience unlike any other that pretty much everyone has tried to copy.
The 59-inch by 20-inch deck is large enough for almost any sized runner, and the 300-pound user weight capacity hits the industry standards we’d expect to see. The newly-added Tread lock makes this machine (now) safe to have around kids and pets who may be tempted to climb and play on it.
Despite the lofty price point, be sure to avoid the temptation of buying a discounted used machine and get yours new. In the past, it's unfortunately been prone to maintenance-related issues, so you’ll want a warranty in case anything happens to yours.

Pricey
Heavy and difficult to move
If you're a serious runner looking for a tread to hold up to serious training, this is it. It's an absolute powerhouse. The frame itself is exceptionally sturdy, and we didn't detect any shaking even when running at push pace (it goes up to 12 MPH). We also find this tread especially great for interval training and hills when we want to switch things up, given its broad decline/incline range.
For those big guys looking to up their cardio, this treadmill has a 400-pound user weight capacity, which surpasses the industry standard by 100 pounds. On top of that, it was built to take a beating, giving it the ability to withstand any exercise that you can throw at it, no matter the intensity.
The downside of the durability and solid feel of this machine is that it's (unsurprisingly) quite heavy. Weighing in at 336 pounds, moving it requires at least two pairs of hands (and some gusto), even with the included transport wheels. For this reason, you'll need to designate a dedicated spot for this treadmill, as it's not as compact as some other models when folded. That designated spot will need to be quite spacious as well, as this tread is wider (and a tad longer) than most comparable home machines.
On the plus side, the extra-large 22-inch by 60-inch deck more than compensates for its substantial footprint. We can open up our stride on this machine and never feel crammed or cut short. Bowflex's commitment to quality is evident in the warranty offering a 15-year frame coverage (which is on par with the industry standard).
It's also remarkably easy to setup thanks to straightforward assembly instructions, taking less than an hour to complete from start to finish.

Should I Buy a Curved Treadmill?
Maybe
. It all depends on your personal fitness level and goals. Curved treadmills are non-motorized. They rely instead on you walking or running, and the belt being pushed backward manually with every foot strike on the sloped surface. While this might not seem as "fancy" or high-tech as a powered treadmill, this design has its benefits.
"Curved treadmills tend to recruit more muscles due to the shape of the belt and the act of propelling against it," says
Eric Sung
, C.S.C.S., a member of the
Men's Health
Strength in Diversity initiative and trainer at Performance Lab in New York City. "It also eases the strain of your joints because of the curvature and is often better for users with varied joint pain."
By some reports, exercising on a curved treadmill burns 30% more calories over a traditional powered treadmill.
"One drawback of a curved treadmill is that it is difficult to achieve higher speeds (sprints) with proper technique. This can impact front side mechanics with one's stride through by 'reaching'," explains Sung. Another thing to consider: Because curved treads are motorless, they also don't allow for incline or decline capabilities.
Does Running on a Treadmill Affect Running Mechanics?
Yes, although not critically, according to David Siik, founder of Precision Run by Equinox.
"To create a sense of security, people tend to run far too close to the front of the treadmill," he explains. This can lead to a compressed posture, restricting the range of motion in your arms. Siik recommends maintaining at least one foot of distance between your belly and the treadmill monitor.
Treadmills may require slightly less engagement of our hamstrings compared to outdoor running, though the difference isn't substantial, Siik tells us.
"Another important point we emphasize with our runners and walkers is the importance of avoiding the habit of constantly staring at your phone while using the treadmill." Over time, this posture can strain your neck.
Benefits of Running on a Treadmill
Jonathan Cane
, an exercise physiologist, running coach, and founder of
City Coach Multisport
in New York City, highlights several benefits of running on a treadmill. He mentions that treadmills allow for the simulation of terrain, making them valuable for training when natural hills or elevation changes aren't readily available. This feature is particularly useful for preparing for hilly races.
"Walking up a grade can have comparable cardiovascular benefit to running flat, yet doesn't have the associated orthopedic stress, so it can be a great way to get a workout without all the pounding you might have with running," he explains.
Siik explains that the benefits of running and walking on an incline boil down to the increased energy spend (remaining calories burned) caused by the increased power needed to climb vertically.
"Variation is key to experience the full benefits of incline. Steep inclines have wonderful energy burning benefits but also can destabilize the knees over time if done frequently," he explains. "This is why the treadmill is beautiful for incline training; it allows you to play with such a spectrum of programming."
Treadmills also offer the advantage of being weather-independent, with modern models featuring softer surfaces that are gentler on the body compared to running on hard asphalt or concrete. (Remember: Running outside exposes you to the elements, which can have additional
mental and physical benefits
, so do it when possible.)

Why Trust Us?
KETTLEBELLS OFFER PLENTY
of bang for your buck. You can use them for
strength training
, to
build muscle
, and for explosive movements like snatches and swings. And you can achieve any of these feats with just one
kettlebell
, making it a tool that’s as simple as it is effective.

Get stronger, however, and you’re going to need a kettlebell that’s heavier—and that can be pricey. Our favorite solution is the adjustable kettlebell, which like the
best adjustable dumbells
and the
best weighted vests
, are highly versatile pieces of equipment. Our editors researched and tested the most popular—and even lesser-known—adjustable kettlebells to find the six best worth considering for your own
home gym
.
What to Consider
Weight Range
Most adjustable kettlebells have a weight range between 10 and 40 pounds. We looked for brands that offer either a wider range of weights in one kettlebell or multiple kettlebells with different weight ranges.
For movements like swings, deadlifts, rows, and push presses, any weight under 40 pounds is too light to be challenging to anyone who isn’t a beginner. Ten to 30 pounds is great for isolation exercises (think curls, lateral raises, and extensions), but won’t pose a proper challenge for the explosive movements that people expect to perform with kettlebells.
Handle
The handle of your kettlebell needs to be easy to grip, comfortable, and able to fit both of your hands for a variety of exercises. The size of the handle refers to both the diameter (measured in millimeters) and the width of the handle. A competition-grade kettlebell has a handle diameter of 190mm (or 7.5 inches). Unless you’re training specifically for kettlebell sport, you don’t need to worry about buying a kettlebell with those specific dimensions.
In fact, some of our testers prefer handles that are thinner in diameter (they’re easier to grip) and wider in length (you can better grab it with both hands). That said, all the kettlebells on this list feature handles that our testers think are comfortable and effective and are millimeters within competition-grade specs.
Shape
You want an adjustable kettlebell to look and function like a traditional kettlebell, so we mostly chose products that resemble single-weight kettlebells. That said, if there’s a pick on this list that strays from the traditional shape, it’s because we deemed it nonetheless comfortable and/or easy to use.
Adjustment Mechanism
You’re going to run into a handful of different changing mechanisms for the kettlebells below. The two most common are a dial and pin. For the dial, the kettlebell usually sits on top of a stack of plates. You turn the dial to the weight you want, and the mechanism automatically engages the appropriate number of weight plates. To use the pin, you’ll manually insert it into different holes in the kettlebell that correlate to a specific weight (it’s no different than using a weight stack at the gym). Both dials and pins are quick and efficient mechanisms.
Dials are often made from plastic so they can be prone to breaking, but this is, in our experience, a rarity and likely won’t happen as long as you use your kettlebell sensibly. Competition-style kettlebells may require you to ratchet open the bell with a wrench and manually add or remove metal plate weights before closing it back up. This is a pain, but the trade off is more stability and durability, and an adjustable kettlebell that’s shaped like and performs like a traditional one. Kettlebell handles aren’t really kettlebells, but handles with an extended pole for you to load weights onto. This process shouldn’t feel too different from loading a barbell.
How We Selected
Our team of
Men’s Health
fitness editors, including certified trainers and former athletes, have used dozens of different models of adjustable kettlebells during our decades of work in the fitness industry. On top of that, we reached out to our large network of experts, including our
Advisory Board
, to share their insights.
We combined this expansive experience with targeted testing of the top devices on the market, done along with the writer Andrew Gutman, from upcoming and established brands. During this testing these kettlebells during a wide range of workouts in a variety of environments, whether that was CrossFit WODs at our local box, kettlebell flows in the
Men's Health
studio gym,
or HIIT workouts in our own garages. Look below to check out our favorite picks for every kind of athlete.
Best Adjustable Kettlebell Overall
Rep Fitness Adjustable Kettlebell with Matte Powder Coating
$165 at Amazon
Pros
It is shaped like a standard kettlebell
Lots of weight options
Made with cast-iron
Fairly priced
Cons
Plastic dial has broken on rare occasion
Our list is competitive. Many iconic brands produce adjustable kettlebells with rave reviews and similar specs. What edged REP’s adjustable kettlebell into our Best Overall spot is that it looks, feels, and performs the most like a standard
kettlebell
—even the handle diameter is nearly competition-grade—and the price is very fair for the equipment you’re getting.
Like nearly everything REP produces, the quality of this kettlebell is standard-setting. The frame is made from cast iron and powder-coated to enhance your grip. The traditional shape enables kettlebell athletes to use this kettlebell, so their training will transfer to competition. Even the bottom of the kettlebell is covered in rubber to protect your floor—a minor detail we appreciate. Typically, you’re paying above market for this level of quality and design, but REP’s adjustable kettlebell is less expensive than other picks on this list.
REP offers three different weight ranges: 8-16kg (17-35lbs), 16-24kg (35-53lbs), and 10-40lbs. The kilogram kettlebells adjust in two-kilogram increments, and the kettlebells sold in pounds adjust in five-pound increments. To select your weight, you’ll turn the dial located on the top of the kettlebell (below the handle). You’ll then lift the kettlebell off the weight stack, where the remaining weight plates will sit for the duration of your set or workout.
If you want to nitpick, other brands have said that the plastic dial feels cheap and prone to breaking. We want to highlight this detail, but our editors don’t think this is an issue unless you plan on abusing the kettlebell.
No matter which weight range you choose, you’re replacing five kettlebells. For general fitness enthusiasts, we like the 10-40lb option; it’s enough weight to challenge you for presses and high-rep sets of squats and rows. If you have some lifting experience and want to primarily train explosive movements like swings and snatches, as one traditionally does with kettlebells, opt for the 16-24kg weight range. For example, I do not train regularly with kettlebells and can still swing 90 pounds and snatch 40 pounds for reps. Unless you’re a complete beginner, we suggest those two weight ranges.

Pros
Competition-grade kettlebell
Replaces 18 kettlebells
Adjusts from 12-32kg
Cons
Comparatively cumbersome
Adjustment is a pain
Bells of Steel created something very cool with this competition-spec adjustable kettlebell. The weight range and increments are fantastic, and the dimensions are exactly to competition spec. You’ll replace 18 kettlebells for less than $300. Two reasons why it’s not our best overall pick are that the adjustment process for this kettlebell is comparatively time-intensive, and a competition-style bell isn’t for everyone.
To change the weights of the Bells of Steel kettlebell, you need a few minutes and a couple of tools. You’ll undo the bolt on the bottom of the kettlebell using an Allen wrench, remove the bottom half, and then loosen the other screw, which secures the plates, with a traditional wrench. You can then add more plates in half-kilogram increments to the bolt that runs through the top half of the shell. Because the adjustment process is more time-consuming, this isn’t the best kettlebell for circuits or workouts that demand you to change weights on the fly.
At first glance, you probably can’t even tell this is an adjustable kettlebell; it has a smooth cast-iron finish, void of any dials or switches, and the 35-millimeter handle looks identical to standard competition kettlebells. This is the serious kettlebell athlete's adjustable kettlebell. That said, if you’ve never trained with an adjustable kettlebell, be aware that the stainless steel handle can rub the hand raw (use a lot of chalk), it’ll feel more cumbersome than other picks on this list, and the starting weight is over 24 pounds.
This is a solid choice if you’re a kettlebell athlete or are looking for a heavier adjustable kettlebell (and you’re okay with the adjustment process).

Most Compact Adjustable Kettlebell
PowerBlock Adjustable Kettlebell
$170 at Amazon
$170 at Macy's
Pros
Easy to identify the weights
Very compact
Feels sturdy
Cons
Replaces only 4 kettlebells
Triangular shape
Powerblock is best known for its rectangular adjustable dumbbells, which can hold up to 100 pounds, but the brand also produces a rugged and compact adjustable kettlebell with a decent weight range.
The 18- to 35-pound kettlebell has dimensions of 5.75″ L x 4.25″ W x 10″ H, while the 35-to-62-pound kettlebell has a dimensions profile of 8″ L x 5.5″ W x 11.25″ H. That’s not drastically smaller than other kettlebells on our list—in fact, Titan’s adjustable kettlebell is half an inch shorter than Powerblock’s heavier kettlebell—but its size relative to the weight range is what earned this pick the superlative of most compact.
We like a few things about this kettlebell. First, the handle is wider than most single-weight and adjustable kettlebells, which I like for two-handed movements like swings and upright rows. This kettlebell is also made from steel and feels sturdy and durable. You can drop this and not worry that it will break; there aren’t any plastic parts. Lastly, the untraditional shape may throw off some kettlebell enthusiasts, but I think the sloped sides make it so it sits more comfortably on my wrist. Anyone who snatched or cleaned a traditional kettlebell knows the pressure that can be put on the wrist.
Unfortunately, you have to choose between a lighter or heavier kettlebell. Each model replaces just four kettlebells, less than any other pick on this list. With the purchase of either kettlebell, you’ll get the shell plus three weights you can select using a pin. (FYI: You need the pin to choose the weights, and Powerblock doesn’t seem to sell a replacement part.) Sixy-two pounds is a substantial top-end weight for an adjustable kettlebell, with only the Titan Loadable Kettlebell Swing and Bells of Steel Competition Kettlebell offering a heavier weight.

Best Budget Adjustable Kettlebell
Titan Fitness 40 LB Adjustable Kettlebell
$120 at titan.fitness
Pros
It has a solid weight range for most people
Round like a kettlebell
Very affordable
Cons
Adjusting it isn’t as simple as other models
The weights aren’t marked
We picked Titan as the best budget option because $120 for the equivalent of seven kettlebells is pretty damn good. It looks and (mostly) feels like a traditional kettlebell, is compact, and uses cast-iron plates, which adds to the product’s durability. What we like most about Titan’s kettlebell is its price and shape. Regarding gym equipment, $120 is pretty affordable for almost any product. A 40-pound kettlebell from Titan Fitness costs $70, so add six more kettlebells to your cart, and you’re definitely exceeding $120 bucks.
The shape and size are comparable to traditional kettlebells, which means you shouldn’t have a hard time adjusting your technique if you switch over to this model. This kettlebell starts at 10 pounds and goes up to 40 pounds, a good weight range for beginners and intermediate lifters. The weight is light enough to master movements like the snatch, clean, and jerk and to burn out the muscles during exercises like curls and overhead presses.
Unfortunately, 40 pounds isn’t enough weight for stronger individuals to get much out of movements like kettlebell swings, rows, chest presses, and deadlifts. If you’re looking to take on high-rep workouts with intensity, you can put this bell to use. However, expect to out-grow this weight range at some point.
The weights on this kettlebell aren’t marked, so you need to read the plates on the inside to figure out how much you’re lifting. Ideally, Titan would paint the numbers somewhere on this kettlebell. Also, adjusting Titan’s kettlebell isn’t as easy as most other picks on this list. You need to unlock the plates and then slide them out one at a time. But these are little nuisances in the grander scheme of what you're getting for the price.

Best Adjustable Kettlebell For Beginners
Bowflex SelectTech 840 Kettlebell
Now 30% Off
$199
$140 at Amazon
$18 at Walmart
$149 at Bowflex
Pros
Replaces 6 kettlebells
Easy to adjust
Good price point
Cons
Has a plastic shell
Handle isn’t grippy
From the company that brought adjustable dumbbells into the mainstream, BowFlex’s SelectTech 840 adjustable kettlebell is a great entry-level model for the kettlebell-curious gym goer. It’s reasonably priced, replaces six kettlebells, and is simple to adjust on the fly. The SelecTtech 840 offers six different weights: Eight, 12, 20, 25, 35, and 40 pounds, enough weight to challenge you during isolation movements like curls and extensions while providing enough resistance for snatches, cleans, and rows.
If you’ve been training with kettlebells for a few years, 40 pounds will likely be too light for you, so you’ll want to look for a kettlebell that offers a heavier top-end weight or consider buying two of this model. While it isn’t shaped exactly like a kettlebell, it feels enough like one that anyone who uses a traditional kettlebell won’t be completely thrown off. The dial located on the top of the kettlebell makes adjusting between weights a breeze, and the handle is relatively wide, making two-handed exercises easier to perform.
I don’t love the plastic shell, which leaves the SelectTech 840 more prone to breaking if dropped. Also, the handle is smooth, which makes holding onto the bell harder, especially after you’ve worked up a sweat. All in all, this is a basic, easy-to-use kettlebell with a moderately challenging weight range. If you’re a beginner or casual kettlebell user, you’ll enjoy BowFlex’s adjustable kettlebell.

Pros

500-lb weight capacity

Cons
Feels weird to swing at first
Requires weight plates for loading
We’ll admit that this is more of a kettlebell-adjacent tool, but we're including it on this list because it’s affordable, you can load it up to 500 pounds, it uses weight plates, and you can use it in a few creative ways.
First, let’s be clear: Titan’s loadable handle is not a kettlebell replacement. It’s nowhere close to the dimensions of a standard kettlebell, so you can’t perform classic kettlebell movements like the snatch, clean, and jerk. As the name implies, Titan’s Loadable Kettlebell Swing is for swinging, with the main benefit being that you can load it with hundreds of pounds.
Swinging this handle will not feel like swinging a kettlebell. It’s 19 inches tall, eight inches taller than a competition kettlebell. You’ll probably feel unstable and unbalanced the first few times you swing this handle, as the plates are relatively far from your center of gravity. You’re also going to need to assume a wider stance than you’re used to when using standard kettlebells. A competition kettlebell is 8.25 inches wide. By comparison, some metal 45-pound plates are nearly 17 inches across, and 25-pound plates are almost 12 inches across. We suggest loading 5-, 10-, and 25-pound plates onto the handle so you don’t have to set your stance as wide.
Even though you can’t technically replace a kettlebell with this handle, it’s still a valuable and fun addition to any home gym. Aside from heavy swings, you can perform one-arm rows, upright rows, single-arm farmer’s carries, duck walks, and elevated sumo deadlifts with this handle. We say “addition” to a home gym because this handle is an excellent buy if you own weight plates. Otherwise, you’ll need to shell out extra money for the plates to load this handle.
If you’re looking for a pure kettlebell replacement, Titan’s Loadable Kettlebell Swing is not for you. However, with a $50 price tag and a 500-pound weight capacity, we think serious strength athletes will love this unique tool's ability to perform heavy swings, rows, elevated deadlifts, and carries.

Why Trust Us?
ARE YOU STUCK
in a rut when it comes to your training? One of the best ways to fight routine fatigue is making sure you have a good amount of dynamic and
explosive movements
in your warm ups and workouts. This kind of exercise requires the right kind of gear, and one of our favorites here at
Men's Health
is the medicine ball. These space-efficient and travel-ready tools aren't limited to being used for rotational power and core exercises either, medicine balls can help you
workout
your entire body. They are a
home gym essential
just like
dumbbells
,
weight benches
, and
pull-up bars
.
Medicine balls can bring an element of fun, while building athleticism through functional strength and stability. Many athletes know how vitally important a medicine ball can be when it comes to rotational power and improving force production, too. The possibilities are endless. So make like an athlete, get a medicine ball, then get ready to get your core looking like some of your favorite athletes—
diet pending
, of course.
What to Consider
Weight
Might be a bit of a no-brainer, but medicine balls come in varying weights. On the lighter side, they are usually between 4-6 pounds, while the denser, heavier ones get up to 18-25 pounds on average. If you’re new to med ball work, a lighter option may be best. "In general, you're better off with a lighter med ball than you think," says
Men's Health
fitness director
Ebenezer Samuel
, C.S.C.S. "Lighter med balls allow you to move athletically, with your muscles moving fast."
Size
Almost going hand-in-hand, although not exclusively, with weight would be the ball size. Be sure to consider what movements you want to perform with your medicine ball. For example, for med ball slams be sure you are using a "slam ball" instead of a classic med ball, this more malleable sand-filled version warps during impact with the floor and won't bounce back up at you.
Materials
No, they are not all made of rubber and bounce. While a good number are solid rubber construction (as it offers the best bounce and durability), you can find the occasional old-school leather ones or synthetic covers (typically filled with sand for ball slams).
Bounce
Speaking of bounce, this is another factor to consider when selecting a medicine ball. This will directly correlate to the materials that it’s made from. Knowing this will help you determine the purpose you plan on using it for. If you are doing wall throws that require you to throw and catch the med ball, having a good amount of bounce is preferred.
Grip
A final consideration is the type of textured surface it has. Some are smoother with tiny pebble-like textures, while others have aggressive diamond patterns to help you grip it optimally while in use.
How We Selected
Men's Health
editors, made up in part of certified trainers and gym-goers, have all used medicine balls at some point in time during our training sessions. Starting with that base knowledge, we consulted with experts in our expansive fitness network, like
Men's Health
advisory board member
Don Saladino
, to determine what factors we all look for in a functional medicine ball. This network includes industry experts and additional trainers, who helped suggest more products for us to test for durability, reliability, and efficiency. We then put these suggestions to the test during our own training at home.
Below is our curated list of gym-tested, tried and true medicine balls that will help you become more functional as an athlete, help you increase power and explosive force, and get a pretty ripped midsection, too.
Best Overall Medicine Ball
REP Fitness Medicine Ball (10 Lbs)
$46 at repfitness.com
Pros
Same diameter regardless of weight
Affordable
Excellent for all levels of users
Durable
Great grip
Cons
Somewhat erratic bounce effect (from stitching)
Not ideal for ground slams
Some say weight feels unbalanced
When it comes to medicine balls, there’s not much to dislike about the REP Fitness medicine ball, which is one of
MH
’s favorites and our overall winner. This ball checks off every box in what to look for, starting with a universal 14-inch diameter throughout all varying weights (this normally varies with other brands). Built with extreme durability in mind, these are hand-stuffed and double-stitched with very thick threading, so whether you’re slamming them against the wall or the ground (not ideally recommended), they will hold up well over time.
Coming in 10 various weights ranging from 4-30 pounds, no matter what your training needs, you can find the perfect weighted ball (each is color-coded, too, for those grabbing multiple balls). With a grippy synthetic leather material construction, these are still great options to hold onto, no matter how sweaty you get during a workout. While they are not designed for slamming against the ground during training and have minimal bounce, they are sturdy and affordable enough to make them an excellent choice.

Maybe when you think of a medicine ball, you envision a basketball-looking, yet much heavier, and striped-coloring rubber ball. If that’s the case, this traditional-looking medicine ball is a wonderful addition to your home gym. Amazon Basics nailed a simple, affordable, yet pretty durable medicine ball that is accessible to everyone.
This no-frills medicine ball is made with a firm rubber exterior and a slightly textured pebble-esque surface to allow for a more enhanced experience. As with all rubber balls, it offers exceptional bounce and durability, however it is not best for wall throws, as its aggressive bounce-back is not ideal. With a superb price tag like this, most feel that it is still well worth it.

Can still have a slick feel during use
Not ideal for wall slams
When it comes to CrossFit, the one name that stands out best is Rogue. Its rubber medicine ball dubbed the Rogue Rubber Medball, is as durable as they come thanks to its all-rubber construction. This is a must for anyone performing WODs and something that can hold up to ground and wall slams, all the way through performing the total-body Wall Ball exercise.
But if you’re worried that a rubber ball might be too slick to use, Rogue was way ahead of you and designed it with a diamond-like grip pattern that offers just the right amount of grip without being overly aggressive. This firm-feeling yet surprisingly spring-like exterior shell offers the perfect versatile medicine ball from slams with a normal bounce-back effect to back-and-forth passes with a gym buddy for partner abs. With weighted options being offered in nine differing weights (6-30 pounds), the Rogue Medball is a solid pick for all the CrossFit lovers out there.

Best Soft-Shell Medicine Ball
Dynamax Soft-Shell Medicine Ball
$115 at Amazon
Pros
Best impact absorption
Sweat and scratch-resistant
Best in durability
Soft enough for partner tosses
Multiple colorways
Cons
Investment price
Can feel unbalanced over time
Virtually no bounce
If you truly want to increase rotational power as an athlete or develop a functional core, this soft-shell medicine ball is the best bet. Unlike rubber medicine balls that aggressively bounce back when attempting wall throws or slams (which can be a safety concern), the soft shell allows for maximal power throws with virtually no bounce back, sparing you from a harmful torpedoing object.
These balls are not only the best for impact absorption but are also sweat, moisture, and scuff-resistant thanks partly to their very durable vinyl materials and exceptional construction. While similar brands may make OK soft-shell balls, the Dynamax brand has found its way into collegiate and professional sports programs. While very expensive, you can rest easy that this investment will last for years to come.

Best Handle Grip Medicine Ball
Titan Fitness 10-Pound Dual Grip Medicine Ball
$62 at Amazon
$56 at Walmart
Pros
Comfortable dual handles
Sturdy rubber design
Pebble texture for added grip
More functional than others
Cons
A bit expensive
Can't be used for wall or ground slams
Only two weight options
Handles make it impossible for bouncing exercises
Medicine balls can start to lack once the sweat starts dripping and the balls become slick and slippery. This dual-handle medicine ball eliminates that altogether. With these handles, you end up getting more than your normal medicine ball. You get a workout tool that becomes more versatile than others.
From seated Russian twists, to kettlebell swings, to shoulder presses and much more, all are exercises you can perform thanks to this ball's handy handles. While other options use thin, flimsy handles, Titan Fitness' handles are thick, sturdy, and deep enough to make handling and pressing very convenient and comfortable. Rubber and a single material construction help to make this one long-lasting medicine ball.

Pros
Excellent durability

Affordable

Cons
No roll
Uneven balance is not ideal for some exercises
Might be too spongy for some
There are good options when it comes to using a med ball as a functional tool, especially for wall or ground slams—then there are the Slam Balls from Yes4All. Others may claim to be good for ground slams, but this one backs that up. Filled internally with sand and built from uber-durable PVC construction, this thing can take a beating and then some. No matter how much force you slam this thing to the ground with, it impacts like sludge and has zero rebound.
Perfect for functional training, the added treaded pattern increases grip, so even if you're doing overhead ground slams, you can ensure it won't slip out of your hands. There is also a slight lopsidedness you get when using it, which makes your core work even harder. While it doesn't roll (by design), this is one functional med ball that's offered at a great price, too.

Best Leather Medicine Ball
Everlast 1910 10-Pound Medicine Ball
$80 at everlast.com
Pros
Aesthetically appealing
Leather offers tacky grip when moist
Durable enough for push-ups
Cons
Only available in 10 lb
A bit pricey
Not recommended for slamming
Leather will wear down over time and use
Those who love a good vintage aesthetic will appreciate this leather medicine ball from Everlast. The brand that became the first household name in Boxing still makes quality heritage-like products today. With its all-leather construction, this medicine ball is still functional enough for gym use as the leather build is a durable material that ages gracefully over time.
Unlike some aggressively patterned rubber balls, this leather med ball provides a more comfortable option with excellent grip, as leather works well with moisture, creating a tacky-like feel. While it's best not to use it for wall throws and ground slams, the ball is still durable enough to perform push-ups on it. It also earns bonus points for elevating your gym's look, too.

Pros
Comes in 4-100 pounds
Durable yet soft
Perfect for slamming exercises
Two year warranty
Cons
Expensive for heavier options
May feel too unbalanced for some
For those above normally strong, strength athletes, these heavy-duty, sand-filled med balls from Perform Better take your strongman training to the next level. While most medicine balls top out around 30 pounds, PBs matches that and then goes beyond, with 30-100 pounds available in ten-pound increments.
"I'm a huge fan of these medicine balls because of the variety they bring," says
Don Saladino
, who has used med balls in his
own training
, as well as that of his clients like Ryan Reynolds. "I have been using med balls for years, and being able to go heavy and push my capacity is huge."
Made from sturdy and durable PVC and filled with sand, these balls feel like gel, while the soft textured shell is easy enough to toss and catch (using the reasonably weighted ones). Whether you use them as Atlas stone pick-ups, over-the-shoulder pickup and drops, or keg tosses, you won't find a better, heavier medicine ball.

This Lower Body Workout Will Jump Start Your Body Recomp Goal
This Lower Body Workout Will Jump Start Your Body Recomp Goal
We're giving you Day 1 of our Ultimate Body Recomposition Workout, a leg day designed to build big-time muscle.
By
Andrew Gutman
Published: Jan 30, 2025 2:25 PM EST

THERE ARE MANY
ways to train, but it’s tough to beat the basics if you’re striving to build muscle and lose body fat at the same time. That lofty goal is called
body recomposition
, which you
can
accomplish using the right plan. Take the leg day below, provided by
Men’s Health
’s fitness director
Ebenezer Samuel, C.S.C.S.
as part of our Body Recomp
Ultimate Workout video
.
The workout is built upon a foundation of tried-and-true muscle-building principles. You’ll use
compound movements
to target multiple muscles at once, lift heavy weights within a rep or two of failure to stimulate
hypertrophy
(muscular growth), and rest long enough to ensure you can tackle each set with ferocity. As long as you’re
consistently eating
in a slight
caloric deficit
, you’ll build new muscle tissue while slowly stripping body fat from your frame.
This is just Day 1 of the whole plan, which runs for four weeks. To access the entire program, you'll have to be a
Men's Health
MVP Premium
member.
Body Recomposition Workout Details
Expect to spend anywhere from an hour to an hour and 15 minutes in the gym for this workout, delegating about half that time to rest—a key to getting the most out of this session. Before you screenshot this workout and give it a try, there are a few things you should know:
Stick to the rest time recommendations
. Below, you’ll see rest times as short as zero to 30 seconds and as long as two and a half minutes.
Research
has shown that both short (less than 60 seconds) and long (more than a minute) rest times are effective for building muscle, but longer rest times will allow you to lift heavier weights for your next set. Which brings us to the next point:
Lift heavy weight
. One of
the keys to building muscle
is using heavy weights—that's especially true if you’re eating in a caloric deficit, according to Samuel—so choose a load that has you reaching failure within the rep range of your final set. And by failure, we mean
technical failure
, which is defined as not being able to do another repetition with perfect form.
Use
lifting straps
. The goal of this workout is to stimulate your muscles for growth, not lifting as much weight as possible. Grip strength will usually be the first point of failure in these heavy lower body lifts; your back and hamstrings will always be able to support more weight than your forearms. We suggest you
use lifting straps for this routine
to remove your grip from the equation so you can focus on hitting the muscles you’re actually trying to train.
The Day 1 Body Recomposition Workout
FIRST EXERCISE:
Barbell Romanian Deadlift (RDL)
The RDL is a hip hinge movement that hits your back, hamstrings, glutes, and taxes your core. Samuel advises that perform this movement with a barbell, so you can load up as much weight as you can handle. “Think of your first two sets where you’re building to that top set where you’re going to go as heavy as you possibly can for six to 10 good reps,” he explains.
How to Do It:
Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and abs engaged, holding a barbell with both hands.
Hinge forward, pushing your hips back and lowering your torso. Stop when your torso is parallel to the floor or your hamstrings are tense.
Pause, and then return to the start. That's 1 rep.
Sets and reps:
3 sets of 6 to 10 reps; 2 to 2:30 minutes rest each set
SECOND EXERCISE:
Dumbbell Walking Lunge
You’ll move onto a quad-dominant movement next—and we’re not talking about the back squat. Instead, Samuel wants you to perform walking lunges. “I want you to use heavy dumbbells…think about going up to 40-, 45-, even 55-pound dumbbells on each side,” he says.
Why the lunge and not the squat? “In real life, I don’t get to stand here, talk to you, and never move," he says. "We want to do something in the gym where we’re going from place to place and getting in that locomotion and acceleration.”
How to Do It:
Hold a dumbbell in each hand. Wear lifting straps so your grip isn’t a limiting factor of how much weight you can lunge,
Take a step forward and simultaneously squat down, driving the knee of your lead leg over your toes. Both of your legs should form roughly 90-degree angles.
Drive up, bringing your back leg forward so it’s in front of your lead leg.
Sets and reps:
3 sets of 6 to 10 reps per leg; 90 seconds rest each set
THIRD AND FOURTH EXERCISE:
Leg Extensions and Seated Leg Curl
You’ll end the workout by isolating the muscles in your quads and hamstrings, using machines and minimal rest times to really push your limits. If you don’t have access to a seated leg curl machine, you can use a lying leg curl machine—but Samuel likes the seated machine as it “leaves a lot less room for you to cheat and involve other muscles.”
How to Do It:
Set both the seated leg curl and leg extension so the ankle and knee pads are properly aligned with your joints.
Start with the seated leg curl. Lean forward so your legs are extended and you feel a deep stretch in your hamstrings. Hold onto the handles and curl your legs as far as the machine will let you. Slowly raise your legs until they’re extended, holding the stretched position for one second. Do 10 reps, and then rest briefly as you move to the other machine. seconds.
Sit in the leg extension machine. Lean back to extend your range of motion and place more tension on your quads. Extend your legs until they’re completely straight. Take two to three seconds to lower the weight. That’s one rep. Do 10 reps and then rest 30 seconds before returning to the leg curl.
Sets and reps:
3 sets of 10 to 12 reps for both exercises; 0 to 30 seconds rest between each exercise

An Accident Took His Legs. It Didn't Stop Him From Making IRONMAN History.
An unexpected journey took Billy Monger from racing cars to breaking triathlon records as a double amputee.

This story is part of our ongoing “First Steps” series, where we share extraordinary stories of men who transformed their bodies, minds, and lives with a focus on the first steps it took them to get there (because, after all, nothing can change without a first step!). Read all of the stories
here
.
Billy Monger
had been racing cars for years when, at 17, an accident changed his life forever. Not only did he hop back on the race track, but he soon found himself building up his strength and endurance. Below, he shares how he went from an arduous recovery to breaking an IRONMAN record in the span of just a few years.
MY DAD BOUGHT
me my first car when I was 2 years old, and he was keen for me to give it a go because it was a passion of his when he was younger. I got into go-karting when I was 6 years old. At 8, I started racing competitively, and won my first British championship when I was 10. The following year, I moved onto a world championship stage, and won races there, too. By the time I was 14, I moved up to car racing. At 16, I moved to Formula 4, an open-wheel racing car category for junior drivers. During my second season in April 2017, I got into an accident that led me to become a double amputee. I was only 17 years old.
I was in the hospital for about 5 weeks, and had 9 or 10 surgeries during that time. I also had  some follow-up surgeries a few months later. The physical recovery was a long process. But just 11 weeks after my accident, I got back behind the wheel of a car on a race circuit with hand controls. It wasn’t the level of racing I was used to in Formula 4, but it was important for me to start again
somewhere
.
In late January 2018, I was back in a Formula 3 race car. I was determined to stay on the career trajectory I had before my accident. During this, I was still relying on walking aids. I didn’t walk on my prosthetics independently until halfway through the year.
Once I was finally walking on prosthetics, I worked hard to build back my strength. During the pandemic lockdown, my dad and I built a home gym, and I started to play around pushing myself more physically. In 2021 I walked, cycled, and kayaked 140 miles in four days to raise money for the British charity
Comic Relief
. I worked with a trainer to prepare, and it gave me something to work towards after COVID.
After that, I knew I needed another physical challenge to take on. My trainer came up with the idea to participate in the
VinFast IRONMAN World Championship in Kailua-Kona, Hawai`i
in October 2024–with the goal of breaking the world record for a double amputee.
“I feel like
AIMING HIGH
always brings
THE BEST
out in me.”
I started all-out training for it in October 2023, a year before the race. It was a completely new training methodology for me. During my racing career, I did a lot of core and neck training and working on my coordination skills, all to maintain the level of fitness that you need to race a car. But for the IRONMAN, I needed to build up my aerobic endurance.
At first, it was a lot of swimming and a lot of cycling. In the early stages, I was training 8-10 hours a week. A lot of it was steady state exercise with a few intervals to keep my heart rate up. Although I had used swimming to help me immediately after my accident during recovery (since it requires zero weight-bearing), I was basically starting from scratch and had no technique. But I caught on.
My running prosthetics took a long time to get right and comfortable enough to take on such long distances. It was the last of the three disciplines I started, and I was finally able to integrate it into my training in February 2024. To qualify for Kona, I did three half IRONMANs, which helped me feel more comfortable with the process of getting ready for the big race. By that point, my training was up to 20 hours a week–close to 3 hours a day.
I worked with a nutritionist to help me fuel up for that much exercise. I was eating between 2,500-3,000 calories a day, which was a lot for me. (My body weight was between 121-132 pounds.) I had three main meals a day, with two snacks. I ate whole, nutritious foods–like fruit, protein yogurt and protein bars. If I was doing an intense training session I would have carbs–like gels or chews. Afterwards, I recovered with chocolate milk to get some more protein in.
Huw Fairclough | Ironman
Billy Monger finishes an Ironman 70.3 race on September 15, 2024 in Weymouth, England.
Kona was not an easy race. I was stung by two jellyfish during the swimming portion, which wasn’t ideal. But the biking portion went really well–I was aiming for sub-8 hours, and it took me roughly 7.5 hours. During my longest training ride before the race, I had picked up a small hamstring strain–so I was concerned about it going in, but it held up.
That said, when I got off the bike, I was absolutely destroyed physically. I was about 9 hours in at that point already, and it suddenly hit me that I had to run a full marathon—which I had never done before in training or otherwise. It was a brutal awakening. But I managed to get my way through it, and the long hours of training paid off. I ended up breaking the world record for a double amputee by over two hours–finishing in 14:23:56.
Although I was pretty broken physically after, my body has recovered–and I'm ready to get back into a proper fitness routine. I still plan to swim, cycle and run, and get back in the gym to build back my strength. I’m always competitive and set high goals and expectations for myself because I feel like aiming high always brings the best out in me. I’ve loved the triathlon community and space. With triathletes, what you put in effort-wise day in and day out is what you get back in terms of results. So it’s quite a rewarding process.
I thought I had a busy life training and traveling the world before doing this IRONMAN, that I didn’t have enough hours in the day. But when you take something like this on and you make it a priority, you realize you just weren't structuring your day in the right way. It’s the small things that make a difference. Even though you’re not feeling up for it, you have to go tick it off. If you say you’re going to do something, make it a priority and get it done as quickly and as soon as you can, and stick to it.

YOU MIGHT BE STEPPING
back into the gym
for the first time in a while
—or maybe even for
the first time ever
. Committing to fitness can be tough with all the distractions and conveniences in day-to-day life, especially if your goal is to develop a consistent training plan and dial-in your diet, to build real muscle.
If you belong to a certain type of gym, you might notice you're surrounded by massive dudes pushing even more massive weights. Their approach seems to be working in the muscle-building department, and their physiques are impressive to say the least. You want to get jacked like them, but you wonder: does building muscle really require that much time and dedication?
The answer is somewhere between yes and no. Developing an
Arnold-esque
physique takes decades of logged gym hours and a rock-solid nutrition plan. If you’re not looking to become the next Mr. Olympia, though, building muscle doesn’t have to be that complex. Here are a few tips to mastering the art of muscle-building.
The 10 Principles of Building Muscle
Rimagine Group Limited
//

1. Prioritize Protein Intake
The more protein your body stores—in a process called
protein synthesis
—the larger your muscles grow. But your body is constantly draining its protein reserves for other uses, like making hormones, for instance.
6-Week Lean Muscle Level-up
The result is less protein available for muscle building. To counteract that, you need to “build and store new proteins faster than your body breaks down old proteins,” says Michael Houston, Ph.D., a professor of nutrition at Virginia Tech University.
Shoot for about 1 gram of protein per pound of body weight, which is roughly the maximum amount your body can use in a day, according to a landmark study in the
Journal of Applied Physiology
.
For example, a 160-pound man should consume around 160 grams of protein a day—the amount he’d get from an 8-ounce chicken breast, 1 cup of cottage cheese, a roast-beef sandwich, two
eggs
, a glass of milk, and 2 ounces of peanuts. Split the rest of your daily calories equally between carbohydrates and fats.
2. Eat More
OatmealStories
//

In addition to adequate protein, you need
more calories
. Your body uses this extra energy to rebuild and grow muscle after your workouts. You’ll need to be strategic about how you increase your intake, says
Leslie Bonci
, M.P.H., R.D.N., sports dietitian to the Kansas City Chiefs.
Use the following formula to calculate the number you need to take in daily to gain 1 pound a week. (Give yourself two weeks for results to show up on the bathroom scale. If you haven’t gained weight by then, increase your calories by 500 a day.)
A.
Your weight in pounds: _____
B.
Multiply A by 12 to get your basic calorie needs: _____
C.
Divide B by 1.6 to estimate your resting metabolic rate (calorie burn without factoring in exercise): _____
D.
Strength training: Multiply the number of minutes you lift weights per week by 5: _____
E.
Aerobic training: Multiply the number of minutes per week that you run, cycle, and play sports by 8: _____
F.
Add D and E, and divide by 7: _____
G.
Add C and F to get your daily calorie needs: _____
H.
Add 500 to G: _____. This is your estimated daily calorie needs to gain 1 pound a week.
Upping your intake might not always be easy. “Gainers may find it difficult to eat more food as they may not always have a great appetite,” Bonci says. But there are options—one easy way to add in those calories is to increase the amount of nutrient dense foods you eat. Think higher calorie foods like full-fat cheeses and yogurts, nuts and nut butters, beans, and low-sugar granola and cereals. These types of foods will help you achieve your calorie count without having to eat a higher volume.
Another calorie-loading tip: make sure there are calories in your glass, not just on your plate, Bonci says. Perfect a
smoothie recipe
or find a
protein powder
that you can’t get enough of—those added calories (and protein!) will make all the difference in your weight gain.
3. Work Big, Not Small
Biceps curls are fun, but if you want to put on muscle, you have to do more to challenge your body. And one key to doing that, says
MH
fitness director
Ebenezer Samuel, C.S.C.S.
, is working through so-called
"multi-joint" movements
. "Yes, isolation training has value," says Samuel, "but it can't be the backbone of your training."
Instead, you want to do exercises that challenge multiple joints and muscles at once. Take, for example, a
dumbbell row
. Every row rep challenges biceps, lats, and core (if your form is strict). Using multiple muscle groups allows you to lift more weight, says Samuel, a key stimulator of growth (more on that later). And it pushes you to use muscles together, just as you do in real life. "Multi-joint moves are key in your workouts," he says.
Make sure moves like squats, deadlifts, pullups, and bench presses are in your workout to take advantage of that. All will stimulate multiple muscle groups at the same time, and in order to grow, you want to do that.
4. Train Heavy
If you want to build muscle and strength, you have to train heavy, says
Curtis Shannon, C.S.C.S.
"Training heavy, safely and efficiently, has many benefits," says Shannon. "Heavy training challenges the muscles not only concentrically but eccentrically. If done right, the stimulus of heavy weight going down with control and going back up will cause greater muscle tear and rebuild."
That means not every set you do should have you pumping out 10 to 15 reps. Yes, high-rep sets can have value, but for
multi-joint moves
like squats and bench presses, and deadlifts, don't be afraid to do sets of, say, five reps. That'll allow you to use more weight, building more pure strength, says Samuel. And as you progress, that new strength will allow you to lift heavier weights for more reps.
One way you can approach this in your training: Lead off every workout with an exercise that lets you train low-rep. Do four sets of three to five reps on your first exercise, then do three sets of 10 to 12 reps for every move after that. "It's the best of both worlds," says Samuel, "letting you build pure strength early, then pile up reps later."
5. Have a Drink First
A 2001 study at the University of Texas found that lifters who drank a shake containing amino acids and carbohydrates before working out increased their protein synthesis more than lifters who drank the same shake after exercising.
The shake contained 6 grams of essential amino acids—the muscle-building blocks of protein—and 35 grams of carbohydrates.
“Since exercise increases blood flow to your working tissues, drinking a carbohydrate-protein mixture before your workout may lead to greater uptake of the amino acids in your muscles,” says Kevin Tipton, Ph.D., an exercise and nutrition researcher at the University of Texas in Galveston.
For your shake, you’ll need about 10 to 20 grams of protein—usually about one scoop of a whey-protein powder. If you want to jazz it up,
here's a few of our favorite high-protein smoothie recipes
.
Can’t stomach protein drinks? You can get the same nutrients from a sandwich made with 4 ounces of deli turkey and a slice of American cheese on whole wheat bread.
6. Don't Always Go Hard

Your body should move every day, but that doesn't mean your workouts should take you to fatigue and exhaustion. "If you train your hardest every day, your body doesn't get a chance to grow," says Samuel. "Pick your spots to attack." Aim to finish every workout feeling good, not dead. Limit your weight room workouts to 12 to 16 total sets of work, and never go beyond that.
This doesn't mean you can't take on a brutal workout every so often. But limit workouts that take your body to its breaking point to three times a week, never on back-to-back days. "You need recovery to grow," says Samuel. "Constantly training to the point of exhaustion will be counterproductive to the recovery you need for muscle growth."
7. Down the Carbs After Your Workout
Research shows that you'll rebuild muscle faster on your rest days if you feed your body carbohydrates.
“Post-workout meals with carbs increase your insulin levels,” which, in turn, slows the rate of protein breakdown, says Kalman. Have a banana, a sports drink, a peanut-butter sandwich.
8. Challenge Yourself with Progressive Overload
As we mentioned earlier, one major key to muscle-building is pushing your muscles to
handle progressively greater challenges
. In general, most gym-goers think that means you must lift heavier in every single workout. That's simply not feasible, says Samuel. "There comes a point where it becomes harder to just put more weight on the bar," he says. "If that wasn't the case, everyone would be benching 300 pounds."
Don't simply aim to add weight on every set of every exercise, says Samuel. But do work to improve in some way on every set of an exercise. "Even if you're not going up in weight, you can push yourself in different ways," he says. "You might do 10 reps of deadlifts this set. On the next set, instead of adding weight, do the same 10 reps, but do them with even sharper form."
Sometimes, staying with the same weight for all four sets on a day can provide plenty of challenge, says Samuel, especially when you're improving your execution every set. There are other forms of progressive overload too. You can decrease the rest time between sets, going from, say, 120 seconds to 90 seconds, or you can up the reps, or you can even do more sets.
"Aim to improve every workout," says Samuel, "but know that that improvement won't always look the same. I may deadlift 315 pounds today four times and not be able to add weight. But if I can squeeze out a fifth rep, or even do my four reps with more control than I did last week, I'm on the right track."
9. Maximize Time Under Tension

One sometimes-forgotten way to progressively overload your muscles is to leave them under more of something called "
time under tension
". When your muscles are working, whether they're under a bench press bar, or whether your biceps is working to curl a dumbbell upwards, they're under "tension" from the weight. You can feel this too: If you stand holding dumbbells at your sides, your biceps aren't under tension. The moment you begin to curl them upwards, you'll feel them flex against the "tension" of the dumbbells.
Experienced lifters often use this tension to their advantage. Instead of just lifting and lowering a weight (on say, that biceps curl), they lift with a specific tempo. They might curl up as fast as they can, for example, and then lower the weight for three focused seconds with good form on every rep.
Doing this leaves your muscles under tension for longer than a typical set, in which you might lift and lower the weight without any specific timing. And that extra time under tension during a set can help spark muscle growth.
Note that you can do this on almost any strength exercise. It doesn't work for explosive exercises, like kettlebell swings, snatches, and cleans. But squats, deadlifts, curls, pullups and pushups (and many other moves) can be tweaked to add more time-under-tension, pushing your muscles farther on every rep.
10. Sleep At Least 6 Hours
Sleep is often the forgotten variable in the journey to muscle. You spend plenty of time training, but what you often don't realize is this: When you're asleep, your muscles are recovering and your body is growing. It's also during this period that muscle-growing hormones are secreted.
You know by now that, ideally, you want to get eight to 10 hours of sleep. That, of course,
doesn't always happen
, but you want to do what you can to maximize the quality of the hours you do get, if you can't hit 8 hours.
So think about your sleep setup if you're serious about muscle. Try to go to bed at the same time every day and try to rise at the same time every day. And sleep in a fully dark, fully quiet cool room. All these little things optimize sleep quality and that can have an underrated effect on your ability to build muscle.
Why Is Building Muscle Beneficial?
BUILDING MUSCLE CAN
do more for your body than just making you look different or adding strength. Yes, there’s a high that comes with hitting your squat max, but the benefit runs so much deeper than those feelings of accomplishment.
Muscle Offers Joint Support
Our muscles offer a huge support system to our joints. They can
absorb
a bit of the impact that radiates through our knees and hips when running, jumping, and even walking. The more muscle we have, the more force gets absorbed, saving our joints from long-term damage. Our muscles also ensure our joints move the directions they’re supposed to. When our muscles are too weak to push against an opposing force, our joints may not be able to handle the impact, causing breaks and tears. This kind of support allows us better balance, preventing those kinds of accidents before they happen.
More Muscle Helps to Burn More Calories
Though the difference is not as significant as many assume it to be,
increasing your muscle
mass also increases your metabolism, meaning you burn more calories at rest in a day. A pound of muscle
burns around 13 calories
a day, whereas a pound of fat tissue only burns about 4. If you're bulking, though, you may be needing food more than this discrepancy accounts for.
That being said if you're putting on muscle, you're definitely working out more often, and inherently burning more calories throughout your day.
Muscle Helps Blood Levels
Gaining strength can even help our blood composition. Our
muscles use both glucose
and fatty acids for fuel. This keeps our blood sugar levels down. Elevated blood sugar can cause long term effects, such as blood vessels damage and a higher risk of heart disease, stroke, and nerve problems.
Muscle Makes Everything Else Easier
Whether you enjoy hitting the basketball court for a game of pick up, tending to your garden, or backpacking through the wilderness, building muscle can “set [you] up for success in the things you enjoy doing outside the gym,” says
Jahkeen Washington, C.P.T.
, owner of
JTW Fit
and the
Harlem Kettlebell Club
Increasing muscle mass can improve your everyday functionality. Many aspects of life become easier as you get stronger—no more losing your breath going up a single flight of stairs, or dropping your heavy grocery bags.
Yes, Muscle Makes You Look Good
Yes, there are the obvious aesthetic benefits to adding muscle mass to your frame. Your clothes will fit better, some people might consider you more attractive, and you'll feel more confident. Those are all big reasons that drive guys to spend hours in the gym pumping iron in the pursuit of gains. There's no shame in making your aesthetic a reason to get in the gym - it still leads to all the other health benefits.
While there's so many reasons to focus on muscle building, there's more to it than just showing up to the gym, hefting some weights, and calling it a day. You'll need to be a bit more intentional for effective muscle growth. To build muscle, you must push your muscles to the limit, then let them recover and grow stronger as they do. And to do this, you must create the proper recovery environment for them when you're not in the gym.
This means your quest to build muscle involves a host of variables over a 24-hour period. The things you do in the gym to push your muscles to the limit count. So does the "work" you put in during the other 20 or so hours when you're away from the gym, everything from rest to nutrition to active recovery. All of this can affect how you build muscle.
What Is Muscle Hypertrophy?
One of the best ways to get started is to understand and define what muscle-building actually is.
Muscle hypertrophy
is the increase in growth of muscle cells, and it's a process that's often kickstarted by resistance training. It's the adaptation our muscles experience from continual exposure to progressively overloaded forms of resistance training, which then results in an increase in our muscle fiber size, both in diameter and length. Essentially, you need to push your muscles hard, often by lifting heavy loads for reps, stimulating the release of muscle-growing hormones and other metabolites. Our muscles get physically larger through the act of strategically consistent and harder workouts.
Remember, effort is one of the most definitive drivers of muscle gain over time. However, it's just one of the drivers. That effort needs to be coupled with a desire to push your body farther than you might think it's capable of. This is something called "progressive overload." If you're not familiar,
progressive overload
involves creating some form of increased, strategic effort based on the style of training you're doing. This doesn't mean going heavier and heavier with the weights in every set and every single workout, because sometimes, that's not possible. Over-focus on going heavy in every single workout, and you set yourself up for injury and disappointment.
No, progressive overload takes place over months and months of working out. Sure, if you're new to the gym, you may add major pounds to the bench press, partly because you're just learning the exercise. But the longer you're in the gym, the harder it is to make gains. This is why it's incredibly important to have a plan in place and build a framework for your training and nutritional habits that coincide with your goals. "Workouts without a plan just won't get you to the goals you want," says Samuel. "You need a strategy."
Note, your muscle building strategy doesn't need to be so rigid that it leaves no room for fun. In fact, you can still eat meals you enjoy, and you don't need to spend hours in the gym, as long as when you're training and fueling yourself strategically a majority of the time. The goal is to create a muscle building plan that is realistic for your goals and needs.
How Long Does It Take to Build Muscle?
THE ANSWER DEPENDS
largely on how much muscle you already have.
"On average, untrained individuals gain one to two pounds of mass per month for several months in the initial phases of training. Probably half that, if you're moderately trained," says
Brad Schoenfeld, P.h.D., C.S.C.S
.
Once you're experienced, you'll see those muscle gains slow down. "If you're very well trained, as you continues to get closer to a genetic ceiling, the amount of muscle that you can build is progressively diminished. Some high level natural bodybuilders can hope to gain one or two pounds a year."
The key is to continue working to improve to build the strength and muscle to the best of your ability, and appreciating strength training for its other benefits as you enjoy the journey.
Protein Is Essential for Muscle Growth

WEIGHT-GAIN POWDERS
seem like an easy solution to a skinny guy’s problems. After all, they pack as many as 2,200 calories into one serving. But you’re not getting what you pay for.
“High-calorie weight-gain drinks usually get more than 80 percent of their calories from sugar,” says Doug Kalman, R.D. And downing that much sugar can give you an upset stomach and diarrhea.
So, in a sense, you’re flushing good money down the toilet. “You’ll get much better results by spreading your calories throughout the day,” says Kalman.
And by using protein shakes. Look for
whey protein powders
at nutrition stores. Combine one scoop of the powder with the following ingredients and blend for a homemade muscle-building pre-workout shake:
1 tsp olive or flaxseed oil
1/2 c fat-free yogurt
1 c grape or apple juice
Stats per shake:
335 calories, 27 gram protein, 45 grams carbohydrates, 6 grams fat

Beginner Full-Body Muscle Building Workout
NEED A PLACE TO START?
Washington’s full body beginner workout is a great first step into lifting. This strength workout hits all your major muscle groups.
3 rounds of each super set / 2 to 3 minute rest between each round
Superset A
Dumbbell
Goblet Squats
8 reps
How to Do It:
Stand with your feet just wider than shoulder-width apart. Turn your toes out slightly to start; as you progress, find the most comfortable stance for your own mobility.
Hold a kettlebell or dumbbell with both at chest-height, elbows high. Pull your shoulder blades down and back. Brace your core.
Push your butt back, then bend your knees to descend down into the squat. Lower down to a depth just below parallel (i.e., your thighs are parallel to the floor) or to the most comfortable position given your personal mobility.
Press your knees apart to prevent them from caving in. Maintain tension in your core and shoulders; don't rest your elbows on your knees.
Push off the floor and squeeze your glutes to stand back up.
Dumbbell
Single-Arm Rows
10 reps
How to Do It:
Stand with your feet at shoulder width apart in front of the bench. Push your butt back and lower your torso down, extending your off arm to rest your palm on the bench. Make sure your shoulders stay above your hips.
Grab the dumbbell with your working hand. Squeeze your glutes and abs to create full-body tension. Your back should be flat, with your head in a neutral position.
Squeeze your mid-back muscles to drive your elbow up, rowing the weight. Keep your shoulders level and avoid rotating your lower back.
Pause for a beat, then lower the weight back down.
Superset B
Dumbbell
Romanian Deadlifts
10 reps
How to Do It:
Standing with your feet about shoulder-width apart, grab a pair of dumbbells from a bench or box.
Keep the dumbbells close to your sides, with your shoulders back, your core tight, and glutes squeezed.
Begin “pushing” your butt back as far as possible as you begin lowering your torso—as if you’re trying to close a car door. Think about taking two seconds with the lowering phase. The goal is to get to about a 45-degree angle, depending on your personal mobility limits. Don’t forget to keep the dumbbells close to your shins—don’t let them hang too far forward.
Pause at the bottom, then stand back up, slightly quicker than the lowering phase.
Dumbbell
Half-Kneeling Press
8 reps
How to Do It:
Kneel on one knee. Grab the dumbbell, and hold it in the hand opposite to the knee that is up.
Squeeze your core, and pack your shoulder blades down and back, creating full body tension. Ensure your shoulders are stacked right overtop of your hips.
Start with the dumbbell lined up with your collarbone. Slightly shift your elbow forward in relation to your torso.
Make sure your forearm is perpendicular to the floor. Press the weight straight up, keeping the core tight so the ribs don’t flare outward.
Superset C
Single-Dumbbell Pause Hip Thrust
10 reps
How to Do It:
You’ll need a bench to set up here. Place your shoulder blades against the bench. Lay the dumbbell across your lap.
Lift your hips up to find the proper position for your feet. Your shins should be parallel with the floor, with your feet about hip-width apart.
Drive the weight up, squeezing your glutes as much as possible. Open your knees up as you drive to help protect your knees. Pause at the top for 2 to 3 seconds before relaxing back to the start.
Dumbbell Seated
Biceps Curls
12 reps
How to Do It:
You’ll need a bench for this movement. If it’s an adjustable bench, move the back so that it is upright at 90 degrees.
Sit up straight on the bench. Hold your dumbbells by your sides, keeping the elbows close into the ribcage.
Turn the wrists so your palms face the ceiling, and curl the weights up towards your chest. Keep the core tight to prevent any sway of the body to muscle up the weight.
Core
Dead Bugs
20 reps
How to Do It:
Start by laying down, with your arms and legs at 90 degrees. Contract your abs so that you can drive your lower back into the ground—the goal is to eliminate any space between your back and any ground surface.
Now, focusing on holding this position, extend one leg and the opposite arm. Extend only so far as you’re able to without losing that back-to-the-ground position.
Don’t worry if you can’t go very far; the move will get easier the more you perform it.
Cable Wood Chops
10 reps per side
How to Do It:
Set up your cable machine so the handle is on the highest setting. Make yourself parallel with the machine, and place two hands on the handle.
Plant your feet about hip-width apart, and squeeze your abs and glutes to create a sturdy base.
Keep your arms mostly straight, with only a slight bend through the elbow. Squeeze your core to pull the cable down across your body to your opposite hip, trying to keep your torso as still as possible.
Continue squeezing your core while you slowly release the handle back up to the starting position.

Why Trust Us?
LIFTERS LONG HELD
to the assumption that any amount of cardio would kill their gains. Thankfully, that type of bro-science is now largely ignored—especially by guys with lofty goals like
body recomposition
—but the question of what kind of cardio exercise fits best into a training plan is still the talk of the free weight floor.
You don't have to take to the treadmill jogs to get the calorie-burning benefits you're looking for to compliment your resistance training. Other cardio machines can add variety to and enhance your training without the joint-pounding that comes with running—specifically,
the stair climber machine
.  Available in many big-box gyms, the humble stair climber is a fantastic calorie-burning tool that’ll help you get and stay lean and bolster your work capacity with weights.
Below, we dive deeper into what the stair climber is, how to use it, and the benefits of this underrated machine.
What Is a Stair Climber?
The stair climber is a large, vertical machine with three to four steps that constantly revolve, like the belt of a treadmill, so you can essentially climb stairs in place. Unlike a treadmill, however, you'll be challenged to lift your bodyweight as you step to the next rung of the machine. Stair climbers are available in many commercial and private gyms.
Benefits of Using a Stair Climber Machine
Burning Calories
Thirty minutes of fast stair climbing burns about 400 calories per 30 minutes for a 180-pound man, according to the
2024 Compendium of Physical Activities
, which assigns metabolic equivalents or METs, a measure of your working metabolic rate versus your resting metabolic rate, to different physical activities. According to these estimates, the stair climber burns roughly two and half calories more per minute than jogging and six calories more per minute than brisk walking. Case and point: The stair climber is an efficient and effective fat-loss tool for lifters looking to reveal their hard-earned muscle mass or stay in a slight calorie deficit during a
body recomposition phase
.
“I have used this machine countless times to speed up my rate of fat loss or slow down my rate of gain (during a bulking phase),” explains
Chris Parnell
, an NYC-based personal trainer and men's Physique competitor in the World Natural Bodybuilding Federation. “The key is to remember your goal; if you’re trying to gain size, your cardio time shouldn't exceed the amount of time you spend resistance training.”
Improved Work Capacity
Some small
studies
have shown that using a stair climber can help to improve your
Vo2 max
(a measure of how much oxygen a person can use during hard exercise). An improved Vo2 max means you can work harder for longer.  Although weight training isn’t as taxing on your cardiorespiratory system as other activities like running, a lack of conditioning can impact your ability to lift weights effectively.
“The biggest carryover to lifting that the stair climber has is its ability to increase a person’s aerobic capacity, which increases their ability to do more work for longer,” Parnell says. “If you’re barbell squatting for 10 reps and you’re breathing heavily and your cardio is failing before your legs fatigue, [you can] start incorporating the stair climber.”
Lifters looking for a cardio fix aren't the only exercisers that can benefit from using a stair climber. Runners can too, even if the relatively slow pace of the machine seems counterintuitive. Thanks to the potential Vo2 max benefits, runners can turn to the stair climber as a useful tool to keep improving their fitness when they want to save their joints from accumulating more stress from pounding the pavement.
Building Up Leg Strength
We’re not saying you should replace leg days with stair climbing; lifting heavy weights remains the best way to grow muscle. Still, consistently hitting the stair climber does activate the muscles in your legs (quads, hamstrings, and glutes), which can help you build muscular endurance and strength. Every time you step up onto another step, you're driving into hip extension and full knee extension, and over the course of a stair climber workout, you accumulate a ton of volume doing this.
The stair climber is also considered a weight-bearing exercise, since you’re placing the entirety of your body weight onto a leg every time you step upward. Weight-bearing movements
have been shown
to increase bone density, helping to prevent fractures as you age. You can easily add a load it a bit too, by strapping on
a weight vest
, so you can turn your stair climbing session into resistance training for even more benefits.
How to Incorporate a Stair Climber Into Your Workouts
The question isn't whether you use a stair climber, but
how
you should use a stair climber—and the answer to that question really depends on your goals. Parnell says a safe and effective starting point for anyone is to perform two 30-minute weekly sessions at a moderate intensity, which “does not negatively impact my resistance training." You can also safely sneak in stair climber work at the end of almost any strength workout; even 6 to 8 minutes of moderate-pace stair climber work can help you pile up a few extra steps and burn a few extra calories.
There isn’t really a cap as to how often you can use the stair climber, but make sure you're paying attention to your rate of recovery. If you feel sore or fatigued during your gym sessions, even with 48 to 72 hours of rest between body parts, then you’re likely doing too much.
If you want to build muscle mass and stave off excessive fat gain, setting your limits on the stair climber is much simpler. “I would not use the stair climber for more than half the amount of time you spend resistance training,” explains Parnell. “So if you weight train for three hours every week, don’t use the stair climber (or perform any aerobic exercise) for more than an hour and a half.” The reason why: You’ll burn too many calories and end up not gaining any or much muscle mass.
You can perform your stair climber sessions on your weight training days or separate days. If you do hit up the stair climber on the same day you lift weights, perform cardio after you lift weights. Otherwise, you risk being too fatigued to have a productive lifting session.
How to Progress Your Stair Climber Workout
In addition to adding a session to your week, you can tweak your stair climber workouts to be easier (or harder).
Focus on slight increases in difficulty, instead of adding time to your workouts, says
MH
fitness director
Ebenezer Samuel, C.S.C.S.
You might raise your speed ever so slightly on the stairclimber, or add an external load (like a weight vest) to your workouts. If you choose to increase speed, keep those adjustments as small as possible; you're climbing stairs, so it doesn't take much speed to progress that challenge. Progress with speed no more than once every five to six workouts; it'll challenge you more than you expect, even if you don't notice it. Never progress speed and add weight simultaneously.
You can also add time to your sessions, although don't make this your main way of "progressing." As with all cardio modalities, honing the quality of your work is better than doing more work for the sake of spending more time on the device.
Avoid changing your stride on the stair climber. Sure, you may see people trying to add a resistance band between their ankles (to stimulate their glutes on each stride) or trying to climb the stair climber laterally. That's not the best use of the machine—and it might not be the safest way to use it, either.

WHEN YOU THINK
about a lover’s touch, your brain might jump to a pair of hands lingering around the hips—which explains the origin of the term "love handles." It’s a cute nickname, but you’d probably describe love handles themselves as anything but "cute."
The term has become associated with the pesky fat that sits on top of your hip bones, and lots of guys want it gone. “Many men are concerned about how to lose weight in their midsection. I let them know that their body has an android distribution, or male-like, weight distribution,” says Fatima Cody Stanford, M.D., M.P.H., obesity medicine physician and
Men's Health
advisor. If losing your love handles is what will help boost your confidence and make you a healthier, happier version of yourself, that's a fine goal to have. Just remember that there's more to health than how you look, and you can set your sights on other outcomes, too (like getting stronger more generally or something like
body recomposition
more specifically).
While there’s no way to lose fat from your midsection only without medical intervention, there are several ways to bring down your overall body fat which will pull from all areas. Here's how.
What Are Love Handles?
Love handles are what most people commonly call the bundle of subcutaneous fat that lies just above your pant line, sitting directly under the skin. That’s actually good news, because it means it’s not the dangerous kind of fat, called
visceral fat
, that can sit on your organs and put unnecessary (and life-threatening) pressure on them. Adipose fat, such as the love handles, can act as energy deposits. When our bodies lose other energy intake (food), we can use these deposits to power our bodily functions.
Even though our bodies have good intentions when collecting these love handles, it doesn’t mean they’re impossible to lose. But it will involve a solid calorie deficit and some effort in the gym.
There are a few shortcuts you can take, but they're extreme, and not something that we'd generally recommend.
Liposuction
is one of these options. More recently, men have turned to non-invasive treatments, the most popular of which feature either
freezing or heating the stubborn fatty areas off the body
. These treatments are expensive and might be a bridge too far, unless you're really desperate.
Besides, by cutting corners, you'll miss out on the fitness gains you'd make along the way using other methods, which will hopefully become a reason you're training, regardless of the aesthetic payoff. If getting rid of love handles without special treatments is your goal, you'll have to work hard—but you'll have to work smart, too.
One method that is
not
smart and
won't
work is
spot reduction
. The theory is that if you focus all of your attention on one specific area in your training (for instance, doing hundreds of crunches for you midsection), you'll be able to burn off the fat in just that area. But that's not how your body works. What you
can
do is lose fat more generally, then build up muscle where you might not have had it before—but for that to work, you'll have to do that smart, hard work.
7 Tips to Get Rid of Your Love Handles
Here's a plan to ditch your stubborn love handles from former
Men's Health
fitness advisor Craig Ballantyne, C.S.C.S.
Find the Right Intervals for Exercise
Studies
have shown that interval-based exercise programs, most specifically
high intensity interval training (HIIT)
, are more effective for burning off your love handles than steady state cardio. Instead of running for miles on end without any clear goal, fine tune your work and rest periods to strip away the fat.
So what type of interval program should you use? You can use a
jump rope
, or apply the principles to running or
weight room work
. Ballantyne recommends this setup to banish that pesky midsection fat:
After a thorough warmup, alternate between 20 seconds of hard exercise and 40 seconds recovery. Repeat that pattern 6 to 8 times. Afterwards, finish with 5 to 10 minutes of cooldown exercise.
If you have extra time, do 10 minutes of regular cardio pace.
Don’t Overload on Cardio

Jogging can only do so much.
Even though Ballantyne recommended cardio for a cool down, he's wary of its effectiveness when performed alone. Extended periods of steady state cardio, like jogging, won’t do much to cut down your spare tire. "It's not going to work as well as interval training," Ballantyne said.
This is related to another issue, according to Ballantyne: Many guys don't have enough muscle in the first place. Losing love handles, like bodybuilding, is a game of illusion. Muscle on your chest and back can essentially "hide" excess fat in your love handle area.
"So most guys are “skinny-fat,” and then try to lose love handles with cardio only, and basically become even smaller versions of themselves—but still skinny-fat," Ballantyne said. "It's better to use intervals and weight training to gain muscle and lose fat at the same time—which IS possible—and change your body's overall appearance."
Rethink Your Core Training Routine
"Ab exercises like crunches are generally a waste of time," Ballantyne said. The problem is, you’re only working the muscles around your lower spine with crunches and situps.
Instead, you should build up your core with moves that focus on spinal stability, like planks and hollow body holds. Check out this quick video about the way your core muscles function for an idea of what you should be aiming for:
Want a smarter core workout in general? Check out
Epic Abs
, the program from MH fitness director Ebenezer Samuel, C.S.C.S. that inspired this video.
Build Yourself Up While Slimming Down
While you're cutting down your midsection, do yourself a solid and work on some other areas of your body that can take attention away from your ample hips. Build up your pecs, lats, deltoids, and traps to create the illusion of smaller love handles.
"Most guys don't have enough muscle to focus on just losing weight," Ballantyne said, "so every guy must build some muscle in these areas."
How can you build the muscle
and
lose fat at the same time? You're
hoping to "culk,"
so you should start by training hard, eating properly, and sticking to a consistent program.
Ballantyne also recommended a plan based around two to three total body workouts per week. Use five exercises per workout (one lower body, one upper push, one lower body single leg, one upper pulling, one total body ab exercise). Do that as a circuit three times through, with eight to 12 reps per exercise. Finish with interval training.
For best results, follow a plan that fits your unique training needs. Use our Workout Finder below to get a personalized recommendation based on your age, fitness level, and other key factors.
Create a Calorie Deficit

You can't neglect nutrition if you're looking to lose fat. After all, losing fat means burning more calories then you take in, or creating a calorie deficit.
Here’s how to calculate a healthy calorie deficit based on your body and goals
.
There are easy eating hacks you can incorporate into your daily routine to
cut calories
while still enjoying yourself and staying satisfied. Eliminating foods you love is an unsustainable way to live. "Negotiate with yourself on what you are willing to do without or do with less of," says Leslie Bonci, R.D., sports dietitian for Kansas City Chiefs.
Fill Up With Healthy Foods
Prioritize and optimize
protein
,
fiber
, healthy fats, and produce to fill up. Protein and fiber help you stay fuller, longer—which may reduce snacking in between meals. When choosing grains, pick the higher fiber choices like quinoa, oatmeal, and whole wheat pastas. Incorporate more beans into your salads, soups, and even blend and add to sauces. Include a fruit or a veggie at every occasion.
When it comes to snacking, focus on foods that will make you chew longer and eat slower, like jerky or apples. Bean dips with veggies are also a quick and easy snack that will load up the fiber and protein with little calories.
To really find a custom nutrition plan that will work best with your body, talk to a registered dietitian.
Work With Professionals
We don’t need to tell you that losing weight is no walk in the park. Accomplishing your goals will take a balance of overhauled nutrition, exercise, and recovery practices to complete the equation and finally shed some of those pounds. You might find it tough to do any of those things on your own.

Working with a professional can help provide some much needed accountability and guidance. Doctors who specialize in weight loss, nutritionists, dietitians, and personal trainers can all help you get to where you want to be. They can tailor your workouts and meal plans to better match your genetic makeup and goals. Don’t be afraid to ask for help if the task feels daunting.
6 Exercises to Target Your Love Handles
Sorry to break it to you—doing loads of side bends and Russian twists won’t melt away your love handles. It’s impossible to lose fat on one portion of your body by exercising the muscles in that area. The concept is called
spot training, or spot reduction
—and it doesn’t work.
What
does
work is incorporating high-velocity compound movements into your workouts. Compound movements are exercises that require multiple muscle groups working together. These kinds of moves will burn a lot of calories, aiding in creating the calorie deficit you need to burn fat all over. Here are 6 of our favorites.
Med Ball Slams
This move lights up your body head to toe, and ramps up your heart rate in the process. Not only will
med ball slams
aid in the fat loss process, but they’ll help you take a little aggression out on your worst days.
How to Do It:
Keep your med ball in between your legs. Hinge the hips down and back, keeping the chest lifted.
As you pick up the ball, explode upwards, coming onto your tiptoes. Keep the arms straight over your head, and keep your hips underneath your shoulders.
Drive down into your heels, and sit back into your squat before swinging your arms through.
Sets and Reps:
Aim for 2 to 3 sets of 30 second sets, either as a warm up or programmed into your next conditioning circuit.
Dumbbell Snatches
The
dumbbell snatch
is one of the best movements for building full body power and strength. Almost your entire body has to work to power the weight up and overhead.
How to Do It:
Place your feet a little wider than hip width apart. Sink the hips down and back, but keep the chest up high.
Grab the dumbbell and turn your elbow pit out to tighten up.
Drive through the legs as powerfully as you can. Pull the dumbbell upwards as if you’re zipping up a coat.
Once your elbow hits your shoulder height—think about pulling backward and turn the elbow to punch the dumbbell towards the ceiling. Dip under the dumbbell with the elbow extended.
Slow lower to the shoulder and then hips before squatting to place the weight back on the floor.
Sets and Reps:
Aim for 3 sets of 3 to 5 reps with a heavy weight, or build it into a conditioning set by doing 30 seconds of work, 30 seconds of rest with a medium weight.
Kettlebell Swing
The
kettlebell swing
is a fundamental core exercise that works practically every muscle in your body. Be careful about ramping up the weight too quickly though—this move has a ton of subtleties that are vital to the safety of the movement.
How to Do It:
Start with the kettlebell a little bit in front of your stance. Hinge the hips back, and tighten up your core and shoulder blades as you grab onto the weight.
Hike the bell backwards as if you were hiking a football. Aggressively stand up by straightening out your knees and hips to thrust the bell up to shoulder height.
Let the bell fall back into your body before swinging the hips back and tilting the torso forward to repeat.
Sets and Reps:
Do 4 sets of 10 to 12 reps with a heavy weight, or build it into a conditioning set by doing 30 seconds of work, 30 seconds of rest with a medium weight.
Burpees
Burpees are infamous for a reason. It looks simple, but do it the right way and you’ll feel way more of a challenge than you’d expect.
How to Do It:
Start standing with your feet shoulder-width apart.
Squat down, placing your hands flat on the floor inside your feet.
Leap your feet back into a pushup position, squeezing your shoulder blades, abs, and glutes. Your feet should be slightly wider than shoulder-width apart.
Bend at the elbows to lower your chest down to the floor. Control this movement rather than throwing yourself straight down.
Press back up into the pushup.
Leap your feet forward back to the initial squatting position.
Explode straight up into the air powerfully, with
triple extension
through the ankle, knee, and hip.
Land back on the floor under control.
Sets and Reps:
Aim 3 to 4 rounds of 20 seconds on, 40 seconds off, or build it into a conditioning circuit.
Mountain Climber
Mountain climbers are a staple core exercise that will challenge your upper body too as you maintain that high plank position.
How to Do It:
Set up in a high plank (pushup) position, with your hands stacked directly below your shoulders, elbows turned out, and feet just wider than hip-width apart. Your shoulders should be higher than your hips. Think of this as an athletic position.
Squeeze your shoulders, core, and glutes to create full-body tension. Look down at the floor, keeping your head in a neutral position.
Drive one knee up high to your chest, as if you were running. Return your leg to a straight position. Repeat with the other leg.
Continue alternating reps, working to keep your torso in position with your shoulders higher than your hips. Brace your core to stay level.
Sets and Reps:
Set a timer for 6 minutes and aim for  20 seconds of work, 10 seconds of rest for a good core burn, build it into a conditioning circuit.
Dumbbell Thruster
This multi-joint movement combines a front squat and a push press to incorporate the whole body to build power and strength—and torch calories, too.
How to Do It:
Grab a hold of two dumbbells, and set your feet up about shoulder width apart. Hold the dumbbells up to the shoulders, pointing the elbows up and forward a little bit.
Squeeze the shoulder blades down and back to control the dumbbells.
Hinge down and back to where your thighs are a little below parallel to the ground, while the back stays straight.
Push back up to standing powerfully, and extend the shoulders and elbows to push the weights up towards the ceiling.
Sets and Reps:
Aim for 3 sets of 6 to 8 reps, build it into a conditioning circuit for 30 seconds of work, 30 seconds of rest.

Editor's Note Jan. 27:
We recently got hands on with the newest version of the
Reebok Nano (the X5)
, and updated the guide accordingly.
YOUR WORKOUT ROUTINE
doesn’t have to feel like a chore. Cross training isn’t just about mixing it up—it’s about keeping your body guessing and your workouts fresh. "When implemented properly, cross training introduces new movement patterns, can reduce injury risk, and keeps workouts effective and engaging for continuous improvement," says
Richard Vance, C.S.C.S.
, a sports performance specialist at Lehigh Valley Health Network. Plus, let’s face it, doing the same thing every day gets boring. You need something to keep it interesting.

And here’s where it all starts—your shoes. The right pair can make or break your cross training sessions. They’re your foundation for everything: lifting, running, jumping—you name it. The wrong shoes? Expect blisters, sore arches, and lifts so shaky you look like you’re on a tightrope. Cross training shoes are the multitaskers of the footwear world, bridging the gap between
running shoes
and
weightlifting kicks
. Whether you’re hammering through an outdoor HIIT class, grinding at the gym, or knocking out a home workout, these shoes are built to keep up.
It's true finding the right pair of shoes for even one type of activity can be challenging enough (see our
best walking shoes
,
best workout shoes
and
best trail running shoes
), but finding the right pair of trainers that can handle a wide array of different movements? That requires hours of testing and careful consideration. After putting these shoes through the wringer—testing versatility, stability, durability, breathability, fit, and weight—we’ve narrowed it down to the 11 best cross-training shoes.
What to Consider
Versatility
Your cross-training shoes should be ready for anything—whether you’re balancing on a rear-foot elevated split squat, panting through shuttle runs, or trying not to smash your shins on
box jumps
. Look for cushioned midsoles to keep you comfortable during cardio, sturdy soles to keep you grounded for heavy lifts, and a flexible design that lets you pivot, jump, and move like a pro.
Fit
A great fit means no slipping or pinching. Aim for a snug midfoot and heel, with a roomy toe box for natural movement. If your toes are crammed like sardines, maybe size up or wear a thinner sock, like
Darn Tough’s Run Quarter Ultra-Lightweight Running Sock
.
Stability
The best cross-training shoes keep you grounded. A firm midsole (the shock-absorbing piece under your foot) and supportive upper (the part that covers the top of your foot) are essential for handling lateral moves and quick transitions without wobbling. Bonus points for sticky rubber outsoles that grip the ground.
Weight
Heavy shoes can feel like you’re trudging through quicksand, slowing you down with every step. Lightweight designs, on the other hand, keep you fast and agile, making explosive movements easier and more efficient.
Breathability
Sweaty feet? Hard pass. Look for mesh uppers or perforated designs that keep air circulating and prevent moisture build-up. Because nobody wants their shoes smelling like a middle school locker room.
Durability
Cross-training is tough on shoes—it’s like asking them to be stunt doubles. Reinforced areas in high-wear zones and tough materials are non-negotiable. A good pair should survive rope climbs, hang cleans, and hex-bar deadlifts without falling apart.
How We Chose
For the past two years, we consulted with
Men's Health
editors and writers on the top cross training shoes for men. Experts, including Fitness Director Ebenezer Samuel, C.S.C.S., Senior Fitness Editor Brett Williams, NASM, and Fitness and Commerce Editor Charles Thorp, NASM, put countless cross trainers through the paces and evaluated their fit, support, design, and stability. We also considered price point, as some cross trainers provide a better overall value than others.
Our editors, along with writer
Joseph Arangio, C.S.C.S.
, tested these shoes in the gym, on the track, and in HIIT classes. We even recruited top fitness pros to make sure these picks meet the needs of athletes who take their workouts seriously—or at least seriously enough to justify new shoes.
The result? A lineup of cross-trainers that are tough, versatile, and probably more dependable than your last gym buddy.

Pros
Great for lifting, HIIT, and plyometrics

The mesh design keeps things cool
Cons
Struggles with lifts over 400 pounds
Not the best for rope climbs
The Nike Free Metcon 6 continues the legacy of its line, beloved in CrossFit boxes for its versatility and performance. Nike revamped its reliable Metcon line, making it lighter, more flexible, and incredibly breathable. These shoes are built for versatility—you can lift 350 pounds, grunt through burpees, and then hop on the
treadmill
, all without your feet sending out an SOS.
"The Free Metcons are tuned more to running than the standard Metcons, which makes them great for group classes and a go-to for any training that involves basic lateral movement," says Fitness Director
Ebenezer Samuel, C.S.C.S.
And while they're not ideal for max deadlifts or squats, "they offer a passable base for lighter-weight versions of those moves done for higher reps, like goblet squats," says Samuel.
Now, let’s talk about the drawbacks. Rope climbs? Forget it. This mesh will rip faster than your patience in rush-hour traffic. And if you’re throwing 400 pounds on the bar, you’ll want something more stable—this isn’t a shoe for max-out day. But man, it’s light. Like, "Did I even put my shoes on?" light. Nike nailed the balance of flexibility and stability, so you can go from lunges to sprints without swapping shoes.
Bottom line: The Free Metcon 6 is a versatile, comfy, do-it-all trainer.

The Reebok Nano has become known as the "Official Shoe of Fitness" and the new X5 does not disappoint in this regard. This shoe does it all: It’s light, breathable, and stable enough to make you feel like a pro, even if you’re just trying to survive leg day. And can we talk about the gusseted tongue? Finally, no more fixing your shoes mid-burpee. Who has time for that?
Senior Fitness Editor Brett Williams tested the shoes for a few weeks before they just released and determined that the latest editions are an improvement on the previous X4s. "I put these through leg days, mobility sessions, and plyometrcis and was impressed by their versatility," says Williams. "You can run in them, but best to stick with short intervals on the treadmill or turf sessions."
Durability? No doubt about it. You can drag your toes, bump into every piece of equipment in the gym, and even take these bad boys on concrete. They’ll hold up better than your buddy’s excuses for skipping cardio. The grip? It’s like the shoe has suction cups—solid on gym floors, mats, or platforms.
At 11.7 oz, they’re light but still stable, and the 7 mm heel-to-toe drop keeps your ankles happy. The Nano X5 is the shoe that gets it done without showing off. A real workhorse in a sea of wannabes.

MOST DURABLE
Nobull Outwork Training Shoes
$129 at NOBULL
Pros
Great for CrossFit and casual wear
Tough one-piece SuperFabric upper
Will perform just as good outdoors as indoors
Handles rope climbs like a champ
Easy to clean
Cons
Shoes take a second to break in
Not the best for breathability
Nobull has generated a cult following in the trainer space thanks to the tough, minimalist-inspired designs. These kicks do exactly what they’re supposed to: Crush CrossFit, hold up during rope climbs, and look good enough to wear when you’re running errands. The upper on these trainers is made with a one-piece SuperFabric that's insanely strong and abrasion resistant. And for the outsole, they have a rubber lug pattern that provides smooth traction and flexibility both indoors and outdoors.
"The wider toebox allows for greater stability. I personally enjoy using them when training Olympic lifts," says Associate Health and Fitness Editor Cori Ritchey, C.S.C.S. That SuperFabric upper? Heck, it’s practically bulletproof. We tried to test its durability by dragging our toes on concrete and deliberately kicking the squat rack. The shoe held up perfectly; however, we did get some strange looks from other gymgoers.
During testing, we found their support and responsive cushioning top-notch, though there's a brief break-in period. These kicks are perfect for high-intensity workouts like CrossFit, offering durability and performance in one package. The seamless, breathable upper and grippy outsole make them versatile for a range of activities, from heavy lifts to plyometrics.
The minimalist design might not suit everyone, but if you're serious about your training, these shoes deliver. They are pricier than other options, but you're investing in durability and "wear it anywhere" vibe. Tough, versatile, and ready for action—the Nobull Outwork Trainers have earned their spot in our
gym bag

Hoka Kawana 2 Training Shoes
$140 at hoka.com
$210 at Amazon
$140 at Nordstrom
Pros
Great for walking, light gym sessions, and easy runs
Breathable upper keeps feet cool during workouts
Gusseted tongue stays in place
Heel loop makes slipping them on simple
Cons
Feels a bit clunky for serious running
Not ideal for wide feet
The Hoka Kawana 2 is like your buddy who shows up for everything—walks, jogs, gym sessions—but draws the line at sprints. This shoe’s got comfort down to a science: Plush cushioning, a breathable upper, and a heel so padded it feels like a luxury pillow for your feet. And let’s talk about the tongue—it’s gusseted now, which means it stays in place like it’s been Velcroed down. No more adjusting mid-jog.
But let’s be honest: If you’re a hardcore runner looking for bounce or speed, these might not be your thing. The EVA midsole is solid, but it’s not exactly putting a spring in your step. And the toebox? It’s narrow. If you’ve got wide feet, you’re going to feel like you’re stuffing a sleeping bag into its case. Traction? Not winning awards there either.
That said, for walks, casual runs, or the gym, the Kawana 2 is a solid go-to. It’s comfy, stable, and durable enough for everyday wear. Plus, with that cushy tongue and easy-on heel loop, slipping these on feels like a treat. It’s not flashy, but it’s dependable—like the shoes version of the gym-desk attendant who always has a spare phone charger.

Pros
Ditches the bulky Hoka design for bettter gym fit
Versatile enough to handle the gym, short runs, and city walks
Breathable upper keeps feet cool during workouts
Wide option accommodates broader feet
Lightweight
Cons
Lacks plush cushioning for long runs
The Hoka Solimar ditches the usual bulky Hoka vibe for a leaner, sleeker look while keeping the performance you expect. Our testers agree that it handles gym workouts, short runs, and casual city strolls with ease. At just 8.2 oz, the Solimar is lightweight yet stable, with a knit upper that keeps your feet cool no matter how intense things get.
The heel padding? It’s like walking on a cloud, and the grip is solid—even on wet pavement. Plus, if the snug fit of the toe box isn’t your thing, these come in a wide version to keep everyone happy. Now, if you’re looking for plush cushioning or shoes for long-distance running, these might not be it. The firm midsole is perfect for versatility but doesn’t deliver the soft ride Hoka fans might expect.
The Solimar is a versatile, stylish cross-trainer that works for shorter runs and light lifting sessions. With a wide option available, it’s got something for everyone—just don’t expect it to feel like your old marshmallow Hokas.

$119 at Rogue Fitness
Pros
Secure traction for agility drills and dynamic movements
Stable enough for heavy squats and deadlifts
Suitable for both gym and casual outings
Excels in lifting, plyometrics, and sprints
Made with sustainable materials
Cons
Not great for long runs
R.A.D shoes? Never heard of them, right? Listen, these aren’t Nike or Reebok. Not even NoBull. It's like the new kid at the gym who shows up out of nowhere and cranks out 225-pounds on the bench press for 10 reps like it’s no biggie. The R.A.D Ones debuted at Wodapalooza—yes, that’s a real name—and these shoes aren’t just here to play; they’re here to do it all.
"I've deadlifted and squatted big weights and performed plyometrics wearing the lightweight kicks. The Swell Foam midsole feels just right," says Senior Fitness Editor Brett Williams, NASM. The 6mm drop feels natural for strong pulls, and the grip? So good you could stop mid-agility drill like a ninja. And let’s talk sustainability: They’re made with sugar cane foam, so not only do they perform, but they also make you feel good about making a better choice for the planet.
Some large-footed testers commented that this model’s toe box is snug. If your feet lean wide or you like your toes to stretch out like they’re at a yoga class, these might not be your jam; however, thinner socks, like
Bombas Men's Running Half Calf Socks
can help you squeeze out a little extra room. These kicks deliver stability for squats, bounce for plyos, and comfort for walking around Costco (without using the cart for support).
At $150, they’re an investment, but if you’re looking for a shoe that handles everything but spotting your bench press, the R.A.D Ones are worth it.

BEST FOR HIIT
On Cloudpulse Training Shoes
$150 at Bloomingdale's
Pros
CloudTec midsole adds extra spring
Keeps your feet cool, even during sprints
Perfect for dynamic movements
Built for cardio and group classes
Plenty of space for your toes to spread
Cons
Wobbles with heavy weights
The On Cloudpulse is On's first shot at a training shoe, and it’s ready to put in the work—at least for the right activities. "On is known best for its runners, but the brand's first pair of training kicks can stand up to most basic workouts," says Senior Fitness Editor Brett Williams, NASM. These kicks are perfect for HIIT and cardio—they’ve got this CloudTec cushioning that feels like tiny trampolines under your feet. And the recycled mesh upper? It keeps things cool even when you’re sweating like crazy in a group class.
At 11.3 oz, the Cloudpulse is lightweight and versatile, making it perfect for group fitness classes or workouts that take you from cardio to strength training. The accommodating toe box ensures natural toe splay for stability during bodyweight and moderate lifts. But for heavy lifting? "You'll be better served reaching for a pair with a lower drop for heavyweight squats or deadlifts," says Williams.
While the grippy outsole and lateral support are impressive, the toebox mesh isn’t built for rough-and-tumble workouts like rope climbs. At $150, they’re great for cardio lovers and HIIT warriors but won’t cut it for serious lifters.

Two insole options for added comfort

Solid for heavy lifts
Cons
Best for 1-2 miles tops, not long runs
Takes a few workouts to break in
The GoRuck Ballistic Trainer isn’t just a shoe; it’s like the overachiever in gym class—built for everything and pretty good at most of it. Made by the same crew that told us to strap on a 50-pound backpack and "enjoy" a long walk, this trainer combines gym-ready versatility with rucking durability.
"These stripped-down trainers aren't fancy, but they're reliable and do the job with a comfortable upper and durable materials," says Senior Fitness Editor Brett Williams, NASM. And he’s right. With an 8mm heel-to-toe drop, these kicks hit the sweet spot: Stable enough for lifting, cushy enough for short sprints, and tough enough to survive your most brutal workout. The CORDURA upper isn’t just durable; it’s practically armor for your feet.
But let’s be honest, if your cardio routine includes half-marathons, these aren’t your shoes. They’re made for explosive moves like box jumps, not long-distance runs. Where they truly excel is under heavy weight. Deadlifts? Squats? They’re ready for the challenge.

Cons

Those who are on the barefoot wave (or are looking to join) will love this pair from Vivobarefoot. These kicks are the epitome of minimalism, perfect for both running and training. Weighing just 232g per shoe, they're incredibly lightweight and versatile.
These will help your feet move in a natural way when training, all while staying incredibly lightweight. We also love the fact they roll up into themselves, making them super easy to pack when traveling.
However, the minimalist design may not suit everyone's preferences, especially if you're used to more cushioned footwear. Additionally, the thinner upper and flatter tread pattern might take some getting used to.

Pros
Built for workouts, short runs, and casual wear
Roomy toe box and solid midsole support
Durable materials for intense workouts
Gym-ready and street-approved
Cons
Stack height isn’t great for big lifts
The Move Trainer, While on Earth's first shoe, looks like a regular lifestyle shoe that is always down for a workout. Founded by 5x CrossFit Games champion
Mat Fraser
, 9x CrossFit Games athlete
Brooke Wells
, and Todd Meleney, a veteran of the sports shoe industry, the Move Trainer was designed for the everyday athlete.
"If I am going to hit a cross training session then meet up with friends after, and I can only bring one pair of shoes, the Move Trainer is my go-to pick," says Fitness and Commerce Editor Charles Thorp, NASM. With its roomy toe box and dense, supportive midsole, it’s ideal for general gym workouts, light runs, and all-day wear. These kicks shine in everyday versatility, whether you're walking the dog or traveling.
That said, they’re not built for super-heavy lifting. The higher stack height and firmer construction might leave powerlifters and minimalist fans wanting more. Still, for a debut effort, While on Earth delivers a trainer that balances form and function beautifully. If you’re after a reliable all-rounder with style, the Move Trainer won’t disappoint.

Under Armour Project Rock BSR 4 Training Shoes

Pros
Perfect amount of cushioning
Stylish athleisure look
Breathable upper
Roomier and more true-to-size than previous versions
Cons
Non-removable insole
A little clunky
If you're into recreational training, HIIT workouts, or just need a solid pair of kicks for day-to-day wear, these UAs have got you covered. They're not tailored to one specific niche, but work well for recreational training, HIIT workouts, and athletic-focused activities.
These shoes boast some tech to keep you going strong, including a molded TPU heel-to-midfoot strap to lock in your heel and UA HOVR cushioning that provides just the right amount of support without feeling pillow-y.
During testing, I particularly like the reworked mesh throughout the toe box. Not only does it make for better breathability, but it's also more durable than previous knit upper versions. The best improvement of all: UA nailed the sizing and shape with this one. They're true to size, and have one of the most comfortable fits of any cross-training shoe I've worn.
However, the plastic TPU tabs on the sides might cause the laces to wear down faster over time (which is more of a durability concern than a performance issue, and not a huge deal). The non-removable insole also means you're missing out on specialized/customized support, though the shoe still holds up well in terms of support and responsiveness

How Often Should I Cross Train?
According to Thieme, you should stray from your dominant training focus at least once (and preferably twice) per week to mix things up and also help you recover. "Not only can the practice enhance your recovery, but it can also help improve a skill in which nearly everyone falls short in one way or another: mobility," says Thieme.

Why Trust Us?
MOST PEOPLE WILL
benefit from
stretching more often
. Whether you're a hardcore exerciser or you're more likely to be found lounging on the couch, instituting a mobility practice can improve
joint range of motion
, decrease muscle tension, and promote tissue recovery.
Spending some dedicated stretching time is especially important if you have a job that keeps you sitting for the majority of your working hours. You're not just inactive in that position—you're putting your muscles in a bad spot.
"A majority of the population spends most of their time seated which leads to shortening of major muscle groups including the pecs, upper traps, and hip flexors," says
Jaron Jin, P.T., D.P.T.,
with
Bespoke Physical Therapy.
"Stretching these muscles can help alleviate tension,
improve mobility
, and decrease muscle tightness."
If you're a beginner stretcher, there are a few solid moves you'll want to master on your journey to better movement. Here, our experts lay out a simple five exercise stretch routine to add to your day.
The 5 Best Stretches for Beginners
Child's Pose
The
classic yoga pose
is best-known for its release of the lower back, but its benefits don't stop there. You'll get a good stretch through the lats, and you'll push your hips, shoulders, and ankles through a greater range of motion.
How to Do It:
Start on all fours. Open your knees a little wider then your torso, and place the tops of your feet on the floor.
Push your hips down and back to sit on your heels, and lower your torso onto the floor. Walk your hands as far away from your body as you can.
Relax your body as deep into the floor as you can. Hold for 30 seconds, then relax for 5 seconds. Do that 2 to 3 times.
Thread the Needle
The thoracic spine, or mid-spine, is prone to getting extremely tight. This stretch will help loosen it up and promote better rotation.
How to Do It:
Start on all fours. Place the tops of your feet on the floor.
Reach one hand up towards the ceiling, and hold it there for a few seconds. Then, reach it under your body, aiming to meet that shoulder to the ground.
Push your opposite hand into the ground to find the stretch through the mid-back.
Hold for 2 to 3 seconds, and alternate to the other side. Do 15 reps per side.
Thoracic Extension
If you catch yourself hunched over a computer often, you'll appreciate this stretch. You'll need a foam roller or a rolled up towel to execute it.
How to Do It:
Place a rolled up towel or
foam roller
just above your low back.
Place your hands behind your head. Exhale slowly as you allow your spine to arch over top of the foam roller, bringing your head back and down towards the ground as far as you can.
Hold here for 2 to 3 seconds, and relax for 5 seconds. Do 15 reps.
Seated Pec Stretch
When your back hunches, your chest shortens up, and often tightens in that position. This pec stretch will open you up. The best part: you don't even need to leave your seat to do it.
How to Do It:
Interlock your fingers behind your head.
Pull the elbows back until you feel the stretch through the chest.
If you struggle to get your fingers behind your head— assume the goalpost position, with the fingers pointed up and the elbow at 90 degrees. It will do the trick.
Hold for about 2 to 3 seconds, and relax for 5 seconds. Aim for 10 reps.
Hip Flexor Stretch
Sitting for long periods leads to tight hip flexors, as the muscles stagnate in a shortened position. This stretch will help alleviate that tension.
How to Do It:
Kneel down on one knee. Prop your other foot in front of you and a little out to the side. Hold your hands on your hips.
Shift your weight slowly forward onto your front leg until you find a stretch through the front portion of your extended hip. Keep your chest lifted.
Hold for 30 seconds, then relax for 5 seconds. Do that 2 to 3 times per side.
How Often Should I Stretch?
If you're looking to improve your mobility outside the gym, you'll want to dedicate a few minutes to stretching each day, multiple times a day. Aim for 10 to 15 minutes (or simply circulate through the series of stretches above) three times a day. An easy way to make sure you hit all three is to do the routine before or after your three main meals.
If you're stretching in conjunction with your workout routine, you'll want to change up your strategy based on when you're stretching. If you're stretching before a workout, consider more dynamic stretches. Do this by holding the stretch for only 2 to 3 seconds before relaxing, aiming for 10-15 reps. "This is a more effective way to improve blood flow and decrease stiffness in muscles prior to exercising," Jin says.
Save the static stretching for after your workout. Hold static stretches for 30 second to a minute.
Why Should I Stretch?
"Stretching has a number of benefits including increasing range of motion, decreasing muscle tension, improving athletic performance, and decreasing soreness after workouts," Jin says. "Even on [rest] days, stretching allows you to still move your body to improve blood flow and promote tissue recovery from the demands of everyday life and additional exercise."
Stretching relieves stiff muscles, which can reduce your risk of injury. When muscles are tense, they can strain or pull easily. Having more give in your muscles provides ease of movement. Routinely stretching your spine and chest can also improve your posture, which is important to ease of breathing and joint health.

SCULPTING A SET
of strong, muscular arms is high among the top priorities guys have at the gym. The big arms ideal is often thought to be a purely aesthetic pursuit—and for some trainees, that might be the case. They might not have anything else on their mind but big gains for their big guns, with plenty of curl-only workouts and mirror flex selfies on their social media profiles.
That's just fine. You're allowed to have purely aesthetic goals for your workouts. But even if you have more functional goals in mind beyond your looks, you'll still be better off if you include arm-focused exercises in your training split. Just like you shouldn't skip leg day, you shouldn't totally ignore focused arm training in a misguided effort to avoid looking vain.
Training your arm muscles isn't super complicated, especially since there's a wealth of movements that are easily accessible for all types of exercisers. You can target your biceps, the crown jewel of the arm muscles, or the triceps, the largest arm muscle on the backside of the limb—or you can really dial down for focused training on the forearms. No matter which group you want to train, keeping good form paramount will be the most sure path to your gains.
These arm exercises will help you to build up all of those muscles. Make sure to take note of all the notes on form and how to implement them into your training, then plug them into your workout to start on your path to big arms.
The Big Arm Building Exercises
Biceps Exercises
Biceps Curl
Why:
The basic, tried-and-true
biceps curl
is the first step to big biceps. You'll start working
elbow flexion
, the basic principle behind biceps movements, and introduce
supination
, which is also important for biceps growth.
How to Do It:
Stand with your feet hip-width apart, holding a pair of dumbbells in a neutral grip (palms facing each other). Squeeze your shoulder blades, abs, and glutes to create full-body tension.
Curl the dumbbell up, moving only at the elbow joint. Keep your upper arms still and perpendicular to the floor.
As you curl up, rotate the dumbbell inward so that your palm faces the sky. The weight should be parallel to the floor by the time you reach the halfway point.
Continue raising the weight up, squeezing the biceps at the top of the movement.
Lower the weight back down with control.
Sets and reps:
3 sets of 10 to 12 reps
Barbell Biceps Curl
Why:
Swapping for a barbell will change your curl more than you might expect. Your hands are in a fixed position on the bar, making supination even more pronounced (if you do the move properly) and you'll be able to load even more weight onto the bar—which will lead to more muscle growth.
How to Do It:
Stand with your feet about shoulder-width apart, holding the bar, using a shoulder-width grip. Squeeze your glutes, abs, and shoulder blades.
Curl the weight up, moving only at the elbows.
Squeeze your biceps at the top for a split second.
Lower the weight back down to the starting position.
Sets and reps:
3 sets of 8 to 10 reps
Spider Curl
Why:
The
spider curl
eliminates all momentum to really target your biceps, thanks to the chest-supported position on the bench.
How to Do It:
Start with your chest on an adjustable bench with a 45-degree angle holding a pair of dumbbells. Squeeze your shoulder blades, abs, and glutes, and keep your upper arm angle perpendicular to the ground.
Curl up with one arm, rotating your pinky up.
Squeeze your biceps at the top with a forward rotation to keep your shoulder protected.
Return to the starting position.
Sets and reps:
3 sets of 10 to 12 reps per side
Dumbbell Preacher Curl
Why:
Dumbbell preacher curls
are useful for changing the upper arm angle on your biceps curls, giving the muscles a different type of pump. The EZ bar and specialized bench or machine setup might be more common in big box gyms, but you can do preacher curls anywhere with dumbbells and an adjustable bench.
How to Do It:
Set up from behind the bench, laying the back of your arm against its inclined surface and "hugging" your armpit to the top. Squat down and engage your glutes, hamstrings, and abs.
Curl the weight up, making sure to keep your upper arm glued to the bench and keeping the wrist in a neutral position. Keep the range of motion away from resting at the bottom or top of the movement so the weight is in a position of constant tension.
Lower back down to the starting position.
Sets and reps:
3 sets of 8 to 12 reps
Concentration Curl
Why:
Concentration curls
are a classic biceps builder—and unsurprisingly, most people go about them the wrong way. The most common mistake trainees make with concentration curls is sitting with poor posture. The point is to isolate your biceps muscle, which is difficult if you're moving your torso and digging your elbow into your thigh.
How to Do It:
Sit on a bench, with a dumbbell between your legs.
Grab the dumbbell with one hand, then place your upper arm (your triceps muscle) against your thigh. Your goal should be to keep your arm perpendicular to the ground throughout the whole movement.
Tighten your core and engage your shoulder blades to create tension and reinforce posture.
Make a fist with your off-hand and extend your non-working arm out to the side. This allows you to use your core to balance and remove any leverage that would take away from biceps engagement.
Curl the weight up with control, keeping the wrist in a neutral position. Emphasize the squeeze at the top of the rep; avoid any backwards lean or shoulder movement, keeping the focus on the biceps.
Return back to the starting position, controlling the weight.
Sets and reps:
3 sets of 8 to 12 reps per side
Tall-Kneeling Curl
3 sets of 8 to 12 reps
One of the most useful things about arm training is that you can shift your position to shift up the challenge. By performing
dumbbell biceps curls from a tall-kneeling position
, you won't just eliminate the inclination to "cheat" the curl using body English—you'll get a core workout, too.
How to Do It:
Kneel on the floor with arms at your sides holding a pair of dumbbells. Tuck your pelvis under slightly so it’s parallel to the floor and brace your abs and glutes. Draw your shoulder blades back and downward (think: “proud chest”).
Keeping your upper arms at your sides, begin curling the dumbbells up moving only at the elbow. As you raise the weights, twist your wrists outward so that your palms face the ceiling at the halfway point. Squeeze your biceps at the top of the movement.
Lower back down to the starting position.
Sets and reps:
3 sets of 8 to 12 reps
Hammer Curl
Why:
Shift the traditional biceps curl to holding the weights with a neutral grip for
the hammer curl
. By making that small change, you'll target a different muscle just beneath the biceps—
the brachialis
—that will really make your arms pop.
How to Do It:
Stand with your feet hip-width apart, holding a pair of dumbbells in a neutral grip (palms facing each other). Squeeze your shoulder blades, abs, and glutes to create full-body tension.
Curl the dumbbell up, moving only at the elbow joint. Keep your upper arms still and perpendicular to the floor. Squeeze your biceps at the top of the movement.
Avoid shifting your elbow forward to keep your shoulders out of the movement.
Lower the weight back down to the starting position under control.
Sets and reps:
3 sets of 8 to 12 reps
Incline Dumbbell Curl
Why:
Add a bench to your curl session to emphasize the peaks of your biceps. The
dumbbell incline curl
allows you to get into a new position, allowing you to stretch the muscle even more.
How to Do It:
Set an incline bench to around a 60 degree angle, and sit back holding a pair of dumbbells. Allow your arms to hang down (but be careful that your shoulders aren't overstretched), with your elbows behind your torso.
Curl the weight up moving only at the elbow and squeeze your biceps at the top of the movement.
Control the weight down, coming to a complete stop before starting the next rep.
Sets and reps:
3 sets of 8 to 12 reps
Cable Biceps Curl
Why:
Biceps curls using free weights are great, but you're more than likely missing out on the top end of the move's your range of motion. Using a cable allows you to keep tension on the muscle in the lengthened position too—which will spur muscle growth.
How to Do It:
Grab the handle with one hand and take a step and a half away from the machine (or as far as you need to feel tension on the muscle).
Squeeze the abs and glutes for a solid base.
Create a slight angle with the elbow to where the cable feels like it's pulling you back.
Ensure that your hips and shoulders are facing square in front—don't allow the tension from the cable to twist your torso backwards.
Moving only at the elbow, curl your hand towards your shoulder.
As you lower back down, make sure the cable doesn't pull your shoulder from its position. Think about keeping the upper arm in line with your torso.
Sets and reps:
3 to 4 sets of 12 to 15 reps
Crucifix Curl
Why:
The
crucifix curl
gives you a chance to change up your angle and isolate your biceps muscle, while also challenging your shoulder stability and core strength. You'll need a cable tower or a resistance band to do it.
How to Do It:
Start in a tall-kneeling position, with the cable/resistance band anchor set up at a height so that your elbow is slightly lower than your shoulder in the starting position. Squeeze your shoulder blades, abs, and glutes, holding the handle.
Curl the weight toward your shoulder, moving only at the elbow. Keep your elbow in the same position without shifting forward. Squeeze your biceps, holding for a beat.
Return back to starting position, controlling the weight.
Sets and reps:
3 sets of 8 to 12 reps
Chinup
Why:
While
the chinup
might be chiefly known as a back-builder, you can sculpt massive arms using the bodyweight exercise, too. Using the
supinated (underhand) grip
shifts more of the onus onto the biceps. To make the move even more arm-centric, try to extend the time under tension by slowly emphasizing the
eccentric (descending) portion
of the exercise.
How to Do It:
Get into a good hanging position holding the bar with a supinated (underhand) grip, squeezing your shoulders, abs, and glutes to maintain tension.
Drive your elbows into your hips to pull yourself up to the bar. Continue until your head is above the bar, pausing briefly at the top.
Lower back down until your elbows are extended, maintaining control of the position and keeping tension.
Sets and reps:
3 sets of 8 to 12 reps
Strict Curl
Why:
This movement forces you to move the right way when you curl, removing any ability to cheat by using lower body power or momentum. Your position against the wall will make sure you keep your form strong.
How to Do It:
Grab a pair of dumbbells and stand against a wall, with your feet shoulder-width apart. Lean into the wall, maintaining three points of contact: squeezing the shoulder blades, driving the shoulders into the wall, and putting your butt on the wall.
Squeeze your abs and glutes to create full-body tension. The back of your arms should be pressed against the wall.
Moving only at the elbows, curl the weight up as high as you can. Pause and squeeze your biceps at the top.
Lower the weight back down with control.
Sets and reps:
3 sets of 8 to 10 reps
Cheat Curl
Why:
Throw out the best practices you've instilled for your biceps curl form—this exercise encourages you to break from convention to lift as much weight as possible, which can yield more muscle growth. The key: emphasizing the eccentric (lowering) portion of the exercise. This is subtle, so leave this move to more advanced workouts.
How to Do It:
Set up by grabbing onto your barbell. Have your hands about shoulder-width apart on the bar.
Hinge softly at the hips, and use the glutes to explode forward and help power the bar to your chest.
Once in this position, stiffen the body. Engage the glutes, shoulder blades and core.
Lower slowly back down, keeping the elbows tucked into your sides and your wrists straight. Focus on going slow here to get the most out of your eccentric contraction— lower for at least 4 seconds.
Sets and reps:
3 sets of 4 to 6 reps
Resistance Band Preacher Curl
Why:
You've used all types of tools for resistance to build up your arms. Now, you can add
a resistance band
to that list for a truly diverse arm pump. You'll shift your arms away from your torso, which is great to get you out of your comfort zone.
How to Do It:
Start seated on the ground, legs straight, core tight. Loop the resistance band around your feet. Grab a handle with each hand and curl up, raising your upper arms so elbows are slightly below shoulders. Don't let your elbows shift up and down as you do this.
Squeeze one biceps hard, while performing a curl rep on the other side. Repeat on the other side.
Sets and reps:
3 sets of 10 to 12 reps
Lying Biceps Cable Curl
Why:
Shift your perspective (and your normal positioning) to attack the biceps from a new angle with this
lying biceps cable curl
. Once you're lying on the bench under the cable, the goal is to squeeze your biceps and keep your upper arms perpendicular to the ground without allowing your elbows to shift backwards.
How to Do It:
Lie down on a flat bench parallel with the floor (or on the floor). Drive your shoulder blades into the bench and squeeze your abs and glutes.
Grab the cable attachment with both hands. Keep your upper arms perpendicular to the ground to maintain tension.
Curl the bar to your forehead, moving only at the elbows. Squeeze your biceps at the top of the movement.
Return to the starting position.
Sets and reps:
3 sets of 8 to 12 reps
Triceps Exercises
Skull Crusher
Why:
The
skull crusher
will help pack muscle to your triceps. The key here is to keep the movement only at the elbow joints, moving deliberately through the eccentric portion of the movement and then focusing on elbow extension.
How to Do It:
Start by lying back on the bench. Don't arch your back—drive your shoulder blades into the bench, squeeze your abs and glutes, and keep your feet flat on the floor.
Press the weight straight up above your chest. Your upper arm should be just past 90 degrees, at a 91 or 92 degree angle. Keep your wrists strong and a tight grip on the bar.
Lower the weight slowly down to an inch above your forehead, moving only at the elbows. Don't allow your shoulders to shift forward; keep your upper arm still.
Drive the weight back up (again moving only at the elbows), squeezing your triceps at the top.
Sets and reps:
4 sets of 8 to 12 reps
Cable Skull Crusher
Why:
Changing up the implement will allow you to emphasize the peak triceps contraction at the top end of the movement. You'll get a better triceps pump this way, leading to more muscle growth.
How to Do It:
Bring the attachment point of the cable machine down to its lowest setting and clip on a rope attachment. Set up a bench so that the top of it is close to the cable machine and adjust to a 15 degree angle.
Lie down on the bench, but extend your legs so you're situated higher up. This will allow you to pull your wrists down and back without hitting the head of the bench. Drive your feet into the ground and contract your glutes and abs, creating full body tension.
Grab onto the rope closer to the base.
Keeping your palms facing each other, bend the elbow down and back to find that stretch through the triceps. Lower your wrists as close as you can to your shoulders based on your mobility.
Squeeze up until your elbow is fully extended, keeping it stacked on top of your shoulder. Don't allow them to flare outward.
Squeeze for one to two seconds before lowering back down.
Sets and reps:
3 sets of 10 to 12 reps
Close-Grip Pushup
Why:
The
close-grip pushup
targets your triceps more than the standard variation of the pushup while also being a much safer option than a diamond pushup, which can allow for potentially dangerous internal rotation at the shoulder. You'll get a great bodyweight triceps pump this way.
How to Do It:
Start in a high plank position as you would for a standard pushup, with your palms flat on the floor at about shoulder-width and your weight resting on your toes. Squeeze your shoulder blades, abs, and glutes to create tension, and keep your gaze on the floor to keep your neck neutral.
Shift your hands in closer together, just narrower than shoulder-width. Turn the pits of your elbows forward to activate your lats.
Lower your chest to the floor, keeping your elbows from flaring out from your torso. Aim to form an L shape with your arms at the bottom position.
Press up off the floor and totally extend your arms at the top of the rep.
Sets and reps:
3 sets of 10 to 12 reps
Triceps Rope Pressdown
3 to 4 sets of 10 to 12 reps
Why:
The
triceps pressdown
is a muscle-building staple that remains a go-to for guys with access to cable machines (you can also use resistance bands tethered to a high anchor point).
MH
fitness director Ebenezer Samuel, C.S.C.S. has a quick hack to avoid cheating your posture: just add an incline bench.
How to Do It:
Lie with your back on a bench set to a 45-degree incline, abs and glutes tight. Your shoulder blades should be off the bench.
Grasp either a handle or rope in your hands. Keep your elbows tight to your torso.
Bending only at the elbows, straighten the rope or handle. Pause and squeeze your triceps.
Return to the start.
Sets and reps:
3 to 4 sets of 10 to 12 reps
Lying Dumbbell Triceps Extension
Why:
The dumbbell extension is a classic triceps move—but the way most guys do it, with the weight overhead, is often ineffective and performed in a way that puts the shoulders at risk. Lie down on a bench to give the long head of the triceps even more attention.
How to Do It:
Grab a dumbbell, wrapping your thumbs around each other touching one side of the bell. Lie back on a bench, placing your head near the end of the bench. Squeeze your glutes and abs, focusing on driving your feet into the ground.
Reach back as far as you can with the dumbbell. Then lower the dumbbell behind your head, driving your elbows toward the ceiling. Avoid flaring your elbows—keep your arms tight and close to your torso. Work to get a deep stretch at the bottom—the goal is to get your forearms perpendicular to the ground.
Straighten your elbows to drive the weight up, moving your elbows forward into shoulder extension.
Sets and reps:
3 to 4 sets of 10 to 15 reps
Dumbbell Triceps Kickback
Why:
The dumbbell triceps kickback is a go-to muscle-builder—but you have to be intentional in your movements. One big key to getting the most out of the exercise is working with lighter weights.
How to Do It:
Set an adjustable bench so that you can prop yourself into position with one arm against it, hinging at the waist. Squeeze your glutes and core to create tension, looking down at the floor. Pick up the dumbbell off the floor, then row the row up until your upper arm is parallel with the ground.
Extend your elbow to kick back, moving only at the joint. Hold the weight still for a count and squeeze your triceps at the top of the position with your arm straight.
Close your elbow to come back to the starting position, keeping your upper arm in that parallel position.
Sets and reps:
3 sets of 10 to 12 reps
Cable Triceps Kickback
Why:
The cable resistance solves some of the major issues with the dumbbell version of the kickback, extending the range of motion and allowing you to emphasize the squeeze at the top of the movement with the muscle in the shortened position.
How to Do It:
Start by taking a staggered stance, bracing yourself on the machine of by placing your elbow on your thigh. Whichever you choose, ensure that your shoulders stay higher then your hips to protect the lower back.
Grab onto the cable handle, and pull your elbow up and back slightly above your torso. Keep your upper arm to be parallel to the ground for the duration of the set.
Straighten out the elbow without rocking or moving the upper arm. Squeeze your triceps at the top.
Slowly lower the weight down, preferably for a two count negative, to complete the rep.
Sets and reps:
3 to 4 sets of 12 to 15 reps
JM Press
Why:
The
JM press
combines one killer triceps move, the skull crusher, with another, the close-grip press. The result is a muscle and strength building hybrid you'll want to have in your workout.
How to Do It:
Start by lying back on the bench. Drive your shoulder blades into the bench, squeeze your abs and glutes, and keep your feet flat on the floor. Press the weight straight up above your chest with your upper arms at a 92 degree angle.
Drive your elbows to your ribs and the weight toward your shoulders. Keep your elbows tight to your torso.
Press the weight back up to the starting position.
Sets and reps:
3 to 4 sets of 8 to 12 reps
Bench Dips
3 sets of 10 to 12 reps
Why:
If you're looking for bodyweight exercises,
bench dips
give you a solid option to train your triceps. This might not be best option for you if you have a history of shoulder issues, however, so be cautious if you want to add this to your workout.
How to Do It:
Sit on the edge of a bench, with your arms extended and your hands on the bench facing out away from yourself. Keep your feet flat on the floor with your knees bent to start.
Push up off the bench, which will help you to drive your shoulder blades down and create scapular depression. Squeeze your shoulder blades to create tension.
Lower down with control to a depth that feels comfortable, keeping tension in your mid-back. Your elbows should never exceed your shoulder height.
Extend your elbows and squeeze your triceps hard to raise back up.
Sets and reps:
3 sets of 8 to 1o reps
Bodyweight Triceps Extension
Why:
This
bodyweight triceps extension
exercise is a little more gentle than the version that uses an external load, but you'll still reap the mass-building benefits. Make sure to move within a comfortable range of motion when you do this to prevent potential injury.
How to Do It:
Set up by grabbing the bar with both hands in an overhand grip. Extend your arms so that your elbows are locked, and maintain a tight standing plank position, keeping your glutes and abs squeezed.
Bend your elbows and bring your torso forward so your head dips under the bar. Go only as far as you can comfortably, keeping your feet planted on the ground.
Straighten your arms, keeping your elbows in line with each other as you squeeze your triceps.
Sets and reps:
3 sets to failure
Forearm Exercises
Farmer's Carry
Why:
Training doesn't get simpler than this. The
farmer's carry
boils down to carrying a heavy load while walking—and that builds muscle in the back, forearms and core more than you'd expect.
How to Do It:
Start holding a pair of heavy dumbbells at your sides. Squeeze your shoulder blades, abs, and glutes while gripping your weights aggressively. Roll your shoulders back to turn on your lower lats and rhomboids. Keep your neck in a neutral position, gazing at a spot just ahead of you on the floor.
Walk straight ahead, keeping your posture intact by maintaining tension. Keep gripping the handles tight to emphasize your forearms.
Sets and reps:
4 sets of 40 second carries
Towel Hammer Curl
Why:
The
towel hammer curl
works your brachialis muscle, just like the dumbbell version—but adding the towel gives you an extra grip challenge, which helps to blow up your forearms.
How to Do It:
Wrap your towel around the handle of a kettlebell, then grip either end of the fabric as tightly as you can.
Curl the weight up, making sure to keep your core engaged and movements fluid to accommodate the hanging weight. Squeeze your biceps at the top.
Lower the weight back down to the start under control.
Sets and reps:
3 sets of 8 to 10 reps
Zottman Curl
Why:
The
Zottman curl
is another biceps move that gets your forearms involved—but this exercise completely shifts the focus halfway through. This isn't a big weight movement, so make sure to focus on form and control even more than with your other curls.
How to Do It:
Start holding the dumbbells in your hands with the weights at your sides, just like a standard curl.
Move only at the elbow to curl the weight up, pausing at the top to squeeze your biceps.
Twist your wrists so that your palms face forward.
Lower down slowly, controlling the weight through the eccentric portion of the lift.
Sets and reps:
3 sets of 8 to 10 reps
Reverse Curl
Why:
Flip your grip on the standard curl to increase the challenge on your forearm muscles, like your brachioradialis, to support the weight.
How to Do It:
Stand with your feet about shoulder width apart holding the weights with your hands in a pronated (overhand) position. Squeeze your glutes, abs, and shoulder blades to create tension.
Lift the weight up, moving only at the elbows. Avoid the inclination to shift your arms forward, keeping your arms "pinned" to your torso.
Pause briefly at the top of the movement. Lower back down to the start, controlling the weight and keeping tension in your forearms.
Sets and reps:
3 sets of 8 to 12 reps
Long Lever Forearm Rotation
Why:
Simplicity is the key for
this versatile long lever drill
, which uses rotational movement to challenge your grip strength. Use anything from a light bar to a broomstick, grip it tightly for some extra benefits, and rotate and twist your wrists around. Move slowly, and keep the weight in control.
How to Do It:
Grip a bar in your hand. Hold it tight.
Twist the bar back and forth, left to right, over and over.
Sets and reps:
3 sets of 40 seconds per arm
The Benefits of Training Your Arm Muscles
So why exactly should you give your arms any attention outside of their role in big compound movements that build strength? While arm muscle development might seem like a vain pursuit that doesn't yield the same performance and real-world benefits as some of these other muscle groups, that's not quite the case. Your arms are integral for so many movements, even exercises that most people consider to be focused on other muscle groups.
Indeed, you can't deadlift or squat without using your hands and arms to grip the bar and keep it in the right position. Even if you have the strongest posterior chain in the world, you'll have a tough time pulling heavy weight off the floor if you're unable to grip and hold onto the barbell.

There's more to training your arms than just ego and looks. Your arm muscles—namely the biceps, triceps, and forearms—are essential for so many daily movements, from gym staples like pushing, pulling, and pressing to everyday tasks like hauling your groceries or picking your kids up to carry them. You'll have a better quality of life with strong, healthy arms.

Why Trust Us?
This story is part of our ongoing “First Steps” series, where we share extraordinary stories of men who transformed their bodies, minds, and lives with a focus on the first steps it took them to get there (because, after all, nothing can change without a first step!). Read all of the stories
here
.
Frank McSorley, 63, of Buckeye, Arizona, started gaining weight shortly after retiring from the Air Force. That is, until a single uncomfortable moment convinced him he had to take action. Below, he describes the simple step that kicked off his fitness journey—and all the places it's taken him since.
IN 1999, I
retired after a 20 year career in the Air Force. After entering civilian life, the pounds started piling up. I was never an active person, but because of Air Force weight limits, I had always kept my weight in check. Once I was out, my weight got out of control. Sitting behind a desk all day, with no restrictions on my eating, I was constantly outgrowing my clothes. Within 6 years, I had put on close to 90 pounds.
My cholesterol eventually grew to very unhealthy levels, and I was put on cholesterol medication. I had constant fatigue and shortness of breath. It left me feeling drained and unhappy.
In 2006, I was 45 years old and wasn’t feeling very good about myself. At 6’ 4”, I could physically hide a lot of weight–but I couldn’t hide it from myself. The moment that convinced me to take action and reclaim my health was very simple: I was sitting on the couch and I leaned forward to tie my shoes and realized I couldn’t breathe. My gut was cutting off my breath. My weight had topped out at 297 pounds. It was time to make a change.
“I decided to start something
SIMPLE
: a walk around
THE BLOCK.
It wasn’t much, but I was
DETERMINED.
”
In the summer of 2006, I decided to start something simple: a
walk
around the block. It wasn’t much, but I was determined to stick with it. I very slowly started adding more distance and speed. Eventually over a long period of time, I was walking anywhere from 4-8 miles pretty much every day. I would use my lunch hour at work to squeeze in a few more miles.
I also joined
WeightWatchers
. The thing I love about the program is that nothing is off limits. You get points every week and you decide how you want to use them. I refuse to eat anything just because it’s “diet-friendly”—it has to be something I really like. I’ve found healthier substitutes for just about everything I like to eat. I don’t consider WeightWatchers a diet, because diets end. This was a lifestyle change I could live with.
After 3 years of walking and adopting healthy eating habits with WeightWatchers, I had lost close to 100 pounds, and I was feeling much better. I thought I’d try
running
. I used the same slow and steady process I took with walking.
Courtesy McSorley
Frank McSorley at the 2024 Susan G. Komen 3-Day.
The first time out, I walked for one block and ran another. Once again, I started slowly adding speed and distance. In 2010, I did my first 5K race, the local St. Patrick’s Day race. I eventually tried a 10K and then a half Marathon in 2011. I remember finishing the half and saying to myself: “I can’t even imagine running a full marathon!”
The next year I signed up for the Smuttynose Marathon in Hampton, NH. I took the training seriously and hit every goal in the 16 week program. In September of that year, I finished my first marathon! When I moved to Arizona in 2017, I moved from road running to trail running. A local running company offered a 12 hour race where you run as many miles as you can. The first time I attempted it, I quit after 9 hours with 33 miles done. The following year I did the whole 12 hours, finishing with 44 miles.
Today, I’m walking, running or biking pretty much every day. I also started playing pickleball several times a week. During COVID, I started weight training and have kept up with a schedule of 3 times a week. Since moving to Arizona, I’ve fallen in love with hiking and am always looking for new hikes to take. A couple of years ago, I checked off a big bucket list item by hiking to the bottom and back up the Grand Canyon. One of my favorite activities is the Susan G. Komen 3-Day, which is a 60 mile walk. I did my first one in 2010, and just did my 24th and 25th this year in Boston and San Diego. My goal in 2025 is to do a 100K race in the Arizona desert.
I can honestly say at 63 years old, I’m much healthier and in better shape than I was at 25. My motto from day one has been: “patience, persistence, but never, ever perfection!” Get out there and find something you like to do. Take it slow and give it time to become a habit! Change it up every once in a while. The bottom line is go out there and do something your future self will be proud of. Don’t worry about the time it will take. Time will pass anyway. Use it to improve your future. You’re worth it.
Three Things That Have Made My Transformation a Success
Tip 1:
Take Baby Steps
I was never in a hurry to lose weight or improve my fitness. I was always happy knowing I was heading in the right direction! It truly amazes me how far I’ve come with tiny increases over many years.
Tip 2:
Don’t be Afraid to Try New Things
I am doing things at 63 years old I could never imagine myself doing when I was 45. My WeightWatchers coach told me at my very first meeting, “The smaller you get, the bigger your world will get.” How incredibly true that is!
Tip 3:
Find a Support Group
I have been part of several running clubs since starting my journey. I’m always amazed at the level of support and motivation the members give each other without being competitive!

SO, YOU WANT
to get strong and build muscle, but you don’t have a ton of time to dedicate to the gym. You can try the 5/3/1 training split, a workout plan that helps to streamline your lift without cutting corners.
As the name implies, lifters wave through sets of five, three, and one rep over the course of the split. It has been helping lifters build strength in some of the heaviest movements in the gym—the squat, deadlift, bench press, and overhead press—for years. The program incorporates lifting heavy weights for a low number of reps.
One of the main benefits, says
Shawn Arent, Ph.D., C.S.C.S.
, chair of the Department of Exercise Science at the University of South Carolina, isn’t just that the program uses heavy weights, but schedules the increase of those weights to help drive progress.
Want to get stronger on a schedule? Start here: Here’s the lowdown on 5/3/1 and how to use it.
What Is the 5/3/1 Program?
The 5/3/1 program focuses on building strength by focusing on four core lifts:
Bench Press
Squat
Overhead Press
Deadlift
Each workout features one or two of these lifts (depending on how many days per week you’re training), and the rep schemes change each week. In Week 1, you’ll perform sets of five reps of these big lifts. In Week 2, you’ll perform sets of three. And in Week 3, you’ll perform sets of five, three, and one rep of each move. After a deload week lifting lighter weights to recover, the process is repeated—hopefully with more weight on the bar for each move.
The program was devised by Jim Wendler, a strength coach, former
football player at the University of Arizona
, and powerlifter. According to
Open Powerlifting
, Wendler’s powerlifting exploits included a 1,000-pound squat, a 675-pound bench press, and a 700-pound deadlift.
Wendler says
he created the 5/3/1 program in the early 2000s to bring back strength principles “that have been lost among the academics and pencil necks.”
How to Use the 5/3/1 Program
Calculate 90 Percent of Your One-Rep Max
First, you’ll need to know your
one-rep maximum (1RM)
for each of the four exercises listed above. Your one-rep max is the amount of weight you could do on a lift for only one repetition—essentially, the heaviest amount you can handle.
If you don’t know your one-rep max, and don’t want to spend a workout maxing out on all these lifts, you can get a rough estimate for each move using a few methods. One is by using the amount you know you can lift for five reps. Write those weights down, and plug into these two calculations from
a study published in the Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research
:
• For lower body exercises: Multiply your 5-rep weight (in kg) by 1.0970. Then add 14.2546.
• For upper body exercises: Multiply your 5-rep weight (in kg) by 1.1307. Then add 0.6999.
These will be your estimated one-rep max for each lift in kilograms. To get your final numbers, do a little more math: Multiply each number by 2.2 to convert it from kilograms to pounds. Then multiply that number by 0.9.
That’s 90 percent of your one-rep max for each move. You’ll use percentages of that number to determine how much you’ll lift in each workout.
Perform Four Weekly Workouts in a Four-Week Cycle
Each of your four weekly workouts will star one of the four big barbell exercises: Bench press, squat, overhead press, and deadlift. After warming up, you’ll do just three sets of each move, resting three to five minutes between sets.
During the four-week cycle, you’ll do four bench press workouts, four squat workouts, four deadlift workouts, and four overhead press workouts. Each of these workouts changes over the course of each four-week cycle: You’ll lift different percentages of the number you calculated above—90 percent of your 1RM—for different numbers of reps after warming up.
Week 1: 5 reps at 65%, 5 reps at 75%, and 5 reps at 85%
Week 2: 3 reps at 70%, 3 reps at 80%, and 3 reps at 90%
Week 3: 5 reps at 75%, 3 reps at 85%, and 1 rep at 95%
Week 4: 5 reps at 40%, 5 reps at 50%, and 5 reps at 60%
The fourth week is a deload week, which lets your body recover after three hard weeks of training so you can hit the new “Week 1” at full force.
Add Weight Every Four Weeks—If You’ve Mastered the Current Loads
After each four-week cycle, the plan of 5/3/1 is to progress, adding five pounds to your one-rep max calculations for the upper body, and 10 pounds to the one-rep max math on the lower body exercises. If you’re not feeling strong in one lift or another, though, and you’re struggling to get the current weight you're working with up with clean form, don’t progress until the next cycle.
Add Assistance Work to Each Workout
After the main lifts, 5/3/1 suggests adding a few other exercises of your choosing. This section, Los Angeles-based strength coach
Juan Guadarrama, C.S.C.S.
says, is one of the reasons 5/3/1 is the basis of the training for many of his athletes: The 5/3/1 protocol lets them build the strength they need to perform, while the assistance (also referred to as accessory) section lets them do some exercises that build muscle size and that they enjoy.
Science has shown that low-rep, high-weight work—like in 5/3/1—builds the most strength, he says. But higher-rep work allows trainees to add muscle volume. By adding three or four assistance exercises after the main lift in slightly longer sets—eight to 12 reps, for example—the workout can provide both benefits.
This section also helps his clients with another thing they want: Variety. One reason some lifters may not stick to 5/3/1 is that there isn’t much variance to the workout. Guadarrama says it’s still worth sticking to, however. Changing assistance exercises periodically can scratch the itch for variety while keeping you progressing in the main lifts.
For beginners, Wendler suggests choosing a pushing move, a pulling move, and a single-leg or core move, and doing 50 to 100 total reps across as many sets as you like.
Benefits of the 5/3/1 Program
There’s a reason this program has helped so many lifters get strong, Arent says: It gets them used to lifting heavy weights regularly. Here are three other reasons 5/3/1 might be the right choice for your gains.
5/3/1 Can Save Time
One of the major appeals of 5/3/1, Arent says, is that it lets you build strength with short sessions.
“You’re focusing on the main, core stuff. So it’s fairly short, and doesn’t have a lot of exercises,” he says. Even if you’re doing two of the main lifts on one day, that’s only six sets, plus a few assistance exercises. If you’re crunched for time and want to lift big weights, this is a big advantage, he says.
Because the program isn’t every day and the workouts are short, you can also add an element to your routine the program lacks on the off days: Cardio and conditioning sessions.
You Train Heavy, But Not to Failure
Training all the way to failure
can help you get strong, but it can also make you sore and put you at risk for injury. But since the 5/3/1 program only has you lift just shy of 90 percent of your one-rep max—and less in the 3- and 5-rep sets—you get close to failure, but shouldn’t quite reach it.
“That’s a good lesson for training for strength in this or other programming,” Arent says. “Not every set has to be, or should be, to failure.”
Progression is Planned
After each four-week cycle, 5/3/1 doesn’t just tell you to progress—it tells you
how much
to progress.
“It takes the guesswork out of programming,” Guadarrama says. “Instead of wasting time figuring out what to do, it gives you a roadmap of what you’re going to do for an extended period of time. And you’re going to gain strength without having to think about it.”
This, Arent says, is another lesson for lifters who aren’t using 5/3/1, too: Don’t just have a program. Have a plan for how it progresses over time too, so you keep getting better without making mistakes.
All You Need Is a Barbell, a Bench, and a Rack
You don’t have to bounce all over the gym to do this program. You mostly need a barbell (with some exceptions), a power rack, and a bench. Since you get to choose your own assistance exercises, these can also be done without adding a ton of equipment to the equation. This makes 5/3/1 doable for guys in crowded gyms, or perfect for if you set up a minimalist home gym for strength.
How to Do the 4 Core Lifts of the 5-3-1 Program
Before starting the 5-3-1 program, you’ll need to master its four pinnacle movements: the deadlift, the squat, the overhead press, and bench press. You can technically do these moves with a barbell, dumbbells, or kettlebells, but if you want to load for maximal gains, you'll likely want to reach for the barbell (other than the overhead press,
which we think is overrated
).
Deadlift
How to Do It:
Start with your feet about hip-width apart. Push your butt back and hinge at the waist to bend down to grab the bar, dumbbells, kettlebells, or whatever equipment you are using..
Make sure your hips are lower than your shoulders. Squeeze your shoulder blades together to set your lats, then engage your core. Keep your neck in a neutral position; don't look up.
Push your feet through the floor and pull the weight up, keeping the weight close to your body. Squeeze your glutes at the top of the list, but don't lean back.
Back Squat
How to Do It:
Start by setting up your equipment. You can use dumbbells or kettlebells in a
suitcase
or
goblet hold
position, a barbell racked either on your
back
or
front
.
Move the feet so they’re a little wider than shoulder width, with the toes pointed slightly outward.
Start by pushing the butt back and tilting the torso forward just slightly before you start bending the knees. Take a deep inhale right before you lower. Take your time lowering down—about 2 seconds.
Open the knees as you lower down. Lower only to the level where you’re able to keep your lower back straight.
As you push up, raise the torso and hips at the same time. Keep the knees pushed out.
Bench Press
How to Do It:
Lie down on the bench. Squeeze your abs and glutes and drive your feet into the floor. Arch your back slightly.
Raise the barbell so its directly overtop of your chest.
Lower the weight down to the starting position under control. Lower until your elbows are below your shoulders.
Drive your shoulders into the back pad of the bench, then press the weight straight up. Keep your arms perpendicular to the ground to keep the proper arm angle.
Overhead Press
How to Do It:
Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, holding a pair of dumbbells. Squeeze your shoulder blades, abs, and glutes to create full-body tension.
Lift the weights to shoulder height. Shift your elbows slightly forward to create an angle relative to your torso (this is the scapular plane). Make sure your forearms are straight, perpendicular to the ground.
Press the weight straight up overhead, emphasizing the core tension to prevent your ribs from flaring. Don't knock the dumbbells together at the top; keep the path the weights travel straight up and down.
Lower the weight back down to your shoulders.

Reporting Guidelines
Men's Health
asks all editors and writers to follow strict reporting protocols to ensure the accuracy of all information reported in the magazine and on site. Studies must be reviewed before being cited in stories, and all factual information must be attributed to a reliable source. Editors rely on interviews with expert sources to substantiate all articles, and each story is reviewed and fact-checked by at least two editors before being published. Articles are then regularly reviewed and updated to include the newest information available on the topic.
.
Generative AI Policy
While we are big believers in technology that helps us innovate and makes our work better, all editorial content produced by
Men's Health
is human-generated by the editors shown above. We never use AI to report or write or fact-check, although it may be used for research purposes. We’ll continue to monitor the development and uses of these tools across the industry.
.
Editorial Independence
Men's Health
receives support from advertisers. However, all content is produced independently. Any content produced in conjunction with an advertiser, or paid for by an advertiser, is clearly marked as such on the site.
.
Affiliate Links
Men's Health
participates in affiliate marketing programs—meaning that purchases made by readers who visit our site and then go to retailers and products recommended by our editors may result in paid commissions. The products we feature are always chosen by editors based on brand standards.

Men's Health
Incorporating the content from
Men's Health
is an ideal marketing tool that can be positioned in many ways to show your company's greatest assets. When you harness the power of reprints, you are able to customize the appearance and presentation of the editorial content and market toward your targeted audience.
E-prints
Electronic reprints, better known as E-prints, are the electronic version of your editorial content. These E-prints can be customized, just like the hard copy article reprints, but are purchased for a specific period of time for your website. E-prints can also be used as a marketing piece and emailed to your prospects and clients or to anyone within your company.
Custom Reprints
The greatest benefit of reprints is the ability to customize and present editorial content as a powerful and professional marketing piece. Whether you are using them for your next direct mail campaign or handing them out at an upcoming industry trade show, reprints can enhance your marketing efforts particularly when you tailor them to your specifications.
Awards
Showcase your awardswith a fashionable wooden plaque. This popular and impressive exhibit is an amazing way to display your accomplishment for any front office, special awards ceremony or given as a gift. For that special touch, include engraving at the bottom to emphasize your achievement.
Elite e-print
The Elite E-print is a digital page-turning solution that transforms static PDF into dynamic and user-friendly presentations. Not only does the Elite E-print grab your customer’s attention with its page-flipping capabilities, but it can also provide embedded video to capture and maintain your readers.

What can I get for free?
If you’re not an MVP member, you’re free to enjoy 4 free articles per month on
menshealth.com
.
Why am I completely blocked from reading some Men’s Health stories?
You must be trying to read an exclusive story, or just hit the maximum free articles during your 30-day limit. If you are not already a member, you will need to join first. If you have already purchased a membership but have not yet created an account, visit our site and click "Sign Up" in the top right corner using the same email you used to purchase your membership and set a new password. If you have signed in before, simply log in.
Once logged in, you will gain access to all member content and benefits!
*Remember to log in on every device that you use.
What is the difference between the Premium All Access, Digital + Print and Digital Only options?
While all plans give you unlimited access to
menshealth.com
and the members-only newsletter. Premium and Digital + Print are annual plans that also give you the print magazine, access to events and deals. Only Premium members get access to 450+ streaming workouts on the All Out Studio app.
Can I only subscribe to All Out Studio?
Absolutely. Head
here
to access hundreds of on-demand workouts curated by the editors at Men’s Health. But if you want full access to All Out Studio in addition to the full MVP experience — exclusive access to MVP-only stories, the members-only newsletter, unlimited access to
menshealth.com
— sign up for the MVP membership program.
Where can I read all of the MH MVP stories?
If you are already a member, you can browse
here
. If you aren’t
join now
!
Where can I contact customer service if I have issues with my account?
You can reach a customer service rep with any questions
here
. We have a team ready to resolve any technical issues or assist in helping you upgrade or cancel your membership.
If I already subscribe to Men’s Health print magazine, do I still have to pay for unlimited MVP access?
Thanks for being a subscriber! Yes, MVP is a separate offering from the print magazine and requires a separate subscription. Feel free to sign up
here
for the annual option, which includes another year of the print magazine.
If I signed up for a membership, how do I access the current digital issue and archived issues?
Go to the App Store or Google Play Newsstand on your device.
Search for the
Men's Health Magazine
app within the store or newsstand.
Download the app on your device and launch it.
Tap the “Subscribe” icon in the app and under “Existing Subscribers” enter your email & zip to log in.
Is Men’s Health MVP available to international subscribers?
The annual options are available to both US and Canada residents only, and anyone with a US-currency-based card (Amex, Visa, Mastercard, Discover, PayPal Amazon Pay) can subscribe to the monthly digital-only option.
