That's because our fitness challenges come with day-by-day calendars to keep you on track, plus lots of variety so you won't get bored. Almost all of the workouts are bodyweight only—meaning you don't need equipment—and you can do them almost anywhere. Several challenges also come with healthy recipes, options for active rest days, plus warm-up and cool-down routines.

Planning your next workout just got easier. Each of the challenges below lasts four weeks—or longer!—and takes the guesswork out of what to do. That's because our fitness challenges come with day-by-day calendars to keep you on track, plus lots of variety so you won't get bored. Almost all of the workouts are bodyweight only—meaning you don't need equipment—and you can do them almost anywhere. Several challenges also come with healthy recipes, options for active rest days, plus warm-up and cool-down routines.
Pick one below and start today!

Sorry, but Running Without Energy Gels Isn’t the Flex You Think
Shaming runners for fueling isn’t just rude—it’s contradicted by science and can be flat-out harmful.

Stop me if you’ve heard this one before: An influencer, wannabe coach, or random guy who races a lot posts about the virtues of running without energy gels or other fuel sources. They might even
directly
lecture a female athlete about it, if she dares to talk up how it’s benefited her training.
The details differ. Sometimes, the person claims the best gel for a half marathon is, well, absolutely
none at all
, or that no athlete needs calories during
training
. In other cases, they say only “slow” runners need fuel, or bemoan how “people have become rather obsessed with the
snacks
.”
But the line of thinking always seems to be the same: Much like raw-dogging a flight or taking a no-sleep challenge, going without fuel on long runs makes you a tougher or more superior human and athlete, they believe.
As a writer who’s covered the science of performance and health for nearly two decades and a 24-time marathon finisher, I’m here to tell you this is a bad take—and it’s hurting our sport.
I’m not alone in this view: “There is this movement in general around teaching ourselves we can be deprived, and trying to get something out of that, that I think is really unhealthy,”
Stephanie Roth-Goldberg, LCSW,
a New York City–based therapist specializing in sports psychology and eating disorder recovery, tells SELF. “I’m not sure what people are trying to prove to themselves—and I’m not sure
they
know what they’re trying to prove to themselves.”
Call it tough-guy syndrome, with an added heaping helping of
diet culture
. Whatever the motivation, we—those of us who gather and share accurate fitness information—would like a word about this approach. Or three, rather: Knock. It. Off.
For one, scientifically speaking, this sentiment is flat-out wrong. The latest
research
and the experience of record-setting runners show that taking fuel—in the form of energy gels or other fast-acting carbohydrates—during long-distance efforts has big benefits for performance.
Plus, shaming others for fueling is needlessly judgmental and dick-ish, driving people who might otherwise enjoy running away from the sport or into unhealthy habits that can have long-term repercussions.
There are a whole host of reasons you can (and should!) use energy gels while running—both for your performance and for your overall health. Everyday athletes can use fuel to run faster, feel better while they’re doing it, and bounce back more quickly afterward, sports dietitian
Rebecca McConville, RD, CSSD
, tells SELF. Not sure how to get started, or need further convincing that you should give it a try? Read on as we set the record straight on sports nutrition, exercise physiology—and the posters who think they’re somehow exempt from both.
What are running gels, and how do they work?
Whatever names they go by—sports gels, carbohydrate gels, and running gels are common ones—these super-dense packets of fast-acting carbs all supplement your body’s existing glucose stores during exercise. Popular brands include Gu, Maurten, Huma, and UCAN, each with unique formulas and a variety of flavors.
They serve a vital role: Despite the widespread demonization of sugar, glucose—yep, a type of sugar—is your body’s main energy source, sports dietitian
Holley Samuel, RD, CSSD
, tells SELF. When you hit the starting line or head out for your regular neighborhood loop, you already have some in your bloodstream and far more stored in your muscles and liver, in a form called glycogen. As you lope along, enzymes break down glycogen into glucose, which your body then uses to create a molecule called adenosine triphosphate, or ATP. This powers both the muscle contractions and brain functions that carry you down the road or trail when you’re booking it.
Those storage spots typically contain enough glycogen to fuel 90 to 120 minutes of vigorous movement, such as running. But even before you’re completely depleted, you’ll begin to fade, McConville says; when your stores dwindle too low, you’ll feel sluggish and awful, what’s often called “hitting the wall” or “bonking.”
Using energy gels (and similar products) pre- and mid-run provides an accessible stream of
carbs
, mostly in the form of sugars and starches, that your body can convert into glucose and then ATP, keeping the bonk at bay. The latest
research
suggests runners, cyclists, and other endurance athletes benefit from getting anywhere from 30 to 60 grams of carbohydrates per hour for efforts lasting from an hour up to 2.5 hours, or as many as 90 to 120 grams
for longer durations
.
It’s true that your body can—and will—burn stored fat to make ATP if you don’t have enough carbs at the ready. But fat-burning happens at a much slower rate, Samuel says, making it a better fuel source for low-intensity effort and not ideal for optimal performance.
You might hear some of these no-fuel posters talk about being “
fat-adapted
.” Some elite athletes, especially those who run ultra-long distances, swear by a ketogenic or very low-carb diet to increase their fat-burning capacity and reduce their reliance on carbohydrates.
However, it’s a controversial approach that doesn’t work for everyone, notes a
review
in the
Journal of Physiology
. Plus, it requires a hyper-focus on tracking and removing foods from your diet, approaches that are tough to stick to and could contribute to underfueling or
disordered eating
. And it still doesn’t invalidate the reams of research on the benefits of carbs for most athletes.
When do you use running gels—and what’s the benefit?
The in-the-moment perks of mid-run fueling apply to any bout of about an hour or more, Samuel says—your body knows time, not mileage, and everyone’s pace is different. For many runners, that means taking in fuel on their weekly long run and sometimes other efforts (like, say, an intense
interval session
on the track that lasts 60 minutes or more). And it means fueling is likely to help you feel and perform better in any race that will take you an hour or more to complete, regardless of the distance—whether it’s a 10K or a full marathon.
That doesn’t mean waiting until the hour mark to take a gel, though. Unlike a car that runs just fine until it hits empty, your body tends to feel best when you stay on top of your energy needs. McConville and Samuel typically recommend taking the first gel—each contains roughly 20 to 30 grams of carbs—at 30 minutes, and then another every 30 minutes after that. So that way, you’re getting the 30 to 60 grams per hour sports dietitians
recommend
. You can also take one before you run, especially if it’s been a while since you last ate.
So sure, random social media dude, you
can
get through a 90-minute or two-hour run or race without gels—but you’ll likely finish with a mostly empty tank, not feeling anywhere near as strong or kickass as you could have.
What’s more, especially if you don’t get a carb-rich snack or meal soon after a fuel-less run, you can
keep digging a deeper hole
, never fully replenishing your glycogen. You might start your next run already at a deficit and also have a greater risk of running low on fuel overall. That can lead to a condition called
relative energy deficiency in sport
or REDs, “a syndrome of every single body system that’s related to underfueling chronically,” Samuel says—and one that “can take a really long time to fix.”
On the flip side, midrun fueling helps you both during the run and after you hit “stop” on your watch. “You’re less depleted at the end of a run,”
Heather Caplan, RD
, a registered dietitian, running coach, and co-founder of the
Lane 9 Project
, tells SELF. That means you’ll also feel stronger the rest of your day, absorb more of the benefits of your training, and be recovered and ready for your next effort. “Part of the practice of fueling midrun is to make sure you’re continuing to give your body what it needs to build endurance and fitness, or maintain what you have,” she says.
Plus, the more you practice fueling on the move, the better your body will get at taking in carbohydrates during vigorous activity. Scientists designed gels to be easy to digest, but slurping them down can still take some getting used to, especially if you’re trying to run at a faster pace. “You need to train the gut just like you’re training your muscles,” McConville says; the more you practice, the less your risk of
GI issues
, whereas you might be hurting if you try them for the first time on race day.
Fueling during training—even on shorter runs, if you want to—can help you build the habit so you’re ready when you want to perform your best. And it provides the opportunity to experiment with the loads of different products out there, so you can find the one that works best for you, Samuel points out. In addition to copious brands and flavors of sports gels for runners, many brands make alternatives like energy chews, blocks,
bars
, and even
jellybeans
for those who prefer something a bit more solid.
Is there a benefit to using energy gels instead of actual food?
Yes, actually. You can—and some runners do—fuel their efforts with other sources of simple carbs, such as pretzels, bananas, or dates, Samuel says. But those aren’t always as portable, especially given how many you’d need to eat. Like we mentioned, energy gels have around 20 to 30 grams of carbs in one small packet, whereas a whole small banana might have about 23 grams.
So if you’re trying to go all-out in your half or full marathon, “carrying a bushel of bananas with you—because that’s how much you’ll need—is not going to make you very aerodynamic,” Samuel says. “They’re also going to be kind of hard to peel.”
Plus, running gels are optimized to give you as big of a boost as possible. Most contain more than one type of carb—for example, glucose, fructose, and maltodextrin. “That will help get energy in quicker and more efficiently,” McConville says, because you process each type via a slightly different pathway. Think about it like a stadium parking lot, Samuel says. You can get cars in a lot more quickly if you have three entrances versus only one; gels avoid energy traffic jams.
But isn’t “real” food always better for you than something
ultraprocessed
, as the keyboard warriors often assert? Not necessarily, especially during intense exercise like running, when you’re pretty much instantly torching everything you’re ingesting, Samuel says. “Sugar is a good thing for that instance, and if you don’t fuel, you’re going to run into more problems than if you take in the sugar,” she says.
Okay, running gels serve a really important purpose. So…why do people keep knocking them?
Great question, since people who brag about how far they can go fuel-free are probably leaving a lot of benefits on the table. (Even those with the somewhat logical-sounding idea that you should withhold carbs during training to get a bigger energy surge during racing aren’t aligned with the
research
—rather, that approach makes your body
less
efficient at using carbs when you need them, not to mention increasing your risk of underfueling overall, Samuel says.)
In fact, their constant need to puff up while shaming others may reveal more about their own food or running anxieties than anything else. “Typically, bullies are working something out in themselves that they feel really bad about, and they don’t have the capacity or the support or the means to work on themselves,” Roth-Goldberg says. So they decide to make others feel bad, too, and get algorithmic encouragement for doing so.
Honestly, that’s the worst part. These energy gatekeepers are creating a culture of shame, blame, and denial that drives people away from running, ushers in a feeling that they’re not tough enough to be an athlete, and makes it all so much harder than it needs to be. I’ll admit that, for all I’ve learned in my career, I’ve let these messages affect my own habits at times—and when I’ve skimped on fuel, I’ve paid the consequences, both with poor performances and injuries. As a journalist, I’ve seen underfueling derail
careers
, harm collegiate
athletes
, and contribute to long-lasting physical and mental health
problems
.
And for whatever reason—the tyranny of the “for you” feed, reinforcement by ill-informed coaches or running-group peers who are also into deprivation, or the underlying hum of carb-phobic messaging in the broader culture—anti-fueling messages are often more compelling than science-based information from nutrition professionals, Caplan says.
New runners—as well as those prone to disordered eating and eating disorders, both incredibly prevalent in the sport—suffer the most. “I feel concerned for the folks coming into this space who don’t know the best practices around fueling, see something like that, and then adopt it as truth and carry that into their training,” Caplan says. “They are not going to get the most out of their training or their race experience.” Not to mention, they’re going to feel like crap, physically and mentally.
So, let us say it loud and clear: Tackling long runs without fueling isn’t a mark of an accomplished runner. Want to know what’s
actually
impressive? Being smart enough to follow the science and confident enough to ignore the fuel-shaming crowd. Those gels in your belt, shorts, or bra pocket aren’t a sign of weakness. They’re proof you take your performance—and even more importantly, your health—seriously.

Sorry, but Running Without Energy Gels Isn’t the Flex You Think
Shaming runners for fueling isn’t just rude—it’s contradicted by science and can be flat-out harmful.

Stop me if you’ve heard this one before: An influencer, wannabe coach, or random guy who races a lot posts about the virtues of running without energy gels or other fuel sources. They might even
directly
lecture a female athlete about it, if she dares to talk up how it’s benefited her training.
The details differ. Sometimes, the person claims the best gel for a half marathon is, well, absolutely
none at all
, or that no athlete needs calories during
training
. In other cases, they say only “slow” runners need fuel, or bemoan how “people have become rather obsessed with the
snacks
.”
But the line of thinking always seems to be the same: Much like raw-dogging a flight or taking a no-sleep challenge, going without fuel on long runs makes you a tougher or more superior human and athlete, they believe.
As a writer who’s covered the science of performance and health for nearly two decades and a 24-time marathon finisher, I’m here to tell you this is a bad take—and it’s hurting our sport.
I’m not alone in this view: “There is this movement in general around teaching ourselves we can be deprived, and trying to get something out of that, that I think is really unhealthy,”
Stephanie Roth-Goldberg, LCSW,
a New York City–based therapist specializing in sports psychology and eating disorder recovery, tells SELF. “I’m not sure what people are trying to prove to themselves—and I’m not sure
they
know what they’re trying to prove to themselves.”
Call it tough-guy syndrome, with an added heaping helping of
diet culture
. Whatever the motivation, we—those of us who gather and share accurate fitness information—would like a word about this approach. Or three, rather: Knock. It. Off.
For one, scientifically speaking, this sentiment is flat-out wrong. The latest
research
and the experience of record-setting runners show that taking fuel—in the form of energy gels or other fast-acting carbohydrates—during long-distance efforts has big benefits for performance.
Plus, shaming others for fueling is needlessly judgmental and dick-ish, driving people who might otherwise enjoy running away from the sport or into unhealthy habits that can have long-term repercussions.
There are a whole host of reasons you can (and should!) use energy gels while running—both for your performance and for your overall health. Everyday athletes can use fuel to run faster, feel better while they’re doing it, and bounce back more quickly afterward, sports dietitian
Rebecca McConville, RD, CSSD
, tells SELF. Not sure how to get started, or need further convincing that you should give it a try? Read on as we set the record straight on sports nutrition, exercise physiology—and the posters who think they’re somehow exempt from both.
What are running gels, and how do they work?
Whatever names they go by—sports gels, carbohydrate gels, and running gels are common ones—these super-dense packets of fast-acting carbs all supplement your body’s existing glucose stores during exercise. Popular brands include Gu, Maurten, Huma, and UCAN, each with unique formulas and a variety of flavors.
They serve a vital role: Despite the widespread demonization of sugar, glucose—yep, a type of sugar—is your body’s main energy source, sports dietitian
Holley Samuel, RD, CSSD
, tells SELF. When you hit the starting line or head out for your regular neighborhood loop, you already have some in your bloodstream and far more stored in your muscles and liver, in a form called glycogen. As you lope along, enzymes break down glycogen into glucose, which your body then uses to create a molecule called adenosine triphosphate, or ATP. This powers both the muscle contractions and brain functions that carry you down the road or trail when you’re booking it.
Those storage spots typically contain enough glycogen to fuel 90 to 120 minutes of vigorous movement, such as running. But even before you’re completely depleted, you’ll begin to fade, McConville says; when your stores dwindle too low, you’ll feel sluggish and awful, what’s often called “hitting the wall” or “bonking.”
Using energy gels (and similar products) pre- and mid-run provides an accessible stream of
carbs
, mostly in the form of sugars and starches, that your body can convert into glucose and then ATP, keeping the bonk at bay. The latest
research
suggests runners, cyclists, and other endurance athletes benefit from getting anywhere from 30 to 60 grams of carbohydrates per hour for efforts lasting from an hour up to 2.5 hours, or as many as 90 to 120 grams
for longer durations
.
It’s true that your body can—and will—burn stored fat to make ATP if you don’t have enough carbs at the ready. But fat-burning happens at a much slower rate, Samuel says, making it a better fuel source for low-intensity effort and not ideal for optimal performance.
You might hear some of these no-fuel posters talk about being “
fat-adapted
.” Some elite athletes, especially those who run ultra-long distances, swear by a ketogenic or very low-carb diet to increase their fat-burning capacity and reduce their reliance on carbohydrates.
However, it’s a controversial approach that doesn’t work for everyone, notes a
review
in the
Journal of Physiology
. Plus, it requires a hyper-focus on tracking and removing foods from your diet, approaches that are tough to stick to and could contribute to underfueling or
disordered eating
. And it still doesn’t invalidate the reams of research on the benefits of carbs for most athletes.
When do you use running gels—and what’s the benefit?
The in-the-moment perks of mid-run fueling apply to any bout of about an hour or more, Samuel says—your body knows time, not mileage, and everyone’s pace is different. For many runners, that means taking in fuel on their weekly long run and sometimes other efforts (like, say, an intense
interval session
on the track that lasts 60 minutes or more). And it means fueling is likely to help you feel and perform better in any race that will take you an hour or more to complete, regardless of the distance—whether it’s a 10K or a full marathon.
That doesn’t mean waiting until the hour mark to take a gel, though. Unlike a car that runs just fine until it hits empty, your body tends to feel best when you stay on top of your energy needs. McConville and Samuel typically recommend taking the first gel—each contains roughly 20 to 30 grams of carbs—at 30 minutes, and then another every 30 minutes after that. So that way, you’re getting the 30 to 60 grams per hour sports dietitians
recommend
. You can also take one before you run, especially if it’s been a while since you last ate.
So sure, random social media dude, you
can
get through a 90-minute or two-hour run or race without gels—but you’ll likely finish with a mostly empty tank, not feeling anywhere near as strong or kickass as you could have.
What’s more, especially if you don’t get a carb-rich snack or meal soon after a fuel-less run, you can
keep digging a deeper hole
, never fully replenishing your glycogen. You might start your next run already at a deficit and also have a greater risk of running low on fuel overall. That can lead to a condition called
relative energy deficiency in sport
or REDs, “a syndrome of every single body system that’s related to underfueling chronically,” Samuel says—and one that “can take a really long time to fix.”
On the flip side, midrun fueling helps you both during the run and after you hit “stop” on your watch. “You’re less depleted at the end of a run,”
Heather Caplan, RD
, a registered dietitian, running coach, and co-founder of the
Lane 9 Project
, tells SELF. That means you’ll also feel stronger the rest of your day, absorb more of the benefits of your training, and be recovered and ready for your next effort. “Part of the practice of fueling midrun is to make sure you’re continuing to give your body what it needs to build endurance and fitness, or maintain what you have,” she says.
Plus, the more you practice fueling on the move, the better your body will get at taking in carbohydrates during vigorous activity. Scientists designed gels to be easy to digest, but slurping them down can still take some getting used to, especially if you’re trying to run at a faster pace. “You need to train the gut just like you’re training your muscles,” McConville says; the more you practice, the less your risk of
GI issues
, whereas you might be hurting if you try them for the first time on race day.
Fueling during training—even on shorter runs, if you want to—can help you build the habit so you’re ready when you want to perform your best. And it provides the opportunity to experiment with the loads of different products out there, so you can find the one that works best for you, Samuel points out. In addition to copious brands and flavors of sports gels for runners, many brands make alternatives like energy chews, blocks,
bars
, and even
jellybeans
for those who prefer something a bit more solid.
Is there a benefit to using energy gels instead of actual food?
Yes, actually. You can—and some runners do—fuel their efforts with other sources of simple carbs, such as pretzels, bananas, or dates, Samuel says. But those aren’t always as portable, especially given how many you’d need to eat. Like we mentioned, energy gels have around 20 to 30 grams of carbs in one small packet, whereas a whole small banana might have about 23 grams.
So if you’re trying to go all-out in your half or full marathon, “carrying a bushel of bananas with you—because that’s how much you’ll need—is not going to make you very aerodynamic,” Samuel says. “They’re also going to be kind of hard to peel.”
Plus, running gels are optimized to give you as big of a boost as possible. Most contain more than one type of carb—for example, glucose, fructose, and maltodextrin. “That will help get energy in quicker and more efficiently,” McConville says, because you process each type via a slightly different pathway. Think about it like a stadium parking lot, Samuel says. You can get cars in a lot more quickly if you have three entrances versus only one; gels avoid energy traffic jams.
But isn’t “real” food always better for you than something
ultraprocessed
, as the keyboard warriors often assert? Not necessarily, especially during intense exercise like running, when you’re pretty much instantly torching everything you’re ingesting, Samuel says. “Sugar is a good thing for that instance, and if you don’t fuel, you’re going to run into more problems than if you take in the sugar,” she says.
Okay, running gels serve a really important purpose. So…why do people keep knocking them?
Great question, since people who brag about how far they can go fuel-free are probably leaving a lot of benefits on the table. (Even those with the somewhat logical-sounding idea that you should withhold carbs during training to get a bigger energy surge during racing aren’t aligned with the
research
—rather, that approach makes your body
less
efficient at using carbs when you need them, not to mention increasing your risk of underfueling overall, Samuel says.)
In fact, their constant need to puff up while shaming others may reveal more about their own food or running anxieties than anything else. “Typically, bullies are working something out in themselves that they feel really bad about, and they don’t have the capacity or the support or the means to work on themselves,” Roth-Goldberg says. So they decide to make others feel bad, too, and get algorithmic encouragement for doing so.
Honestly, that’s the worst part. These energy gatekeepers are creating a culture of shame, blame, and denial that drives people away from running, ushers in a feeling that they’re not tough enough to be an athlete, and makes it all so much harder than it needs to be. I’ll admit that, for all I’ve learned in my career, I’ve let these messages affect my own habits at times—and when I’ve skimped on fuel, I’ve paid the consequences, both with poor performances and injuries. As a journalist, I’ve seen underfueling derail
careers
, harm collegiate
athletes
, and contribute to long-lasting physical and mental health
problems
.
And for whatever reason—the tyranny of the “for you” feed, reinforcement by ill-informed coaches or running-group peers who are also into deprivation, or the underlying hum of carb-phobic messaging in the broader culture—anti-fueling messages are often more compelling than science-based information from nutrition professionals, Caplan says.
New runners—as well as those prone to disordered eating and eating disorders, both incredibly prevalent in the sport—suffer the most. “I feel concerned for the folks coming into this space who don’t know the best practices around fueling, see something like that, and then adopt it as truth and carry that into their training,” Caplan says. “They are not going to get the most out of their training or their race experience.” Not to mention, they’re going to feel like crap, physically and mentally.
So, let us say it loud and clear: Tackling long runs without fueling isn’t a mark of an accomplished runner. Want to know what’s
actually
impressive? Being smart enough to follow the science and confident enough to ignore the fuel-shaming crowd. Those gels in your belt, shorts, or bra pocket aren’t a sign of weakness. They’re proof you take your performance—and even more importantly, your health—seriously.

Does Barre ‘Count’ as Strength Training or Is It More About Flexibility?
Find out what all those little pulses are actually doing for your muscles.

Hop into any barre class and your muscles will quickly start to feel it: As you pulse to the beat of the
booming playlist
, it’s pretty darn common to get “the shakes,” where your body starts trembling from the strain of seemingly endless repetitions. It’s a similar feeling to what you might get from a tough lifting workout.
But do those
burning, quivering muscles
mean that barre actually “counts” as strength training—even if you never pick up anything heavier than a three-pound weight? We asked barre experts to break down exactly how this popular ballet-inspired workout affects our muscles, and the best way to fit it in with the rest of your exercise routine.
So what kind of strength can barre build?
The current trendiness of barre can make it seem like a newfangled workout, but it actually dates back decades ago. The regimen centers around traditional strength training movements like lunges and squats, but gives most of them a ballet-inspired twist, like turnout (outward rotation of the legs) or demi-pointe (raising up onto the balls of your feet). Some exercises also use a classic ballet barre to help you balance.
Traditionally, most barre moves don’t go through your full range of motion like you would in a typical lifting session. For instance, if you were
doing a lunge
, you’d normally bend all the way down until your one leg is parallel to the floor, then you’d stand all the way up before you do it all over again. Barre is different: “We go to that end range of motion, so you’re sinking down into a lunge, and then you’re doing little pulses,” exercise physiologist
Rachelle Reed, PhD
, an instructor at
PureBarre
, tells SELF.
This doesn’t mean it’s any easier, though. The challenge comes from doing a ton of repetitions of these tiny contractions—sometimes for minutes at a time. “You’re in it longer than what you would see in traditional strength training,”
Lisa Schale-Drake
, online lead instructor at
Barre3
, tells SELF. That’s possible because, instead of lifting super heavy weights through big ranges, you’re moving just your own bodyweight, or maybe light dumbbells, ankle/
wrist weights
, or resistance bands in small micro-movements.
These mini pulses mimic what you’d get out of an
isometric exercise
, where you just keep your body still in one challenging spot. “It’s almost like holding a plank for every major muscle group in your body,”
Shannon Reznik
, a master teacher trainer at
PureBarre
, tells SELF. These kinds of isometric movements build muscular endurance, or our muscles’ ability to keep firing over an extended period.
“This is really focusing much more on your slow-twitch fibers,”
Sarah Patterson, CPT
, product manager of strength classes at Barre3, tells SELF. These are the fibers designed for the long haul—they don’t generate a ton of power, but they can keep at it for quite some time. “These have a much higher resistance to fatigue and they also recover really, really quickly,” Patterson says. They’re what our bodies rely on for low- or moderate-intensity activities like
hiking
, low-key
cycling
or, ya know, day-to-day life like staying upright when you’re just standing around.
However, you won’t win any Strongman Challenges just by taking barre class.
If you consider strength training as anything that makes your muscles stronger, sure, barre can fit the bill. Although there hasn’t been much research done on barre specifically, there is
evidence
that this kind of high repetition/low weight exercise can be just as effective for growing muscle as heavy lifting—as long as you keep going close to the point of what exercise scientists call “failure,” where the last couple of reps feel nearly impossible to eke out.
But if your goal is to
maximize
your strength, barre isn’t really the best strategy. By not
lifting any heavy weights
, you’re limiting the gains you could make because you’re not training your muscles to produce the force and power it takes to move bigger loads. And in the group class format of a barre workout, it can be tricky to systematically increase the challenge over time with the kind of tailored progressive overload strategy that’s known to boost strength most effectively. “The muscle fibers are only adapting to the stimulus that you’re giving them,” Dr. Reed says. “At a certain point, you’re just maintaining rather than continuing to accrue more adaptation.”
That said, many barre studios are evolving to enhance the strength benefits of the workout. For instance, Dr. Reed says most instructors at various barre studios now incorporate the full ranges of motion during some exercises to supplement all that isometric work—meaning they’ll now include
eccentric
and concentric contractions (when the muscles are activated while lengthened or shortened, respectively) for greater strength gains. And many barre studios now have strength-focused classes that use up to 15- or 20-pound weights.
But there are other solid reasons to check out barre too.
Of course, stronger muscles aren’t the only reason to work out. Other aspects of your fitness can get a bump from barre class too.
Two of the biggest benefits harken back to barre’s balletic roots:
flexibility
and
balance
. Right alongside those strength exercises, most barre classes incorporate stretches like bending over your legs to lengthen the hamstrings. And barre is typically done in thin, grippy socks, which means you can feel the floor with the soles of your feet; Dr. Reed says this can help improve our proprioception, or the feedback between our brain and body that’s essential for balance. Add in the fact that many of the movements are done with your heels raised while others have you standing on just one leg, and you’ve got a major balance booster.
Schale-Drake says she actually sees barre’s balance challenges as functional core training. “We rarely lie on the floor and just do crunches—that’s not very functional. But standing on one leg, switching from a lunge to a knee lift, or stepping out wide to one side, these are all training for life,” she says.
That booming playlist in barre class also has its benefits. Because all the movements are set to a musical beat, it can encourage you to push harder. “When you feel the music course through your body and you’re working in unison with people in the room, it just provides this intangible sense of energy,” Reznik says. It also just makes exercising more fun—which is actually a pretty important perk given that science shows we’re more likely to stick with workouts we actually
like.
“Enjoyment is the biggest predictor of long-term maintenance,” Dr. Reed says.
Barre can seamlessly slot into the rest of your workout routine.
Tempted to give barre a try? Fortunately, this workout is pretty easy to include alongside the rest of your
weekly workouts
: Barre doesn’t typically wear you out so much that you need multiple days to recover the way that you might with more intense strength training or high-impact workouts.
Plus it can benefit your fitness no matter where you’re coming from.
Pretty new to strength work? Barre workouts can be a fantastic entry point for heavier lifting. Schale-Drake says they train proper alignment and build endurance that can help you to eventually take on higher loads. “I say it’s foundational to supporting other activities that require a higher amount of resistance,” she says.
But that doesn’t mean you can’t benefit if you’re already a big lifter. “This is going to help you have better form, better core, better coordination, reduce your fatigue so you can go heavier and stronger and more powerful with your lifting,” Schale-Drake says.
For cardio fans looking to use barre to check off their strength training box, Dr. Reed recommends starting with one or two classes a week, then eventually working in more progressively overloading strength work (outside of class). She adds that barre is actually a popular cross-training option for runners since it improves balance and helps maintain muscle mass, but isn’t so strenuous that you can’t do a long run the next day.
No matter where you’re coming from or how you usually like to move, barre can help make your body more resilient. “[For] people who are looking to cross-train, improve their mobility, work on flexibility, work on balance, and just learn safe, strong exercise form,” Dr. Reed says, “adding barre into their routine could be a really good thing to consider.”

Does Barre ‘Count’ as Strength Training or Is It More About Flexibility?
Find out what all those little pulses are actually doing for your muscles.

Hop into any barre class and your muscles will quickly start to feel it: As you pulse to the beat of the
booming playlist
, it’s pretty darn common to get “the shakes,” where your body starts trembling from the strain of seemingly endless repetitions. It’s a similar feeling to what you might get from a tough lifting workout.
But do those
burning, quivering muscles
mean that barre actually “counts” as strength training—even if you never pick up anything heavier than a three-pound weight? We asked barre experts to break down exactly how this popular ballet-inspired workout affects our muscles, and the best way to fit it in with the rest of your exercise routine.
So what kind of strength can barre build?
The current trendiness of barre can make it seem like a newfangled workout, but it actually dates back decades ago. The regimen centers around traditional strength training movements like lunges and squats, but gives most of them a ballet-inspired twist, like turnout (outward rotation of the legs) or demi-pointe (raising up onto the balls of your feet). Some exercises also use a classic ballet barre to help you balance.
Traditionally, most barre moves don’t go through your full range of motion like you would in a typical lifting session. For instance, if you were
doing a lunge
, you’d normally bend all the way down until your one leg is parallel to the floor, then you’d stand all the way up before you do it all over again. Barre is different: “We go to that end range of motion, so you’re sinking down into a lunge, and then you’re doing little pulses,” exercise physiologist
Rachelle Reed, PhD
, an instructor at
PureBarre
, tells SELF.
This doesn’t mean it’s any easier, though. The challenge comes from doing a ton of repetitions of these tiny contractions—sometimes for minutes at a time. “You’re in it longer than what you would see in traditional strength training,”
Lisa Schale-Drake
, online lead instructor at
Barre3
, tells SELF. That’s possible because, instead of lifting super heavy weights through big ranges, you’re moving just your own bodyweight, or maybe light dumbbells, ankle/
wrist weights
, or resistance bands in small micro-movements.
These mini pulses mimic what you’d get out of an
isometric exercise
, where you just keep your body still in one challenging spot. “It’s almost like holding a plank for every major muscle group in your body,”
Shannon Reznik
, a master teacher trainer at
PureBarre
, tells SELF. These kinds of isometric movements build muscular endurance, or our muscles’ ability to keep firing over an extended period.
“This is really focusing much more on your slow-twitch fibers,”
Sarah Patterson, CPT
, product manager of strength classes at Barre3, tells SELF. These are the fibers designed for the long haul—they don’t generate a ton of power, but they can keep at it for quite some time. “These have a much higher resistance to fatigue and they also recover really, really quickly,” Patterson says. They’re what our bodies rely on for low- or moderate-intensity activities like
hiking
, low-key
cycling
or, ya know, day-to-day life like staying upright when you’re just standing around.
However, you won’t win any Strongman Challenges just by taking barre class.
If you consider strength training as anything that makes your muscles stronger, sure, barre can fit the bill. Although there hasn’t been much research done on barre specifically, there is
evidence
that this kind of high repetition/low weight exercise can be just as effective for growing muscle as heavy lifting—as long as you keep going close to the point of what exercise scientists call “failure,” where the last couple of reps feel nearly impossible to eke out.
But if your goal is to
maximize
your strength, barre isn’t really the best strategy. By not
lifting any heavy weights
, you’re limiting the gains you could make because you’re not training your muscles to produce the force and power it takes to move bigger loads. And in the group class format of a barre workout, it can be tricky to systematically increase the challenge over time with the kind of tailored progressive overload strategy that’s known to boost strength most effectively. “The muscle fibers are only adapting to the stimulus that you’re giving them,” Dr. Reed says. “At a certain point, you’re just maintaining rather than continuing to accrue more adaptation.”

Anyone looking to get started with a fitness routine knows that it’s not
quite
as easy as it sounds. Sure, you can lace up a pair of running shoes and start jogging or fire up a video and bang out some bodyweight exercises right at home, but there’s a barrier that remains for a lot of folks: the feeling that they don’t really “fit” in with fitness or that exercise isn’t for them.
Here at SELF, our mission is to change that, both with the articles we publish and the images we choose. Despite what scrolling on social media may have you think, fitness
is
for everyone—and we want to help welcome you into the fold. One small way to do that, we believe, starts with the models we highlight to take you through each and every workout we put out there. That’s why our Everyday Athletes have been at the core of our fitness content for years: We want you to see yourselves on the mat, in the weight room, or on the track, so you can feel empowered to make fitness your own.
We’re so excited to introduce our Everyday Athletes Class of 2025: Over the course of the last year, we scoured the New York area fitness space to find the real-world fitness folks who exemplify our #TeamSELF values that everyone deserves a spot on the floor. This year’s group are marathoners, strength coaches, physical therapists, life coaches, dancers, and everything in between. They’re stroke survivors, poets, foster cat rescuers, activists, and flat-out inspirers. They work with folks looking to deadlift double their bodyweight, nail a tricky yoga pose, exercise comfortably through a POTS flare-up, or simply move in a way that feels affirming for their bodies. Keep on scrolling to learn more about our Everyday Athletes 2025 and keep checking back to see them demoing our workouts for the year to come! (Can’t wait? Click on over to SELF’s newest workout program,
6 Weeks to Stronger
, to see some of them in action!).

Least favorite exercise:
Barbell bench press.
Lauren Leavell started working out 14 years ago, and when she decided to make it her career nine years ago, she felt pulled toward barre: “I loved the way moving my body made me feel, and I wanted to be part of that process with and for other people,” she tells SELF. “Particularly in barre, there is not a lot of body diversity, and I thought it was important to model that. I wanted to see more barre teachers like me.” From there, she expanded into other areas of fitness—she now also teaches HIIT and mobility, and takes on personal training clients—and maintains a weight-neutral approach with all of it. “People come to me and they work on whatever they want to work on in their bodies without an aesthetic or weight loss goal,” she says “Instead, we’re looking at how they feel, how they move in their daily lives, and how we can do that together.” It’s a way of training that supports clients for the long haul. In fact, Leavell recently had a client tell her that they knew they’d be able to attend a class of hers in their third trimester of pregnancy
and
during a POTS flare because she always offers the modifications they need to feel comfortable in their body. “As someone who works constantly to make fitness more accessible, this was truly high praise and made me feel like all the care I put into my classes is paying off!”

@chaddyboychadd
Age:
46
Location:
Sunnyside, New York
Occupation:
Personal trainer, group fitness instructor, and life coach.
Favorite hype-up workout song:
“We Found Love” by Rihanna.
Best way to recover after a tough session:
Foam roller, baby.
Around 10 years ago, Chad Ryan first got into strength training when he joined up at Mark Fisher Fitness in NYC. It was there where he met a “trifecta” of coaches who encouraged his own path into the field, as Ryan tells SELF. “It was magical and inspiring to witness and be around,” he says. “The superb coaches mixed fun and fitness, gave excellent cues, and were a part of making me feel stronger and later very seen and acknowledged.” Three years later, he decided to turn it into a career; he got certified as a functional strength coach and in kettlebell training. “I still lead with their spirits inside me and all of their wisdom and knowledge they left on my very impressionable heart,” he says. Now, he’s motivating clients of his own, as a lead fitness coach at Mark Fisher Fitness and privately at
ChangeWithChad
. One way to do it, he believes, is to encourage consistency through “patience and persistence—a beautiful blend of the two,” as he explains it. “It’s about taking that
second
step,” Ryan says. “You can’t fully assess a fitness facility or coach or experience without having data. Go back another time, at least two visits, to make comparisons” and determine if you’ve found the community that makes you feel seen, encouraged, and motivated.

@thick.amb.fit
Age:
28
Location:
Brooklyn, New York
Occupation:
Occupational therapist and strength coach
Favorite kind of exercise
: Anything with kettlebells—they work on strength, mobility, and conditioning all at once.
Biggest gym pet peeve:
People who lift too heavy and compromise on form.
As a licensed occupational therapist who works with geriatric patients with chronic illnesses, Amber Edwards can see firsthand the benefit of encouraging movement in everyday life. Problem is, lots of older folks aren’t able to take advantage of it, either due to lack of access, or simply because fitness can be intimidating to get started with. “I would love to see more opportunities for this population to increase not only their strength, but also their confidence—and that will translate into their daily routine and help reduce the risk of mortality,” she tells SELF. The same benefits hold true for people in a lower age bracket as well. A former track and field athlete, Edwards has relied on strength training not only to help her qualify for regional and national meets, but also to guide her through life’s challenges. “Even during my lowest moments, fitness was a tool to assist me to never give up, keep me grounded, and to always remind me of the things I can and can’t control. It became more than just something I liked to do as a hobby—I wanted to make it a lifestyle and help others feel the same way.”
Zach Bergfelt
Katie Thompson
Social:
@zachbergfeltpilates
Age
: 35
Location:
Manhattan, New York
Occupation:
Fitness instructor for private and group classes
Favorite thing to do outside of fitness:
Traveling with my husband or catching a Broadway show.
Best feeling in fitness:
There’s nothing quite like the pride I feel when a client conquers an exercise or sequence they never thought possible.
Zach Bergfelt first fell in love with fitness as a dance major in college. At first, he started with Pilates as a way to cross-train, but it later grew into his focus: Now, he’s a “jack of all trades” in the fitness space, teaching Pilates (mat, Reformer, and Cadillac), cycling, and other classes too. “I wanted to make all bodies feel welcome, and I wanted to make everyone feel like they had a voice in fitness,” he tells SELF. The best way to foster it? Bergfelt believes that sustainable fitness comes from finding a routine that’s
your
routine—not a carbon copy of someone else’s or one that’s chockfull of things you think you “should” be doing. “If you hate running, don’t run,” he says. “Do a dance cardio class, go for a walk, do whatever you feel like that’ll give you joy, sweat a little bit, and get stronger your way, not someone else’s.”
Winnie Yu
Katie Thompson
Social:
@dr.winnatlife
Location:
Chinatown, New York
Occupation:
Orthopedic physical therapist and certified strength and conditioning specialist
Favorite way to recover after a tough workout:
Compression boots and sauna.
Least favorite exercise:
StairMaster—I don’t have the patience for it.
After doctors told her that her “body wasn’t meant to run” due to her history of injuries as a teen, Winnie Yu was left frustrated—and determined to prove them wrong. “I was told from a young age that I would just live with some level of pain down the road,” she tells SELF. But after becoming an orthopedic physical therapist, she realized that it didn’t have to be that way. “With proper programming, I’ve managed my body’s ability to heal, to get stronger, to get more mobile, and to inspire and guide others to do the same,” she says. In fact, Yu was able to run the 2023 New York City Marathon side-by-side with her best friend, and finish, as she describes it, a “completely pain-free race.” As a physical therapist, Yu emphasizes the importance of exercise for longevity and better movement versus simple aesthetic benefits. And that encompasses an overall change she’d like to see come to the fitness space too: More focus on function, less on achieving a certain “look.” “As I started working in the medical world, I began to realize that strength is what we should strive for, not just being lean,” says Yu, who says she grew up in an Asian community that valued thin bodies. “I would love to see more women feel comfortable with starting their fitness journeys with the goals of becoming healthier and not to just fit societal norms of beauty.”
Heart Gardener
Katie Thompson
Social:
@transyogateacher
Age:
36
Location:
Queens, New York
Occupation:
Activist, organizer, and MSW student at Columbia University’s School of Social Work
Favorite time to work out:
Midday—get some work done in the morning, take a break, get into my body, and then get a clear mind for the rest of the day.
The one exercise that makes you feel confident:
I’ve been having a lot of fun kicking up into forearm stand and handstand lately, which are two poses I never thought I could do.
Heart Gardener got his start in yoga from an early age—before he was even born, you may say. “My mom did yoga when she was pregnant with me,” he tells SELF. “And she introduced me to meditation and chanting when I was young—say, age two—and so it’s always been a part of my life.” But it wasn’t until his early 20s when he started to take the practice more seriously. “I was looking for healing. I was very lost with who I was, so I came to yoga to deal with trauma and emotional distress,” he says. “The goal of yoga is self-realization, and through it I realized I was trans and finally found self-acceptance, which is the most liberating thing I’ve ever experienced.” Still, he acknowledges it was often difficult to find instructors who shared his identities. So as a way to hold space for others who felt the same, he became an instructor himself in 2017, and started teaching Queer, Trans Yoga in his hometown of Washington, DC, in 2019. “I was able to share a practice that saved my life with others in ways that felt like a true honoring of the gift of yoga,” he says. Making the time to move his body is imperative, but it’s not always easy to find time for—something that Gardener knows a lot of other busy folks struggle with too. One tip? “I’ve just been setting timers for 10 minutes,” he says. “Then I just get on my yoga mat and move my body. It doesn’t have to look a certain way; I don’t even need to stand up. It feels good to move and kind of play around, sometimes I dance and get funky with it.”
Francine Delgado-Lugo
Katie Thompson
Social:
@francine_formfitnessbk
Age:
48
Location:
Brooklyn, New York
Occupation:
Strength coach and co-owner of
Form Fitness Brooklyn
Biggest gym pet peeve:
When people don’t put their weights back.
Favorite kind of workout:
I’m currently in love with upper-body push work, and I’ve been bitten by the running bug once again.
Francine Delgado-Lugo first started running as a way to manage stress 20 years ago, and soon began racing everything from 5Ks to half marathons to marathons—plus some Spartan races for good measure. Then she fell in love with weightlifting. “I had a great experience with a trainer—I learned how to be strong and confident in my own body, so I wanted to give back,” Delgado-Lugo tells SELF. She earned certifications in personal training and weightlifting, and partnered with two of her best friends (also trainers) to open Form Fitness Brookln, a gym dedicated to fostering an inclusive environment. “We as women have been taught for way too long that being small is what matters, and I believe you can be strong and beautiful and healthy at any size,” Delgado-Lugo says. Form Fitness also emphasizes functional strength—as does Delgado-Lugo in her own workouts. “Fitness is life,” she says. “There is nothing like feeling strong and being able to withstand standing in a line for a long time, being able to carry my own groceries, pick up my kid, and do for myself.” What’s more, it provides the “me” time a lot of folks are lacking. “Being in the gym, you have to shut everything out, and just be there with your weights and your workout. Fitness shows me that I can trust myself, rely on myself, and love myself.“
Jessie Diaz-Herrera
Katie Thompson
Social:
@curveswithmoves
Age:
37
Location:
Bronx, New York
Occupation:
Joyful movement instructor and cofounder of
Power Plus Wellness
Favorite hype-up workout song:
Definitely “Beso (Fruta Fresca)” by Wakyin, especially before teaching a dance fitness class.
The one exercise that makes you feel confident:
We’ve recently been picking up 100+ pound sand bags and throwing them over our shoulder, and it feels so badass!
Jessie Diaz-Herrera grew up as an athlete, starting with softball as a kid and later taking up rugby and dance. “I’ve been in an active body my entire life,” she tells SELF. “At every weight and in every shape my body has taken, she’s always been active, and I’m so grateful for that.” As an adult, she started with group fitness, leaning into CrossFit, Pilates, and, yep, dance too, and became an ACE-certified group fitness instructor so she could help others find their own place in fitness. That’s why she founded
Power Plus Wellness
(PPW), “a community where movement is a source of joy, not punishment.” For Diaz-Herrerra, it’s also been a lifesaver. In 2022, she experienced a major stroke that left the right side of her body paralyzed. “Movement, paired with pouring myself into PPW, became my path to recovery,” she says. “It healed my body and mind, and it reminded me just how precious life truly is.”
Natalia Perez-Segnini
Katie Thompson
Social:
@talathanyou
Age:
33
Location:
Brooklyn, New York
Occupation
: Yoga instructor; strength and conditioning coach; and movement, mindset, and breathwork coach
Favorite thing to do outside of fitness:
I’m a big fan of cooking, and I like to write songs/poetry/notes that feel like novels.
Best way to recover after a tough workout:
Recovery yoga flow, nutritious fuel, and then a delicious horizontal session on my couch.
Before she stepped into fitness professionally, Natalia Perez-Segnini lived a few very different professional lives—in journalism and sales, amid “a season of unhealthy lifestyle choices,” as she tells SELF. For someone growing up playing sports, movement had simply been a form of “competitive play,” but it soon became more: “As I reshaped my life, my career shifted with me and things sort of clicked into place.” She became a certified personal trainer and registered yoga instructor, with a deep interest in helping folks find an “in” into fitness that works for them. “You don’t have to be as bendy as the most ‘perfect’ yoga instructor you know to practice yoga, to lift weights, to be a fitness and movement enthusiast,” she says. “It’s not about how you look in your body, but how you
feel
in your body.” It’s all also about taking chances: In particular, she considers seeing the tug-of-war play out in a client’s eyes when they realize they can be scared to try something—and then still give it a shot—as one of her favorite moments as a coach. “So much breeds from that idea implanting itself in the mind: ‘I still can try,’” she says. “Despite the circumstances, previous experience, or desired outcome, not being afraid to try is the skeleton key to growth.”

Anyone looking to get started with a fitness routine knows that it’s not
quite
as easy as it sounds. Sure, you can lace up a pair of running shoes and start jogging or fire up a video and bang out some bodyweight exercises right at home, but there’s a barrier that remains for a lot of folks: the feeling that they don’t really “fit” in with fitness or that exercise isn’t for them.
Here at SELF, our mission is to change that, both with the articles we publish and the images we choose. Despite what scrolling on social media may have you think, fitness
is
for everyone—and we want to help welcome you into the fold. One small way to do that, we believe, starts with the models we highlight to take you through each and every workout we put out there. That’s why our Everyday Athletes have been at the core of our fitness content for years: We want you to see yourselves on the mat, in the weight room, or on the track, so you can feel empowered to make fitness your own.
We’re so excited to introduce our Everyday Athletes Class of 2025: Over the course of the last year, we scoured the New York area fitness space to find the real-world fitness folks who exemplify our #TeamSELF values that everyone deserves a spot on the floor. This year’s group are marathoners, strength coaches, physical therapists, life coaches, dancers, and everything in between. They’re stroke survivors, poets, foster cat rescuers, activists, and flat-out inspirers. They work with folks looking to deadlift double their bodyweight, nail a tricky yoga pose, exercise comfortably through a POTS flare-up, or simply move in a way that feels affirming for their bodies. Keep on scrolling to learn more about our Everyday Athletes 2025 and keep checking back to see them demoing our workouts for the year to come! (Can’t wait? Click on over to SELF’s newest workout program,
6 Weeks to Stronger
, to see some of them in action!).
Lauren Leavell
Katie Thompson
Social:
@laurenleavellfitness
Age
: 33
Location:
Philadelphia, Pennsylvania
Occupation
: Personal trainer and group fitness instructor at
Lauren Leavell Fitness
Favorite thing to do outside of fitness:
Foster and rescue cats, coach and support other small fitness businesses.
Least favorite exercise:
Barbell bench press.
Lauren Leavell started working out 14 years ago, and when she decided to make it her career nine years ago, she felt pulled toward barre: “I loved the way moving my body made me feel, and I wanted to be part of that process with and for other people,” she tells SELF. “Particularly in barre, there is not a lot of body diversity, and I thought it was important to model that. I wanted to see more barre teachers like me.” From there, she expanded into other areas of fitness—she now also teaches HIIT and mobility, and takes on personal training clients—and maintains a weight-neutral approach with all of it. “People come to me and they work on whatever they want to work on in their bodies without an aesthetic or weight loss goal,” she says “Instead, we’re looking at how they feel, how they move in their daily lives, and how we can do that together.” It’s a way of training that supports clients for the long haul. In fact, Leavell recently had a client tell her that they knew they’d be able to attend a class of hers in their third trimester of pregnancy
and
during a POTS flare because she always offers the modifications they need to feel comfortable in their body. “As someone who works constantly to make fitness more accessible, this was truly high praise and made me feel like all the care I put into my classes is paying off!”

Around 10 years ago, Chad Ryan first got into strength training when he joined up at Mark Fisher Fitness in NYC. It was there where he met a “trifecta” of coaches who encouraged his own path into the field, as Ryan tells SELF. “It was magical and inspiring to witness and be around,” he says. “The superb coaches mixed fun and fitness, gave excellent cues, and were a part of making me feel stronger and later very seen and acknowledged.” Three years later, he decided to turn it into a career; he got certified as a functional strength coach and in kettlebell training. “I still lead with their spirits inside me and all of their wisdom and knowledge they left on my very impressionable heart,” he says. Now, he’s motivating clients of his own, as a lead fitness coach at Mark Fisher Fitness and privately at
ChangeWithChad
. One way to do it, he believes, is to encourage consistency through “patience and persistence—a beautiful blend of the two,” as he explains it. “It’s about taking that
second
step,” Ryan says. “You can’t fully assess a fitness facility or coach or experience without having data. Go back another time, at least two visits, to make comparisons” and determine if you’ve found the community that makes you feel seen, encouraged, and motivated.

Age:

Location:
Brooklyn, New York
Occupation:
Occupational therapist and strength coach
Favorite kind of exercise
: Anything with kettlebells—they work on strength, mobility, and conditioning all at once.
Biggest gym pet peeve:
People who lift too heavy and compromise on form.
As a licensed occupational therapist who works with geriatric patients with chronic illnesses, Amber Edwards can see firsthand the benefit of encouraging movement in everyday life. Problem is, lots of older folks aren’t able to take advantage of it, either due to lack of access, or simply because fitness can be intimidating to get started with. “I would love to see more opportunities for this population to increase not only their strength, but also their confidence—and that will translate into their daily routine and help reduce the risk of mortality,” she tells SELF. The same benefits hold true for people in a lower age bracket as well. A former track and field athlete, Edwards has relied on strength training not only to help her qualify for regional and national meets, but also to guide her through life’s challenges. “Even during my lowest moments, fitness was a tool to assist me to never give up, keep me grounded, and to always remind me of the things I can and can’t control. It became more than just something I liked to do as a hobby—I wanted to make it a lifestyle and help others feel the same way.”

Traveling with my husband or catching a Broadway show.
Best feeling in fitness:
There’s nothing quite like the pride I feel when a client conquers an exercise or sequence they never thought possible.
Zach Bergfelt first fell in love with fitness as a dance major in college. At first, he started with Pilates as a way to cross-train, but it later grew into his focus: Now, he’s a “jack of all trades” in the fitness space, teaching Pilates (mat, Reformer, and Cadillac), cycling, and other classes too. “I wanted to make all bodies feel welcome, and I wanted to make everyone feel like they had a voice in fitness,” he tells SELF. The best way to foster it? Bergfelt believes that sustainable fitness comes from finding a routine that’s
your
routine—not a carbon copy of someone else’s or one that’s chockfull of things you think you “should” be doing. “If you hate running, don’t run,” he says. “Do a dance cardio class, go for a walk, do whatever you feel like that’ll give you joy, sweat a little bit, and get stronger your way, not someone else’s.”
Winnie Yu

Location:
Chinatown, New York
Occupation:
Orthopedic physical therapist and certified strength and conditioning specialist
Favorite way to recover after a tough workout:
Compression boots and sauna.
Least favorite exercise:
StairMaster—I don’t have the patience for it.
After doctors told her that her “body wasn’t meant to run” due to her history of injuries as a teen, Winnie Yu was left frustrated—and determined to prove them wrong. “I was told from a young age that I would just live with some level of pain down the road,” she tells SELF. But after becoming an orthopedic physical therapist, she realized that it didn’t have to be that way. “With proper programming, I’ve managed my body’s ability to heal, to get stronger, to get more mobile, and to inspire and guide others to do the same,” she says. In fact, Yu was able to run the 2023 New York City Marathon side-by-side with her best friend, and finish, as she describes it, a “completely pain-free race.” As a physical therapist, Yu emphasizes the importance of exercise for longevity and better movement versus simple aesthetic benefits. And that encompasses an overall change she’d like to see come to the fitness space too: More focus on function, less on achieving a certain “look.” “As I started working in the medical world, I began to realize that strength is what we should strive for, not just being lean,” says Yu, who says she grew up in an Asian community that valued thin bodies. “I would love to see more women feel comfortable with starting their fitness journeys with the goals of becoming healthier and not to just fit societal norms of beauty.”
Heart Gardener

@transyogateacher
Age:
36
Location:
Queens, New York
Occupation:
Activist, organizer, and MSW student at Columbia University’s School of Social Work
Favorite time to work out:
Midday—get some work done in the morning, take a break, get into my body, and then get a clear mind for the rest of the day.
The one exercise that makes you feel confident:
I’ve been having a lot of fun kicking up into forearm stand and handstand lately, which are two poses I never thought I could do.
Heart Gardener got his start in yoga from an early age—before he was even born, you may say. “My mom did yoga when she was pregnant with me,” he tells SELF. “And she introduced me to meditation and chanting when I was young—say, age two—and so it’s always been a part of my life.” But it wasn’t until his early 20s when he started to take the practice more seriously. “I was looking for healing. I was very lost with who I was, so I came to yoga to deal with trauma and emotional distress,” he says. “The goal of yoga is self-realization, and through it I realized I was trans and finally found self-acceptance, which is the most liberating thing I’ve ever experienced.” Still, he acknowledges it was often difficult to find instructors who shared his identities. So as a way to hold space for others who felt the same, he became an instructor himself in 2017, and started teaching Queer, Trans Yoga in his hometown of Washington, DC, in 2019. “I was able to share a practice that saved my life with others in ways that felt like a true honoring of the gift of yoga,” he says. Making the time to move his body is imperative, but it’s not always easy to find time for—something that Gardener knows a lot of other busy folks struggle with too. One tip? “I’ve just been setting timers for 10 minutes,” he says. “Then I just get on my yoga mat and move my body. It doesn’t have to look a certain way; I don’t even need to stand up. It feels good to move and kind of play around, sometimes I dance and get funky with it.”
Francine Delgado-Lugo

@francine_formfitnessbk
Age:
48
Location:
Brooklyn, New York
Occupation:
Strength coach and co-owner of
Form Fitness Brooklyn
Biggest gym pet peeve:
When people don’t put their weights back.
Favorite kind of workout:
I’m currently in love with upper-body push work, and I’ve been bitten by the running bug once again.
Francine Delgado-Lugo first started running as a way to manage stress 20 years ago, and soon began racing everything from 5Ks to half marathons to marathons—plus some Spartan races for good measure. Then she fell in love with weightlifting. “I had a great experience with a trainer—I learned how to be strong and confident in my own body, so I wanted to give back,” Delgado-Lugo tells SELF. She earned certifications in personal training and weightlifting, and partnered with two of her best friends (also trainers) to open Form Fitness Brookln, a gym dedicated to fostering an inclusive environment. “We as women have been taught for way too long that being small is what matters, and I believe you can be strong and beautiful and healthy at any size,” Delgado-Lugo says. Form Fitness also emphasizes functional strength—as does Delgado-Lugo in her own workouts. “Fitness is life,” she says. “There is nothing like feeling strong and being able to withstand standing in a line for a long time, being able to carry my own groceries, pick up my kid, and do for myself.” What’s more, it provides the “me” time a lot of folks are lacking. “Being in the gym, you have to shut everything out, and just be there with your weights and your workout. Fitness shows me that I can trust myself, rely on myself, and love myself.“
Jessie Diaz-Herrera

Age:

Location:
Bronx, New York
Occupation:
Joyful movement instructor and cofounder of
Power Plus Wellness
Favorite hype-up workout song:
Definitely “Beso (Fruta Fresca)” by Wakyin, especially before teaching a dance fitness class.
The one exercise that makes you feel confident:
We’ve recently been picking up 100+ pound sand bags and throwing them over our shoulder, and it feels so badass!
Jessie Diaz-Herrera grew up as an athlete, starting with softball as a kid and later taking up rugby and dance. “I’ve been in an active body my entire life,” she tells SELF. “At every weight and in every shape my body has taken, she’s always been active, and I’m so grateful for that.” As an adult, she started with group fitness, leaning into CrossFit, Pilates, and, yep, dance too, and became an ACE-certified group fitness instructor so she could help others find their own place in fitness. That’s why she founded
Power Plus Wellness
(PPW), “a community where movement is a source of joy, not punishment.” For Diaz-Herrerra, it’s also been a lifesaver. In 2022, she experienced a major stroke that left the right side of her body paralyzed. “Movement, paired with pouring myself into PPW, became my path to recovery,” she says. “It healed my body and mind, and it reminded me just how precious life truly is.”
Natalia Perez-Segnini
Katie Thompson
Social:
@talathanyou
Age:
33
Location:
Brooklyn, New York
Occupation
: Yoga instructor; strength and conditioning coach; and movement, mindset, and breathwork coach
Favorite thing to do outside of fitness:
I’m a big fan of cooking, and I like to write songs/poetry/notes that feel like novels.
Best way to recover after a tough workout:
Recovery yoga flow, nutritious fuel, and then a delicious horizontal session on my couch.
Before she stepped into fitness professionally, Natalia Perez-Segnini lived a few very different professional lives—in journalism and sales, amid “a season of unhealthy lifestyle choices,” as she tells SELF. For someone growing up playing sports, movement had simply been a form of “competitive play,” but it soon became more: “As I reshaped my life, my career shifted with me and things sort of clicked into place.” She became a certified personal trainer and registered yoga instructor, with a deep interest in helping folks find an “in” into fitness that works for them. “You don’t have to be as bendy as the most ‘perfect’ yoga instructor you know to practice yoga, to lift weights, to be a fitness and movement enthusiast,” she says. “It’s not about how you look in your body, but how you
feel
in your body.” It’s all also about taking chances: In particular, she considers seeing the tug-of-war play out in a client’s eyes when they realize they can be scared to try something—and then still give it a shot—as one of her favorite moments as a coach. “So much breeds from that idea implanting itself in the mind: ‘I still can try,’” she says. “Despite the circumstances, previous experience, or desired outcome, not being afraid to try is the skeleton key to growth.”

Andie MacDowell’s Painful Hip Symptoms Were Actually Piriformis Syndrome—Here’s What to Know
The condition can feel like sciatica, but it’s different.

Leg and
hip pain
can be frustrating to navigate given that so many different things can cause it. After all, struggling with issues in these areas can be a sign of problems with everything from your mattress to a tight
IT band
, with plenty of potential culprits in between. Now Andie MacDowell just opened up about being diagnosed with a health condition that caused her intense hip and leg pain—and most people have never heard of it.
It’s called piriformis syndrome, and the 66-year-old said on
The Drew Barrymore Show
on January 23 that the pain the condition caused was so bad, she thought she would need to get a hip replacement. MacDowell said she experienced pain that “was shooting down my leg,” and suggested her exercise routine contributed to her issue—in particular, a
lot
of Peloton workouts, per
Entertainment Weekly
.
However, MacDowell said she discovered, once she got a proper diagnosis, that her “hips are fine.” She worked with a PT for exercises targeting her glutes and her hip muscles. “I just do it every day, and it doesn’t hurt anymore. It’s a miracle.”
The
Four Weddings and a Funeral
star’s conversation is raising a lot of questions about piriformis syndrome and what causes it. Here’s the deal.
Piriformis syndrome is related to sciatica.
Piriformis syndrome is a neuromuscular condition that happens when the piriformis muscle in the butt, which is flat and pear-shaped, pushes against the sciatic nerve, according to the
Genetic and Rare Diseases Information Center
(GARD). “The piriformis muscle is deep in the buttock and runs diagonally across it,”
Nicholas Anastasio, MD
, a physician specializing in physical medicine and rehabilitation at Mercy Medical Center in Baltimore, tells SELF. “It externally rotates your hip.” (Say, for instance, when you move your leg out to the side to step into a car.) The sciatic nerve starts outside of your spine, travels through your pelvis, into your butt, and to the back of each thigh—and the piriformis muscle “sits right on top of that,” Dr. Anastasio says.
Piriformis syndrome mainly causes
sciatica
, which is a broad term used to describe pain in your lower back or hip that radiates down the back of your thigh and into the leg, per the
American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons
(AAOS). “You get this deep buttock pain, and then can get nerve pain running down your leg,” Dr. Anastasio says. However, he says, unlike with sciatica, folks usually don’t have back pain with piriformis syndrome.
Piriformis syndrome can also cause other uncomfortable symptoms like tenderness, aching, tingling, and numbness in your butt, along with pain when you sit, go up stairs, walk, or run, according to GARD. In fact, according to
research
in
BMJ Practical Neurology,
the most common hallmark of piriformis syndrome is pain over the site of the piriformis muscle after sitting for just 15 to 20 minutes.
Being active and exercising can raise your risk.
At baseline, piriformis syndrome is usually caused by damage, irritation, or overuse of the piriformis muscle, according to GARD. That can make the piriformis muscle swell or tighten, putting pressure on the sciatic nerve. Again, this muscle is in your butt—so going hard with
exercises that work your glutes
or nearby areas could lead to piriformis syndrome.
“Cycling is a big exercise that can cause it, along with horseback riding,” Dr. Anastasio says. “Anything where you’re sitting with the hips open like a book to the outside can be problematic.” This is particularly true if your bike positioning is a little off, and your legs are rotated out when you cycle, Dr. Anastasio says. (Remember, proper positioning involves your hips tracking under your knees, and your knees over the balls of your feet). “Keeping your hips in a neutral position is safest,” he adds.
Even hip abduction machines at the gym that work the butt muscles can aggravate the piriformis muscle, he says. Finally, muscle overuse is also a big potential cause, Dr. Anastasio says. And that’s why running can also be a trigger—particularly if folks have weak glute muscles and tight upper thigh muscles, or if they skimp on stretching or strengthening, per
ACSM’s Health & Fitness Journal.
“If there are imbalances in the surrounding muscles, such as weak glutes, the piriformis may overcompensate, leading to tightness and irritation,”
Karen VanEtten, PT, DPT
, director of Sports Medicine & Rehabilitation Services at Michigan State University. “Over time, this strain can cause microtrauma or inflammation, which places additional pressure on the sciatic nerve, especially if proper recovery or stretching isn’t prioritized.”
If you develop symptoms of piriformis syndrome, it’s important to check in with a pro—because they can help.
Dr. Anastasio stresses that piriformis syndrome isn’t overly common. In fact, it’s considered a rare condition. With that, it’s possible to be misdiagnosed when something else is behind your pain. “I’ve undiagnosed it more than I’ve diagnosed it,” Dr. Anastasio says. “A lot of people are told they have piriformis syndrome when the pain is actually from their back.”
If you do, in fact, have piriformis syndrome, your health care provider will likely recommend that you try to rest the muscle and apply ice to the area. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can be helpful, along with cortisone injections if you’re struggling, Dr. Anastasio says. “In chronic cases, Botox can help,” he says.
And—as MacDowell has learned—physical therapy can also be big. “It helps address muscle imbalances and improve posture,” Dr. VanEtten says.
In particular, strengthening (and then stretching) muscles including the piriformis, glute max (the biggest muscle in your butt), gluteus medius (a small muscle in your side-butt), hip abductors (outer thigh muscles), hip adductors (inner thigh muscles), and hamstrings (back of your thigh) is often recommended, per the AAOS. Bolstering your core can also help too says Dr. VanEtten. (Here’s some great
stretches and strengthening exercises for sciatica
, for instance).
To lower the risk of developing piriformis syndrome or to avoid exacerbating it in the future, Dr. Anastasio says it’s important to practice good form when you’re on a bike or riding a horse. If your bike seat tends to cause your hips to rotate out, he suggests looking for a new one that allows you to keep your hips in a more neutral position.
Finally, while it can be tough to go slow when you have a workout routine you’re excited about, it’s important to avoid going from 0 to 100—balance is definitely key, and allowing your body enough time to rest and recover between sessions is important. Dr. Anastasio says it’s crucial to gradually increase your pace and distance with exercise. “It’s important to have a gradual step-up in your intensity to prevent overuse injuries,” he says.

Andie MacDowell’s Painful Hip Symptoms Were Actually Piriformis Syndrome—Here’s What to Know
The condition can feel like sciatica, but it’s different.

Leg and
hip pain
can be frustrating to navigate given that so many different things can cause it. After all, struggling with issues in these areas can be a sign of problems with everything from your mattress to a tight
IT band
, with plenty of potential culprits in between. Now Andie MacDowell just opened up about being diagnosed with a health condition that caused her intense hip and leg pain—and most people have never heard of it.
It’s called piriformis syndrome, and the 66-year-old said on
The Drew Barrymore Show
on January 23 that the pain the condition caused was so bad, she thought she would need to get a hip replacement. MacDowell said she experienced pain that “was shooting down my leg,” and suggested her exercise routine contributed to her issue—in particular, a
lot
of Peloton workouts, per
Entertainment Weekly
.
However, MacDowell said she discovered, once she got a proper diagnosis, that her “hips are fine.” She worked with a PT for exercises targeting her glutes and her hip muscles. “I just do it every day, and it doesn’t hurt anymore. It’s a miracle.”
The
Four Weddings and a Funeral
star’s conversation is raising a lot of questions about piriformis syndrome and what causes it. Here’s the deal.
Piriformis syndrome is related to sciatica.
Piriformis syndrome is a neuromuscular condition that happens when the piriformis muscle in the butt, which is flat and pear-shaped, pushes against the sciatic nerve, according to the
Genetic and Rare Diseases Information Center
(GARD). “The piriformis muscle is deep in the buttock and runs diagonally across it,”
Nicholas Anastasio, MD
, a physician specializing in physical medicine and rehabilitation at Mercy Medical Center in Baltimore, tells SELF. “It externally rotates your hip.” (Say, for instance, when you move your leg out to the side to step into a car.) The sciatic nerve starts outside of your spine, travels through your pelvis, into your butt, and to the back of each thigh—and the piriformis muscle “sits right on top of that,” Dr. Anastasio says.
Piriformis syndrome mainly causes
sciatica
, which is a broad term used to describe pain in your lower back or hip that radiates down the back of your thigh and into the leg, per the
American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons
(AAOS). “You get this deep buttock pain, and then can get nerve pain running down your leg,” Dr. Anastasio says. However, he says, unlike with sciatica, folks usually don’t have back pain with piriformis syndrome.
Piriformis syndrome can also cause other uncomfortable symptoms like tenderness, aching, tingling, and numbness in your butt, along with pain when you sit, go up stairs, walk, or run, according to GARD. In fact, according to
research
in
BMJ Practical Neurology,
the most common hallmark of piriformis syndrome is pain over the site of the piriformis muscle after sitting for just 15 to 20 minutes.
Being active and exercising can raise your risk.
At baseline, piriformis syndrome is usually caused by damage, irritation, or overuse of the piriformis muscle, according to GARD. That can make the piriformis muscle swell or tighten, putting pressure on the sciatic nerve. Again, this muscle is in your butt—so going hard with
exercises that work your glutes
or nearby areas could lead to piriformis syndrome.
“Cycling is a big exercise that can cause it, along with horseback riding,” Dr. Anastasio says. “Anything where you’re sitting with the hips open like a book to the outside can be problematic.” This is particularly true if your bike positioning is a little off, and your legs are rotated out when you cycle, Dr. Anastasio says. (Remember, proper positioning involves your hips tracking under your knees, and your knees over the balls of your feet). “Keeping your hips in a neutral position is safest,” he adds.
Even hip abduction machines at the gym that work the butt muscles can aggravate the piriformis muscle, he says. Finally, muscle overuse is also a big potential cause, Dr. Anastasio says. And that’s why running can also be a trigger—particularly if folks have weak glute muscles and tight upper thigh muscles, or if they skimp on stretching or strengthening, per
ACSM’s Health & Fitness Journal.
“If there are imbalances in the surrounding muscles, such as weak glutes, the piriformis may overcompensate, leading to tightness and irritation,”
Karen VanEtten, PT, DPT
, director of Sports Medicine & Rehabilitation Services at Michigan State University. “Over time, this strain can cause microtrauma or inflammation, which places additional pressure on the sciatic nerve, especially if proper recovery or stretching isn’t prioritized.”
If you develop symptoms of piriformis syndrome, it’s important to check in with a pro—because they can help.
Dr. Anastasio stresses that piriformis syndrome isn’t overly common. In fact, it’s considered a rare condition. With that, it’s possible to be misdiagnosed when something else is behind your pain. “I’ve undiagnosed it more than I’ve diagnosed it,” Dr. Anastasio says. “A lot of people are told they have piriformis syndrome when the pain is actually from their back.”
If you do, in fact, have piriformis syndrome, your health care provider will likely recommend that you try to rest the muscle and apply ice to the area. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) can be helpful, along with cortisone injections if you’re struggling, Dr. Anastasio says. “In chronic cases, Botox can help,” he says.
And—as MacDowell has learned—physical therapy can also be big. “It helps address muscle imbalances and improve posture,” Dr. VanEtten says.
In particular, strengthening (and then stretching) muscles including the piriformis, glute max (the biggest muscle in your butt), gluteus medius (a small muscle in your side-butt), hip abductors (outer thigh muscles), hip adductors (inner thigh muscles), and hamstrings (back of your thigh) is often recommended, per the AAOS. Bolstering your core can also help too says Dr. VanEtten. (Here’s some great
stretches and strengthening exercises for sciatica
, for instance).
To lower the risk of developing piriformis syndrome or to avoid exacerbating it in the future, Dr. Anastasio says it’s important to practice good form when you’re on a bike or riding a horse. If your bike seat tends to cause your hips to rotate out, he suggests looking for a new one that allows you to keep your hips in a more neutral position.
Finally, while it can be tough to go slow when you have a workout routine you’re excited about, it’s important to avoid going from 0 to 100—balance is definitely key, and allowing your body enough time to rest and recover between sessions is important. Dr. Anastasio says it’s crucial to gradually increase your pace and distance with exercise. “It’s important to have a gradual step-up in your intensity to prevent overuse injuries,” he says.

Why Madison Keys Was ‘No Longer Searching for Validation’ Even Before Winning the Australian Open
Days after her first Slam title, the tennis star shares what stoked her confidence, how she tweaked her game, and why representation matters on the court.

In the land down under, Madison Keys is on top of the world. Over the weekend, the 29-year-old American tennis player won the first major of her career, beating two-time defending champion Aryna Sabalenka to clinch a historic victory at the Australian Open. In
footage
of the match’s final point, she raises her arms high in the air before covering her face in an outburst of emotion. “It was just kind of an out-of-body experience,” she tells SELF in a Zoom call on January 28. “In that moment, you become so hyper-focused on the task at hand that you just take everything point by point. Everything else just disappears.”
And she’s still riding that high three days later. In her own way, that is—keeping it chill is the new titlist’s preference. Immediately after, “I did get a nice glass of champagne, and then the next night, I got to have dinner with my team and kind of take it all in,” Keys says. “I'm a pretty low-key person, so that was the perfect way to celebrate.”
And there was a lot to reflect upon. With the win, Keys achieved a career milestone that she’s been eyeing for more than half her life. Since turning pro on her 14th birthday in 2009 (she famously started playing tennis after seeing Venus Williams on TV), she’s been considered a top contender on the WTA Tour, but a Grand Slam title eluded her. Previously, her closest brush was the 2017 US Open final, but it ended in a decisive straight-sets loss to fellow American Sloane Stephens. More recently,
Keys made it to the Wimbledon fourth round
but was forced to retire due to a minor hamstring tear, a decision that was necessary for her health but no less heartbreaking for it. “You kind of have to rebuild confidence back with your body after an injury,” she told SELF of the setback, right before the US Open. Then, in that tournament, she was knocked out in the third round by Belgian player Elise Mertens.
But change was in the cards. Ranked 14 in the world heading into the Australian Open, Keys managed to overcome a difficult draw, beating fellow American Danielle Collins in the third round, 2022 Wimbledon champion Elena Rybakina in the fourth, Elina Svitolina in the quarterfinals, and five-time Grand Slam champion Iga Świątek in the semifinals before facing off against Sabalenka. Held in Rod Laver Arena, the final was a nail-biter, but in the third set, Keys hit a forehand winner that sealed the deal.
In the process, she notched a few notable achievements: Becoming the first American to win the Australian Open in five years; the first woman in 20 years to beat the World No. 1 and 2 (Sabalenka and Świątek, respectively) en route to an Australian Open win; and the fourth oldest first-time Grand Slam women’s champion in the Open Era, according to Tennis.com.
Days later, the excitement hasn’t worn off. “I’m still super happy,” she says. “I think I'll probably ride the wave as long as I can.” Below, Keys talks to SELF about that ride so far; making the changes that prefaced her big win; and feeling comfortable with who she is and where she’s at, Grand Slam title or not.
SELF:
Your husband, fellow tennis player Bjorn Fratangelo, doubles as your coach. What is that dynamic like?
Madison Keys:
This summer will be, I think, two years that he’s been coaching me. It really helps that he played professional tennis as well, so he understands the life.
We work really well together because he knows when and how to deliver messages. We have really good communication, and we do a good job of knowing when we should talk tennis, and when the tennis talk should be turned off and we should go back to just being romantic partners.
He is a very smart guy and knows what he is talking about, so it’s pretty easy to have back-and-forth. He has my best interests at heart, and I trust what he says.
You’ve made some big technical changes recently regarding your racket, like switching out your Wilson for a Yonex and swapping your gut strings for polyester ones. How do you feel these adjustments have enhanced your game and reduced your injury risk?
We started making some changes last year. I had a pretty significant injury at the beginning and missed the first few months [of the tennis season], and it finally got to the point where I was like, Okay, I need to make some actual changes so that I can continue to play full seasons and be healthy.
I don’t really know specs and the technical things, but Bjorn is such a tennis geek. He can literally watch tennis on TV and tell me what racket the players are using, what it is. He knows everything. So I told him what I was searching for in a racket, and he narrowed it down for me, so I didn’t feel like the options were endless. Within the first five minutes of hitting with the new racket, I was like, Oh, yeah, this is it.
Do you think these changes were a factor in your victory?
Yeah, absolutely. I think the extra power and control that I’ve been able to find has not only helped my average rally ball be a little bit more dangerous, but also given me the freedom to go for things and thread the needle a little bit more, in a way that feels safe and comfortable. When you have that kind of combination, it just gives you a level of confidence. You feel like, Okay, no matter what is happening during the match, I can figure things out and I don’t have to stress as much that I have to play at a perfect level. This [racket and strings pairing] is definitely the combination for the foreseeable feature.
Going into the Australian Open, how were you feeling, especially knowing you’d have a long road to the podium?
So I actually won the tournament before the Australian Open, the Adelaide International. I played some really good tennis there, and when you’re able to do that, you have a level of confidence already that definitely helps push you through the draw.
Maybe there’s a little bit of superstition to it as well. The one other time I won the Adelaide International [in 2022], I ended up making the semifinals of the Australian Open. So when I won Adelaide again this year, in my head, I was like, Oh, maybe this is good luck. Maybe we’ll see a run in Australia.
I actually never look at the draw, so I am always kind of surprised at the end of any match about who the next opponent is. Some people like to look—I know [current World No. 6] Jessie Pegula does and knows every possible thing that could happen—but I’ve always just thought that the chances of it actually playing out how it should are so rare, why waste your time? Eventually, at some point, you figure it out, when there’s not very many people left. But in this case, I think I'm glad that I
didn’t
look at the draw, because that could have been a little bit daunting. Every round, I definitely gained more and more confidence, and as things went on, I felt more and more sure of myself, sure that I could be the one holding the trophy on Saturday.
What does it mean to you to finally achieve this milestone of winning a major? Does it feel like a lot of pressure has been lifted?
I think that I finally got to the point where I felt like I didn’t need to prove myself anymore, where I was really content with what I had done. Obviously, as a professional tennis player, I was still always wanting more, always wanting to win every draw, but no longer searching for validation through winning a Slam.
Not
winning a Slam, I think, gave me the freedom to not only win one, but now really appreciate it in a way that I don’t think that I could have before.
In some ways, I wish I could [reassure my younger self], but in other ways, I think going through all of the hard moments and the heartbreak got me to this point, because that was how I learned the lessons that I needed to win. So I am kind of a believer that everything happens for a reason.
With your Australian Open win, you join Black tennis greats like
Serena Williams
and
Naomi Osaka
, who have also achieved that distinction. What does it mean to you that many young girls see themselves represented in you?
I think representation matters, especially as a woman of color who has been playing for as long as I have and has gone through a lot of hard times to finally—at this point in my career—get the win. Being able to be someone who a little girl can look up to and say, ‘She looks like me,’ I mean, it’s amazing.
I got a very nice note from Serena. From the first time we played, she’s been someone who has always said that she believed I could absolutely be a Grand Slam winner. And as someone who looked up to her so much growing up, that always made me feel like, ‘Okay, if she says it, then it’s got to be true.’ So finally getting one, and having all of her support and kind words, it’s definitely something that you dream of when you’re a little kid.
What comes next for you? Are you already strategizing for upcoming tournaments, or are you taking some time to savor this moment?
I have a few days off, so honestly, I’m really looking forward to being home—making coffee, cooking some meals in our recently renovated kitchen, just getting back to normal life.
I’m trying to take in everything that’s happened in the last two weeks, but also, I’m always looking forward. That’s the reality of tennis, is that it doesn’t really stop. We have a bunch of big tournaments coming up—Indian Wells, the Miami Open—so I’m looking forward to getting back on the court and working on trying to continue to improve my serve and my net game. And, I think, focusing on that—focusing on constantly trying to be better and implement the things that we’re doing on the practice court in matches—just gives me the best opportunity to keep playing some good tennis.

Why Madison Keys Was ‘No Longer Searching for Validation’ Even Before Winning the Australian Open
Days after her first Slam title, the tennis star shares what stoked her confidence, how she tweaked her game, and why representation matters on the court.

In the land down under, Madison Keys is on top of the world. Over the weekend, the 29-year-old American tennis player won the first major of her career, beating two-time defending champion Aryna Sabalenka to clinch a historic victory at the Australian Open. In
footage
of the match’s final point, she raises her arms high in the air before covering her face in an outburst of emotion. “It was just kind of an out-of-body experience,” she tells SELF in a Zoom call on January 28. “In that moment, you become so hyper-focused on the task at hand that you just take everything point by point. Everything else just disappears.”
And she’s still riding that high three days later. In her own way, that is—keeping it chill is the new titlist’s preference. Immediately after, “I did get a nice glass of champagne, and then the next night, I got to have dinner with my team and kind of take it all in,” Keys says. “I'm a pretty low-key person, so that was the perfect way to celebrate.”
And there was a lot to reflect upon. With the win, Keys achieved a career milestone that she’s been eyeing for more than half her life. Since turning pro on her 14th birthday in 2009 (she famously started playing tennis after seeing Venus Williams on TV), she’s been considered a top contender on the WTA Tour, but a Grand Slam title eluded her. Previously, her closest brush was the 2017 US Open final, but it ended in a decisive straight-sets loss to fellow American Sloane Stephens. More recently,
Keys made it to the Wimbledon fourth round
but was forced to retire due to a minor hamstring tear, a decision that was necessary for her health but no less heartbreaking for it. “You kind of have to rebuild confidence back with your body after an injury,” she told SELF of the setback, right before the US Open. Then, in that tournament, she was knocked out in the third round by Belgian player Elise Mertens.
But change was in the cards. Ranked 14 in the world heading into the Australian Open, Keys managed to overcome a difficult draw, beating fellow American Danielle Collins in the third round, 2022 Wimbledon champion Elena Rybakina in the fourth, Elina Svitolina in the quarterfinals, and five-time Grand Slam champion Iga Świątek in the semifinals before facing off against Sabalenka. Held in Rod Laver Arena, the final was a nail-biter, but in the third set, Keys hit a forehand winner that sealed the deal.
In the process, she notched a few notable achievements: Becoming the first American to win the Australian Open in five years; the first woman in 20 years to beat the World No. 1 and 2 (Sabalenka and Świątek, respectively) en route to an Australian Open win; and the fourth oldest first-time Grand Slam women’s champion in the Open Era, according to Tennis.com.
Days later, the excitement hasn’t worn off. “I’m still super happy,” she says. “I think I'll probably ride the wave as long as I can.” Below, Keys talks to SELF about that ride so far; making the changes that prefaced her big win; and feeling comfortable with who she is and where she’s at, Grand Slam title or not.
SELF:
Your husband, fellow tennis player Bjorn Fratangelo, doubles as your coach. What is that dynamic like?
Madison Keys:
This summer will be, I think, two years that he’s been coaching me. It really helps that he played professional tennis as well, so he understands the life.
We work really well together because he knows when and how to deliver messages. We have really good communication, and we do a good job of knowing when we should talk tennis, and when the tennis talk should be turned off and we should go back to just being romantic partners.
He is a very smart guy and knows what he is talking about, so it’s pretty easy to have back-and-forth. He has my best interests at heart, and I trust what he says.
You’ve made some big technical changes recently regarding your racket, like switching out your Wilson for a Yonex and swapping your gut strings for polyester ones. How do you feel these adjustments have enhanced your game and reduced your injury risk?
We started making some changes last year. I had a pretty significant injury at the beginning and missed the first few months [of the tennis season], and it finally got to the point where I was like, Okay, I need to make some actual changes so that I can continue to play full seasons and be healthy.
I don’t really know specs and the technical things, but Bjorn is such a tennis geek. He can literally watch tennis on TV and tell me what racket the players are using, what it is. He knows everything. So I told him what I was searching for in a racket, and he narrowed it down for me, so I didn’t feel like the options were endless. Within the first five minutes of hitting with the new racket, I was like, Oh, yeah, this is it.
Do you think these changes were a factor in your victory?
Yeah, absolutely. I think the extra power and control that I’ve been able to find has not only helped my average rally ball be a little bit more dangerous, but also given me the freedom to go for things and thread the needle a little bit more, in a way that feels safe and comfortable. When you have that kind of combination, it just gives you a level of confidence. You feel like, Okay, no matter what is happening during the match, I can figure things out and I don’t have to stress as much that I have to play at a perfect level. This [racket and strings pairing] is definitely the combination for the foreseeable feature.
Going into the Australian Open, how were you feeling, especially knowing you’d have a long road to the podium?
So I actually won the tournament before the Australian Open, the Adelaide International. I played some really good tennis there, and when you’re able to do that, you have a level of confidence already that definitely helps push you through the draw.
Maybe there’s a little bit of superstition to it as well. The one other time I won the Adelaide International [in 2022], I ended up making the semifinals of the Australian Open. So when I won Adelaide again this year, in my head, I was like, Oh, maybe this is good luck. Maybe we’ll see a run in Australia.
I actually never look at the draw, so I am always kind of surprised at the end of any match about who the next opponent is. Some people like to look—I know [current World No. 6] Jessie Pegula does and knows every possible thing that could happen—but I’ve always just thought that the chances of it actually playing out how it should are so rare, why waste your time? Eventually, at some point, you figure it out, when there’s not very many people left. But in this case, I think I'm glad that I
didn’t
look at the draw, because that could have been a little bit daunting. Every round, I definitely gained more and more confidence, and as things went on, I felt more and more sure of myself, sure that I could be the one holding the trophy on Saturday.
What does it mean to you to finally achieve this milestone of winning a major? Does it feel like a lot of pressure has been lifted?
I think that I finally got to the point where I felt like I didn’t need to prove myself anymore, where I was really content with what I had done. Obviously, as a professional tennis player, I was still always wanting more, always wanting to win every draw, but no longer searching for validation through winning a Slam.
Not
winning a Slam, I think, gave me the freedom to not only win one, but now really appreciate it in a way that I don’t think that I could have before.
In some ways, I wish I could [reassure my younger self], but in other ways, I think going through all of the hard moments and the heartbreak got me to this point, because that was how I learned the lessons that I needed to win. So I am kind of a believer that everything happens for a reason.

In the year of our Lord 2025, no wardrobe is complete without a pair of black leggings. Soft, stretchy tights have become as essential as blue jeans and
white T-shirts
—wear ’em on cozy nights in, wear ’em while exercising, throw on an oversized blazer or sweater and wear ’em to the office (if your dress code permits…use your judgement, we’re not your boss).
But when it comes to options for black leggings, the limit does not exist. So the SELF team got to work testing tights from fan-favorite brands like Athleta, Lululemon, Old Navy, and more to see which are the very best for your needs, be that for running or running errands, namaste-ing or staying in.

What to look for when choosing black leggings
First things first: What are you buying these leggings
for
? A pair meant for physical activity will need specific features—like moisture-wicking materials or compression—that might not be as important to you if the plan is to wear them while catching up on
Severance.
Here are some criteria to keep in mind as you weigh your options.
Material
AccordionItemContainerButton
LargeChevron
All leggings must be tight and stretchy (if they’re not these things, they’re not leggings), which means they’ll include fabrics like spandex, Lycra, or elastane. For
exercise leggings
, you’ll also want to look for sweat-wicking materials like polyester or nylon, Alysha Flynn, founder of the female running community What Runs You, previously told SELF. Lounging leggings, meanwhile, may include cotton or wool blends.
Fit
AccordionItemContainerButton
LargeChevron
According to
Lauren Leavell
, certified personal trainer and barre instructor, make sure your leggings allow you to move without feeling restricted. While all leggings are meant to fit close to the body, different pairs have different levels of stretch and compression. “In athletics, the idea behind compression wear is to improve blood flow or oxygen delivery to muscles,”
James Borchers, MD
, director of the division of sports medicine at Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, previously told SELF. However, there aren’t many studies to back these claims, so there isn’t so much a “best” level of compression as one that’s “best for you”—a.k.a. whatever feels comfy.
Extra features
AccordionItemContainerButton
LargeChevron
Do you need a pocket to keep your phone physically attached to your body at all times? A drawstring to keep your leggings’ waistband tight? Or will you be running outside and need a pair with a zippered compartment for your keys and ID? Features aren’t always just added bells and whistles—they can make the difference between a legging that gets the job done and one that makes you perform even better.
How we chose the leggings on this list
SELF editors sifted through online reviews to find beloved leggings across the world wide web, then put some of the top picks through their paces. Testers wore their leggings for multiple activities—including running, yoga, cycling, and school pickup—over the course of the testing period (testing time varied by person, but it was at least one month long) and washed them according to the care instructions. We also considered past winners from
SELF’s Activewear Awards
.

Pros
Supersoft fabric

Cons
Not the most compressive option on this list
There’s a good reason why Athleta’s Salutation Stash leggings took top honors in our 2024 Activewear Awards: They’re soft, supple, and last forever. “These are my everything leggings! I have been buying the Stash from Athleta for years, and they hold up,” one awards tester said. “I teach barre, lift weights, hike trails, and browse the aisles of Trader Joe’s in them constantly.”
I love how the waistband supports my core without rearranging my organs, and the fabric blend (which includes moisture-wicking nylon, Lycra, and polyester) can stand up to sweaty workout sessions—believe me,
I sweat a
ton

Don’t sleep on Aritzia’s activewear. The Cheeky Hi-Rise Leggings in the brand’s PowerSculpt fabric are smooth, sleek, and stay put through every squat, lunge, and forward fold. If you love the style’s booty-lifting look but prefer a less compressive fit, the same design is available in five different fabrics that, according to Aritzia, are better for lower and medium-impact activities.

Pro tip: You don’t need to spend a bundle to get a quality pair of black leggings. Old Navy’s High-Waisted PowerSoft Leggings were the number-one pick by SELF readers in our 2024 Activewear Awards, and they’ll run you just $40 (even less when they’re on sale, which is often). “They’re comfortable AF, slimming, and they actually stay up during runs! I literally have 25 pairs, and they’re the only bottoms I’ll do races in,” one tester said. “The side pockets are so great, I don’t even need to wear running belts during my training runs to keep my phone, gum, and keys handy.”

Pros
Lightweight fabric has great stretch
Soft, brushed feeling
Cons
Knit material can hold in heat and sweat
“After years of wearing and writing about leggings, I finally know what brands are talking about when they say their tights have a ‘second skin’ feel, thanks to these leggings,” SELF’s senior commerce writer Sara Coughlin says. “They’re lighter than air, endlessly stretchy, and truly a joy to wear.” Coughlin wore the Vuori leggings for a whole day: She lounged on the couch, she went for a walk, she played with the dog, “and I never once felt distracted by my leggings,” she says.
However, she doesn’t recommend this pair for workouts because their thicker, knit material traps in heat and moisture. “The leggings felt great while I was stretching, but started to feel a little warm
when I started lifting weights
and moving around,” Coughlin says about wearing the AllTheFeels to the gym. “I’m still glad to have them in my closet—they really are uniquely and blissfully comfortable—but now I know they’re strictly lounging leggings.”

Wunder Train High-Rise Tight 28"
$98
Lululemon
Pros
Wide, comfortable waistband with pocket
Available in four lengths
Quick-drying fabric
Cons
Reviewers say the fabric feels thin (but not flimsy)
No side pockets
Lululemon’s Wunder Train Tight is designed for the gym or fitness studio (but still looks sharp out to brunch or bopping around town). This pair is made from the brand’s Everlux fabric, which is a blend of sweat-wicking nylon and Lycra. It features four-way stretch (so the leggings are just
as flexible as you are
) and has medium compression, so it’s more supportive than the brand’s popular Align and Wunder Under styles but is just as soft to the touch.
With numeric sizes from 0 through 20 and four available lengths, you can mix and match specs to find your perfect fit; then cinch the waistband’s drawstring if you need even more customization. During my testing—which included multiple sweaty Peloton cycling classes and strength training sessions—I found the Wunder Trains to be more lightweight and a little looser than the Athleta Salutations. (If you like a gentle hold, go for your regular size; I’d recommend sizing up if you prefer less compression and down for a tighter fit.)

Pros

Cons

If your top priority with leggings is looking snatched, we’ve found your match. Shapewear brand Spanx is doing what it does best with the SPANXshape Booty Boost Leggings: The pair’s sleek, slippery fabric offers so much support, I feel like a Bond girl (or a seal…but, like, in a good way?) when I wear them.
This style has also taken home SELF Activewear Awards multiple years, proving it has more to offer than good looks by holding up to hard-core CrossFit circuits and dance cardio classes. “These are perfection,” said one tester, who wears a size 2X. “They did not move. The leggings are high-waisted and cover my entire tummy as a plus-size woman. Where have these leggings been all my life?”

SELF’s director of fitness and food Christa Sgobba is a leggings expert: She’s worn dozens of different styles over the years for business and pleasure—because, hey, when you’re a fitness editor, working out is both of those things. And her top tights for strength training are the Under Armour Meridian Leggings.
“The material is so smooth and light; it doesn’t feel constricting,” she says. That being said, “These are absolutely squat-proof,” she promises (a must when you’re lifting). Bonus: UA reviewers say these make their butts look great.

Pros
Have a “barely there” feel
Reasonably priced, compared to similar styles from other brands
Cons
Not as compressive (which could be a pro or con, depending on personal preference!)
Not recommended for high-intensity workouts
When you’re flowing through chaturanga, you want to be able to focus on keeping your elbows tucked in and your core strong—not on whether your leggings are going to roll down. According to SELF senior health writer Erica Sloan, who wore the Adidas All Me Leggings during yoga and Pilates, that’s exactly what you get with this pair: “These really are a second-skin type of legging, so you can almost forget you’re wearing them,” she says. “And for all their softness and stretchiness, I was still impressed by the fact that they stayed in place throughout a Pilates reformer class and multiple walks around my neighborhood —no need to pull up the waistband.”
While Adidas recommends the All Me leggings for
low-impact activities
, they do feature the brand’s “Aeroready” sweat-wicking technology, which Sloan can vouch for. “I sweat a
ton
in Pilates, and these didn’t show the moisture much or stay wet for long after,” she says.

Pros

Cons
Waistband rolls down during exercise, according to reviewers
Nike claims the center drop pocket in waistband is large enough to hold your phone, but reviewers disagree
Who better to trust with a recommendation for leggings with staying power than a busy mom on the go? Just such a former SELF staffer tested the Nike Zenvy leggings—including wearing them for a full day at work—and says these “truly comfy” bottoms made her feel “supported and covered but without the discomfort of squeezing.” She adds: “They’re easy to slip on and when I sit down, they don’t roll.”
Can you exercise in these? Sure! The fabric is sweat-wicking, and our tester says she was comfortable wearing them during an intense workout. However, the material is meant to feel like a “soft hug” (per Nike), so compression-lovers might prefer a different pair for when they’re training.

Maternity Everyday Full Panel Leggings

Pros
Great price

Cons

May not be best for later in pregnancy; reviewers report the waistband is tight
SELF’s special projects director Hannah Pasternak says these maternity leggings from Gap are “just sooooo soft”—that’s five Os, friends. Made of 90% cotton, they’re a bit thicker and have less give than your typical workout leggings. But Pasternak and reviewers agree that the material feels high quality, especially for the $60 price tag.
Pasternak’s final word? “Looking at the model in these leggings is almost enough to convince me to get pregnant again,” she says.

In the year of our Lord 2025, no wardrobe is complete without a pair of black leggings. Soft, stretchy tights have become as essential as blue jeans and
white T-shirts
—wear ’em on cozy nights in, wear ’em while exercising, throw on an oversized blazer or sweater and wear ’em to the office (if your dress code permits…use your judgement, we’re not your boss).
But when it comes to options for black leggings, the limit does not exist. So the SELF team got to work testing tights from fan-favorite brands like Athleta, Lululemon, Old Navy, and more to see which are the very best for your needs, be that for running or running errands, namaste-ing or staying in.

What to look for when choosing black leggings
First things first: What are you buying these leggings
for
? A pair meant for physical activity will need specific features—like moisture-wicking materials or compression—that might not be as important to you if the plan is to wear them while catching up on
Severance.
Here are some criteria to keep in mind as you weigh your options.
Material
AccordionItemContainerButton
LargeChevron
All leggings must be tight and stretchy (if they’re not these things, they’re not leggings), which means they’ll include fabrics like spandex, Lycra, or elastane. For
exercise leggings
, you’ll also want to look for sweat-wicking materials like polyester or nylon, Alysha Flynn, founder of the female running community What Runs You, previously told SELF. Lounging leggings, meanwhile, may include cotton or wool blends.

According to
Lauren Leavell
, certified personal trainer and barre instructor, make sure your leggings allow you to move without feeling restricted. While all leggings are meant to fit close to the body, different pairs have different levels of stretch and compression. “In athletics, the idea behind compression wear is to improve blood flow or oxygen delivery to muscles,”
James Borchers, MD
, director of the division of sports medicine at Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, previously told SELF. However, there aren’t many studies to back these claims, so there isn’t so much a “best” level of compression as one that’s “best for you”—a.k.a. whatever feels comfy.

Do you need a pocket to keep your phone physically attached to your body at all times? A drawstring to keep your leggings’ waistband tight? Or will you be running outside and need a pair with a zippered compartment for your keys and ID? Features aren’t always just added bells and whistles—they can make the difference between a legging that gets the job done and one that makes you perform even better.
How we chose the leggings on this list
SELF editors sifted through online reviews to find beloved leggings across the world wide web, then put some of the top picks through their paces. Testers wore their leggings for multiple activities—including running, yoga, cycling, and school pickup—over the course of the testing period (testing time varied by person, but it was at least one month long) and washed them according to the care instructions. We also considered past winners from
SELF’s Activewear Awards

Pros
Supersoft fabric
Durable; holds up to years of workouts and washings
Roomy leg pocket doesn’t add bulk to the silhouette
Cons
Not the most compressive option on this list
There’s a good reason why Athleta’s Salutation Stash leggings took top honors in our 2024 Activewear Awards: They’re soft, supple, and last forever. “These are my everything leggings! I have been buying the Stash from Athleta for years, and they hold up,” one awards tester said. “I teach barre, lift weights, hike trails, and browse the aisles of Trader Joe’s in them constantly.”
I love how the waistband supports my core without rearranging my organs, and the fabric blend (which includes moisture-wicking nylon, Lycra, and polyester) can stand up to sweaty workout sessions—believe me,
I sweat a

Pro tip: You don’t need to spend a bundle to get a quality pair of black leggings. Old Navy’s High-Waisted PowerSoft Leggings were the number-one pick by SELF readers in our 2024 Activewear Awards, and they’ll run you just $40 (even less when they’re on sale, which is often). “They’re comfortable AF, slimming, and they actually stay up during runs! I literally have 25 pairs, and they’re the only bottoms I’ll do races in,” one tester said. “The side pockets are so great, I don’t even need to wear running belts during my training runs to keep my phone, gum, and keys handy.”

Pros

Cons
Knit material can hold in heat and sweat
“After years of wearing and writing about leggings, I finally know what brands are talking about when they say their tights have a ‘second skin’ feel, thanks to these leggings,” SELF’s senior commerce writer Sara Coughlin says. “They’re lighter than air, endlessly stretchy, and truly a joy to wear.” Coughlin wore the Vuori leggings for a whole day: She lounged on the couch, she went for a walk, she played with the dog, “and I never once felt distracted by my leggings,” she says.
However, she doesn’t recommend this pair for workouts because their thicker, knit material traps in heat and moisture. “The leggings felt great while I was stretching, but started to feel a little warm
when I started lifting weights
and moving around,” Coughlin says about wearing the AllTheFeels to the gym. “I’m still glad to have them in my closet—they really are uniquely and blissfully comfortable—but now I know they’re strictly lounging leggings.”

Lululemon
Pros
Wide, comfortable waistband with pocket
Available in four lengths
Quick-drying fabric
Cons
Reviewers say the fabric feels thin (but not flimsy)
No side pockets
Lululemon’s Wunder Train Tight is designed for the gym or fitness studio (but still looks sharp out to brunch or bopping around town). This pair is made from the brand’s Everlux fabric, which is a blend of sweat-wicking nylon and Lycra. It features four-way stretch (so the leggings are just
as flexible as you are
) and has medium compression, so it’s more supportive than the brand’s popular Align and Wunder Under styles but is just as soft to the touch.
With numeric sizes from 0 through 20 and four available lengths, you can mix and match specs to find your perfect fit; then cinch the waistband’s drawstring if you need even more customization. During my testing—which included multiple sweaty Peloton cycling classes and strength training sessions—I found the Wunder Trains to be more lightweight and a little looser than the Athleta Salutations. (If you like a gentle hold, go for your regular size; I’d recommend sizing up if you prefer less compression and down for a tighter fit.)

This style has also taken home SELF Activewear Awards multiple years, proving it has more to offer than good looks by holding up to hard-core CrossFit circuits and dance cardio classes. “These are perfection,” said one tester, who wears a size 2X. “They did not move. The leggings are high-waisted and cover my entire tummy as a plus-size woman. Where have these leggings been all my life?”

And her top tights for strength training are the Under Armour Meridian Leggings.
“The material is so smooth and light; it doesn’t feel constricting,” she says. That being said, “These are absolutely squat-proof,” she promises (a must when you’re lifting). Bonus: UA reviewers say these make their butts look great.

Pros
Have a “barely there” feel
Reasonably priced, compared to similar styles from other brands
Cons
Not as compressive (which could be a pro or con, depending on personal preference!)
Not recommended for high-intensity workouts
When you’re flowing through chaturanga, you want to be able to focus on keeping your elbows tucked in and your core strong—not on whether your leggings are going to roll down. According to SELF senior health writer Erica Sloan, who wore the Adidas All Me Leggings during yoga and Pilates, that’s exactly what you get with this pair: “These really are a second-skin type of legging, so you can almost forget you’re wearing them,” she says. “And for all their softness and stretchiness, I was still impressed by the fact that they stayed in place throughout a Pilates reformer class and multiple walks around my neighborhood —no need to pull up the waistband.”
While Adidas recommends the All Me leggings for
low-impact activities
, they do feature the brand’s “Aeroready” sweat-wicking technology, which Sloan can vouch for. “I sweat a
ton
in Pilates, and these didn’t show the moisture much or stay wet for long after,” she says.

Waistband rolls down during exercise, according to reviewers
Nike claims the center drop pocket in waistband is large enough to hold your phone, but reviewers disagree
Who better to trust with a recommendation for leggings with staying power than a busy mom on the go? Just such a former SELF staffer tested the Nike Zenvy leggings—including wearing them for a full day at work—and says these “truly comfy” bottoms made her feel “supported and covered but without the discomfort of squeezing.” She adds: “They’re easy to slip on and when I sit down, they don’t roll.”
Can you exercise in these? Sure! The fabric is sweat-wicking, and our tester says she was comfortable wearing them during an intense workout. However, the material is meant to feel like a “soft hug” (per Nike), so compression-lovers might prefer a different pair for when they’re training.

SELF’s special projects director Hannah Pasternak says these maternity leggings from Gap are “just sooooo soft”—that’s five Os, friends. Made of 90% cotton, they’re a bit thicker and have less give than your typical workout leggings. But Pasternak and reviewers agree that the material feels high quality, especially for the $60 price tag.
Pasternak’s final word? “Looking at the model in these leggings is almost enough to convince me to get pregnant again,” she says.

The world of wearables can be pretty intimidating. Fitness tech evolves constantly, meaning there are so many options to choose from—and tons of metrics to sort through (HRV! Sleep score!
Recovery
!). So which numbers really matter, and how do you find the best fitness trackers that’ll help you get the most out of your workouts?
To cut through the noise, we asked fitness experts which smartwatches and rings they recommend for every type of active lifestyle. We also tested some for ourselves to see if they
really
live up to the hype. Whether your goal is to set a new PR,
get eight hours of sleep
a night, or squeeze those 10,000 steps in every day, there’s a fitness tracker that can help you achieve it below.

What to consider before buying a fitness tracker
Battery life
AccordionItemContainerButton
LargeChevron
How often you need to charge a tracker might seem like a minor detail, but it can mean the difference between a wearable you actually use and one you don’t bother with.
Lisa Gualtieri, PhD
, a digital health professor at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and founder of Recycle Health (an organization that collects fitness trackers to donate), tells SELF that a short battery life is one of the biggest reasons people stop using their fitness watch—so make sure yours fits your lifestyle. Does it need more juice every night, or just once in a while? And how long does it take to fully charge?
Price
AccordionItemContainerButton
LargeChevron
Yes, activity trackers can be very expensive. And more advanced features typically mean a bigger investment. But there are also a number of budget-friendly options that cost less than
a pair of running shoes
. Most brands offer a range of models from entry-level to high-end,
Lindsey Bomgren, NASM-CPT
, founder of online fitness studio Nourish Move Love, tells SELF. When you’re figuring out how much you want to spend, just remember to calculate the cost of the device itself, plus any monthly subscriptions required to use it.
Metrics and features
AccordionItemContainerButton
LargeChevron
Not all wearables track the same data points, so consider which metrics are most important to you. For instance, if you’re a swimmer, you might want a watch that can count every stroke. Or if sleep is your biggest concern, consider a fitness tracker like the
Whoop
or
Oura Ring
that will dive deep into those nighttime metrics. You can also find watches that let you stream music, give turn-by-turn navigation, or automatically alert a loved one if you fall. “There are so many different options these days, depending on what you care about,” running coach
Amanda Nurse
tells SELF.
Comfort
AccordionItemContainerButton
LargeChevron
While some people only wear a fitness tracker during workouts, most today are designed to stay on your hand or wrist 24/7. So look for something light and sleek that you can set and forget. Consider whether a smaller watch case or a fabric vs. a silicone band might be more comfortable on your wrist, or if you’d prefer a smart ring instead.
Accuracy
AccordionItemContainerButton
LargeChevron
While no tracker is perfect, yours should provide info that’s precise enough to give you useful insights. “It’s widely known that the data wearables track isn’t always 100% accurate, but where these devices really shine is when we consider data over the long-haul,”
Ollie Thompson, CPT
, a trainer in London, tells SELF. It's those trends over time that can help you measure your progress and notice when you deviate from your baseline.
Cardiac surgeon
Basel Ramlawi, MD
, adds that, while many trackers have fairly accurate heart rate sensors that can deliver some solid stats to you and your provider, they’re not super sophisticated and shouldn’t be relied on for diagnostics without additional tests by your doctor.
Frequently asked questions about fitness trackers
What metrics can a fitness tracker track?
AccordionItemContainerButton
LargeChevron
Fitness trackers can track data like your steps, pace, heart rate, activity time, menstrual cycle, and more. Many can also log your sleep, breaking down how much time you spend in various sleep stages and your overnight heart rate variability. Others show advanced health and well-being metrics like your blood oxygen level (spo2), respiratory rate, and skin temperature—some can even take an ECG or give you an overall “stress score.”
What are the different types of fitness trackers?
AccordionItemContainerButton
LargeChevron
Fitness trackers can range from simple pedometers to mini-computers on your wrist. The most basic ones will mainly record your step count and maybe your heart rate. GPS tracking sports watches will also calculate your distance and pace, which makes them ideal for running and cycling.
A heads up: Smartwatches like Apple Watches or Google Pixel Watches can offer more connectivity, like the ability to answer phone calls or allow you to pay for your post-run coffee right from your wrist, but they might not have as many workout-specific settings. Some “put smartwatch features first, activity tracking second,” Bomgren says.
Do doctors recommend fitness trackers?
AccordionItemContainerButton
LargeChevron
When it comes to health monitoring, Dr. Gualtieri says that Apple watches are getting closer and closer to meeting the standards of medical-grade devices. For instance, they’re now FDA-approved to detect sleep apnea, and many also have an ECG app, irregular heart rate notifications, ovulation estimates, and more.
Many doctors say fitness trackers can be a smart way to take a proactive role in your own healthcare, particularly if you use your tracker as a heart rate monitor. “It allows people to be aware of where their heart is—it brings it front and center,” Dr. Ramlawi says. Some
Fitbits
and Apple Watches can even detect signs of common heart problems like atrial fibrillation (aFib, an arrhythmia), allowing doctors to treat it early. Dr. Ramlawi recommends getting a tracker that allows you to share a report of any irregular events with your provider, if this is a feature you’re interested in. (Just remember that fitness trackers aren’t a replacement for regular check-ups with your cardiologist or another provider.)

“If you're an everyday, at-home athlete, I think the Venu 3S is one of the best on the market for good, well-rounded measurements for everything,” says Bomgren, who uses one herself. “[It] has a nine- to 10-day battery life, so I can go on a trip and not have to pack my charger.”
We’re fans too: While this watch earned a spot in SELF’s
2024 Home Fitness Awards
, it was an editor favorite long before then. When SELF’s fitness director Christa Sgobba, CPT, tested the
Garmin Venu 3S
, she was impressed by how much workout data it collected—and how accurate her numbers were. “The Venu 3 is definitely pricey, but it also provides a solid bang for its buck,” she wrote in her review. “I can’t think of anything it’s missing that’d tempt me to look for an upgrade in a couple of years—so it’s the kind of fitness tracker that’ll keep you in the know for the long haul.”
She particularly loved the Venu’s strength training features and raved about its detailed recovery metrics that include personalized push and

Great value for lots of features
User-friendly app
Amazon reviewers say the screen is easy to read, but not too big
Lightweight
Cons
Works best with Google apps (not Apple apps), according to reviewers
This lightweight Fitbit is our top overall pick for its user-friendly design and impressive range of statistics. It has plenty of familiar features like activity tracking (including heart rate, distance, steps, and calories burned), sleep monitoring, and built-in GPS. But you’ll also get touchless pay and turn-by-turn directions from Google Maps when you’re on the go. You can even see VO2 max estimates, a daily stress score, and notifications from Gmail, to help you stay in the loop.
The Charge 6 is a great value: The price also includes six months of a Fitbit premium subscription, which provides advanced tracking features and access to workout classes via the Fitbit app. It’s no wonder Thompson says Fitbits are his first pick for beginners—or that this one is the brand’s best-selling watch.

Cons
Some reviewers report problems seeing the screen in bright daylight
Whether you’re a new runner, a 10-time Boston Marathon qualifier, or somewhere in between, the Garmin Forerunner is one of the best running watches around. Nurse says that, while Garmins are generally excellent at giving accurate heart rate and GPS data, she loves the 955 Solar specifically because it’s loaded up with features like race predictions and VO2 max estimates—it’ll even count every one of her strokes when she’s swimming.
It also has helpful safety features: “One time I fell off my bike, and my watch put out an alert to my husband,” Nurse says. Plus, the 955 Solar’s solar charging feature means its battery life is among the best around. “I tend to not take it off unless I'm going out to a fancy event (it's not cute for that), but I wear it all other times,” she says.
If you’re looking for a less expensive alternative,
Amanda Brooks
, ACE-certified personal trainer and running coach, tells SELF she recommends the
Garmin Forerunner 55
, which she says provides “all of the basic data that you need, from distance to heart rate to programming workouts.” It also offers cadence alerts and race time predictions based on your training.

Not the most intuitive interface
Unreliable sleep tracking
Although it’s a newer brand than Garmin, Coros has quickly gained a reputation for making fitness trackers with excellent battery life and great features at more reasonable price points. Our tester found that the Pace Pro’s AMOxLED screen clearly displays your stats during workouts—whether you’re out at night or in bright sunlight—with fun graphics that let you quickly check your heart rate zone (read: no need to do mental math while you’re on the run).
Downloadable maps, race predictions, expert-created training plans, build-your-own workouts, and loads of insights to scroll through after every activity make the Pace Pro one of the best training buddies you can find. Although our tester found that the sleep tracking isn’t the most accurate, she was impressed by its 20-day battery life. Just be patient while poking around: She noticed that the interface isn’t always the most intuitive, so it may take you a few minutes to find and access all of its helpful features.

Pros
Big, bright screen

Rugged water- and dust-resistant case
Quickly check your messages and adjust your music
Cons
Shorter battery life

If your workouts often take you outdoors, we think it could be worth investing in the Apple Watch Ultra 2. A highly dust- and water-resistant case and super bright screen help protect the tech inside, even when the weather (or your plans) change suddenly. Runners will appreciate that it can automatically detect when you’re at a track and provide accurate pace and distance stats, while hikers will enjoy downloading offline maps and saving custom trail routes right to your wrist.
The watch even works as a dive computer up to 40 meters under water. In her review of the original
Apple Watch Ultra
, Amy Eisinger, MA, CPT, wrote, “I love that I’m able to track my workouts, sleep, health, texts, music, and everything else, all from a single device.” She added, “this will easily be my new go-to for long runs, quick workouts, and every other part of my active (and slightly sleepless) life.”

Only works with Android phones (not iPhones)
Smartwatch fans with Android phones, the Pixel Watch 3 could be for you. Use it to pay for purchases without a credit card, connect to smart devices in your home, or respond to messages at the sound of your voice (using Google Assistant). You can even record music or see your Nest Cam feed right from your wrist.
But it also has lots of helpful fitness features like activity tracking, including a daily readiness score and target cardio load, so you can plan your workout routine accordingly. Plus, the Pixel collects sleep and health metrics (like breathing rate and heart rate variability) and has useful safety features like real-time fall detection and emergency SOS. No iPhone required.

Cons
Some Best Buy reviewers report syncing issues
While some of the best fitness trackers today are basically mini-computers on your wrists, there’s also something to be said for more basic options. If you’re looking for your first fitness tracker—or you aren’t interested in a bunch of extra bells and whistles—SELF’s senior commerce editor, Sarah Felbin, says the Inspire 3 is a great option.
“I’ve had my Inspire 3 for a few years now—I love that it’s small and low-profile, but still tracks a ton of data,” she says. “The Fitbit app is easy to use and allows me to check my steps, heart rate, sleep, and more at a glance.” She recommends springing for the paid Fitbit membership ($80 per year) if you're looking for detailed sleep tracking or workout programming, but adds that you can still get a lot out of this watch without it. Her favorite feature? The alarm, which gently vibrates on your wrist to wake you up in the morning or remind you to
get up and stretch

Pros
Detailed recovery metrics and sleep data
Converts stats into personalized recommendations that are easy to understand
Over 70,000 customizable color combinations to choose from
Cons
Pricey subscription required
No screen to show data while working out
Lots of top athletes like Michael Phelps and LeBron James use Whoop, a tracker that focuses on an often forgotten part of training: recovery. Strength coach
Ava Fagin, CSCS
, director of sports performance at Cleveland State University, tells SELF she wears hers 24/7 to keep tabs on her sleep and optimize her rest days. The tracker’s Strain Coach takes into account your heart rate variability (HRV), resting heart rate (RHR), and hours of sleep each day, then spits out a number. That result helps Fagin decide how vigorously to exercise each day—or
when to rest instead
.
Marcel Dinkins, CSCS
, personal trainer and Peloton fitness instructor in NYC, tells SELF that Whoop has helped her “learn to properly stagger workouts, to take advantage of scheduling naps, and really prioritize proper recovery in between sessions so I can continue to go hard when it’s time to train.”
Not a fan of always having something on your wrist? Whoop now offers clothing and
accessories
that let you position the tracker in your bra or underwear, so you can find the most comfortable method that works for you.

Pros
No need to wear a watch

Sizing kit

Cons
Most features require a paid subscription
If you want to learn more about your sleep patterns but don’t love the idea of having a tracker on your wrist at all times, check out the new Oura Ring 4. “That's a less obtrusive thing to wear,” Dr. Gualtieri says. The tiny sensors around your finger can detect your sleep stages, stress levels, and movement that the app turns into detailed health data and personalized recommendations.
Our tester says her Home Fitness Award–winning Oura Ring is her new favorite sidekick, even beyond workouts: “So far, I have a love-hate relationship with my Oura ring,” she says. “Love: when it tells me I’ve hit my activity goal for the day. Hate: when it lowers my sleep score for going to bed too late. But really, I'm impressed by how much it's picked up on. It could tell when I was
super stressed on a travel day
, and it even let me know that I was showing ‘minor signs’ of strain on a day I was feeling under the weather.” We’d say that’s pretty smart.

Some Amazfit reviewers say the strap comes off easily
Most fitness trackers cost a pretty penny—but for under $100 (and no subscription charge), the Amazfit Band 7 is just as capable as some more expensive options. It has 120 different sport modes and auto-detects certain activities like walking, running, or rowing. The watch can also monitor your heart rate and sleep, sending you alerts if it detects high stress or low blood oxygen levels.
Plus, you can wear it for an impressive 18 days between charges. Just be aware that some reviewers report the strap slips off pretty easily, so you’ll want to keep an eye on it when you’re outside or on the move.

Pros
30 day battery life
Classic aesthetic
Comes with a free 30-day trial and a two-year warranty
Cons
Some Withing reviewers noticed that the sleep tracking isn’t as accurate
Only shows one metric at a time
As someone who’s tried lots of trackers, Dr. Gualtieri says she’s stuck with this one from Withings the longest. That’s because it has two very practical perks: a battery that lasts a full month between charges and a watch face that blends in with any outfit. “It’s convenient because I often want to glance at my wrist and see the time—I don't want to have to push a button or have a complicated display,” she says.
But unlike your average timekeeper, Withings’ bestselling ScanWatch 2 also picks up on your heart rate, blood oxygen levels, temperature, activity, menstrual cycle, and sleep—and will give you a heads up if something seems off. Most of the display is taken up by the analog clock, so you can only peek at one metric at a time (which can be limiting during a workout where you might want to always see pace and distance, for instance).
But you can go deeper in the app, which offers plenty of data for free. Or, upgrade to Withings Plus for exclusive content like recommended workouts, recipes, and feedback on your metrics from a certified cardiologist.

The world of wearables can be pretty intimidating. Fitness tech evolves constantly, meaning there are so many options to choose from—and tons of metrics to sort through (HRV! Sleep score!
Recovery
!). So which numbers really matter, and how do you find the best fitness trackers that’ll help you get the most out of your workouts?
To cut through the noise, we asked fitness experts which smartwatches and rings they recommend for every type of active lifestyle. We also tested some for ourselves to see if they
really
live up to the hype. Whether your goal is to set a new PR,
get eight hours of sleep
a night, or squeeze those 10,000 steps in every day, there’s a fitness tracker that can help you achieve it below.

What to consider before buying a fitness tracker
Battery life
AccordionItemContainerButton
LargeChevron
How often you need to charge a tracker might seem like a minor detail, but it can mean the difference between a wearable you actually use and one you don’t bother with.
Lisa Gualtieri, PhD
, a digital health professor at the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health and founder of Recycle Health (an organization that collects fitness trackers to donate), tells SELF that a short battery life is one of the biggest reasons people stop using their fitness watch—so make sure yours fits your lifestyle. Does it need more juice every night, or just once in a while? And how long does it take to fully charge?
Price
AccordionItemContainerButton
LargeChevron
Yes, activity trackers can be very expensive. And more advanced features typically mean a bigger investment. But there are also a number of budget-friendly options that cost less than
a pair of running shoes
. Most brands offer a range of models from entry-level to high-end,
Lindsey Bomgren, NASM-CPT
, founder of online fitness studio Nourish Move Love, tells SELF. When you’re figuring out how much you want to spend, just remember to calculate the cost of the device itself, plus any monthly subscriptions required to use it.
Metrics and features
AccordionItemContainerButton
LargeChevron
Not all wearables track the same data points, so consider which metrics are most important to you. For instance, if you’re a swimmer, you might want a watch that can count every stroke. Or if sleep is your biggest concern, consider a fitness tracker like the
Whoop
or
Oura Ring
that will dive deep into those nighttime metrics. You can also find watches that let you stream music, give turn-by-turn navigation, or automatically alert a loved one if you fall. “There are so many different options these days, depending on what you care about,” running coach
Amanda Nurse
tells SELF.
Comfort
AccordionItemContainerButton
LargeChevron
While some people only wear a fitness tracker during workouts, most today are designed to stay on your hand or wrist 24/7. So look for something light and sleek that you can set and forget. Consider whether a smaller watch case or a fabric vs. a silicone band might be more comfortable on your wrist, or if you’d prefer a smart ring instead.
Accuracy
AccordionItemContainerButton
LargeChevron
While no tracker is perfect, yours should provide info that’s precise enough to give you useful insights. “It’s widely known that the data wearables track isn’t always 100% accurate, but where these devices really shine is when we consider data over the long-haul,”
Ollie Thompson, CPT
, a trainer in London, tells SELF. It's those trends over time that can help you measure your progress and notice when you deviate from your baseline.
Cardiac surgeon
Basel Ramlawi, MD
, adds that, while many trackers have fairly accurate heart rate sensors that can deliver some solid stats to you and your provider, they’re not super sophisticated and shouldn’t be relied on for diagnostics without additional tests by your doctor.

Fitness trackers can track data like your steps, pace, heart rate, activity time, menstrual cycle, and more. Many can also log your sleep, breaking down how much time you spend in various sleep stages and your overnight heart rate variability. Others show advanced health and well-being metrics like your blood oxygen level (spo2), respiratory rate, and skin temperature—some can even take an ECG or give you an overall “stress score.”
What are the different types of fitness trackers?
AccordionItemContainerButton
LargeChevron
Fitness trackers can range from simple pedometers to mini-computers on your wrist. The most basic ones will mainly record your step count and maybe your heart rate. GPS tracking sports watches will also calculate your distance and pace, which makes them ideal for running and cycling.
A heads up: Smartwatches like Apple Watches or Google Pixel Watches can offer more connectivity, like the ability to answer phone calls or allow you to pay for your post-run coffee right from your wrist, but they might not have as many workout-specific settings. Some “put smartwatch features first, activity tracking second,” Bomgren says.
Do doctors recommend fitness trackers?

When it comes to health monitoring, Dr. Gualtieri says that Apple watches are getting closer and closer to meeting the standards of medical-grade devices. For instance, they’re now FDA-approved to detect sleep apnea, and many also have an ECG app, irregular heart rate notifications, ovulation estimates, and more.
Many doctors say fitness trackers can be a smart way to take a proactive role in your own healthcare, particularly if you use your tracker as a heart rate monitor. “It allows people to be aware of where their heart is—it brings it front and center,” Dr. Ramlawi says. Some
Fitbits
and Apple Watches can even detect signs of common heart problems like atrial fibrillation (aFib, an arrhythmia), allowing doctors to treat it early. Dr. Ramlawi recommends getting a tracker that allows you to share a report of any irregular events with your provider, if this is a feature you’re interested in. (Just remember that fitness trackers aren’t a replacement for regular check-ups with your cardiologist or another provider.)

“If you're an everyday, at-home athlete, I think the Venu 3S is one of the best on the market for good, well-rounded measurements for everything,” says Bomgren, who uses one herself. “[It] has a nine- to 10-day battery life, so I can go on a trip and not have to pack my charger.”
We’re fans too: While this watch earned a spot in SELF’s
2024 Home Fitness Awards
, it was an editor favorite long before then. When SELF’s fitness director Christa Sgobba, CPT, tested the
Garmin Venu 3S
, she was impressed by how much workout data it collected—and how accurate her numbers were. “The Venu 3 is definitely pricey, but it also provides a solid bang for its buck,” she wrote in her review. “I can’t think of anything it’s missing that’d tempt me to look for an upgrade in a couple of years—so it’s the kind of fitness tracker that’ll keep you in the know for the long haul.”
She particularly loved the Venu’s strength training features and raved about its detailed recovery metrics that include personalized push and
rest day recommendations

Pros
Great value for lots of features
User-friendly app
Amazon reviewers say the screen is easy to read, but not too big
Lightweight
Cons
Works best with Google apps (not Apple apps), according to reviewers
This lightweight Fitbit is our top overall pick for its user-friendly design and impressive range of statistics. It has plenty of familiar features like activity tracking (including heart rate, distance, steps, and calories burned), sleep monitoring, and built-in GPS. But you’ll also get touchless pay and turn-by-turn directions from Google Maps when you’re on the go. You can even see VO2 max estimates, a daily stress score, and notifications from Gmail, to help you stay in the loop.
The Charge 6 is a great value: The price also includes six months of a Fitbit premium subscription, which provides advanced tracking features and access to workout classes via the Fitbit app. It’s no wonder Thompson says Fitbits are his first pick for beginners—or that this one is the brand’s best-selling watch.

Some reviewers report problems seeing the screen in bright daylight
Whether you’re a new runner, a 10-time Boston Marathon qualifier, or somewhere in between, the Garmin Forerunner is one of the best running watches around. Nurse says that, while Garmins are generally excellent at giving accurate heart rate and GPS data, she loves the 955 Solar specifically because it’s loaded up with features like race predictions and VO2 max estimates—it’ll even count every one of her strokes when she’s swimming.
It also has helpful safety features: “One time I fell off my bike, and my watch put out an alert to my husband,” Nurse says. Plus, the 955 Solar’s solar charging feature means its battery life is among the best around. “I tend to not take it off unless I'm going out to a fancy event (it's not cute for that), but I wear it all other times,” she says.
If you’re looking for a less expensive alternative,
Amanda Brooks
, ACE-certified personal trainer and running coach, tells SELF she recommends the
Garmin Forerunner 55
, which she says provides “all of the basic data that you need, from distance to heart rate to programming workouts.” It also offers cadence alerts and race time predictions based on your training.

Unreliable sleep tracking
Although it’s a newer brand than Garmin, Coros has quickly gained a reputation for making fitness trackers with excellent battery life and great features at more reasonable price points. Our tester found that the Pace Pro’s AMOxLED screen clearly displays your stats during workouts—whether you’re out at night or in bright sunlight—with fun graphics that let you quickly check your heart rate zone (read: no need to do mental math while you’re on the run).
Downloadable maps, race predictions, expert-created training plans, build-your-own workouts, and loads of insights to scroll through after every activity make the Pace Pro one of the best training buddies you can find. Although our tester found that the sleep tracking isn’t the most accurate, she was impressed by its 20-day battery life. Just be patient while poking around: She noticed that the interface isn’t always the most intuitive, so it may take you a few minutes to find and access all of its helpful features.

While some of the best fitness trackers today are basically mini-computers on your wrists, there’s also something to be said for more basic options. If you’re looking for your first fitness tracker—or you aren’t interested in a bunch of extra bells and whistles—SELF’s senior commerce editor, Sarah Felbin, says the Inspire 3 is a great option.
“I’ve had my Inspire 3 for a few years now—I love that it’s small and low-profile, but still tracks a ton of data,” she says. “The Fitbit app is easy to use and allows me to check my steps, heart rate, sleep, and more at a glance.” She recommends springing for the paid Fitbit membership ($80 per year) if you're looking for detailed sleep tracking or workout programming, but adds that you can still get a lot out of this watch without it. Her favorite feature? The alarm, which gently vibrates on your wrist to wake you up in the morning or remind you to

Lots of top athletes like Michael Phelps and LeBron James use Whoop, a tracker that focuses on an often forgotten part of training: recovery. Strength coach
Ava Fagin, CSCS
, director of sports performance at Cleveland State University, tells SELF she wears hers 24/7 to keep tabs on her sleep and optimize her rest days. The tracker’s Strain Coach takes into account your heart rate variability (HRV), resting heart rate (RHR), and hours of sleep each day, then spits out a number. That result helps Fagin decide how vigorously to exercise each day—or
when to rest instead
.
Marcel Dinkins, CSCS
, personal trainer and Peloton fitness instructor in NYC, tells SELF that Whoop has helped her “learn to properly stagger workouts, to take advantage of scheduling naps, and really prioritize proper recovery in between sessions so I can continue to go hard when it’s time to train.”
Not a fan of always having something on your wrist? Whoop now offers clothing and

The tiny sensors around your finger can detect your sleep stages, stress levels, and movement that the app turns into detailed health data and personalized recommendations.
Our tester says her Home Fitness Award–winning Oura Ring is her new favorite sidekick, even beyond workouts: “So far, I have a love-hate relationship with my Oura ring,” she says. “Love: when it tells me I’ve hit my activity goal for the day. Hate: when it lowers my sleep score for going to bed too late. But really, I'm impressed by how much it's picked up on. It could tell when I was
super stressed on a travel day
, and it even let me know that I was showing ‘minor signs’ of strain on a day I was feeling under the weather.” We’d say that’s pretty smart.

Pros

Cons
Some Withing reviewers noticed that the sleep tracking isn’t as accurate
Only shows one metric at a time
As someone who’s tried lots of trackers, Dr. Gualtieri says she’s stuck with this one from Withings the longest. That’s because it has two very practical perks: a battery that lasts a full month between charges and a watch face that blends in with any outfit. “It’s convenient because I often want to glance at my wrist and see the time—I don't want to have to push a button or have a complicated display,” she says.
But unlike your average timekeeper, Withings’ bestselling ScanWatch 2 also picks up on your heart rate, blood oxygen levels, temperature, activity, menstrual cycle, and sleep—and will give you a heads up if something seems off. Most of the display is taken up by the analog clock, so you can only peek at one metric at a time (which can be limiting during a workout where you might want to always see pace and distance, for instance).
But you can go deeper in the app, which offers plenty of data for free. Or, upgrade to Withings Plus for exclusive content like recommended workouts, recipes, and feedback on your metrics from a certified cardiologist.

If you get a period, you may have noticed that your body feels…different…at various points in your
monthly cycle
. Some days, you might feel charged up and ready to go, while others you’re moving in slow motion. It would make sense that this ebb and flow might impact how you show up to tackle your fitness routine too. That’s the idea behind cycle-syncing workouts, or the practice of changing up your exercise routine according to what phase you’re at in your menstrual cycle.
In theory, it seems solid: If hormones change throughout the month, why shouldn’t your
workouts
? Advocates of the practice say it comes with a range of benefits, from improving performance and recovery to decreasing
cycle-related symptoms
and
fatigue
. Some professional athletes (like
Ironman World Champion Laura Philipp
) have spoken publicly about factoring their cycle into training, and even the US Women’s National Team, led by sports scientist Dawn Scott,
famously leveraged it
en route to their 2019 World Cup win. Over the last few years, the concept has become a trendy wellness topic, even prompting dedicated cycle-syncing apps, workout programs from
Nike
,
Obé
, and
Alo Moves
, and tens of thousands of
posts on TikTok
.
The thing is, the science isn’t quite there, and as a result experts aren’t exactly jumping to endorse it. Curious about cycle syncing? Here’s everything you need to know.
What a cycle-synced workout routine might look like
The menstrual cycle can be divided into two main phases: follicular, the first half of the cycle when you menstruate and an ovary gets ready to release an egg; and luteal, the second half when your body prepares for a potential pregnancy.
Ovulation
is essentially the turning point in between,
Janet Choi, MD
, a double-board certified reproductive endocrinologist and ob-gyn and the chief medical officer of Progyny, tells SELF.
In the context of cycle syncing, many people break the menstrual cycle down into four distinct parts: menstruation, follicular, ovulation, and luteal. Cycle-based workout routines hinge on the changes that happen during each phase to guide
exercise intensity
throughout the month. Because the method isn’t yet supported by a lot of science, the recommendations on how to sync your workouts to your cycle vary. In general, proponents of the practice suggest something like this:
Menstruation (~Day 1–5): Light workouts like walking, stretching, mobility, and active recovery.
Menstruation (i.e., your period) happens at the beginning of the follicular phase, and it’s characterized by low hormone levels, particularly estradiol (a type of estrogen), Dr. Choi says. As a result, during this time, you may experience fatigue and decreased energy. You may also deal with period-related symptoms like cramps, nausea, or headaches, which could keep you from wanting to do high-intensity workouts or going all-out in the gym.
Follicular (~Day 5–14): Moderate-to-high-intensity workouts, like running, dance cardio, or weight lifting.
After your period ends and the follicular phase progresses, estradiol levels slowly rise, Dr. Choi says. You might find yourself with more and more energy as you approach ovulation, making it a potentially good time to ramp up your workout intensity.
Ovulatory (~Day 14): High-energy or strenuous workouts, like running, dance cardio, or weight lifting.
Hormone levels, including estradiol, peak around ovulation, Dr. Choi says. At this point in the cycle, many menstruators notice increased energy, improved mood, and heightened creativity, she says—in theory, making it a great time to challenge yourself and go for that PR.
Luteal (~Day 14–28): Somewhat gentler exercise, like Pilates, yoga, walking, or steady-state cardio.
“Following ovulation, estrogen levels start to decline while progesterone levels rise, peaking about a week post-ovulation,” Dr. Choi says. During this phase—and especially as you approach your next period and deal with potential PMS symptoms—you may experience lower energy, sleep disturbances, and possible mood changes, Dr. Choi says. For this reason, you may feel like dialing back on your workout intensity at this time.
An important caveat: Though a
28-day cycle
is considered “typical,” menstrual cycles can vary from person to person and month to month. In fact, one
2019 study
of more than 600,000 menstrual cycles found that only 13% were 28 days long and that, for the majority of menstruators, ovulation didn’t occur on day 14. Not to mention, if you use
hormonal contraception
, these same fluctuations don’t apply since it interrupts normal hormonal cycling, Liz Joy, MD, MPH, FACSM, chief medical officer of
Lore Health
and past president of both the
American College of Sports Medicine
and the
Female and Male Athlete Triad Coalition
, tells SELF.
For some exercisers, cycle syncing is less about following a strict plan and more about tuning into your body’s needs.
Meaghan Moran
, a holistic health coach and personal trainer, for example, tells SELF that she’s been cycle syncing for about two years. She doesn’t follow a firm schedule but says she’s become aware of how each phase impacts her mood, body, and mental capacity and lets that guide her workouts. She prioritizes gentler movement during menstruation and the late-luteal phase while increasing the intensity as she gets closer to ovulation.
How legit are the benefits?
Some people on social media who cycle sync their workouts anecdotally say it’s helped them with everything from
acne and PMS symptoms
to
reducing inflammation, “balancing” hormones
, and
seeing more significant workout results
. Sounds awesome, right? But it’s important not to oversell the method’s impact because, right now, we just don’t have the research to validate these or any other potential benefits.
“Though there may be some rationale for the approach, it’s not supported by current high-quality evidence,”
Sara Rosenkranz, PhD
, exercise physiologist and associate professor in kinesiology and nutrition sciences at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, tells SELF.
In fact, from a workout performance perspective, most research suggests that the menstrual cycle
doesn’t
significantly impact muscle strength or endurance, Dr. Choi says. Two recent reviews—one published in
Frontiers in Sports and Active Living
and another in
Sports Medicine
—analyzed the available studies on the topic and concluded that there isn’t enough evidence to support the idea that monthly hormone fluctuations affect acute fitness or long-term training results. And any actual observed difference likely isn’t dramatic enough to warrant changing your whole workout routine if you’re not a pro athlete. “Since any potential gains related to menstrual cycle training are relatively small, this is more likely to benefit elite athletes, where seconds count, to a greater extent than recreationally active women,” Dr. Joy says.
All that said, even if factoring your cycle into your workout routine doesn’t magically help you gain muscle or
run a faster 5K
, it could come with other perks, like making you feel good or fostering a more intuitive relationship with fitness. “Becoming more attuned to menstrual-cycle-related symptoms and how they affect and interact with physical activity is important,” Dr. Joy says. At a minimum, it gives you the opportunity to adjust your training type or exercise intensity, but it may also encourage you to modify other behaviors that support training, like diet, hydration, and sleep.
Moran, for example, used to do primarily
high-intensity workouts
and was left feeling exhausted. Since switching to cycle syncing, she says she’s felt a deeper connection to her body and has learned to focus on workouts that make her feel her best—even if they’re more low-key than she was used to. “I started slow by just doing walking, stretching, or yoga during my period and felt how positively my body reacted to the break during that time of the month,” she says. With cycle syncing, she has noticed an improvement in her PMS and finds that she’s “less irritable before and during menstruation.”
Are there any downsides?
Cycle syncing isn’t likely to cause any real harm, but there are a few potential drawbacks. First, “we certainly do not want to imply that people should limit their physical activity during certain phases of the menstrual cycle,” Dr. Joy says—especially considering
less than a quarter of US adults
get enough exercise according to federal guidelines. If you follow the above cycle-syncing recommendations, you might find it’s difficult to meet the recommendations set by the
Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans
, which call for 150 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity and at least two days of muscle-strengthening work per week.
To that point, the generic cycle-syncing script could also lead you to skip out on workouts or reduce intensity when you don’t need to. “It’s well-established that exercise can be safe and effective at any point during the menstrual cycle,” Dr. Rosenkranz says.
Plus the additional layers of tracking and planning could make this approach to training feel overly complicated, Dr. Rosenkranz says. Maybe even enough so that it messes with a
well-established fitness routine
that’s been working for you. The reality is that it can already be difficult to squeeze consistent workouts into a busy schedule, fit in the ideal mix of strength, cardio, and
mobility work
, and progress toward goals like running a marathon or building muscle. Adding cycle syncing on top of this can be unrealistic or make your fitness routine feel like more of a chore than it should be.
How to try cycle syncing
The single most important thing to consider when choosing an exercise program is that it’s specific to your individual needs, Dr. Rosenkranz says. If you want to give cycle syncing a go, follow these steps to tailor it to you.
1. Start by tracking your menstrual cycle.
First, you’ll need to start tracking your cycle using a
period tracking app
or other method, Dr. Joy says. (If you’re not comfortable putting your information into an app, you can use an old-fashioned paper calendar or journal.) Don’t just mark the days of your period; also take note of symptoms and energy levels throughout a few entire cycles to gain insight into how the phases may affect your training, Dr. Rosenkranz says.
2. Play with your workouts and see what happens.
Start experimenting with workout adjustments based on the info you’ve collected during the last few cycles, noting how you’re feeling (energy, mood, motivation) and performing (i.e., strength or endurance), Dr. Joy says. Over time, you might notice that you struggle with high-intensity workouts the day before your period or that moderate cardio feels great at any time of the month. Rather than basing your routine around your cycle, use what you’ve learned about your cycle to modify your workouts as needed.
3. Consider other lifestyle habits.
In addition to the changes that happen with your menstrual cycle, many other factors can impact your workout experience and performance. “For example, sleep can have profound effects on training, as can nutrition and where you are in your training program,” Dr. Rosenkranz says. Your goals, stress levels, injuries, and illnesses are all other reasons that you may need to modify your workouts day-to-day. “Listening to your own body—especially signs like energy levels, mood, and physical comfort—is often the most effective way to guide workout adjustments,” Dr. Choi says.
The takeaway on cycle-syncing workouts
If you’d like to use your menstrual cycle to guide your workout programming, that’s your prerogative. It could help you gain awareness of how monthly changes affect your motivation and performance or encourage you to scale back when you need it. The potential risks are that universal cycle-syncing advice may not take your individuality into consideration, and it could unnecessarily complicate your planning or keep you from your full training potential.
Cycle syncing isn’t a cure-all, and it’s essential to be skeptical of anything with purported benefits that sound too good to be true. Still, there’s some real value at the heart of it: When it comes to working out, listening to your body and honoring its needs is always a winning approach.

If you get a period, you may have noticed that your body feels…different…at various points in your
monthly cycle
. Some days, you might feel charged up and ready to go, while others you’re moving in slow motion. It would make sense that this ebb and flow might impact how you show up to tackle your fitness routine too. That’s the idea behind cycle-syncing workouts, or the practice of changing up your exercise routine according to what phase you’re at in your menstrual cycle.
In theory, it seems solid: If hormones change throughout the month, why shouldn’t your
workouts
? Advocates of the practice say it comes with a range of benefits, from improving performance and recovery to decreasing
cycle-related symptoms
and
fatigue
. Some professional athletes (like
Ironman World Champion Laura Philipp
) have spoken publicly about factoring their cycle into training, and even the US Women’s National Team, led by sports scientist Dawn Scott,
famously leveraged it
en route to their 2019 World Cup win. Over the last few years, the concept has become a trendy wellness topic, even prompting dedicated cycle-syncing apps, workout programs from
Nike
,
Obé
, and
Alo Moves
, and tens of thousands of
posts on TikTok
.
The thing is, the science isn’t quite there, and as a result experts aren’t exactly jumping to endorse it. Curious about cycle syncing? Here’s everything you need to know.
What a cycle-synced workout routine might look like
The menstrual cycle can be divided into two main phases: follicular, the first half of the cycle when you menstruate and an ovary gets ready to release an egg; and luteal, the second half when your body prepares for a potential pregnancy.
Ovulation
is essentially the turning point in between,
Janet Choi, MD
, a double-board certified reproductive endocrinologist and ob-gyn and the chief medical officer of Progyny, tells SELF.
In the context of cycle syncing, many people break the menstrual cycle down into four distinct parts: menstruation, follicular, ovulation, and luteal. Cycle-based workout routines hinge on the changes that happen during each phase to guide
exercise intensity
throughout the month. Because the method isn’t yet supported by a lot of science, the recommendations on how to sync your workouts to your cycle vary. In general, proponents of the practice suggest something like this:
Menstruation (~Day 1–5): Light workouts like walking, stretching, mobility, and active recovery.
Menstruation (i.e., your period) happens at the beginning of the follicular phase, and it’s characterized by low hormone levels, particularly estradiol (a type of estrogen), Dr. Choi says. As a result, during this time, you may experience fatigue and decreased energy. You may also deal with period-related symptoms like cramps, nausea, or headaches, which could keep you from wanting to do high-intensity workouts or going all-out in the gym.
Follicular (~Day 5–14): Moderate-to-high-intensity workouts, like running, dance cardio, or weight lifting.
After your period ends and the follicular phase progresses, estradiol levels slowly rise, Dr. Choi says. You might find yourself with more and more energy as you approach ovulation, making it a potentially good time to ramp up your workout intensity.
Ovulatory (~Day 14): High-energy or strenuous workouts, like running, dance cardio, or weight lifting.
Hormone levels, including estradiol, peak around ovulation, Dr. Choi says. At this point in the cycle, many menstruators notice increased energy, improved mood, and heightened creativity, she says—in theory, making it a great time to challenge yourself and go for that PR.
Luteal (~Day 14–28): Somewhat gentler exercise, like Pilates, yoga, walking, or steady-state cardio.
“Following ovulation, estrogen levels start to decline while progesterone levels rise, peaking about a week post-ovulation,” Dr. Choi says. During this phase—and especially as you approach your next period and deal with potential PMS symptoms—you may experience lower energy, sleep disturbances, and possible mood changes, Dr. Choi says. For this reason, you may feel like dialing back on your workout intensity at this time.
An important caveat: Though a
28-day cycle
is considered “typical,” menstrual cycles can vary from person to person and month to month. In fact, one
2019 study
of more than 600,000 menstrual cycles found that only 13% were 28 days long and that, for the majority of menstruators, ovulation didn’t occur on day 14. Not to mention, if you use
hormonal contraception
, these same fluctuations don’t apply since it interrupts normal hormonal cycling, Liz Joy, MD, MPH, FACSM, chief medical officer of
Lore Health
and past president of both the
American College of Sports Medicine
and the
Female and Male Athlete Triad Coalition
, tells SELF.
For some exercisers, cycle syncing is less about following a strict plan and more about tuning into your body’s needs.
Meaghan Moran
, a holistic health coach and personal trainer, for example, tells SELF that she’s been cycle syncing for about two years. She doesn’t follow a firm schedule but says she’s become aware of how each phase impacts her mood, body, and mental capacity and lets that guide her workouts. She prioritizes gentler movement during menstruation and the late-luteal phase while increasing the intensity as she gets closer to ovulation.
How legit are the benefits?
Some people on social media who cycle sync their workouts anecdotally say it’s helped them with everything from
acne and PMS symptoms
to
reducing inflammation, “balancing” hormones
, and
seeing more significant workout results
. Sounds awesome, right? But it’s important not to oversell the method’s impact because, right now, we just don’t have the research to validate these or any other potential benefits.
“Though there may be some rationale for the approach, it’s not supported by current high-quality evidence,”
Sara Rosenkranz, PhD
, exercise physiologist and associate professor in kinesiology and nutrition sciences at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, tells SELF.
In fact, from a workout performance perspective, most research suggests that the menstrual cycle
doesn’t
significantly impact muscle strength or endurance, Dr. Choi says. Two recent reviews—one published in
Frontiers in Sports and Active Living
and another in
Sports Medicine
—analyzed the available studies on the topic and concluded that there isn’t enough evidence to support the idea that monthly hormone fluctuations affect acute fitness or long-term training results. And any actual observed difference likely isn’t dramatic enough to warrant changing your whole workout routine if you’re not a pro athlete. “Since any potential gains related to menstrual cycle training are relatively small, this is more likely to benefit elite athletes, where seconds count, to a greater extent than recreationally active women,” Dr. Joy says.
All that said, even if factoring your cycle into your workout routine doesn’t magically help you gain muscle or
run a faster 5K
, it could come with other perks, like making you feel good or fostering a more intuitive relationship with fitness. “Becoming more attuned to menstrual-cycle-related symptoms and how they affect and interact with physical activity is important,” Dr. Joy says. At a minimum, it gives you the opportunity to adjust your training type or exercise intensity, but it may also encourage you to modify other behaviors that support training, like diet, hydration, and sleep.
Moran, for example, used to do primarily
high-intensity workouts
and was left feeling exhausted. Since switching to cycle syncing, she says she’s felt a deeper connection to her body and has learned to focus on workouts that make her feel her best—even if they’re more low-key than she was used to. “I started slow by just doing walking, stretching, or yoga during my period and felt how positively my body reacted to the break during that time of the month,” she says. With cycle syncing, she has noticed an improvement in her PMS and finds that she’s “less irritable before and during menstruation.”
Are there any downsides?
Cycle syncing isn’t likely to cause any real harm, but there are a few potential drawbacks. First, “we certainly do not want to imply that people should limit their physical activity during certain phases of the menstrual cycle,” Dr. Joy says—especially considering
less than a quarter of US adults
get enough exercise according to federal guidelines. If you follow the above cycle-syncing recommendations, you might find it’s difficult to meet the recommendations set by the
Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans
, which call for 150 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity and at least two days of muscle-strengthening work per week.
To that point, the generic cycle-syncing script could also lead you to skip out on workouts or reduce intensity when you don’t need to. “It’s well-established that exercise can be safe and effective at any point during the menstrual cycle,” Dr. Rosenkranz says.
Plus the additional layers of tracking and planning could make this approach to training feel overly complicated, Dr. Rosenkranz says. Maybe even enough so that it messes with a
well-established fitness routine
that’s been working for you. The reality is that it can already be difficult to squeeze consistent workouts into a busy schedule, fit in the ideal mix of strength, cardio, and
mobility work
, and progress toward goals like running a marathon or building muscle. Adding cycle syncing on top of this can be unrealistic or make your fitness routine feel like more of a chore than it should be.

2. Play with your workouts and see what happens.

Holding asanas in a heated class can be tricky, especially when you’re dealing with clingy clothes and
stinging sweat in your eyes
while trying not to slip—which is why finding the best mat for hot yoga is essential to keeping you stable and safe. The ideal pick will help you feel “zoned in on your practice to the point where you’re not focusing on your mat,” Erin Archibald, a registered yoga instructor with CorePower Yoga in Denver, tells SELF.
But shopping for one that doesn’t slip or bunch up as you move and perspire isn’t as simple as grabbing the first option you see on the shelf. To help you track down the right hot yoga mat for your practice, we spoke with instructors and scrolled through tons of reviews from shoppers. Browse our firm, supportive, and highly grippy favorites below.

How to choose a hot yoga mat
Grip

A grippy mat will reduce your chances of slipping and sliding as things get hot and sweaty in class. Look for rubber options, says Archibald—natural rubber (over synthetic) tends to be higher quality. Cork is also a naturally grippy material.
Absorbency
AccordionItemContainerButton
LargeChevron
Porous mats with an open-cell design can better absorb your sweat and won’t create a slipping hazard with any puddles, Archibald says. Many open-cell mats are constructed with natural rubber.
Just keep in mind: You’ll want to regularly clean them, so they don’t get stinky. If you prefer an option that’s easier to sanitize, go for a closed-cell, nonporous design that can be wiped down, Levey says. With these mats, you may also want to use a yoga towel for extra traction (we’ve included some of our favorites below).
Thickness
AccordionItemContainerButton
LargeChevron
Yoga mats come in a wide range of thicknesses, and the right amount of padding boils down to your personal preference. You might feel more stable for balancing poses on a thinner mat, while a thicker one will provide more cushion for your joints. Generally, Archibald recommends a thinner option (three to five millimeters tall) for hot yoga for a more grounded feeling, and a thicker mat (above five millimeters) for slower-paced styles like yin or
restorative
.
Size
AccordionItemContainerButton

Standard yoga mats are 26 by 71 inches, which works well for most folks, Archibald says. If you’re taller (say, over six foot two), then you may feel more comfortable on a wider, longer version, Levey says.
Durability

Yoga mats are difficult to recycle, so it’s important to look for one that can last you for several years of practice,

Jacquelyn recommends picking a darker mat for hot yoga, as light ones can show sweat stains. “Your instinct might be to select something you simply enjoy looking at, but also consider that you'll be sweating a large amount on the surface of the mat, and that impacts discoloration over time,” she says.
Other equipment that’s useful for hot yoga
Your yoga practice and gear can be as simple or souped up as you want it to be. You might want a set of yoga blocks to help you maintain proper alignment or modify poses, straps to help you get into your stretches or deepen them, and bolsters to support your knees or hips. Another nice-to-have: a
yoga mat bag
or carrying strap (if your mat doesn’t come with one), to make heading to and from class a little easier.

Lululemon
Pros
Absorbs sweat
Reversible
Well-cushioned
Antimicrobial
Cons
On the pricey side
A favorite among many of the experts we spoke to, this
2022 SELF Home Fitness Award winner
has a rubber base and a grippy top layer to keep you grounded. Plus, it’s sweat-absorbing: “I always feel very stable and rooted when I’m practicing on a Lulu mat,” says Archibald, who has been using hers for over three years.
If you alternate between vinyasa and hot yoga, you’ll love The Mat’s reversible design—you can choose to use the high-traction side or the more cushioned side, depending on the class you’re in. It’s even sturdy enough for other activities, like
HIIT workouts
,
Sarah Larson Levey,
a registered yoga instructor and cofounder of Y7 Studio in NYC, tells SELF, making it a great pick for beginners who want the most bang for their buck.
Need a thinner surface for even greater stability? There’s also a
3mm option
available.

This mat comes in two sizes and is “very grippy, supportive, and stable,” Archibald says. The closed-cell construction seals out moisture and bacteria, making it easy to wipe down and disinfect. Slightly thicker than Lululemon’s The Mat at six millimeters high, the Manduka Pro is great for folks wanting extra cushioning for their joints. Customers describe the Manduka Pro as worth the investment—although it
is
pretty pricey, it does come with a

Best No-Slip Grip: JadeYoga Harmony Mat

Harmony Yoga Mat
$92

Public Lands
Pros
Solid traction
Sweat-absorbing
Very supportive
Cons
Hard to clean
While all of the mats on this list have good traction, the Harmony Mat has a unique texture that our experts confirm sets it apart from the pack. Described by Levey as “wonderful,” this natural rubber mat provides ample cushioning. Archibald finds it to be very grippy and incredibly supportive, and she likes the porous sweat-absorbing surface—it provides a “grittier” feel compared to other mats, she says.
The one downside: It can be tricky to clean. “It’s definitely not something that you can just wipe down with a towel,” Levey says. To thoroughly sanitize it, she recommends using
JadeYoga’s mat cleaner
.

Pros

Firm feel
Very lightweight
Cons
Some Amazon reviewers report that it doesn’t lay completely flat
“Cork is a natural and non-slip surface that responds even better when wet, which means you're safe to sweat,” Jacquelyn says. “It dries quickly too.”
This super lightweight cork mat from Gaiam is five millimeters thick, like many other options on this list, and pretty budget-friendly (it’s often on sale for under $30). Another bonus: The bottom is coated in thermoplastic elastomer (TPE), so it won’t shift around on the floor underneath you. “I actually love this mat more than any mat I’ve ever had,” one happy Amazon shopper wrote. “It doesn’t smell weird, I don’t slip, and I don’t need to use a towel on my mat during practice. 10/10 for me.”

Pros
Soaks up sweat quickly
Available in multiple sizes
Cons
A bit heavy
This high-quality Manduka mat wins points from Jacquelyn for being “extremely sturdy,” no matter how much you sweat. The material allows moisture to pass through the top layer of the mat to the foam interior, making it majorly absorbent. (You won’t be stepping in any puddles during downward dog with this one.)
“The grip will hold you in place, and the company provides
services
you can utilize at the end of the mat’s life to make sure it doesn't end up in a landfill,” Jacquelyn adds—a win if you’re looking for a more eco-friendly pick.

Cons

Not super padded
JadeYoga’s textured Elite S mat is designed to withstand
lots
of use—and Jacquelyn says it lives up to the hype, especially for hot yoga (it has a similar feel to the Jade Harmony). “The Jade grip is truly the best in the business, and this mat is built to last through years of rigorous practice,” she says.
A dense top layer adds firmness and protects against scuffs, making the Elite S a great choice for flowing practices with lots of transitions or mat workouts like
Pilates
. “I bought it in December 2011, and am still comfortable 12 years after,” one JadeYoga reviewer wrote. Jacquelyn also likes supporting JadeYoga for their sustainability efforts: The company plants a tree for every mat purchased.

Pros

Cons

Less cushioned
These eye-catching mats from Reetual will add some joy—and stability—to your hot yoga practice. Made with a padded, tacky rubber base to prevent slippage and a top layer that gets grippier the more you sweat (since moisture helps increase the traction), they’re both fun and functional.
Amazon reviewers describe them as “stunning” and “beautiful,” and praise the fact that “there’s absolutely no slipping,” even in the sweatiest conditions. This mat is slightly smaller than average and it’s also on the thinner side, so it may not be right for taller folks or those who prefer extra cushioning for their joints. But fans of firmness who hate sinking into their mat might want to give it a try.

For a high-quality mat at a lower price point, consider this pick from Gaiam. The textured surface wicks moisture away, while the padding “made hot yoga a lot easier!” per one Amazon reviewer, who said they were able push their feet into the mat for added stability. They also recommended using it with a towel to remove any sweat, since it wicks moisture rather than absorbing it.
FYI: This mat is smaller than standard size, so tall folks may consider opting for a different pick on this list.

This mat is a bigger investment, but reviewers say it’s well worth the higher price. It’s slightly larger than average and made from biodegradable rubber, which makes it a “durable and perfectly sticky mat,” according to one Amazon reviewer. Another shared that they “don’t even need a mat towel with it, since the grip is so great.”
Customers also praise the mat’s alignment system—basically, a series of markings on the mat that help you understand where to place your hands and feet as you practice. Oh, and t comes with a nifty carrying bag too.

Best hot yoga towels
If you knowing you’re going to break a sweat, it’s a good idea to bring a towel to wipe your hands, face, or mat during class. You don’t need anything special, though. “To be truthful, mat towels are not a necessity when you buy a mat already built to withstand sweat,” says Jacquelyn. “But when I do use a towel in yoga, I opt for small hand towels in a heated vinyasa session or big beach towels in a true hot yoga (Bikram) class. These are likely towels you already have on hand, so start there!”
Looking for something you can use just for yoga? Here are a few she recommends.
Manduka eQua Yoga Hand Towel

You can place this lightweight microfiber towel near your mat to keep sweaty hands at bay or lay it on your mat under your face to catch any drips. “It's easy to throw in a yoga bag and dries quickly, so I end up using it for up to three to four sessions,” says Jacquelyn. “It’s great for wiping your face or even covering your eyes in savasana!”

A large, mat-sized towel like this one (with a textured bottom) can transform a regular yoga mat into a grippy hot yoga mat. It’ll also help absorb moisture during seriously heated classes. “This is the towel I use for super sweaty Bikram yoga sessions,” says Jacquelyn. “I've had the same pink Yogitoes for over 13 years and it still works perfectly. I trust the brand and love the anti-slip silicone nubs!”

Holding asanas in a heated class can be tricky, especially when you’re dealing with clingy clothes and
stinging sweat in your eyes
while trying not to slip—which is why finding the best mat for hot yoga is essential to keeping you stable and safe. The ideal pick will help you feel “zoned in on your practice to the point where you’re not focusing on your mat,” Erin Archibald, a registered yoga instructor with CorePower Yoga in Denver, tells SELF.
But shopping for one that doesn’t slip or bunch up as you move and perspire isn’t as simple as grabbing the first option you see on the shelf. To help you track down the right hot yoga mat for your practice, we spoke with instructors and scrolled through tons of reviews from shoppers. Browse our firm, supportive, and highly grippy favorites below.

A grippy mat will reduce your chances of slipping and sliding as things get hot and sweaty in class. Look for rubber options, says Archibald—natural rubber (over synthetic) tends to be higher quality. Cork is also a naturally grippy material.

Porous mats with an open-cell design can better absorb your sweat and won’t create a slipping hazard with any puddles, Archibald says. Many open-cell mats are constructed with natural rubber.
Just keep in mind: You’ll want to regularly clean them, so they don’t get stinky. If you prefer an option that’s easier to sanitize, go for a closed-cell, nonporous design that can be wiped down, Levey says. With these mats, you may also want to use a yoga towel for extra traction (we’ve included some of our favorites below).
Thickness
AccordionItemContainerButton
LargeChevron
Yoga mats come in a wide range of thicknesses, and the right amount of padding boils down to your personal preference. You might feel more stable for balancing poses on a thinner mat, while a thicker one will provide more cushion for your joints. Generally, Archibald recommends a thinner option (three to five millimeters tall) for hot yoga for a more grounded feeling, and a thicker mat (above five millimeters) for slower-paced styles like yin or
restorative
.
Size
AccordionItemContainerButton

Standard yoga mats are 26 by 71 inches, which works well for most folks, Archibald says. If you’re taller (say, over six foot two), then you may feel more comfortable on a wider, longer version, Levey says.
Durability
AccordionItemContainerButton
LargeChevron
Yoga mats are difficult to recycle, so it’s important to look for one that can last you for several years of practice,
Talon Jacquelyn
, a registered yoga teacher and meditation coach at Talon J Yoga, tells SELF. As you shop, look for reviews from shoppers that speak to the mat’s longevity.
Color
AccordionItemContainerButton
LargeChevron
Jacquelyn recommends picking a darker mat for hot yoga, as light ones can show sweat stains. “Your instinct might be to select something you simply enjoy looking at, but also consider that you'll be sweating a large amount on the surface of the mat, and that impacts discoloration over time,” she says.
Other equipment that’s useful for hot yoga
Your yoga practice and gear can be as simple or souped up as you want it to be. You might want a set of yoga blocks to help you maintain proper alignment or modify poses, straps to help you get into your stretches or deepen them, and bolsters to support your knees or hips. Another nice-to-have: a
yoga mat bag
or carrying strap (if your mat doesn’t come with one), to make heading to and from class a little easier.

Pros

Cons
On the pricey side
A favorite among many of the experts we spoke to, this
2022 SELF Home Fitness Award winner
has a rubber base and a grippy top layer to keep you grounded. Plus, it’s sweat-absorbing: “I always feel very stable and rooted when I’m practicing on a Lulu mat,” says Archibald, who has been using hers for over three years.
If you alternate between vinyasa and hot yoga, you’ll love The Mat’s reversible design—you can choose to use the high-traction side or the more cushioned side, depending on the class you’re in. It’s even sturdy enough for other activities, like
HIIT workouts
,
Sarah Larson Levey,
a registered yoga instructor and cofounder of Y7 Studio in NYC, tells SELF, making it a great pick for beginners who want the most bang for their buck.
Need a thinner surface for even greater stability? There’s also a

Public Lands
Pros
Solid traction
Sweat-absorbing
Very supportive
Cons
Hard to clean
While all of the mats on this list have good traction, the Harmony Mat has a unique texture that our experts confirm sets it apart from the pack. Described by Levey as “wonderful,” this natural rubber mat provides ample cushioning. Archibald finds it to be very grippy and incredibly supportive, and she likes the porous sweat-absorbing surface—it provides a “grittier” feel compared to other mats, she says.
The one downside: It can be tricky to clean. “It’s definitely not something that you can just wipe down with a towel,” Levey says. To thoroughly sanitize it, she recommends using
JadeYoga’s mat cleaner

“Cork is a natural and non-slip surface that responds even better when wet, which means you're safe to sweat,” Jacquelyn says. “It dries quickly too.”
This super lightweight cork mat from Gaiam is five millimeters thick, like many other options on this list, and pretty budget-friendly (it’s often on sale for under $30). Another bonus: The bottom is coated in thermoplastic elastomer (TPE), so it won’t shift around on the floor underneath you. “I actually love this mat more than any mat I’ve ever had,” one happy Amazon shopper wrote. “It doesn’t smell weird, I don’t slip, and I don’t need to use a towel on my mat during practice. 10/10 for me.”

Pros

Cons
A bit heavy
This high-quality Manduka mat wins points from Jacquelyn for being “extremely sturdy,” no matter how much you sweat. The material allows moisture to pass through the top layer of the mat to the foam interior, making it majorly absorbent. (You won’t be stepping in any puddles during downward dog with this one.)
“The grip will hold you in place, and the company provides
services
you can utilize at the end of the mat’s life to make sure it doesn't end up in a landfill,” Jacquelyn adds—a win if you’re looking for a more eco-friendly pick.

JadeYoga’s textured Elite S mat is designed to withstand

A dense top layer adds firmness and protects against scuffs, making the Elite S a great choice for flowing practices with lots of transitions or mat workouts like
Pilates
. “I bought it in December 2011, and am still comfortable 12 years after,” one JadeYoga reviewer wrote. Jacquelyn also likes supporting JadeYoga for their sustainability efforts: The company plants a tree for every mat purchased.

Pros

Cons

Less cushioned
These eye-catching mats from Reetual will add some joy—and stability—to your hot yoga practice. Made with a padded, tacky rubber base to prevent slippage and a top layer that gets grippier the more you sweat (since moisture helps increase the traction), they’re both fun and functional.
Amazon reviewers describe them as “stunning” and “beautiful,” and praise the fact that “there’s absolutely no slipping,” even in the sweatiest conditions. This mat is slightly smaller than average and it’s also on the thinner side, so it may not be right for taller folks or those who prefer extra cushioning for their joints. But fans of firmness who hate sinking into their mat might want to give it a try.

They also recommended using it with a towel to remove any sweat, since it wicks moisture rather than absorbing it.

Another shared that they “don’t even need a mat towel with it, since the grip is so great.”
Customers also praise the mat’s alignment system—basically, a series of markings on the mat that help you understand where to place your hands and feet as you practice. Oh, and t comes with a nifty carrying bag too.

Best hot yoga towels
If you knowing you’re going to break a sweat, it’s a good idea to bring a towel to wipe your hands, face, or mat during class. You don’t need anything special, though. “To be truthful, mat towels are not a necessity when you buy a mat already built to withstand sweat,” says Jacquelyn. “But when I do use a towel in yoga, I opt for small hand towels in a heated vinyasa session or big beach towels in a true hot yoga (Bikram) class. These are likely towels you already have on hand, so start there!”
Looking for something you can use just for yoga? Here are a few she recommends.

You can place this lightweight microfiber towel near your mat to keep sweaty hands at bay or lay it on your mat under your face to catch any drips. “It's easy to throw in a yoga bag and dries quickly, so I end up using it for up to three to four sessions,” says Jacquelyn. “It’s great for wiping your face or even covering your eyes in savasana!”

A large, mat-sized towel like this one (with a textured bottom) can transform a regular yoga mat into a grippy hot yoga mat. It’ll also help absorb moisture during seriously heated classes. “This is the towel I use for super sweaty Bikram yoga sessions,” says Jacquelyn. “I've had the same pink Yogitoes for over 13 years and it still works perfectly. I trust the brand and love the anti-slip silicone nubs!”

Training for a race? Looking to get some steps in as you listen to a podcast
or audiobook
? No matter your fitness goals, the best treadmills can help you get moving, even when the weather outside is less than ideal (read: cold, rainy, snowy, or icy). “I’m a strong proponent of using the tools that you have to best get your workouts in [safely],”
Katherine Wuestenfeld
, a NASM-certified personal trainer and RRCA-certified run coach in Chicago, tells SELF.
Having a treadmill at home also helps nip any “I’ll just do it tomorrow” excuses in the bud: As
Allison Gruber, PhD
, an associate professor of kinesiology at Indiana University Bloomington who uses her treadmill to work out safely before sunrise, previously told SELF, “whatever can keep you running, do it.”
Knowing which one to buy, however, isn’t always easy. To help you navigate a sea of seemingly similar options, we’re here with expert tips and insights from SELF testers. Shop our favorite treadmills for almost any space and fitness goals below.

Is using a treadmill as effective as running outside?
Running offers a
ton of benefits
—like improving your heart health, boosting your mood, helping you sleep, and more—and using a treadmill can help you access all of them safely. “When I trained for the 2019 Boston Marathon, we had a really snowy and icy winter in the months leading up to the race,” Wuestenfeld says, noting the conditions forced her to do a lot of her training indoors on a treadmill. “I ended up still setting a PR at the race, so I think that's a testament to the power of treadmill training and how effective it can be.” She also likes
training for long runs
on a treadmill so she can practice effectively fueling herself—staying indoors offers easy access to water and gels, she says.
Treadmills can help you brush up on specific skills too. A machine with incline and decline settings will allow you to practice running up and down hills if you live in a flat area, while speed controls take the guesswork out of sprints or interval runs.
The pros add that you’ll see the most benefits if you use your treadmill regularly. “If you’re running consistently on a treadmill, it’s absolutely effective,”
Erin Molloy
, an RRCA-certified run coach in Brooklyn, tells SELF. “It’s all about what keeps you motivated and moving.”
What features should you look for in a treadmill for your home gym?
As you sift through our top picks, here’s what to keep in mind to help you pick the right treadmill for your space.
Size
AccordionItemContainerButton
LargeChevron
Before you start shopping, measure your space to make sure a treadmill will fit. Leave several feet of room behind the machine (
in case you fall
) and make sure your ceiling is high enough to accommodate the height of everyone who will use the machine, says Wuestenfeld.
Speed
AccordionItemContainerButton
LargeChevron
The top speeds of the treadmills on this list range from 3.7 to 12.5 miles per hour (mph). “I would look at the top end speed that a treadmill offers as it relates to your own personal top-end speed,” says Wuestenfeld. She also recommends testing the treadmill out in person at higher speeds so you can see how stable it feels (but if you’re shopping online, you can usually find this information in the treadmill’s reviews).
Incline
AccordionItemContainerButton
LargeChevron
Some of our picks can incline and decline from -3% to 15%—others don’t tilt at all. Consider where you like to run and how much you want to switch up your workouts: “Incline ability is helpful for simulating hills that you would encounter outdoors,” says Wuestenfeld.
Motor
AccordionItemContainerButton
LargeChevron
Most treadmill motors have continuous horsepower (CHP) or horsepower (HP). CHP describes how the motor will perform over time, while HP refers to the maximum power the treadmill is capable of reaching (but doesn’t tell you for how long). This makes CHP a more reliable measurement of a treadmill’s juice. If you’re a runner, look for a machine that has at least 3.0 CHP. Anything lower than that is better for walking or light jogging. (Note: Not all brands on this list share their treadmills’s CHP or HP.)
Programming
AccordionItemContainerButton
LargeChevron
"Many treadmills offer programming these days, either with virtual coaches, like Peloton or iFit, or with pre-programmed workouts on the treadmill itself,” says Wuestenfeld. Just keep in mind that you may need to pay extra for a membership to unlock guided workouts and classes.
How we picked the best treadmills
We sourced our winners by scouring thousands of reviews online and asking fitness experts for their shopping advice and personal favorites. We also kept important details in mind as we built this list, including size, speed range, programming capability, and price. SELF staffers even tested some of these treadmills themselves, as part of our
Fitness Awards
. Whether you’re
training for a marathon
or walking at a standing desk while you work, we have you covered with reliable options from brands like NordicTrack, Peloton, Echelon, and more.

Pros
Large touchscreen pivots for off-tread workouts
Can incline and decline
High weight capacity
Features SmartAdjust capabilities, so you can focus on your workout
Cushioned running deck is designed to absorb impact
Cons
iFit workouts require a separate membership
A pricier option
This 2024 SELF Home Fitness Award winner takes the gold for best treadmill overall because it’s high-tech, but still user-friendly. For $39 per month, you can stream more than 10,000 classes from
iFit
, a fitness coaching platform, on its large touchscreen (although you can also use it in manual mode, no membership required). During these workouts, the machine will automatically adjust your speed and incline to follow the instructor—no more fiddling with buttons mid-sweat session. And because the screen pivots, you can use it to follow off-tread yoga or strength training workouts too.
The 1750 also earns points for its cushioned running deck, strong 4.25 CHP motor, and auto-adjusting fan that speeds up or slows down to match the intensity of your workout. Although it’s pricey, we think it’s well worth the investment (especially if you sign up for iFit): You definitely “get what you pay for,” our tester, a marathon runner, confirmed.

Short on space, but still trying to set a new PR? The Echelon Stride-6 has a smaller footprint than other options on this list, but doesn’t compromise on the size of its running deck, speed, or incline settings. Our favorite feature, though, is how small it folds up, thanks to Echelon’s design that allows you to collapse the monitor, console, and arms down flat on top of the running deck.
From there, you can lift the machine vertically and use its transport wheels to tuck it up against a wall. Just a heads up: Echelon reviewers say that lifting the machine upright might be a two-person job.

With three zones of cushioning in the running deck, the Horizon 7.0 AT is a great choice for runners looking to save their joints. As
Kelly Bernadyn, CPT
, a Michigan-based group fitness instructor at Life Time clubs previously told SELF, treadmills with cushioned running decks make workouts a little easier on your body by offering extra shock absorption; it’s like
wearing an über-cushy sneaker
.
Gregory Moy, DPT
, a physical therapist in California, also told SELF that cushioned treadmills can be helpful for people with foot problems or “marathoners [and] ultramarathoners who are running 70 to 100 miles a week and need some time off from the hard pavement.”
Beyond cushioning, the Horizon 7.0 AT offers a broad range of incline settings; a dial to help you adjust your speed and incline quickly; and Bluetooth, Apple, and Samsung Galaxy connectivity.

Pros

Cons
Low weight capacity

Top speed and horsepower are pretty low
For a fraction of the price of some of our other top picks, this treadmill is a little bare bones (but still works great). While it can’t incline or decline, it’s very compact, with wheels and a folding mechanism to help you tuck it out of the way. Weighing around 70 pounds, it’s also easier to move around by yourself.
Amazon shoppers confirm that, even though it’s budget-friendly, it’s still well-made: “I bought this thinking it probably wouldn’t be very sturdy for its price,” one wrote. “I have been pleasantly surprised: Not only is it sturdy, but it's extremely quiet.”

Pros
Longest running belt on this list
Huge touchscreen that tilts
Vast, constantly growing library of live and recorded classes
Use it with or without the motor
Cons
Expensive
Doesn’t fold up
All-access membership costs an extra $44 per month
World-class programming, including a large, growing collection of live and pre-recorded trainer-led classes, give the Peloton Tread+ a special edge. “I really like the classes on my Peloton, as they provide a nice distraction from being inside and make my runs go by faster than if I was just staring at a blank screen,” says Wuestenfeld.
Classes aside, Wuestenfeld says the Tread+ also feels very well-made. “On other treadmills I've tried, when the speed gets below a seven-minute-mile pace, things get shaky, don't feel as smooth, and it doesn't always feel like a safe surface for running fast,” she says. “The Tread+ feels smooth on the slatted belt, even at faster speeds. The slatted belt is also a lot more cushioned than some of the really hard landing surfaces of other treadmills I've been on.”
If the Tread+ is out of your budget, check out the slightly cheaper
OG Tread
: While it has a different belt, a smaller screen, and can’t incline as much, we still think it’s a solid machine.

Pros
Folds up
Available in 5 colors
Lightweight and easy to move
Multiple ways to adjust the settings, including a remote control and smartphone app
Cons
Low weight capacity
Max speed only supports walking and light jogging
If you’re interested in adding movement to your work-from-home calls or TV binge-watching, an under-desk treadmill (sometimes also called
a walking pad
) might be up your alley—as SELF has previously reported, it offers many of the same benefits.
While this option from WalkingPad doesn’t incline and only reaches a max speed of 3.7 mph, it’s pretty lightweight at 55 pounds, making it easy to move between rooms. It also folds up, so you can stash it out of sight underneath a bed or couch. Another bonus: You can control it using the LED display panel at the top of the tread belt, the included remote, or even the
KS Fit
app on your phone, which is key for a machine that doesn’t have a console in arm’s reach.

Training for a race? Looking to get some steps in as you listen to a podcast
or audiobook
? No matter your fitness goals, the best treadmills can help you get moving, even when the weather outside is less than ideal (read: cold, rainy, snowy, or icy). “I’m a strong proponent of using the tools that you have to best get your workouts in [safely],”
Katherine Wuestenfeld
, a NASM-certified personal trainer and RRCA-certified run coach in Chicago, tells SELF.
Having a treadmill at home also helps nip any “I’ll just do it tomorrow” excuses in the bud: As
Allison Gruber, PhD
, an associate professor of kinesiology at Indiana University Bloomington who uses her treadmill to work out safely before sunrise, previously told SELF, “whatever can keep you running, do it.”
Knowing which one to buy, however, isn’t always easy. To help you navigate a sea of seemingly similar options, we’re here with expert tips and insights from SELF testers. Shop our favorite treadmills for almost any space and fitness goals below.

Is using a treadmill as effective as running outside?
Running offers a
ton of benefits
—like improving your heart health, boosting your mood, helping you sleep, and more—and using a treadmill can help you access all of them safely. “When I trained for the 2019 Boston Marathon, we had a really snowy and icy winter in the months leading up to the race,” Wuestenfeld says, noting the conditions forced her to do a lot of her training indoors on a treadmill. “I ended up still setting a PR at the race, so I think that's a testament to the power of treadmill training and how effective it can be.” She also likes
training for long runs
on a treadmill so she can practice effectively fueling herself—staying indoors offers easy access to water and gels, she says.
Treadmills can help you brush up on specific skills too. A machine with incline and decline settings will allow you to practice running up and down hills if you live in a flat area, while speed controls take the guesswork out of sprints or interval runs.
The pros add that you’ll see the most benefits if you use your treadmill regularly. “If you’re running consistently on a treadmill, it’s absolutely effective,”
Erin Molloy
, an RRCA-certified run coach in Brooklyn, tells SELF. “It’s all about what keeps you motivated and moving.”
What features should you look for in a treadmill for your home gym?
As you sift through our top picks, here’s what to keep in mind to help you pick the right treadmill for your space.
Size
AccordionItemContainerButton
LargeChevron
Before you start shopping, measure your space to make sure a treadmill will fit. Leave several feet of room behind the machine (
in case you fall
) and make sure your ceiling is high enough to accommodate the height of everyone who will use the machine, says Wuestenfeld.
Speed
AccordionItemContainerButton
LargeChevron
The top speeds of the treadmills on this list range from 3.7 to 12.5 miles per hour (mph). “I would look at the top end speed that a treadmill offers as it relates to your own personal top-end speed,” says Wuestenfeld. She also recommends testing the treadmill out in person at higher speeds so you can see how stable it feels (but if you’re shopping online, you can usually find this information in the treadmill’s reviews).
Incline
AccordionItemContainerButton
LargeChevron
Some of our picks can incline and decline from -3% to 15%—others don’t tilt at all. Consider where you like to run and how much you want to switch up your workouts: “Incline ability is helpful for simulating hills that you would encounter outdoors,” says Wuestenfeld.
Motor
AccordionItemContainerButton
LargeChevron
Most treadmill motors have continuous horsepower (CHP) or horsepower (HP). CHP describes how the motor will perform over time, while HP refers to the maximum power the treadmill is capable of reaching (but doesn’t tell you for how long). This makes CHP a more reliable measurement of a treadmill’s juice. If you’re a runner, look for a machine that has at least 3.0 CHP. Anything lower than that is better for walking or light jogging. (Note: Not all brands on this list share their treadmills’s CHP or HP.)
Programming
AccordionItemContainerButton
LargeChevron
"Many treadmills offer programming these days, either with virtual coaches, like Peloton or iFit, or with pre-programmed workouts on the treadmill itself,” says Wuestenfeld. Just keep in mind that you may need to pay extra for a membership to unlock guided workouts and classes.
How we picked the best treadmills
We sourced our winners by scouring thousands of reviews online and asking fitness experts for their shopping advice and personal favorites. We also kept important details in mind as we built this list, including size, speed range, programming capability, and price. SELF staffers even tested some of these treadmills themselves, as part of our
Fitness Awards
. Whether you’re
training for a marathon
or walking at a standing desk while you work, we have you covered with reliable options from brands like NordicTrack, Peloton, Echelon, and more.

NordicTrack
Pros
Large touchscreen pivots for off-tread workouts
Can incline and decline
High weight capacity
Features SmartAdjust capabilities, so you can focus on your workout
Cushioned running deck is designed to absorb impact
Cons
iFit workouts require a separate membership
A pricier option
This 2024 SELF Home Fitness Award winner takes the gold for best treadmill overall because it’s high-tech, but still user-friendly. For $39 per month, you can stream more than 10,000 classes from
iFit
, a fitness coaching platform, on its large touchscreen (although you can also use it in manual mode, no membership required). During these workouts, the machine will automatically adjust your speed and incline to follow the instructor—no more fiddling with buttons mid-sweat session. And because the screen pivots, you can use it to follow off-tread yoga or strength training workouts too.
The 1750 also earns points for its cushioned running deck, strong 4.25 CHP motor, and auto-adjusting fan that speeds up or slows down to match the intensity of your workout. Although it’s pricey, we think it’s well worth the investment (especially if you sign up for iFit): You definitely “get what you pay for,” our tester, a marathon runner, confirmed.

Echelon App
Short on space, but still trying to set a new PR? The Echelon Stride-6 has a smaller footprint than other options on this list, but doesn’t compromise on the size of its running deck, speed, or incline settings. Our favorite feature, though, is how small it folds up, thanks to Echelon’s design that allows you to collapse the monitor, console, and arms down flat on top of the running deck.
From there, you can lift the machine vertically and use its transport wheels to tuck it up against a wall. Just a heads up: Echelon reviewers say that lifting the machine upright might be a two-person job.

Cons
Horizon reviewers say assembly might be a two-person job
With three zones of cushioning in the running deck, the Horizon 7.0 AT is a great choice for runners looking to save their joints. As
Kelly Bernadyn, CPT
, a Michigan-based group fitness instructor at Life Time clubs previously told SELF, treadmills with cushioned running decks make workouts a little easier on your body by offering extra shock absorption; it’s like
wearing an über-cushy sneaker
.
Gregory Moy, DPT
, a physical therapist in California, also told SELF that cushioned treadmills can be helpful for people with foot problems or “marathoners [and] ultramarathoners who are running 70 to 100 miles a week and need some time off from the hard pavement.”
Beyond cushioning, the Horizon 7.0 AT offers a broad range of incline settings; a dial to help you adjust your speed and incline quickly; and Bluetooth, Apple, and Samsung Galaxy connectivity.

Designed with shock-absorbing cushioning in the deck that aims to reduce the impact on your body, you can expect to feel great during and after your workouts. Just know that if you’d like to take iFit classes on this one, you’ll need to spend an extra $39 each month on a subscription; if not, you’ll only be able to use the machine in manual mode.

Pros
Folds up and has wheels for easy storage
Much lighter than some other picks on this list
Amazon shoppers say it’s pretty quiet
Cons
Low weight capacity
Can’t incline or decline
Top speed and horsepower are pretty low
For a fraction of the price of some of our other top picks, this treadmill is a little bare bones (but still works great). While it can’t incline or decline, it’s very compact, with wheels and a folding mechanism to help you tuck it out of the way. Weighing around 70 pounds, it’s also easier to move around by yourself.
Amazon shoppers confirm that, even though it’s budget-friendly, it’s still well-made: “I bought this thinking it probably wouldn’t be very sturdy for its price,” one wrote. “I have been pleasantly surprised: Not only is it sturdy, but it's extremely quiet.”

Pros
Longest running belt on this list
Huge touchscreen that tilts
Vast, constantly growing library of live and recorded classes
Use it with or without the motor
Cons
Expensive
Doesn’t fold up
All-access membership costs an extra $44 per month
World-class programming, including a large, growing collection of live and pre-recorded trainer-led classes, give the Peloton Tread+ a special edge. “I really like the classes on my Peloton, as they provide a nice distraction from being inside and make my runs go by faster than if I was just staring at a blank screen,” says Wuestenfeld.
Classes aside, Wuestenfeld says the Tread+ also feels very well-made. “On other treadmills I've tried, when the speed gets below a seven-minute-mile pace, things get shaky, don't feel as smooth, and it doesn't always feel like a safe surface for running fast,” she says. “The Tread+ feels smooth on the slatted belt, even at faster speeds. The slatted belt is also a lot more cushioned than some of the really hard landing surfaces of other treadmills I've been on.”
If the Tread+ is out of your budget, check out the slightly cheaper
OG Tread
: While it has a different belt, a smaller screen, and can’t incline as much, we still think it’s a solid machine.

Pros
Folds up
Available in 5 colors
Lightweight and easy to move
Multiple ways to adjust the settings, including a remote control and smartphone app
Cons
Low weight capacity
Max speed only supports walking and light jogging
If you’re interested in adding movement to your work-from-home calls or TV binge-watching, an under-desk treadmill (sometimes also called
a walking pad
) might be up your alley—as SELF has previously reported, it offers many of the same benefits.
While this option from WalkingPad doesn’t incline and only reaches a max speed of 3.7 mph, it’s pretty lightweight at 55 pounds, making it easy to move between rooms. It also folds up, so you can stash it out of sight underneath a bed or couch. Another bonus: You can control it using the LED display panel at the top of the tread belt, the included remote, or even the
KS Fit
app on your phone, which is key for a machine that doesn’t have a console in arm’s reach.

4. Tracking Techniques and Technologies and Targeted Advertising
Tracking Techniques and Technologies
We and our third-party business partners use various tools and technologies such as cookies, pixels, localStorage, web beacons, software development kits, and similar technologies (collectively, “
Tracking Technologies
”) to collect data when you interact with our Products and Services, including our websites, mobile applications, and email communications. Some of these technologies store data in the browser or on your device. Other technologies may use network-related or other information to recognize your device (e.g., IP address).
Our Products and Services use Tracking Technologies, for example, when you first request a web page and data is then stored on your computer or other device so the website can access Personal Information when you make subsequent requests for pages from that Product or Service. These technologies may also be used to collect and store information about your usage of the Products and Services, such as pages you have visited, and Content you viewed or searched for. We may also use these technologies to save your preferences, consent, and choices; determine if you opened or interacted with our emails or newsletters; troubleshoot and resolve technical issues or outages; conduct research; deliver editorial Content and advertising; maintain subscription and registration information; and store information you may want to retrieve on a regular basis. Additionally, we may use these technologies to collect analytics and measure the use of our Products and Services.
The use of these Tracking Technologies helps us serve you better by understanding what you are interested in, track trends, measure the effectiveness of ads, conduct frequency capping, and tailor offers about our Products and Services to you. We also allow specific, approved third-party business partners and/or service providers, including Google Analytics, to collect data from your browser or device for Targeted Advertising, analytics, and measurement purposes using their own similar tools. For more information about Google Analytics including how to opt out, visit
How Google Uses Information
and to
Opt-out of Google Analytics

Targeted Advertising and Identity Resolution Partners
We and our third-party business partners may collect and share Personal Information about your online and offline activities over time and across unaffiliated websites and mobile applications to predict your preferences and interests, and, in conjunction with third parties, may use your Personal Information for cross-context behavioral advertising and to serve advertising believed to be of interest to you ("
Targeted Advertising
").
We may collaborate with our service providers and our third-party
Identity Resolution Partners
to deliver Targeted Advertising and identify the different devices and browsers you may use to access our Products and Services. We and these
Identity Resolution Partners
facilitate identity resolution by creating probabilistic and deterministic identifiers. These identifiers may use Personal Information, including your name, email address, phone number, and Activity and Device Information to generate an online identifier reasonably linkable to you and/or your device or browser.
For example, we may disclose hashed email address, phone number, or other information about your device to our Identity Resolution Partners, who may, in turn, return an online identifier that we may store in a first party cookie or similar technology and disclose to our advertising partners to provide you a more personalized advertising experience. These identifiers also help us with fraud detection and security, to enforce our User Agreement, verify user authentication for accessing Content behind a paywall, and to determine eligibility for offers available exclusively to new subscribers, among other things. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of our Identity Resolution Partners, which are separate from our own and which are not covered by this Privacy Policy. You can Opt-Out of Identity Resolution Partner LiveRamp’s use of your Personal Information for these purposes by visiting

Opting Out of a “Sale” or “Sharing” of Your Personal Information or of its Use for Targeted Advertising
section below.

We and our advertising partners may make inferences about your interests and these inferences may be used for Targeted Advertising. In certain U.S. states, these inferences may be considered Sensitive Personal Information. When we obtain this information from our third-party business partners, we will, where required by law, contractually ensure that they have obtained your consent or offered you an opportunity to opt out before sharing it with us. Similarly, if we collect Sensitive Personal Information directly from you, where required by law, we will obtain your consent, provide you an opportunity to opt out, or take other appropriate action.

When you picture strength training, moves with
dumbbells
, kettlebells, and barbells likely come to mind. But slotting in resistance band exercises is another way to effectively fire up your muscles. And, with tons of options to choose from, it’s possible to hit your entire body with these elastic tools.
Plus, bands offer some pretty awesome benefits that you
won’t
get from picking up free weights, making them a compelling add to most any exerciser’s routine.
Curious to know more? We tapped two fitness pros to learn just how effective these stretchy devices can be, what you can gain from weaving them into your routine, and a whole host of awesome band exercises to try—plus a quick, four-move resistance band workout routine to tie it all together. So grab your nearest pack of ‘em and get ready to work!
Can you get an effective workout with resistance bands?
We’ll cut straight to the chase: Yes, you can definitely get a good workout using resistance bands,
Susie Reiner, PhD, CSCS
, a certified exercise physiologist and post doctoral researcher at the University of Kentucky’s Sports Medicine Research Institute and the founder of
TheoryEx
, tells SELF. This is true no matter what type of band you’re using—whether it’s a traditional resistance band (a long, wide one you can either tie together in a loop or grip the ends with both hands to do tons of different moves); a looped band (a long circular one that’s often used for big compound exercises like deadlifts and squats); a band with handles (one that’s got grips on each end for your hands, ideal for upper-body moves like chest presses and flies), or a mini band (a smaller circular band that you typically place around your ankles or above your knees for exercises like clam shells and lateral leg lifts).
Though they may seem flimsy compared to dumbbells or kettlebells, resistance bands add mechanical tension to your muscles, just like free weights or machines do, Dr. Reiner explains. And any time you tack on that tension, you’re helping your muscles to adapt and get stronger over time, which is the whole point of strength training. The one caveat: You need to use resistance that delivers
enough
of a challenge to your muscles to spur these changes,
Katie Pierson, CPT,
a Montana-based certified personal trainer, spin instructor, and contributor at
Indoor Cycling Love
, tells SELF. Otherwise, you risk plateauing, she explains. So if, by the end of your reps, your muscles don’t feel fatigued, that’s a sign to level up, she says, which you can do by picking up a thicker band, as those usually offer more resistance than thinner ones.
In that vein, if you stick with bands for the long haul, you’ll likely eventually reach a point where they can
no longer provide the challenge your muscles need
to grow bigger and stronger, as SELF previously reported. Because of that, “resistance bands don’t replace traditional strength building methods, especially if you’re trying to maximize strength and maximize power,” Dr. Reiner says. But before you reach that juncture? They’re a good way to level up the intensity of bodyweight moves, Reiner says. And they offer a whole bunch of other benefits too. Speaking of…
What are some benefits of resistance band exercises?
One of the biggest perks is the bands themselves are really accessible, which makes them easy to use consistently. “What helps people continue exercising is having something that you can do from anywhere, that there are no barriers to,” Dr. Reiner says. And in that sense, bands certainly fit the bill: They’re lightweight and non-bulky, which makes them easy to toss in your bag and use on the go. And, they’re cost effective—a pack of mini bands, for example, is just
$6 on Amazon
. “Not everybody can purchase a set of dumbbells, or adjustable dumbbells, but a lot of people can afford a set of bands,” says Pierson.
Another plus for band exercises: They offer a unique type of resistance called variable or accommodating resistance. Basically, the tension applied to the muscle changes throughout the movement, Dr. Reiner explains. “It’s lighter when there’s more slack in the band, and heavier as you continue the motion,” she says. This is different from free weights, which provide a constant load across the range of motion. Variable resistance provides a unique stimulus to your neuromuscular system, which helps challenge the body in a new way, she explains.
To boot, “they're also really versatile,” Pierson adds. “A single band, or even just two different types of bands, can really offer a wide variety” of ways to work different muscle groups, she explains. For example, by adjusting how much slack there is on the band to shift how much resistance you’re working with, you can use the same one to do squats, deadlifts, rows, and presses—something that would be tough to effectively pull off with just a single set of weights.
Then there’s the fact that resistance band exercises can be used in a broad number of settings, Dr. Reiner adds. They’re a staple in the prehab/rehab world because they help strengthen the stabilizer muscles around a joint, Dr. Reiner says. And they offer a more gradual progression than weights, which is helpful for targeting smaller muscle groups. “For example, someone who can do a lateral raise with one weight but struggles to get to the next dumbbell weight can supplement with resistance bands to strengthen the medial deltoid,” Dr. Reiner says. Plus, light bands can be a great way to focus on form and boost stability around a joint, Dr. Reiner explains. They’re also awesome for activating muscles before exercise. And they can serve as a stellar standalone routine too, which we’ll get to in just a sec.
What exercises can you do with resistance bands?
When it comes to bands, there are dozens of exercises to choose from, Dr. Reiner says. This makes it really easy to get in a total-body workout, she says. Tons of traditional compound strength moves that you’d typically perform with free weights can be adapted for bands—think: deadlifts, squats, overhead presses, and rows. They’re also great for exercises like bicep curls, tricep extensions, and clam shells that hone in on smaller areas of the body, as well as activation drills (like lateral walks and monster walks) to fire up key muscles before a workout.
Pro tip: Before doing resistance band workouts, take a sec to inspect the bands and make sure they don’t have any nicks, cuts, or tears, Pierson advises. Blemishes like those could cause them to snap on you during exercise, which “can be really painful,” she explains. If you
do
notice these, then swap out your bands for some new ones.
Resistance Band Exercises to Try
Pinterest
Katie Thompson
Pull-Apart
Stand with your feet hip-width apart and hold one end of your resistance band in each hand.
Raise your straight arms to chest height, palms down, with your hands about six inches apart. The band should have a small amount of tension, but not be taut.
Now pull the band apart, extending your arms wide to each side, keeping them at the same height.
Return your arms to center. This is 1 rep.
This is a great exercise for improving posture. It works key backside muscles, including your back extensors and lats. It also fires up your traps. Pierson suggests alternating between short, fast pulses and long, slow pulses as a way to really challenge your muscles.
Pinterest
Katie Thompson
Deadlift
Place a looped resistance band straight on the floor and step on it with both feet to secure it firmly. Keep enough slack on either side for you to pull up.
Hinge forward at your hips to lower your body, keeping your back flat. With both hands, grab both ends of the resistance band and lift it to about shin height. This is the starting position. There should be enough slack in the band so you don’t feel tension yet.
Push through your heels to pull the band up so you stand up straight. Pause at the top and squeeze your butt. This is 1 rep.
A classic strength move and one of the most functional exercises out there, the deadlift works your hamstrings and glutes as well as your back extensors.

Overhead Press
Stand with your feet hip-width apart, your feet holding down a looped resistance band. Hold an end of the band in each hand at your shoulders, palms facing out.
Extend your arms straight above your head. Make sure to keep your back straight and avoid arching.
Bring the band back down to rest at your collarbone. This is 1 rep.
This is a great exercise for targeting your shoulders, Dr. Reiner says. It also hits the triceps, she adds.
Pinterest
Katie Thompson
Chest Fly
Loop a resistance band with handles onto something secure behind you. Grab onto each handle and hold your arms straight out in a T, palms facing forward.
Stand with one foot about a foot in front of the other so your stance is staggered. Stand far enough forward that there's tension in the band. This is the starting position.
Slowly pull the band to bring the handles to meet in front of your body, keeping your arms straight, with a slight bend in the elbows.
Then, slowly extend your arms back out to the starting position. Be careful to not let the band spring back quickly. This is 1 rep.
As the name suggests, this exercise really works your chest muscles. Think about squeezing them together when you bring your arms toward one another, as
SELF previously reported
.

Katie Thompson
Bent-Over Row
Stand with both feet on a resistance band, about hip-width apart. Hold one end in each hand by your sides, palms facing in toward each other. Bend your knees slightly and hinge forward at the hips, keeping your back flat, arms straight, and hands under your shoulders.
Bend your elbows to pull the band toward your chest, keeping your elbows close to your body (they should skim your sides).
Slowly straighten your arms and lower your hands back to the starting position. This is 1 rep.
Here you’re working your back muscles, Dr. Reiner says, including your upper and mid-back, as well as your biceps.
Pinterest
Katie Thompson
Standing Chest Press
Loop a resistance band with handles onto something secure behind you. Grab onto each handle and hold your arms straight out to the side, elbows bent at 90 degrees, palms facing forward.
Stand with one foot about a foot in front of the other so your stance is staggered. Stand far enough forward that there's tension in the band. This is the starting position.
Slowly press the handles forward and straighten your arms, until your hands meet in front of your body.
Then, slowly bend your elbows and bring the handles back toward your chest to return to the starting position. Be careful to not let the band spring back quickly. This is 1 rep.
A traditional chest press has you lying on the ground as you press free weights or a barbell above you. This resistance band variation takes places from a standing position and works your pecs, deltoids (shoulders), and triceps.
Pinterest
Katie Thompson
Lat Pulldown
Loop a resistance band over a sturdy anchor above you.
Stand with one foot about a foot in front of the other so your stance is staggered. Stand far enough forward that there's tension in the band. This is the starting position.
Grab onto one end of the band with each hand and extend your arms toward the ceiling at a slight diagonal. Your torso should be upright and leaning slightly forward. Keep your core tight, back flat, and chest lifted.
Slowly pull your hands down and out to shoulder height. Hold for a moment, squeezing your back and shoulder blades tight.
Slowly extend your arms back out to the starting position. This is 1 rep.
This exercise works your lats and biceps. It’s also great for shoulder stability, Dr. Reiner says.
Pinterest
Katie Thompson
Overhead Triceps Extension
Stand with your feet close together holding down a resistance band.
Hold an end of the band in each hand behind your head, with the band running behind your body. Your elbows should remain close to your ears, your palms facing each other, and the knuckles on both hands touching. This is starting position.
Without moving your upper arms, straighten your elbows and extend your arms directly overhead.
Pause for a second, and then slowly lower the band behind your head. This is 1 rep.
This is a great way to target your triceps—the muscles on the backside of your upper arm. As you do reps, keep your elbows tucked close to your body; don’t let them flare out.
Pinterest
Katie Thompson
Biceps Curl
Stand with both feet on a resistance band with handles. Hold one end in each hand, arms extended, palms facing forward.
Slowly curl your hands up toward your shoulders, squeezing your biceps. Keep your elbows tight to the sides of your body.
Slowly lower your hands back down to starting position.
That’s 1 rep.
A traditional biceps curl involves dumbbells, which apply the same amount of tension to your muscles throughout, but in this banded version, you’ll feel more tension at the top of the move than at the bottom due to the varying resistance.
Pinterest
Katie Thompson
Standing Lateral Leg Lift
Loop a mini band (or tied resistance band) around your ankles and stand with your feet together.
With your hands at your chest or on your hips (as pictured), shift your weight into your left leg and place your right foot lightly on the floor a few inches to the right so there is tension in the band.
Squeeze your abs and tuck your pelvis under as you slowly lift your right leg out to the side, keeping your knee straight. Lift it as high as you can but stop right before you feel your back begin to arch.
Return your right foot to the floor, keeping tension in the band. That's 1 rep.
Do all your reps on one side, then repeat on the other side.
This move really targets your hip abductors, a group of muscles that help move your leg away from your body. A lot of people can be weak here, so doing moves like this one to strengthen them can be really helpful.
Pinterest
Katie Thompson
Glute Bridge
Lie on your back with your hands at your sides, knees bent, and feet flat on the floor hip-width apart. Loop a mini band (or tied resistance band) around your thighs, just above your knees. This is the starting position.
Squeeze your glutes and abs and push through your heels to lift your hips a few inches off the floor until your body forms a straight line from your shoulders to your knees. Hold this position for a second, making sure to maintain tension in the band so your knees don't collapse in.
Slowly lower your hips to return to the starting position. This is 1 rep.
The glute bridge is a classic butt exercise that fires up your core and glute max (biggest butt muscle) while also stretching your hip flexors. Adding a resistance band to this motion ups the challenge for your muscles.
Pinterest
Katie Thompson
Clam Shell
Lie on your right side with your hips, knees, and ankles stacked on top of each other. Bend your knees to 90 degrees and wrap a mini band (or tied resistance band) around your thighs just above your knees. Rest your top hand on the ground. This is the starting position.
Keeping your feet together, lift your left knee open, then slowly lower it back to meet your left. This is 1 repetition.
Focus on keeping your core engaged and your back straight as you do these moves. Try not to lean forward or tip back.
Do all your reps, then switch sides and repeat.
The
clam shell
is a popular rehab/prehab exercise since it can help with both preventing and alleviating a host of issues caused by weak glutes, like knee and back pain. It fires up your glute max (biggest butt muscle) as well as your glute medius (side butt), plus your external obliques (side core muscles).
Pinterest
Katie Thompson
Lateral Walk
Loop a mini band (or tied resistance band) around your ankles and get into a quarter-squat position (a shallower squat). This is the starting position.
Take a giant step to your right with your right foot, then follow with your left. Take 5 steps in this direction (or as many as your space allows).
Step back in the reverse direction, starting each step with your left and then your right, until you return to the starting position.
Continue this movement, alternating directions each time.
This is a great way to activate your glutes—especially your side-butt muscles—before you use them more intensely in a workout. Make it easier by placing the resistance band above your knees, Pierson says.
Pinterest
Katie Thompson
Monster Walk
Stand with your feet hip-width apart, a mini band (or tied resistance band) around your ankles, and your knees bent into a quarter squat.
Take a diagonal step forward and to the right with your right foot, then take a diagonal step forward to the left with your left foot. This is 1 rep.
Continue stepping forward and diagonally, alternating between your left and right foot, for a set number of reps.
Reverse the movement, stepping diagonally behind your body with each step, for another set of reps, until you return to the starting position.
Try to maintain at least some tension in the band at all times, even when you’re stepping your feet closer together.
If you don’t have a ton of space, take fewer steps in either direction. Just make sure you’ve completed an equal number of steps forward and backward by the end of your reps.
Another awesome warm-up move that targets the glutes, this exercise has you walking diagonally in the transverse plane of motion, which is helpful for building well-rounded strength, since a lot of day-to-day activities take place in the sagittal plane (forward and backward motions.)
Pinterest
Katie Thompson
Sumo Squat
Place a looped resistance band straight on the floor and step on it with both feet to secure it firmly. Keep your feet wider than shoulder-width apart with your toes turned out. Grab both ends of the resistance band with your hands and place your hands in front of your hips. The band should feel very taut. This is the starting position.
Engage your core and keep your chest lifted and back flat. Push your hips back and bend your knees as you lower into a squat.
Press your feet into the floor as you stand and squeeze your glutes at the top for 1 rep.
This squat variation works your quads, hamstrings, and glutes.
Here’s a resistance band workout to try.

Alicia Jamison
, MA, coach at
Bodyspace Fitness
in New York City, this routine alternates between upper-body and lower-body moves—you’ll do a pull-apart, deadlift, overhead press, then sumo squat—which allows one half to rest while the other works. That makes this an efficient, effective routine to slot into your day.
You’ll need one light-to-medium strength band for the pull-apart and overhead press, and a heavier one for the deadlift and sumo squat. Do each exercise for 30 seconds, then rest 30 seconds before moving onto the next exercise. Again, the order is:
Pull-Apart
Deadlift
Overhead Press
Sumo Squat
Repeat the entire circuit 2 to 3 times total without taking any extra rest in between rounds.

When you picture strength training, moves with
dumbbells
, kettlebells, and barbells likely come to mind. But slotting in resistance band exercises is another way to effectively fire up your muscles. And, with tons of options to choose from, it’s possible to hit your entire body with these elastic tools.
Plus, bands offer some pretty awesome benefits that you
won’t
get from picking up free weights, making them a compelling add to most any exerciser’s routine.
Curious to know more? We tapped two fitness pros to learn just how effective these stretchy devices can be, what you can gain from weaving them into your routine, and a whole host of awesome band exercises to try—plus a quick, four-move resistance band workout routine to tie it all together. So grab your nearest pack of ‘em and get ready to work!
Can you get an effective workout with resistance bands?
We’ll cut straight to the chase: Yes, you can definitely get a good workout using resistance bands,
Susie Reiner, PhD, CSCS
, a certified exercise physiologist and post doctoral researcher at the University of Kentucky’s Sports Medicine Research Institute and the founder of
TheoryEx
, tells SELF. This is true no matter what type of band you’re using—whether it’s a traditional resistance band (a long, wide one you can either tie together in a loop or grip the ends with both hands to do tons of different moves); a looped band (a long circular one that’s often used for big compound exercises like deadlifts and squats); a band with handles (one that’s got grips on each end for your hands, ideal for upper-body moves like chest presses and flies), or a mini band (a smaller circular band that you typically place around your ankles or above your knees for exercises like clam shells and lateral leg lifts).
Though they may seem flimsy compared to dumbbells or kettlebells, resistance bands add mechanical tension to your muscles, just like free weights or machines do, Dr. Reiner explains. And any time you tack on that tension, you’re helping your muscles to adapt and get stronger over time, which is the whole point of strength training. The one caveat: You need to use resistance that delivers
enough
of a challenge to your muscles to spur these changes,
Katie Pierson, CPT,
a Montana-based certified personal trainer, spin instructor, and contributor at
Indoor Cycling Love
, tells SELF. Otherwise, you risk plateauing, she explains. So if, by the end of your reps, your muscles don’t feel fatigued, that’s a sign to level up, she says, which you can do by picking up a thicker band, as those usually offer more resistance than thinner ones.
In that vein, if you stick with bands for the long haul, you’ll likely eventually reach a point where they can
no longer provide the challenge your muscles need
to grow bigger and stronger, as SELF previously reported. Because of that, “resistance bands don’t replace traditional strength building methods, especially if you’re trying to maximize strength and maximize power,” Dr. Reiner says. But before you reach that juncture? They’re a good way to level up the intensity of bodyweight moves, Reiner says. And they offer a whole bunch of other benefits too. Speaking of…
What are some benefits of resistance band exercises?
One of the biggest perks is the bands themselves are really accessible, which makes them easy to use consistently. “What helps people continue exercising is having something that you can do from anywhere, that there are no barriers to,” Dr. Reiner says. And in that sense, bands certainly fit the bill: They’re lightweight and non-bulky, which makes them easy to toss in your bag and use on the go. And, they’re cost effective—a pack of mini bands, for example, is just
$6 on Amazon
. “Not everybody can purchase a set of dumbbells, or adjustable dumbbells, but a lot of people can afford a set of bands,” says Pierson.
Another plus for band exercises: They offer a unique type of resistance called variable or accommodating resistance. Basically, the tension applied to the muscle changes throughout the movement, Dr. Reiner explains. “It’s lighter when there’s more slack in the band, and heavier as you continue the motion,” she says. This is different from free weights, which provide a constant load across the range of motion. Variable resistance provides a unique stimulus to your neuromuscular system, which helps challenge the body in a new way, she explains.
To boot, “they're also really versatile,” Pierson adds. “A single band, or even just two different types of bands, can really offer a wide variety” of ways to work different muscle groups, she explains. For example, by adjusting how much slack there is on the band to shift how much resistance you’re working with, you can use the same one to do squats, deadlifts, rows, and presses—something that would be tough to effectively pull off with just a single set of weights.
Then there’s the fact that resistance band exercises can be used in a broad number of settings, Dr. Reiner adds. They’re a staple in the prehab/rehab world because they help strengthen the stabilizer muscles around a joint, Dr. Reiner says. And they offer a more gradual progression than weights, which is helpful for targeting smaller muscle groups. “For example, someone who can do a lateral raise with one weight but struggles to get to the next dumbbell weight can supplement with resistance bands to strengthen the medial deltoid,” Dr. Reiner says. Plus, light bands can be a great way to focus on form and boost stability around a joint, Dr. Reiner explains. They’re also awesome for activating muscles before exercise. And they can serve as a stellar standalone routine too, which we’ll get to in just a sec.
What exercises can you do with resistance bands?
When it comes to bands, there are dozens of exercises to choose from, Dr. Reiner says. This makes it really easy to get in a total-body workout, she says. Tons of traditional compound strength moves that you’d typically perform with free weights can be adapted for bands—think: deadlifts, squats, overhead presses, and rows. They’re also great for exercises like bicep curls, tricep extensions, and clam shells that hone in on smaller areas of the body, as well as activation drills (like lateral walks and monster walks) to fire up key muscles before a workout.
Pro tip: Before doing resistance band workouts, take a sec to inspect the bands and make sure they don’t have any nicks, cuts, or tears, Pierson advises. Blemishes like those could cause them to snap on you during exercise, which “can be really painful,” she explains. If you
do
notice these, then swap out your bands for some new ones.

Overhead Triceps Extension
Stand with your feet close together holding down a resistance band.
Hold an end of the band in each hand behind your head, with the band running behind your body. Your elbows should remain close to your ears, your palms facing each other, and the knuckles on both hands touching. This is starting position.
Without moving your upper arms, straighten your elbows and extend your arms directly overhead.
Pause for a second, and then slowly lower the band behind your head. This is 1 rep.
This is a great way to target your triceps—the muscles on the backside of your upper arm. As you do reps, keep your elbows tucked close to your body; don’t let them flare out.
Pinterest
Katie Thompson
Biceps Curl
Stand with both feet on a resistance band with handles. Hold one end in each hand, arms extended, palms facing forward.
Slowly curl your hands up toward your shoulders, squeezing your biceps. Keep your elbows tight to the sides of your body.
Slowly lower your hands back down to starting position.
That’s 1 rep.
A traditional biceps curl involves dumbbells, which apply the same amount of tension to your muscles throughout, but in this banded version, you’ll feel more tension at the top of the move than at the bottom due to the varying resistance.
Pinterest
Katie Thompson
Standing Lateral Leg Lift
Loop a mini band (or tied resistance band) around your ankles and stand with your feet together.
With your hands at your chest or on your hips (as pictured), shift your weight into your left leg and place your right foot lightly on the floor a few inches to the right so there is tension in the band.
Squeeze your abs and tuck your pelvis under as you slowly lift your right leg out to the side, keeping your knee straight. Lift it as high as you can but stop right before you feel your back begin to arch.
Return your right foot to the floor, keeping tension in the band. That's 1 rep.
Do all your reps on one side, then repeat on the other side.
This move really targets your hip abductors, a group of muscles that help move your leg away from your body. A lot of people can be weak here, so doing moves like this one to strengthen them can be really helpful.

Katie Thompson
Glute Bridge
Lie on your back with your hands at your sides, knees bent, and feet flat on the floor hip-width apart. Loop a mini band (or tied resistance band) around your thighs, just above your knees. This is the starting position.
Squeeze your glutes and abs and push through your heels to lift your hips a few inches off the floor until your body forms a straight line from your shoulders to your knees. Hold this position for a second, making sure to maintain tension in the band so your knees don't collapse in.
Slowly lower your hips to return to the starting position. This is 1 rep.
The glute bridge is a classic butt exercise that fires up your core and glute max (biggest butt muscle) while also stretching your hip flexors. Adding a resistance band to this motion ups the challenge for your muscles.

Lateral Walk
Loop a mini band (or tied resistance band) around your ankles and get into a quarter-squat position (a shallower squat). This is the starting position.
Take a giant step to your right with your right foot, then follow with your left. Take 5 steps in this direction (or as many as your space allows).
Step back in the reverse direction, starting each step with your left and then your right, until you return to the starting position.
Continue this movement, alternating directions each time.
This is a great way to activate your glutes—especially your side-butt muscles—before you use them more intensely in a workout. Make it easier by placing the resistance band above your knees, Pierson says.

Monster Walk
Stand with your feet hip-width apart, a mini band (or tied resistance band) around your ankles, and your knees bent into a quarter squat.
Take a diagonal step forward and to the right with your right foot, then take a diagonal step forward to the left with your left foot. This is 1 rep.
Continue stepping forward and diagonally, alternating between your left and right foot, for a set number of reps.
Reverse the movement, stepping diagonally behind your body with each step, for another set of reps, until you return to the starting position.
Try to maintain at least some tension in the band at all times, even when you’re stepping your feet closer together.
If you don’t have a ton of space, take fewer steps in either direction. Just make sure you’ve completed an equal number of steps forward and backward by the end of your reps.
Another awesome warm-up move that targets the glutes, this exercise has you walking diagonally in the transverse plane of motion, which is helpful for building well-rounded strength, since a lot of day-to-day activities take place in the sagittal plane (forward and backward motions.)

Sumo Squat
Place a looped resistance band straight on the floor and step on it with both feet to secure it firmly. Keep your feet wider than shoulder-width apart with your toes turned out. Grab both ends of the resistance band with your hands and place your hands in front of your hips. The band should feel very taut. This is the starting position.
Engage your core and keep your chest lifted and back flat. Push your hips back and bend your knees as you lower into a squat.
Press your feet into the floor as you stand and squeeze your glutes at the top for 1 rep.
This squat variation works your quads, hamstrings, and glutes.
Here’s a resistance band workout to try.
Inspired to put your newfound resistance band knowledge to the test? We have a four-move workout that’ll smoke your entire body in just 12 minutes. Created for SELF by certified personal trainer
Alicia Jamison
, MA, coach at
Bodyspace Fitness
in New York City, this routine alternates between upper-body and lower-body moves—you’ll do a pull-apart, deadlift, overhead press, then sumo squat—which allows one half to rest while the other works. That makes this an efficient, effective routine to slot into your day.
You’ll need one light-to-medium strength band for the pull-apart and overhead press, and a heavier one for the deadlift and sumo squat. Do each exercise for 30 seconds, then rest 30 seconds before moving onto the next exercise. Again, the order is:
Pull-Apart
Deadlift
Overhead Press
Sumo Squat
Repeat the entire circuit 2 to 3 times total without taking any extra rest in between rounds.

How to Set Realistic Fitness Goals You’ll Actually Achieve, According to Top Trainers
Because smart planning at the start can set you up for long-term success.

Whether you’re a lifelong athlete or totally
new to exercising
, the start of a new year always marks a boom in fitness-related resolutions. “Exercise more” even ranked among the top five resolutions for 2024, according to a
YouGov.org poll
of 1,000 people. (And, of course, this kind of goal-setting doesn’t need to be tied to New Year’s; it can be done
any
time you’re looking to add some movement to your life.) Done right, this can be an invaluable tool for advancing in your fitness journey—it can help structure workouts, keep you on track, measure progress, and motivate you to continue—but it can be surprisingly tough to find a happy medium between ambitious and far-fetched. And treading that fine line is key to success.
“People often take that ‘New year, new you’ thing very seriously,” certified personal trainer
Francine Delgado-Lugo, CPT,
movement and strength coach and cofounder of
Form Fitness Brooklyn
, tells SELF. But for fitness to stick around for the long haul, you want it to be something that works for the
actual
you, not a version you’re hoping to become. Now, this doesn’t mean that change isn’t possible—it definitely
is
. But at the same time, setting a lofty, unsustainable, or otherwise unrealistic goal can set you up for failure right out of the gate. And that failure, in turn, can trigger a downward spiral that can leave you feeling pretty down about yourself and what you can do.
Fitness shouldn’t make you feel lousy—in fact, once you get into it,
it packs a ton of mood-boosting benefits
. So to help you take the plunge, we tapped experts for their best tips on how to set great fitness goals. Read on for what to keep in mind as you get started crafting the very best ones for you—you know, the ones that are both worthwhile
and
workable.
1. Focus on one goal at a time.
When it comes to setting a fitness goal, “one of the biggest mistakes is that people try to do too much at one time,”
Kellen Scantlebury, DPT
, certified strength and conditioning specialist and founder of
Fit Club NY
, tells SELF. Perhaps you want to hit the gym every day,
meal-prep
for each and every workday lunch,
and
get at least
eight hours of sleep
a night. Tackling that much at once is essentially just a recipe for disaster. With so many things looming in front of them, “people get anxious, and if they didn’t do one thing, they feel like a failure,” says Dr. Scantlebury. This can lead to
negative self-talk
that lowers your chances of achieving
any
of the goals.
Instead, pick one thing you
really
want to crush—like doing a pull-up or
completing your first-ever 5K
—and channel your efforts into achieving that before exploring another goal.
2. Make it your own.
It can be easy to scroll through the ’gram and feel inspired-yet-envious by reels of the super-fit. Yet basing your own goals off of what you see others achieving is neither productive nor practical.
“When we are bombarded by images of what fitness should look like and how we should do XYZ, it can be hard to identify what’s good for you,” Tony Vidal, NYC-based certified strength and conditioning specialist and master trainer with fitness app
POPiN
, tells SELF. Certain things that top athletes can do—
run a marathon
, do 100
push-ups
, master the most challenging
yoga poses
—“may be great for them, but it’s not a metric that everyone should be measured by,” says Vidal. In other words, your goal should be
your
goal—something that you personally are excited about and realistically able to achieve—not someone else’s.
3. Make it measurable, specific, and time-bound.
This goal allows you to track your progress, says Vidal. Plus, the more specific your goal, the clearer the path to achieving it becomes,
Mark DiSalvo
, a NYC-based certified strength and conditioning specialist, tells SELF.
Wanting to “be stronger,” for example, is a great place to start, but what does that mean to you? Saying you want to increase the number of push-ups you can do makes the goal
measurable
, and saying you want to be able to do 10 push-ups in one minute makes it
specific
. On top of that, the goal should be time-bound, as this helps you focus your efforts, develop a more structured plan for actually achieving the goal, and creates a sense of urgency that can be motivating. Examples of measurable, specific, and time-bound goals include being able to
deadlift
10 repetitions with 50 pounds in three months, running a 5K nonstop by the end of the year, and correctly performing a pull-up by the start of summer. A great way to remember this is through the SMART method, which helps you make sure your goal is specific, measurable, attainable, relevant, and timely.
4. Come prepared.
Get off to a great start by knowing the logistics of what it’ll take to achieve your fitness goal and making sure you have all the gear on hand. Depending on your chosen sport or exercise, this could be anything from a snowboard to a
yoga mat
to a gym membership (or
a set of adjustable weights
so you can lift at home). Buying the necessary clothing, footwear, accessories, or equipment—making a financial investment in your goal, in other words—can even help with motivation, according to Delgado-Lugo. So before you even begin, she says, ask yourself, “What are the things that I need?”
Even if you don’t have to make any new purchases, doing this mental inventory will prevent needless delays that could potentially keep you from starting your fitness journey
at all
, according to Delgado-Lugo. Say your fitness goal involves running. If you’ve already confirmed you have some
suitable sneakers
stashed away somewhere, you can’t then tell yourself, “Oh, I can't go running because I don't have a good pair of shoes” when the moment arrives, Delgado-Lugo says. One more potential excuse eliminated.
5. Block time off on your calendar—but keep it realistic.
It’s not called a
fitness
routine
for nothing: Like anything else, achieving an exercise goal takes time and effort, so make sure that’s reflected in your schedule, according to Delgado-Lugo. “Plan and commit to it the way you would any other personal obligation,” she says.
Booking a gym session as you would a haircut, job interview, or doctor’s appointment might feel weird, but carving out that dedicated window is essential, according to Delgado-Lugo. Start by calculating how much time you have available to devote on a regular basis—after all, results aren’t immediate, so you’ll need multiple sessions to work towards them anyway.
Then find a way to fit that time block into your schedule. If you end up working late most days, an evening workout probably isn’t the best idea, for example. (And if you’re not a morning person, the opposite is true.)
And just so we’re clear, a fitness goal that demands more time than you have available is automatically
not
a realistic one! Going too big too soon—say, committing to work out five days a week from zero—can be highly demoralizing when you inevitably start to drop off and realize you just can’t hit that number amid all your other commitments. (And yes, you absolutely can achieve some great results with one, two, three, or four days a week—SELF’s new workout plan
6 Weeks to Stronger
breaks it all down for you.
)
6. Play the long game.
There’s some truth to the ol’ cliché “Rome wasn’t built in a day,” Delgado-Lugo says—and similarly,
building strength
,
increasing speed
, or achieving any other fitness objective isn’t accomplished with a snap of your fingers (as much as we might wish it were). We all want instant gratification, but it’s important to be realistic with the time frame you develop for achieving your goal, says DiSalvo. “Lasting changes take a while,” he explains.
Know that “you are never going to make an overhaul in one week,” adds Dr. Scantlebury. Instead, pick a goal that can be achieved over the course of several months or even a year. A long-term mentality will help you see your goal as a lifestyle change, rather than quick fix, and you’ll be much more likely to adhere to it.
7. Understand what’s driving your goal.
Sometimes fitness goals are driven by underlying fears, insecurities, or
body image issues
—like wanting to run a marathon because you were bullied during the middle school gym class mile, or signing up for a CrossFit class because an ex once commented on your weight—and it’s important to address these issues rather than assuming achieving your goal will assuage them.
“Depending on what you are trying to accomplish, it can stir up a lot of emotions,” says DiSalvo. If thinking about your goal brings anxiety or triggers past mental struggles, consider talking with a
mental health professional
to help you sort it out.
8. Develop micro-goals on the way to the biggie.
Within your larger goal, you should schedule in smaller, confidence-building goals that are achievable in a shorter time period. “Everyone signs up for a big long race, and they haven't even run a 5K yet,” Delgado-Lugo says. You can think of these micro-goals as stepping stones leading to your ultimate destination. For example, say you want to run a nine-minute mile. During your training, you should make a smaller goal, like running a half-mile in under five minutes, to both show yourself how much you've accomplished and assess where you currently are. “It’s all about those little victories,” explains DiSalvo. “You want to be able to reward yourself mentally.” Having to wait
too
long to feel like you’ve accomplished anything can diminish your motivation and pull you off track entirely.
In general, it’s good to set micro-goals that can be achieved every two to three weeks,
Mike Clancy
, NYC-based certified strength and conditioning specialist, tells SELF. That amount of time can help you determine if your macro-goal is realistic and provide the chance to scale things back if needed.
And if you want to pare it down even further? Consider focusing on the specific exercises or workouts you want to take on, according to Delgado-Lugo. Let's say your goal is to do a
pull-up
—widely considered the holy grail of bodyweight strength exercises,
Kira Stokes, CPT
, a personal trainer in New York and LA and the creator of the
KSFIT app
, previously told SELF. Once you’ve built up your upper-body strength and shoulder mobility, you can start with some dead hangs, then move on to band-assisted chin-ups, negative chin-ups, and, finally, pull-ups.
9. Consider a professional’s input.
If you’re having a hard time evaluating your current fitness level, determining what would be a realistic goal, or just feeling overwhelmed about the process, it can be helpful to
consult an expert
, like a certified personal trainer. “A professional can help give you guidance on how realistic your goal is and can help you set markers along the way, so you can check in and confirm you are on the right track over time,”
Kollins Ezekh, CPT
, certified personal trainer and group fitness expert, tells SELF.
At Fit Club NY, for example, Dr. Scantlebury will ask clients about various factors influencing their lifestyle, including their prior history with fitness (e.g., have they trained before? Are they a former athlete? Do they have experience lifting weights?), their nutrition, their work and social history (e.g., do they have a demanding, high-stress job? Do they go out frequently?, etc.). These questions aren’t to judge; they’re to understand, explains Dr. Scantlebury. “Once we understand their life, we can create a program around that works for them.”
On top of that, Dr. Scantlebury will conduct several athletic tests—like endurance tests and strength tests—to assess someone’s baseline level of fitness. Though you can ask yourself these questions and conduct fitness tests on yourself, if you’re new to exercise, it may be helpful to get an expert’s input. Remember, it’s not like you’re not locked into a lifelong subscription: You can always just hire a professional for a few sessions to teach you the fundamentals of movement, Delgado-Lugo says. And if you want some pointers but not necessarily one-on-one, personalized coaching? You can always find fitness programs online to help you start out. Check out SELF’s huge workout directory
here
.
10. Plan for a support system.
When thinking about your goal, you should also think about who in your life could encourage you, motivate you, and hold you accountable. Then, recruit them whenever you're in need of support. “If people you spend the most time with are supportive of your goals, it will make a huge difference," says Ezekh.
11. And remember, that support system should include
yourself.
Life has a habit of getting in the way, so give yourself grace when the going gets tough, even though it can be oh-so-easy to get discouraged if you don’t instantly see results. “We tend to be focused on the outcome,” Delgado-Lugo says, but in reality, “fitness is really about the journey and the process.” So don’t be too hard on yourself if you fall off the wagon once or twice (or three times, or four, or five…). Skip a gym day? “Don't be all or nothing about it,” Delgado-Lugo says. “Show up the next day.”

Whether you’re a lifelong athlete or totally
new to exercising
, the start of a new year always marks a boom in fitness-related resolutions. “Exercise more” even ranked among the top five resolutions for 2024, according to a
YouGov.org poll
of 1,000 people. (And, of course, this kind of goal-setting doesn’t need to be tied to New Year’s; it can be done
any
time you’re looking to add some movement to your life.) Done right, this can be an invaluable tool for advancing in your fitness journey—it can help structure workouts, keep you on track, measure progress, and motivate you to continue—but it can be surprisingly tough to find a happy medium between ambitious and far-fetched. And treading that fine line is key to success.
“People often take that ‘New year, new you’ thing very seriously,” certified personal trainer
Francine Delgado-Lugo, CPT,
movement and strength coach and cofounder of
Form Fitness Brooklyn
, tells SELF. But for fitness to stick around for the long haul, you want it to be something that works for the
actual
you, not a version you’re hoping to become. Now, this doesn’t mean that change isn’t possible—it definitely
is
. But at the same time, setting a lofty, unsustainable, or otherwise unrealistic goal can set you up for failure right out of the gate. And that failure, in turn, can trigger a downward spiral that can leave you feeling pretty down about yourself and what you can do.
Fitness shouldn’t make you feel lousy—in fact, once you get into it,
it packs a ton of mood-boosting benefits
. So to help you take the plunge, we tapped experts for their best tips on how to set great fitness goals. Read on for what to keep in mind as you get started crafting the very best ones for you—you know, the ones that are both worthwhile
and
workable.
1. Focus on one goal at a time.
When it comes to setting a fitness goal, “one of the biggest mistakes is that people try to do too much at one time,”
Kellen Scantlebury, DPT
, certified strength and conditioning specialist and founder of
Fit Club NY
, tells SELF. Perhaps you want to hit the gym every day,
meal-prep
for each and every workday lunch,
and
get at least
eight hours of sleep
a night. Tackling that much at once is essentially just a recipe for disaster. With so many things looming in front of them, “people get anxious, and if they didn’t do one thing, they feel like a failure,” says Dr. Scantlebury. This can lead to
negative self-talk
that lowers your chances of achieving
any
of the goals.
Instead, pick one thing you
really
want to crush—like doing a pull-up or
completing your first-ever 5K
—and channel your efforts into achieving that before exploring another goal.
2. Make it your own.
It can be easy to scroll through the ’gram and feel inspired-yet-envious by reels of the super-fit. Yet basing your own goals off of what you see others achieving is neither productive nor practical.
“When we are bombarded by images of what fitness should look like and how we should do XYZ, it can be hard to identify what’s good for you,” Tony Vidal, NYC-based certified strength and conditioning specialist and master trainer with fitness app
POPiN
, tells SELF. Certain things that top athletes can do—
run a marathon
, do 100
push-ups
, master the most challenging
yoga poses
—“may be great for them, but it’s not a metric that everyone should be measured by,” says Vidal. In other words, your goal should be
your
goal—something that you personally are excited about and realistically able to achieve—not someone else’s.
3. Make it measurable, specific, and time-bound.
This goal allows you to track your progress, says Vidal. Plus, the more specific your goal, the clearer the path to achieving it becomes,
Mark DiSalvo
, a NYC-based certified strength and conditioning specialist, tells SELF.
Wanting to “be stronger,” for example, is a great place to start, but what does that mean to you? Saying you want to increase the number of push-ups you can do makes the goal
measurable
, and saying you want to be able to do 10 push-ups in one minute makes it
specific
. On top of that, the goal should be time-bound, as this helps you focus your efforts, develop a more structured plan for actually achieving the goal, and creates a sense of urgency that can be motivating. Examples of measurable, specific, and time-bound goals include being able to
deadlift
10 repetitions with 50 pounds in three months, running a 5K nonstop by the end of the year, and correctly performing a pull-up by the start of summer. A great way to remember this is through the SMART method, which helps you make sure your goal is specific, measurable, attainable, relevant, and timely.
4. Come prepared.
Get off to a great start by knowing the logistics of what it’ll take to achieve your fitness goal and making sure you have all the gear on hand. Depending on your chosen sport or exercise, this could be anything from a snowboard to a
yoga mat
to a gym membership (or
a set of adjustable weights
so you can lift at home). Buying the necessary clothing, footwear, accessories, or equipment—making a financial investment in your goal, in other words—can even help with motivation, according to Delgado-Lugo. So before you even begin, she says, ask yourself, “What are the things that I need?”
Even if you don’t have to make any new purchases, doing this mental inventory will prevent needless delays that could potentially keep you from starting your fitness journey
at all
, according to Delgado-Lugo. Say your fitness goal involves running. If you’ve already confirmed you have some
suitable sneakers
stashed away somewhere, you can’t then tell yourself, “Oh, I can't go running because I don't have a good pair of shoes” when the moment arrives, Delgado-Lugo says. One more potential excuse eliminated.
5. Block time off on your calendar—but keep it realistic.
It’s not called a
fitness
routine
for nothing: Like anything else, achieving an exercise goal takes time and effort, so make sure that’s reflected in your schedule, according to Delgado-Lugo. “Plan and commit to it the way you would any other personal obligation,” she says.
Booking a gym session as you would a haircut, job interview, or doctor’s appointment might feel weird, but carving out that dedicated window is essential, according to Delgado-Lugo. Start by calculating how much time you have available to devote on a regular basis—after all, results aren’t immediate, so you’ll need multiple sessions to work towards them anyway.
Then find a way to fit that time block into your schedule. If you end up working late most days, an evening workout probably isn’t the best idea, for example. (And if you’re not a morning person, the opposite is true.)
And just so we’re clear, a fitness goal that demands more time than you have available is automatically
not
a realistic one! Going too big too soon—say, committing to work out five days a week from zero—can be highly demoralizing when you inevitably start to drop off and realize you just can’t hit that number amid all your other commitments. (And yes, you absolutely can achieve some great results with one, two, three, or four days a week—SELF’s new workout plan
6 Weeks to Stronger
breaks it all down for you.
)
6. Play the long game.
There’s some truth to the ol’ cliché “Rome wasn’t built in a day,” Delgado-Lugo says—and similarly,
building strength
,
increasing speed
, or achieving any other fitness objective isn’t accomplished with a snap of your fingers (as much as we might wish it were). We all want instant gratification, but it’s important to be realistic with the time frame you develop for achieving your goal, says DiSalvo. “Lasting changes take a while,” he explains.
Know that “you are never going to make an overhaul in one week,” adds Dr. Scantlebury. Instead, pick a goal that can be achieved over the course of several months or even a year. A long-term mentality will help you see your goal as a lifestyle change, rather than quick fix, and you’ll be much more likely to adhere to it.
7. Understand what’s driving your goal.
Sometimes fitness goals are driven by underlying fears, insecurities, or
body image issues
—like wanting to run a marathon because you were bullied during the middle school gym class mile, or signing up for a CrossFit class because an ex once commented on your weight—and it’s important to address these issues rather than assuming achieving your goal will assuage them.
“Depending on what you are trying to accomplish, it can stir up a lot of emotions,” says DiSalvo. If thinking about your goal brings anxiety or triggers past mental struggles, consider talking with a
mental health professional
to help you sort it out.
8. Develop micro-goals on the way to the biggie.
Within your larger goal, you should schedule in smaller, confidence-building goals that are achievable in a shorter time period. “Everyone signs up for a big long race, and they haven't even run a 5K yet,” Delgado-Lugo says. You can think of these micro-goals as stepping stones leading to your ultimate destination. For example, say you want to run a nine-minute mile. During your training, you should make a smaller goal, like running a half-mile in under five minutes, to both show yourself how much you've accomplished and assess where you currently are. “It’s all about those little victories,” explains DiSalvo. “You want to be able to reward yourself mentally.” Having to wait
too
long to feel like you’ve accomplished anything can diminish your motivation and pull you off track entirely.
In general, it’s good to set micro-goals that can be achieved every two to three weeks,
Mike Clancy
, NYC-based certified strength and conditioning specialist, tells SELF. That amount of time can help you determine if your macro-goal is realistic and provide the chance to scale things back if needed.
And if you want to pare it down even further? Consider focusing on the specific exercises or workouts you want to take on, according to Delgado-Lugo. Let's say your goal is to do a
pull-up
—widely considered the holy grail of bodyweight strength exercises,
Kira Stokes, CPT
, a personal trainer in New York and LA and the creator of the
KSFIT app
, previously told SELF. Once you’ve built up your upper-body strength and shoulder mobility, you can start with some dead hangs, then move on to band-assisted chin-ups, negative chin-ups, and, finally, pull-ups.
9. Consider a professional’s input.
If you’re having a hard time evaluating your current fitness level, determining what would be a realistic goal, or just feeling overwhelmed about the process, it can be helpful to
consult an expert
, like a certified personal trainer. “A professional can help give you guidance on how realistic your goal is and can help you set markers along the way, so you can check in and confirm you are on the right track over time,”
Kollins Ezekh, CPT
, certified personal trainer and group fitness expert, tells SELF.
At Fit Club NY, for example, Dr. Scantlebury will ask clients about various factors influencing their lifestyle, including their prior history with fitness (e.g., have they trained before? Are they a former athlete? Do they have experience lifting weights?), their nutrition, their work and social history (e.g., do they have a demanding, high-stress job? Do they go out frequently?, etc.). These questions aren’t to judge; they’re to understand, explains Dr. Scantlebury. “Once we understand their life, we can create a program around that works for them.”
On top of that, Dr. Scantlebury will conduct several athletic tests—like endurance tests and strength tests—to assess someone’s baseline level of fitness. Though you can ask yourself these questions and conduct fitness tests on yourself, if you’re new to exercise, it may be helpful to get an expert’s input. Remember, it’s not like you’re not locked into a lifelong subscription: You can always just hire a professional for a few sessions to teach you the fundamentals of movement, Delgado-Lugo says. And if you want some pointers but not necessarily one-on-one, personalized coaching? You can always find fitness programs online to help you start out. Check out SELF’s huge workout directory

.
10. Plan for a support system.
When thinking about your goal, you should also think about who in your life could encourage you, motivate you, and hold you accountable. Then, recruit them whenever you're in need of support. “If people you spend the most time with are supportive of your goals, it will make a huge difference," says Ezekh.
11. And remember, that support system should include
yourself.
Life has a habit of getting in the way, so give yourself grace when the going gets tough, even though it can be oh-so-easy to get discouraged if you don’t instantly see results. “We tend to be focused on the outcome,” Delgado-Lugo says, but in reality, “fitness is really about the journey and the process.” So don’t be too hard on yourself if you fall off the wagon once or twice (or three times, or four, or five…). Skip a gym day? “Don't be all or nothing about it,” Delgado-Lugo says. “Show up the next day.”

You might not think much about your hands when running. But if you forget to cover them up
when temps dip below 40 degrees
, they can quickly become a problem. “In cold weather, your body's trying to maintain that core warmth, so a lot of the blood flow is going to your core—a little bit less to your hands,”
Mohammad Saad, DPT
, a physical therapist at Hospital for Special Surgery in New York City, tells SELF.
A good pair of running gloves will give you an added layer of warmth to make up for that lack of circulation, keeping you a whole lot more comfortable and ensuring you’ll still have enough feeling in your fingers to rip open gels or stop
your running watch
. But there’s a wide range of options out there, from thin, knit pairs you might get at races to super-insulated mittens that can see you through arctic temps.
To find the best running gloves, SELF interviewed running coaches and physical therapists to get their recommendations and insights on what to look for in a good pair. We also wore several gloves in cold weather ourselves to see how they actually hold up. Here’s what to know if you’re on the hunt for your new favorite pair.

How to choose the best running gloves
Most activewear companies that cater to runners sell running gloves, so there are lots of options to choose from. Keep these three things in mind when you’re considering your options.
Materials
AccordionItemContainerButton
LargeChevron
For running, it’s best to choose moisture-wicking materials that provide warm insulation without being too bulky. “
Sweating
can be dangerous when you're running in the winter,” Gonzales says, since your skin loses heat faster when it’s wet. Synthetic fabrics like polyester are a good pick—or, if you want to go the natural route, look for Merino wool, she suggests.
Design
AccordionItemContainerButton
LargeChevron
Many running gloves offer a few design details that can come in handy when you’re on the move. If you plan to use your phone or track your miles with a smartwatch that has a touchscreen, choose gloves that have compatible tips at least on the thumb and index finger. Nurse and Saad both add that it’s helpful to have some reflective details if you plan to
run after dark
(although these elements are typically pretty minimal on gloves, so you might want to pair them with some high-visibility clothing). Many gloves also have silicone grips on the palms, fingers, or both to help you securely grab your phone or rip open that gel mid-stride.
Warmth
AccordionItemContainerButton
LargeChevron
The amount of insulation in running gloves can vary, so be sure to choose options that work for the climate you’ll be running in. Lightweight or liner gloves that offer some breathability are best for mild conditions. When it dips into the 20s or teens, you might want a thicker, midweight option. For more brutal winter weather, consider a mitten, which will trap your body heat better than gloves can, Dr. Saad says.
There are also hybrid glove/mitten options that can be helpful if you warm up over the course of a run, or when you’re heading on a trail run where conditions are likely to change mid-way through.
Frequently asked questions about running gloves
Why is it important to keep your hands warm while running?
AccordionItemContainerButton
LargeChevron
In short, it can help keep them healthy—and much more comfortable. Sub-freezing temps can lead to debilitating pain and may even cause nerve damage in extreme cases, Dr. Saad says. Even if conditions outside aren’t quite that dire, “having a pair of gloves keeps you from shivering and losing energy,” Boston-based running coach
Amanda Nurse
tells SELF.
How do you find the right glove size?
AccordionItemContainerButton
LargeChevron
Most companies offer a size chart with instructions on how to measure your hand. Some fit gloves based on the circumference around your knuckles, while others are based on the length of your hand from the edge of your wrist to the tip of your middle finger. Some brands tell you to measure both; in that case, go with the larger of those two measurements to make sure you’ve got enough room.
Are Merino gloves good?
AccordionItemContainerButton
LargeChevron
Merino wool is a great fabric for running clothes because it’s temperature-regulating, moisture-wicking, and odor-resistant. Nurse highly recommends Merino wool because “they create a great amount of warmth, but also they’re very breathable.”
Which running gloves provide the best warmth and breathability?
AccordionItemContainerButton
LargeChevron
For running gloves that are both warm and breathable, look into a hybrid glove/mitten like
Black Diamond’s Deploy Wind Hood Gloves
or
Brooks's Draft Hybrid Glove
. You can slip on the hood for extra protection or take it off if you start to overheat.

The North Face
Pros
All five fingers are touchscreen-compatible
Grippy dots on palm and fingers
Easily snap together when you take them off
Made with recycled materials
Cons
Inner stitching can feel itchy
This midweight pair of gloves from The North Face is decked out: All five fingers are touchscreen-compatible (and actually worked well during testing). Grippy dots along the palm and fingers make it easy to grab a zipper or a credit card while you’re on the go. After your run, the pairing clip allows you to easily snap both gloves together, so you won’t lose one.
Rather than a unisex fit, the
men’s
and
women’s
versions fit differently, which our tester loved—the material actually wrapped around her fingers properly and fit, well, like a glove. The only red flag? There’s some scratchy inner stitching that doesn’t feel great when you’re slipping them on. Once the gloves are in place though, it didn’t bother our tester or cause any chafing on her run.

Pros
Soft brushed fleece inside
Clip together
Grippy silicone on palms
Screen-friendly fingertips
Cons
Don't cover much of the wrist, according to Lululemon reviewers
Most running gloves look pretty darn plain, but you can
count on Lululemon
to make them a bit more stylish. A heathered grey and black colorway, curvy reflective design on the back of the hand, and grippy dotted print on the palms and fingers zhuzh up this basic accessory.
“They’ve always been a favorite of mine,” Nurse says. “They're just very comfortable and have a nice little stretch to them. My fingers aren't stiff or uncomfortable in them.” Lululemon’s Rulu fleece is known for being soft, stretchy, and sweat-wicking—a.k.a. ideal for running. Although some reviewers report that they’re a bit short on the wrist (and Nurse warns they’re not
super
warm), these gloves are great for runs when you want some lightweight, but still screen-friendly, coverage.

Tracksmith
Pros
Super soft, flexible fabric

Extra-velvety brushed material along thumb and index finger
Very durable
Cons
No grips
Only available in two sizes
Fan favorite running brand Tracksmith has a reputation for making high-quality products that resonate with runners—including the not-so-glamorous parts of the sport. Think: All the snot that comes with logging cold, dry winter miles. Tracksmith’s lightweight Inverno Gloves feature super soft brushed material along the thumb and index finger that’s specifically designed for nose wipes. It’s a genius little detail that means your skin won’t get irritated, even when your nose won’t stop running. And yes, they wash up without any problems afterwards (although we’ve always followed the brand’s rec to let them air-dry).
Our tester has had an old pair that’s now seen her through four New England winters, and they still don’t show any signs of wear. “The stretchy knit fabric fits so snugly and easily on my hands that I almost forget I’m wearing gloves,” she says. Despite how lightweight they are, she says they keep her hands warm and happy, even when temps dip down into the teens.

May not be warm enough for very cold weather
The soft Merino wool that lines the inside of these gloves keeps your hands surprisingly warm, even though they’re on the thinner side. Nurse says they’re ideal for harder workouts in the 20s or 30s “if you want your hands to be nice and warm, but not sweaty and gross—they’re a perfect weight.”
On the outside, recycled polyester helps keep the winter weather from creeping inside. During testing, we even found it kept our hands dry in the snow. But when conditions got especially chilly (in the low 20s or teens), we craved something a
little
thicker.

When you want to keep your hands warm, but not
too
warm, we suggest reaching for Rabbit’s midweight Tech Gloves. They’re just thick enough to protect against temps in the teens, 20s, and 30s, with a thin strip of elastic sewn into the inner wrist to keep the cold out. Our tester particularly appreciated that there’s thinner material between the fingers to keep them from feeling too bulky.
But what really sets these gloves apart is the fleece lining: It’s downright dreamy, delivering exactly the kind of softness we wanted during testing. The only drawback is that the material isn’t the most durable—it got a little fuzzy along the palm and fingers after just a few wears.

Thin and not super durable, according to Amazon reviewers
Sure, you could pick up a bare bones pair of knit gloves for a few dollars pretty much anywhere. But for just a little more, this pair from New Balance is a far more runner-friendly option. The sweat-wicking fabric is designed to keep your hands dry (and the gloves from smelling, if you don’t wash them right away). There’s grippy silicone on your palms to help you securely hold onto your phone if you pull it out mid-run.
And, maybe most importantly, the thumb and forefinger both have touchscreen tips to let you easily swipe on your screen. Reviewers report that these gloves aren’t super warm, and that the stitching can come apart with heavy wear—but thousands still swear by them as a budget-friendly option for running in mild cold.

Pros
Optional wind-resistant, water-repellent hood
Light and flexible
Grippy pattern on palm
Two-year warranty
Cons
Some Black Diamond reviewers wish the hood was detachable
Winter weather can be finicky, and if your running route takes you from windier to warmer patches, it can be helpful to wear gloves that are more versatile. Black Diamond’s Deploy Wind Hood Gloves fit the bill, with a thin, wind-resistant mitt that you can pull over your fingers when things get extra breezy or stow inside the cuff once you heat up.
Our tester found that this design makes a major difference, effectively blocking the wind so her hands stayed comfy in a variety of temps. Whether the hood’s on or off, all the fabric is super light, so you never feel like you’ve got too much
stuff
on your hands. And, like many other picks on this list, they also have silicone grips on the palms and touchscreen-friendly fingertips.

Best Windproof: Brooks Draft Hybrid Glove

Draft Hybrid Glove

Fleet Feet
Pros
Attach together with a magnet
Windproof, water resistant mitt can cover fingers or be tucked away
Touchscreen-friendly fingertips
Cons
Seams can rip somewhat easily, according to Brooks reviewers
A common pair you’ll see on winter running paths is this popular Brooks glove. “They work really well because I can take the flap off the mitt and just have the glove part,”
Evy Gonzales
, a New York–based running coach with Game Changers, tells SELF. “It really does make a difference if I just don't want it as warm.”
She says she’s used her pair for years, taking advantage of the windproof, water resistant mitt when temperatures drop below freezing. One unique feature: There’s a magnet inside to keep the two gloves together when you’re not wearing them.

Trailheads
Pros
Zipper on the back of each hand
Ultra-soft lining
Extended cuff and Velcro tab lock in heat
Made with recycled materials
Cons
Bulky
Need to unzip them to use your phone or watch
For the coldest days, up the insulation with a solid pair of mittens. Our tester took these thermal ones from Trailheads out for a windy run when it was just nine degrees, and her hands were the only part of her that felt comfortable. The detail that sets this pair apart is the zipper on the back of each hand. You can open it up to quickly free your index finger—which you’ll need to do if you need to
use your smartwatch
or phone, since these mitts are bulky and not touchscreen-compatible.
Our tester also found that the opening came in handy when she overestimated how cold it actually was, and her palms started to get a little sweaty. With a simple unzip, she could let a little air flow in. Bonus: Trailheads says these can work as ski gloves too.

Cold hands are no match for these Hurricane Mitts—soft fleece creates cozy warmth inside, while a water-and wind-resistant outer layer keeps the elements out. They're also touchscreen-compatible (something you don’t often see in mittens), and the thumb features a conductive knit (so you can still scroll on your phone without having to take them off).

You might not think much about your hands when running. But if you forget to cover them up
when temps dip below 40 degrees
, they can quickly become a problem. “In cold weather, your body's trying to maintain that core warmth, so a lot of the blood flow is going to your core—a little bit less to your hands,”
Mohammad Saad, DPT
, a physical therapist at Hospital for Special Surgery in New York City, tells SELF.
A good pair of running gloves will give you an added layer of warmth to make up for that lack of circulation, keeping you a whole lot more comfortable and ensuring you’ll still have enough feeling in your fingers to rip open gels or stop
your running watch
. But there’s a wide range of options out there, from thin, knit pairs you might get at races to super-insulated mittens that can see you through arctic temps.
To find the best running gloves, SELF interviewed running coaches and physical therapists to get their recommendations and insights on what to look for in a good pair. We also wore several gloves in cold weather ourselves to see how they actually hold up. Here’s what to know if you’re on the hunt for your new favorite pair.

How to choose the best running gloves
Most activewear companies that cater to runners sell running gloves, so there are lots of options to choose from. Keep these three things in mind when you’re considering your options.
Materials
AccordionItemContainerButton
LargeChevron
For running, it’s best to choose moisture-wicking materials that provide warm insulation without being too bulky. “
Sweating
can be dangerous when you're running in the winter,” Gonzales says, since your skin loses heat faster when it’s wet. Synthetic fabrics like polyester are a good pick—or, if you want to go the natural route, look for Merino wool, she suggests.
Design
AccordionItemContainerButton
LargeChevron
Many running gloves offer a few design details that can come in handy when you’re on the move. If you plan to use your phone or track your miles with a smartwatch that has a touchscreen, choose gloves that have compatible tips at least on the thumb and index finger. Nurse and Saad both add that it’s helpful to have some reflective details if you plan to
run after dark
(although these elements are typically pretty minimal on gloves, so you might want to pair them with some high-visibility clothing). Many gloves also have silicone grips on the palms, fingers, or both to help you securely grab your phone or rip open that gel mid-stride.
Warmth
AccordionItemContainerButton
LargeChevron
The amount of insulation in running gloves can vary, so be sure to choose options that work for the climate you’ll be running in. Lightweight or liner gloves that offer some breathability are best for mild conditions. When it dips into the 20s or teens, you might want a thicker, midweight option. For more brutal winter weather, consider a mitten, which will trap your body heat better than gloves can, Dr. Saad says.
There are also hybrid glove/mitten options that can be helpful if you warm up over the course of a run, or when you’re heading on a trail run where conditions are likely to change mid-way through.
Frequently asked questions about running gloves
Why is it important to keep your hands warm while running?
AccordionItemContainerButton
LargeChevron
In short, it can help keep them healthy—and much more comfortable. Sub-freezing temps can lead to debilitating pain and may even cause nerve damage in extreme cases, Dr. Saad says. Even if conditions outside aren’t quite that dire, “having a pair of gloves keeps you from shivering and losing energy,” Boston-based running coach
Amanda Nurse
tells SELF.
How do you find the right glove size?
AccordionItemContainerButton
LargeChevron
Most companies offer a size chart with instructions on how to measure your hand. Some fit gloves based on the circumference around your knuckles, while others are based on the length of your hand from the edge of your wrist to the tip of your middle finger. Some brands tell you to measure both; in that case, go with the larger of those two measurements to make sure you’ve got enough room.
Are Merino gloves good?
AccordionItemContainerButton
LargeChevron
Merino wool is a great fabric for running clothes because it’s temperature-regulating, moisture-wicking, and odor-resistant. Nurse highly recommends Merino wool because “they create a great amount of warmth, but also they’re very breathable.”
Which running gloves provide the best warmth and breathability?
AccordionItemContainerButton
LargeChevron
For running gloves that are both warm and breathable, look into a hybrid glove/mitten like
Black Diamond’s Deploy Wind Hood Gloves
or
Brooks's Draft Hybrid Glove
. You can slip on the hood for extra protection or take it off if you start to overheat.

The North Face
Pros
All five fingers are touchscreen-compatible
Grippy dots on palm and fingers
Easily snap together when you take them off
Made with recycled materials
Cons
Inner stitching can feel itchy
This midweight pair of gloves from The North Face is decked out: All five fingers are touchscreen-compatible (and actually worked well during testing). Grippy dots along the palm and fingers make it easy to grab a zipper or a credit card while you’re on the go. After your run, the pairing clip allows you to easily snap both gloves together, so you won’t lose one.
Rather than a unisex fit, the
men’s
and
women’s
versions fit differently, which our tester loved—the material actually wrapped around her fingers properly and fit, well, like a glove. The only red flag? There’s some scratchy inner stitching that doesn’t feel great when you’re slipping them on. Once the gloves are in place though, it didn’t bother our tester or cause any chafing on her run.

Pros
Soft brushed fleece inside
Clip together
Grippy silicone on palms
Screen-friendly fingertips
Cons
Don't cover much of the wrist, according to Lululemon reviewers
Most running gloves look pretty darn plain, but you can
count on Lululemon
to make them a bit more stylish. A heathered grey and black colorway, curvy reflective design on the back of the hand, and grippy dotted print on the palms and fingers zhuzh up this basic accessory.
“They’ve always been a favorite of mine,” Nurse says. “They're just very comfortable and have a nice little stretch to them. My fingers aren't stiff or uncomfortable in them.” Lululemon’s Rulu fleece is known for being soft, stretchy, and sweat-wicking—a.k.a. ideal for running. Although some reviewers report that they’re a bit short on the wrist (and Nurse warns they’re not
super
warm), these gloves are great for runs when you want some lightweight, but still screen-friendly, coverage.

Inverno Gloves
$35
Tracksmith
Pros
Super soft, flexible fabric
Touchscreen pads on index finger and thumb
Extra-velvety brushed material along thumb and index finger
Very durable
Cons
No grips
Only available in two sizes
Fan favorite running brand Tracksmith has a reputation for making high-quality products that resonate with runners—including the not-so-glamorous parts of the sport. Think: All the snot that comes with logging cold, dry winter miles. Tracksmith’s lightweight Inverno Gloves feature super soft brushed material along the thumb and index finger that’s specifically designed for nose wipes. It’s a genius little detail that means your skin won’t get irritated, even when your nose won’t stop running. And yes, they wash up without any problems afterwards (although we’ve always followed the brand’s rec to let them air-dry).
Our tester has had an old pair that’s now seen her through four New England winters, and they still don’t show any signs of wear. “The stretchy knit fabric fits so snugly and easily on my hands that I almost forget I’m wearing gloves,” she says. Despite how lightweight they are, she says they keep her hands warm and happy, even when temps dip down into the teens.

Pros
Lightweight but warm

Smartwool reviewers say they run small
May not be warm enough for very cold weather
The soft Merino wool that lines the inside of these gloves keeps your hands surprisingly warm, even though they’re on the thinner side. Nurse says they’re ideal for harder workouts in the 20s or 30s “if you want your hands to be nice and warm, but not sweaty and gross—they’re a perfect weight.”
On the outside, recycled polyester helps keep the winter weather from creeping inside. During testing, we even found it kept our hands dry in the snow. But when conditions got especially chilly (in the low 20s or teens), we craved something a
little
thicker.

Best Midweight: Rabbit Tech Gloves
Rabbit
Tech Gloves

$36
Rabbit

Fleet Feet
Pros
Fleece inner lining
Touchscreen pads on index finger and thumb
Cinching around inner wrist keeps them secure without pinching
Cons
Material shows wear pretty easily
Only available in two sizes
When you want to keep your hands warm, but not
too
warm, we suggest reaching for Rabbit’s midweight Tech Gloves. They’re just thick enough to protect against temps in the teens, 20s, and 30s, with a thin strip of elastic sewn into the inner wrist to keep the cold out. Our tester particularly appreciated that there’s thinner material between the fingers to keep them from feeling too bulky.
But what really sets these gloves apart is the fleece lining: It’s downright dreamy, delivering exactly the kind of softness we wanted during testing. The only drawback is that the material isn’t the most durable—it got a little fuzzy along the palm and fingers after just a few wears.

Best Value: New Balance Lightweight Running Glove
Amazon
New Balance
Lightweight Running Glove
$19
Amazon
Pros
Touchscreen pads on index finger and thumb
Grippy silicone on palms
Stretchy, sweat-wicking fabric
Cons
Thin and not super durable, according to Amazon reviewers
Sure, you could pick up a bare bones pair of knit gloves for a few dollars pretty much anywhere. But for just a little more, this pair from New Balance is a far more runner-friendly option. The sweat-wicking fabric is designed to keep your hands dry (and the gloves from smelling, if you don’t wash them right away). There’s grippy silicone on your palms to help you securely hold onto your phone if you pull it out mid-run.
And, maybe most importantly, the thumb and forefinger both have touchscreen tips to let you easily swipe on your screen. Reviewers report that these gloves aren’t super warm, and that the stitching can come apart with heavy wear—but thousands still swear by them as a budget-friendly option for running in mild cold.

Best Hybrid: Black Diamond Deploy Wind Hood Gloves

Deploy Wind Hood Gloves
$50
Black Diamond

Campsaver
Pros
Optional wind-resistant, water-repellent hood
Light and flexible
Grippy pattern on palm
Two-year warranty
Cons
Some Black Diamond reviewers wish the hood was detachable
Winter weather can be finicky, and if your running route takes you from windier to warmer patches, it can be helpful to wear gloves that are more versatile. Black Diamond’s Deploy Wind Hood Gloves fit the bill, with a thin, wind-resistant mitt that you can pull over your fingers when things get extra breezy or stow inside the cuff once you heat up.
Our tester found that this design makes a major difference, effectively blocking the wind so her hands stayed comfy in a variety of temps. Whether the hood’s on or off, all the fabric is super light, so you never feel like you’ve got too much
stuff
on your hands. And, like many other picks on this list, they also have silicone grips on the palms and touchscreen-friendly fingertips.

Best Windproof: Brooks Draft Hybrid Glove

Brooks
Draft Hybrid Glove
$54
Fleet Feet
Pros
Attach together with a magnet
Windproof, water resistant mitt can cover fingers or be tucked away
Touchscreen-friendly fingertips
Cons
Seams can rip somewhat easily, according to Brooks reviewers
A common pair you’ll see on winter running paths is this popular Brooks glove. “They work really well because I can take the flap off the mitt and just have the glove part,”
Evy Gonzales
, a New York–based running coach with Game Changers, tells SELF. “It really does make a difference if I just don't want it as warm.”
She says she’s used her pair for years, taking advantage of the windproof, water resistant mitt when temperatures drop below freezing. One unique feature: There’s a magnet inside to keep the two gloves together when you’re not wearing them.

Best Mittens: Trailheads Convertible Zip Mitts

Convertible Zip Mitts

Trailheads
Pros
Zipper on the back of each hand
Ultra-soft lining
Extended cuff and Velcro tab lock in heat
Made with recycled materials
Cons
Bulky
Need to unzip them to use your phone or watch
For the coldest days, up the insulation with a solid pair of mittens. Our tester took these thermal ones from Trailheads out for a windy run when it was just nine degrees, and her hands were the only part of her that felt comfortable. The detail that sets this pair apart is the zipper on the back of each hand. You can open it up to quickly free your index finger—which you’ll need to do if you need to
use your smartwatch
or phone, since these mitts are bulky and not touchscreen-compatible.
Our tester also found that the opening came in handy when she overestimated how cold it actually was, and her palms started to get a little sweaty. With a simple unzip, she could let a little air flow in. Bonus: Trailheads says these can work as ski gloves too.

Cold hands are no match for these Hurricane Mitts—soft fleece creates cozy warmth inside, while a water-and wind-resistant outer layer keeps the elements out. They're also touchscreen-compatible (something you don’t often see in mittens), and the thumb features a conductive knit (so you can still scroll on your phone without having to take them off).

Exercising at home
is a great way to avoid crowded gyms, save some money on memberships, and make progress toward your fitness goals—on your own schedule. While we love
a good bodyweight workout
, adding the right machines and accessories to your setup can help keep your routine feeling fresh and challenging.
To track down the very best home gym equipment, we scoured dozens of sites, read tons of reviews, and even tested a bunch of options for ourselves as part of
SELF’s Home Fitness Awards
. We also spoke with personal trainers,
physical therapists
, and other experts to get their take on what makes high-end fitness gadgets truly great and safe to use. Whether you have an entire room to fill or just a corner to spare, you can find some highly effective gear below that can help make your living room sweat sessions a little easier and (dare we say?) more fun.

The benefits of at-home gym equipment
Convenience
AccordionItemContainerButton
LargeChevron
It’s the worst when you need to pause your circuit to awkwardly loiter near a row of occupied machines while you wait for one to free up. Or maybe it’s late enough that you don’t want to leave your house, but you’re awake and antsy, so you want to blast loud music and blow off some steam on the treadmill.
Having your own setup lets you break a sweat any time of day, for as long as you want to, without needing to commute to a new location or worry about hogging a machine for too long. It’s your space, and you get to make your own rules.
Privacy
AccordionItemContainerButton
LargeChevron
Whether you’re dipping your toe into the workout game for the first time in a while or trying a new-for-you modality your friend told you about, privacy allows you to experiment freely—i.e., dance as if no one is watching, figuratively or literally. With your own home workout setup, you can get to business when and how you want, without other gym goers watching over your shoulder.
What to look for when shopping for at-home gym equipment
Budget
AccordionItemContainerButton
LargeChevron
Franco Calabrese, DPT
, a physical therapist based in Chicago, tells SELF that “cost and size are the two biggest factors when it comes to finding the right piece of equipment for home.” The upfront expense of building a home gym could give you sticker-shock, but when you consider the costs of a gym membership, transportation to get there, and other fees, you might realize you’re setting yourself up to potentially save over time.
Many gym equipment brands offer discounts and financing options—plus, according to our expert-vetted list, some of the best home workout equipment is less pricey than you might expect.
Equipment type and size
AccordionItemContainerButton
LargeChevron
“If your space is limited, I would look for smaller and more versatile and quality items,” which can suit various workouts, Dr. Calabrese says: “Kettlebells, dumbbells, and resistance bands are the most effective, since they don’t take up a lot of space and they can be moved with ease from room to room or from inside to outside, depending on your preferred workout area.”
If you’re working with a smaller area, like a one-bedroom apartment, aim for space-saving gear like the
Sonic Boom
jump rope. You can also narrow your shopping search to target
compact equipment
or
smart home gyms
, both of which can save space compared to heftier options.
Fitness goals
AccordionItemContainerButton
LargeChevron
Okay, bad news: There’s no magical piece of equipment that’ll work for everyone’s individual fitness preferences and goals. But some products target lots of different muscle groups in a single workout, and we think they’re worth considering for your new space. “
Tonal
offers amazing pieces of equipment that allow you to perform a wide array of exercises to target muscles throughout the entire body,” says Dr. Calabrese. Dr. McCartney also recommends a rowing machine (you can shop our favorites below).
FAQs
What basic home gym equipment do I need?
AccordionItemContainerButton
LargeChevron
Everyone is different, but Dr. Calabrese recommends starting with kettlebells, dumbbells, and resistance bands because they’re small, easy to move, and cost effective.
What is the most effective home exercise equipment?
AccordionItemContainerButton
LargeChevron
Dr. McCartney recommends rowers because they provide a full-body workout;
research
has found that they can target around 80% of the body’s muscles at a time. We like the
Hydrow Wave
and
Concept2 RowErg
. Dr. Calabrese says smart home gyms like the
Tonal
can also be efficient pieces of equipment, given that they offer workouts that can target multiple muscle groups at a time.
How much does a full home gym machine cost to set up?
AccordionItemContainerButton
LargeChevron
The cost for a full home gym can vary from a few hundred dollars to a few thousand dollars depending on what and how many pieces of equipment you’re buying. But the most important piece of the equation is whether or not you use it. When it comes to exercise, “consistency is the key,” says Dr. Calabrese. “The ability to have something in the convenience of your own home will definitely increase the chances of staying consistent.”
Treadmills
The trusty treadmill is a staple in many home gyms, so it makes sense that there are tons of models to choose from, including super-connected smart treadmills and portable folding options with just the essential features.
Try a longtime favorite:
We’ve recommended the NordicTrack 1750 multiple times, including in our 2024 Home Fitness Awards. It’s an extremely sturdy machine with techy bells and whistles like streamable classes via iFit and an HD touchscreen—plus, it comes highly recommended by multiple running coaches.
A smart budget pick:
Horizon’s T101 treadmill is another favorite among experts. It doesn’t have as many added features as NordicTrack, but it costs less and provides a reliable ride with several preset programs.
To fold away:
If space is at a premium, the Home Fitness Award-winning ProForm Carbon TLX is a compact, foldable tread that our tester says is exceptionally stable and easy to use. It’s far less expensive than the NordicTrack 1750, but we found that it doesn’t look or feel cheap.

Exercise bikes
A stationary bike is a great purchase if you want to add some
low-impact cardio
to your routine. “Personally, I love
the Peloton bike
, but there are also excellent entry-level exercise bikes on the market,”
Ollie Thompson, CPT
, a personal trainer in London, tells SELF.
Like an at-home gym membership:
Though it’s a bit of a splurge, the
SELF Certified Peloton Bike+
truly lives up to the hype. Our tester says it’s “super comfortable” and easy to use, and compares the on-demand and live classes to an in-studio experience—they’re motivating, immersive, and fun.
Bike on a budget:
With 100 levels of magnetic resistance, BowFlex’s C6 lives in the home of one Home Fitness Awards judge (an indoor cycling instructor). The simple LCD screen only shows basic statistics like speed and distance, but there’s a stand to place your tablet or phone, so you can easily connect to apps like Peloton or Zwift to see more metrics.
For a more relaxed ride:
If a recumbent bike is more your style, consider the Home Fitness Award–winning Merach S19. Our tester likes that the pedals glide smoothly and almost silently, and that the resistance is easy to adjust mid-workout. Plus, the mesh seat is breathable enough that you won’t end up with swamp butt.

Rowing machines
The workout you get from a rowing machine—
part cardio, part strength-training
—is certainly efficient.
Rowing
can work muscles in your upper
and
lower body, so you can keep building endurance and challenging yourself, even as you get stronger.
Our fave high-tech option:
The Home Fitness Award–winning Hydrow Wave comes with hundreds of live and on-demand classes that should appeal to both beginners and more experienced users. It’s designed to replicate the feeling of being on the water without having to leave your living room.
What the pros use:
Coaches and pros swear by the established industry standard, Concept2’s RowERG, for a solid, somewhat “old-school” workout. Also a Home Fitness Award winner, it’s battery-powered and breaks down into two pieces for easy storage.

Ellipticals
Also ideal for low-impact cardio, an elliptical might be your perfect match if you want a workout that’s similar to running, but
easier on your knees
.
For interactive workouts:
NordicTrack’s Home Fitness Award-winning FS10i makes elliptical sessions fun, thanks to interactive, trainer-led iFit workouts in all kinds of gorgeous settings (our tester particularly enjoyed running on a beach in Hawaii). Just know that an iFit membership costs $39 a month, on top of the price of the elliptical itself.
Best budget pick:
Looking for a streamlined machine without any “smart” bells and whistles? Niceday’s budget-friendly elliptical has 16 resistance levels and comes highly recommended to SELF by personal trainers.

Under-desk exercisers
Working a desk job doesn’t have to mean
sitting still all day long
. Under-desk cardio machines “are really great for folks that just don’t have the time in their workday to get out for a walk or are trying to boost their activity level,” Massachusetts-based physical therapist
Haley Harrison, DPT, CSCS,
tells SELF.
Walk while you work:
If you want to boost your step count, we recommend Urevo’s budget-friendly
walking pad
, which won a Home Fitness Award for its impressively quiet belt. Dr. Harrison says hopping on this will activate new muscle groups and change your posture after spending hours in a chair.
To keep your legs moving while seated:

Smart home gyms
For a total-body workout, look into a smart home gym. These often feature a tall mirror or screen that streams classes and fitness instruction from the pros. “You can see the person doing it right there with you, so you can compare your form to their form,”
Rick Richey, CPT,
a personal trainer, faculty instructor for the National Academy of Sports Medicine, and founder of the Independent Training Spot in New York City, tells SELF. Expect an all-in-one, metric-tracking, trainer-led home workout (that, admittedly, can cost a pretty penny).
The smartest “smart” pick:
One 2023
Home Fitness Awards
judge appreciated the tailor-made workout experience she got from Tonal, which adds a digital cable machine to the screen. She noted that, as she gained strength, it automatically adjusted its weight and resistance settings to keep her challenged. “They’re super versatile, customizable, and space-saving,” Dr. Harrison says, adding that if you’ve got the budget, Tonal machines are some of the best home gym equipment you can buy. Tonal requires a 12-month membership in order to access its class library, which costs $60 per month (or $720 for a year).

Dumbbells
A pair of dumbbells
is one of the first pieces of home gym equipment that many trainers will recommend investing in. “Having basic weights is your foundation for strength training, which, in my opinion, is one of the best forms of at-home workouts,”
Lindsey Bomgren, NASM-CPT,
personal trainer and founder of online fitness platform Nourish Move Love, tells SELF.
Best all-in-one option:
Why waste precious space on a rack of dumbbells when you can opt for an adjustable pair, like this expert-recommended set from BowFlex? It won a Home Fitness Award three years in a row for its efficient design: Just drop the dumbbells in their case, select your desired weight, and lift. “It’s only ever two dumbbells. That’s all you need,” Richey says. “Talk about space-efficient.”
For a more analog vibe:
If you have space to spare, Bells of Steel’s dumbbells impressed our Home Fitness Award judges with their comfortable, ergonomic handles.

Kettlebell
Kettlebells are another home gym staple, Bomgren says. Sure, they’re also free weights, like dumbbells—but the attached handle makes them ideal for performing
explosive movements
that build power, like the classic kettlebell swing.
An adjustable workhorse:
In the same vein as BowFlex’s adjustable dumbbells, the SelectTech 840 Kettlebell prevents clutter with its wide selection of weight options from 8 to 40 pounds. No wonder it’s also a Home Fitness Award winner.
Smart bang for your buck:
If you want to go the more traditional route, Rep Fitness’s Home Fitness Award winners offer a great value. Our expert tester says the wide handles make them easier to maneuver than some other options out there.

Resistance bands
While light resistance bands can assist with
active recovery
and stretching, heavier ones can supplement your strength training: Throw a couple on a pull-up bar and do lat pull-downs, or wrap one around your legs during bodyweight exercises like lunges. “They’re so easy to travel with, so versatile, and take up zero space in your home,” Bomgren says. Also: “So affordable.”
A durable mini band set:
Cheap resistance bands can easily snap or break down over time, but our tester’s set of five bands from Fit Simplify has lasted four years so far, making it a Home Fitness Awards favorite.
For a stronger, fabric option:
Multiple trainers recommend the Home Fitness Award–winning Better Band from Committed HP for larger bodies: It comes in a ton of size and tension options, plus it has a hook attachment that makes the band easier to adjust.

Medicine ball
Speaking of versatility,
David Harvey, CPT
, a personal trainer and yoga instructor based in Texas, tells SELF that a medicine ball is a dependable piece of weight-training equipment to have on hand: Whether you’re working your arms, legs, or core, you can add one to a variety of exercises to up the intensity. Dr. Harrison says they’re particularly great for throwing exercises like slams (“if you don’t live above someone else!”) and loaded abdominal work like crunches. This Prosource ball comes in several weights and has a soft, slightly padded surface that’s easy to catch and grip.

Wearable weights
Wrist and ankle weights
can make various exercises a little tougher (but still approachable). “I like to recommend them to my friends who are intimidated by weights but still want to ramp up their workout routine,” Christine Choi, a certified personal trainer in Atlanta, tells SELF.
Extra pounds on a budget:
With a soft outer layer and secure Velcro, Henkelion’s wearable weights get the job done. They impressed our tester so much, we gave them a Home Fitness Award in 2024.
Weights with style:
Hilary Hoffman, NASM-CPT,
personal trainer and owner of New York’s SotoMethod fitness studio, recommends the Home Fitness Award–winning Bala Bangles. “If you’re looking for something that's aesthetically pleasing, it definitely fits the bill,” she says. The cute cuffs come in pastel hues that make them look more like cute accessories than workout gear.

Jump rope
When it comes to challenging cardio workouts in tight spaces, don’t overlook a jump rope. “That’s probably the best bang for your buck when it comes to small things that you can put away,” Richey says.
A top-quality basic:
Sonic Boom’s speed rope won a 2022 Home Fitness Award for its adjustable length and comfortable, grippy handles. It comes with two adjustable cables, so you can find the exact length you need.
Connected workouts:
If you want to be fancy (or need some help with how to get in a good jump rope sesh) Crossrope’s Bluetooth-connected handles will count your reps while the app gives you a guided workout. Our tester said it was the first time she ever actually
enjoyed
jumping rope. You can even get a ropeless set that won’t scuff your ceiling or floors—and can’t be tripped over.

Yoga mat
A good yoga mat
will cushion your joints while you stretch, provide a stable base during poses, and keep you from slipping and sliding when things get sweaty. “There’s definitely a difference between a cheap one and a more expensive one,” says Dr. Harrison, who’s also a certified yoga instructor. “If that's something you want to invest in, look into one of the nicer, more durable ones where you’re not going to slide around.”
To avoid slipping:
Manduka’s Pro yoga mat—described as the “Rolls Royce of yoga mats” by one instructor—is heavy-duty, easy to clean, and exceptionally grippy.
For extra room to stretch out:
We also like the Big Mat from Lululemon, which brought home the award for best mat for big and tall folks in 2023’s Home Fitness Awards. “Because it’s wider, longer, and thicker than other yoga mats, it protects your body (and floors!) really well,” one judge noted.
If you want a foldable option:
Hoffman recommends the Stakt mat. It’s a hefty 12 millimeters thick to give your joints plenty of cushioning and folds up if you need even more support (or want to turn it into a block for certain exercises).

Massagers
We can’t stress the importance of workout recovery enough, and using a massager can help make your off-days feel especially restorative. “They stimulate the muscle to the point that the muscle relaxes,” Richey says, adding that you can feel some major pain relief after a session.
For powerful handheld massages:
The Home Fitness Award–winning Theragun Mini is small enough to use with one hand, but still has plenty of power for kneading knots and breaking up tight fascia around your muscles.
Sit back and feel the squeeze:
Hyperice’s Normatec Go boots use air compression to massage your calves after a run, and come recommended by SELF’s director of fitness and food, Christa Sgobba, CPT. Our favorite part: All you have to do is strap them on, sit back, and relax—there’s zero effort required.

Foam roller
A foam roller is another recovery essential that both Richey and Bomgren say everybody should have. “They’re [an] awesome way to add mobility to your routine,” Bomgren says. “I get on my foam roller every single morning.”
Dig into those knots:
The Triggerpoint is a solid, Home Fitness Award–winning option. Its dense, textured grid has long, smooth sections for rolling out sensitive areas that need a gentler touch, as well as smaller spikes to dig into deep knots.
Add some vibes:
Hyperice’s Vyper 3 ups the ante by adding a little vibration. Bomgren loves the hard, rigid surface for soothing sore areas.

Suspension trainer
“If used correctly, the all-in-one TRX system can be the only piece of equipment that you need,” Victoria Nolan, an ACSM–certified personal trainer based in Houston, tells SELF. The Home2 System, in particular, won a SELF Home Fitness Award in 2023 for its low-tech setup that’s easy to use and provides a full-body workout with minimal fuss. “It’s perfect for home workouts,” Thompson says, since this one piece of equipment is versatile enough to build strength, improve mobility, and enhance stability and flexibility.
Bonus: The design helps make some exercises (like pistol squats) more accessible while amping up the intensity of others (think:
push-ups
with your feet in the straps).

Exercising at home
is a great way to avoid crowded gyms, save some money on memberships, and make progress toward your fitness goals—on your own schedule. While we love
a good bodyweight workout
, adding the right machines and accessories to your setup can help keep your routine feeling fresh and challenging.
To track down the very best home gym equipment, we scoured dozens of sites, read tons of reviews, and even tested a bunch of options for ourselves as part of
SELF’s Home Fitness Awards
. We also spoke with personal trainers,
physical therapists
, and other experts to get their take on what makes high-end fitness gadgets truly great and safe to use. Whether you have an entire room to fill or just a corner to spare, you can find some highly effective gear below that can help make your living room sweat sessions a little easier and (dare we say?) more fun.

The benefits of at-home gym equipment
Convenience
AccordionItemContainerButton
LargeChevron
It’s the worst when you need to pause your circuit to awkwardly loiter near a row of occupied machines while you wait for one to free up. Or maybe it’s late enough that you don’t want to leave your house, but you’re awake and antsy, so you want to blast loud music and blow off some steam on the treadmill.
Having your own setup lets you break a sweat any time of day, for as long as you want to, without needing to commute to a new location or worry about hogging a machine for too long. It’s your space, and you get to make your own rules.
Privacy
AccordionItemContainerButton
LargeChevron
Whether you’re dipping your toe into the workout game for the first time in a while or trying a new-for-you modality your friend told you about, privacy allows you to experiment freely—i.e., dance as if no one is watching, figuratively or literally. With your own home workout setup, you can get to business when and how you want, without other gym goers watching over your shoulder.
What to look for when shopping for at-home gym equipment
Budget
AccordionItemContainerButton
LargeChevron
Franco Calabrese, DPT
, a physical therapist based in Chicago, tells SELF that “cost and size are the two biggest factors when it comes to finding the right piece of equipment for home.” The upfront expense of building a home gym could give you sticker-shock, but when you consider the costs of a gym membership, transportation to get there, and other fees, you might realize you’re setting yourself up to potentially save over time.
Many gym equipment brands offer discounts and financing options—plus, according to our expert-vetted list, some of the best home workout equipment is less pricey than you might expect.
Equipment type and size
AccordionItemContainerButton
LargeChevron
“If your space is limited, I would look for smaller and more versatile and quality items,” which can suit various workouts, Dr. Calabrese says: “Kettlebells, dumbbells, and resistance bands are the most effective, since they don’t take up a lot of space and they can be moved with ease from room to room or from inside to outside, depending on your preferred workout area.”
If you’re working with a smaller area, like a one-bedroom apartment, aim for space-saving gear like the
Sonic Boom
jump rope. You can also narrow your shopping search to target
compact equipment
or
smart home gyms
, both of which can save space compared to heftier options.
Fitness goals
AccordionItemContainerButton
LargeChevron
Okay, bad news: There’s no magical piece of equipment that’ll work for everyone’s individual fitness preferences and goals. But some products target lots of different muscle groups in a single workout, and we think they’re worth considering for your new space. “
Tonal
offers amazing pieces of equipment that allow you to perform a wide array of exercises to target muscles throughout the entire body,” says Dr. Calabrese. Dr. McCartney also recommends a rowing machine (you can shop our favorites below).
FAQs
What basic home gym equipment do I need?
AccordionItemContainerButton
LargeChevron
Everyone is different, but Dr. Calabrese recommends starting with kettlebells, dumbbells, and resistance bands because they’re small, easy to move, and cost effective.
What is the most effective home exercise equipment?
AccordionItemContainerButton
LargeChevron
Dr. McCartney recommends rowers because they provide a full-body workout;
research
has found that they can target around 80% of the body’s muscles at a time. We like the
Hydrow Wave
and
Concept2 RowErg
. Dr. Calabrese says smart home gyms like the
Tonal
can also be efficient pieces of equipment, given that they offer workouts that can target multiple muscle groups at a time.
How much does a full home gym machine cost to set up?
AccordionItemContainerButton
LargeChevron
The cost for a full home gym can vary from a few hundred dollars to a few thousand dollars depending on what and how many pieces of equipment you’re buying. But the most important piece of the equation is whether or not you use it. When it comes to exercise, “consistency is the key,” says Dr. Calabrese. “The ability to have something in the convenience of your own home will definitely increase the chances of staying consistent.”
Treadmills
The trusty treadmill is a staple in many home gyms, so it makes sense that there are tons of models to choose from, including super-connected smart treadmills and portable folding options with just the essential features.
Try a longtime favorite:
We’ve recommended the NordicTrack 1750 multiple times, including in our 2024 Home Fitness Awards. It’s an extremely sturdy machine with techy bells and whistles like streamable classes via iFit and an HD touchscreen—plus, it comes highly recommended by multiple running coaches.
A smart budget pick:
Horizon’s T101 treadmill is another favorite among experts. It doesn’t have as many added features as NordicTrack, but it costs less and provides a reliable ride with several preset programs.
To fold away:
If space is at a premium, the Home Fitness Award-winning ProForm Carbon TLX is a compact, foldable tread that our tester says is exceptionally stable and easy to use. It’s far less expensive than the NordicTrack 1750, but we found that it doesn’t look or feel cheap.

Exercise bikes
A stationary bike is a great purchase if you want to add some
low-impact cardio
to your routine. “Personally, I love
the Peloton bike
, but there are also excellent entry-level exercise bikes on the market,”
Ollie Thompson, CPT
, a personal trainer in London, tells SELF.
Like an at-home gym membership:
Though it’s a bit of a splurge, the
SELF Certified Peloton Bike+
truly lives up to the hype. Our tester says it’s “super comfortable” and easy to use, and compares the on-demand and live classes to an in-studio experience—they’re motivating, immersive, and fun.
Bike on a budget:
With 100 levels of magnetic resistance, BowFlex’s C6 lives in the home of one Home Fitness Awards judge (an indoor cycling instructor). The simple LCD screen only shows basic statistics like speed and distance, but there’s a stand to place your tablet or phone, so you can easily connect to apps like Peloton or Zwift to see more metrics.
For a more relaxed ride:
If a recumbent bike is more your style, consider the Home Fitness Award–winning Merach S19. Our tester likes that the pedals glide smoothly and almost silently, and that the resistance is easy to adjust mid-workout. Plus, the mesh seat is breathable enough that you won’t end up with swamp butt.

Rowing machines
The workout you get from a rowing machine—
part cardio, part strength-training
—is certainly efficient.
Rowing
can work muscles in your upper
and
lower body, so you can keep building endurance and challenging yourself, even as you get stronger.
Our fave high-tech option:
The Home Fitness Award–winning Hydrow Wave comes with hundreds of live and on-demand classes that should appeal to both beginners and more experienced users. It’s designed to replicate the feeling of being on the water without having to leave your living room.
What the pros use:
Coaches and pros swear by the established industry standard, Concept2’s RowERG, for a solid, somewhat “old-school” workout. Also a Home Fitness Award winner, it’s battery-powered and breaks down into two pieces for easy storage.

Ellipticals
Also ideal for low-impact cardio, an elliptical might be your perfect match if you want a workout that’s similar to running, but
easier on your knees
.
For interactive workouts:
NordicTrack’s Home Fitness Award-winning FS10i makes elliptical sessions fun, thanks to interactive, trainer-led iFit workouts in all kinds of gorgeous settings (our tester particularly enjoyed running on a beach in Hawaii). Just know that an iFit membership costs $39 a month, on top of the price of the elliptical itself.
Best budget pick:
Looking for a streamlined machine without any “smart” bells and whistles? Niceday’s budget-friendly elliptical has 16 resistance levels and comes highly recommended to SELF by personal trainers.

Under-desk exercisers
Working a desk job doesn’t have to mean
sitting still all day long
. Under-desk cardio machines “are really great for folks that just don’t have the time in their workday to get out for a walk or are trying to boost their activity level,” Massachusetts-based physical therapist
Haley Harrison, DPT, CSCS,
tells SELF.
Walk while you work:
If you want to boost your step count, we recommend Urevo’s budget-friendly
walking pad
, which won a Home Fitness Award for its impressively quiet belt. Dr. Harrison says hopping on this will activate new muscle groups and change your posture after spending hours in a chair.
To keep your legs moving while seated:
DeskCycle’s
Home Fitness Award–winning
pedaler that lets you choose between eight levels of resistance has racked up over 10,000 five-star reviews on Amazon.

For a total-body workout, look into a smart home gym. These often feature a tall mirror or screen that streams classes and fitness instruction from the pros. “You can see the person doing it right there with you, so you can compare your form to their form,”
Rick Richey, CPT,
a personal trainer, faculty instructor for the National Academy of Sports Medicine, and founder of the Independent Training Spot in New York City, tells SELF. Expect an all-in-one, metric-tracking, trainer-led home workout (that, admittedly, can cost a pretty penny).
The smartest “smart” pick:

judge appreciated the tailor-made workout experience she got from Tonal, which adds a digital cable machine to the screen. She noted that, as she gained strength, it automatically adjusted its weight and resistance settings to keep her challenged. “They’re super versatile, customizable, and space-saving,” Dr. Harrison says, adding that if you’ve got the budget, Tonal machines are some of the best home gym equipment you can buy. Tonal requires a 12-month membership in order to access its class library, which costs $60 per month (or $720 for a year).

Dumbbells
A pair of dumbbells
is one of the first pieces of home gym equipment that many trainers will recommend investing in. “Having basic weights is your foundation for strength training, which, in my opinion, is one of the best forms of at-home workouts,”
Lindsey Bomgren, NASM-CPT,
personal trainer and founder of online fitness platform Nourish Move Love, tells SELF.
Best all-in-one option:
Why waste precious space on a rack of dumbbells when you can opt for an adjustable pair, like this expert-recommended set from BowFlex? It won a Home Fitness Award three years in a row for its efficient design: Just drop the dumbbells in their case, select your desired weight, and lift. “It’s only ever two dumbbells. That’s all you need,” Richey says. “Talk about space-efficient.”
For a more analog vibe:

Kettlebell
Kettlebells are another home gym staple, Bomgren says. Sure, they’re also free weights, like dumbbells—but the attached handle makes them ideal for performing
explosive movements
that build power, like the classic kettlebell swing.
An adjustable workhorse:
In the same vein as BowFlex’s adjustable dumbbells, the SelectTech 840 Kettlebell prevents clutter with its wide selection of weight options from 8 to 40 pounds. No wonder it’s also a Home Fitness Award winner.
Smart bang for your buck:
If you want to go the more traditional route, Rep Fitness’s Home Fitness Award winners offer a great value. Our expert tester says the wide handles make them easier to maneuver than some other options out there.

Resistance bands
While light resistance bands can assist with
active recovery
and stretching, heavier ones can supplement your strength training: Throw a couple on a pull-up bar and do lat pull-downs, or wrap one around your legs during bodyweight exercises like lunges. “They’re so easy to travel with, so versatile, and take up zero space in your home,” Bomgren says. Also: “So affordable.”
A durable mini band set:
Cheap resistance bands can easily snap or break down over time, but our tester’s set of five bands from Fit Simplify has lasted four years so far, making it a Home Fitness Awards favorite.
For a stronger, fabric option:
Multiple trainers recommend the Home Fitness Award–winning Better Band from Committed HP for larger bodies: It comes in a ton of size and tension options, plus it has a hook attachment that makes the band easier to adjust.

Medicine ball
Speaking of versatility,
David Harvey, CPT
, a personal trainer and yoga instructor based in Texas, tells SELF that a medicine ball is a dependable piece of weight-training equipment to have on hand: Whether you’re working your arms, legs, or core, you can add one to a variety of exercises to up the intensity. Dr. Harrison says they’re particularly great for throwing exercises like slams (“if you don’t live above someone else!”) and loaded abdominal work like crunches. This Prosource ball comes in several weights and has a soft, slightly padded surface that’s easy to catch and grip.

Wearable weights
Wrist and ankle weights
can make various exercises a little tougher (but still approachable). “I like to recommend them to my friends who are intimidated by weights but still want to ramp up their workout routine,” Christine Choi, a certified personal trainer in Atlanta, tells SELF.
Extra pounds on a budget:
With a soft outer layer and secure Velcro, Henkelion’s wearable weights get the job done. They impressed our tester so much, we gave them a Home Fitness Award in 2024.
Weights with style:
Hilary Hoffman, NASM-CPT,
personal trainer and owner of New York’s SotoMethod fitness studio, recommends the Home Fitness Award–winning Bala Bangles. “If you’re looking for something that's aesthetically pleasing, it definitely fits the bill,” she says. The cute cuffs come in pastel hues that make them look more like cute accessories than workout gear.

Jump rope
When it comes to challenging cardio workouts in tight spaces, don’t overlook a jump rope. “That’s probably the best bang for your buck when it comes to small things that you can put away,” Richey says.
A top-quality basic:
Sonic Boom’s speed rope won a 2022 Home Fitness Award for its adjustable length and comfortable, grippy handles. It comes with two adjustable cables, so you can find the exact length you need.
Connected workouts:
If you want to be fancy (or need some help with how to get in a good jump rope sesh) Crossrope’s Bluetooth-connected handles will count your reps while the app gives you a guided workout. Our tester said it was the first time she ever actually
enjoyed
jumping rope. You can even get a ropeless set that won’t scuff your ceiling or floors—and can’t be tripped over.

Yoga mat
A good yoga mat
will cushion your joints while you stretch, provide a stable base during poses, and keep you from slipping and sliding when things get sweaty. “There’s definitely a difference between a cheap one and a more expensive one,” says Dr. Harrison, who’s also a certified yoga instructor. “If that's something you want to invest in, look into one of the nicer, more durable ones where you’re not going to slide around.”
To avoid slipping:
Manduka’s Pro yoga mat—described as the “Rolls Royce of yoga mats” by one instructor—is heavy-duty, easy to clean, and exceptionally grippy.
For extra room to stretch out:
We also like the Big Mat from Lululemon, which brought home the award for best mat for big and tall folks in 2023’s Home Fitness Awards. “Because it’s wider, longer, and thicker than other yoga mats, it protects your body (and floors!) really well,” one judge noted.
If you want a foldable option:
Hoffman recommends the Stakt mat. It’s a hefty 12 millimeters thick to give your joints plenty of cushioning and folds up if you need even more support (or want to turn it into a block for certain exercises).

Massagers
We can’t stress the importance of workout recovery enough, and using a massager can help make your off-days feel especially restorative. “They stimulate the muscle to the point that the muscle relaxes,” Richey says, adding that you can feel some major pain relief after a session.
For powerful handheld massages:
The Home Fitness Award–winning Theragun Mini is small enough to use with one hand, but still has plenty of power for kneading knots and breaking up tight fascia around your muscles.
Sit back and feel the squeeze:
Hyperice’s Normatec Go boots use air compression to massage your calves after a run, and come recommended by SELF’s director of fitness and food, Christa Sgobba, CPT. Our favorite part: All you have to do is strap them on, sit back, and relax—there’s zero effort required.

Foam roller
A foam roller is another recovery essential that both Richey and Bomgren say everybody should have. “They’re [an] awesome way to add mobility to your routine,” Bomgren says. “I get on my foam roller every single morning.”
Dig into those knots:
The Triggerpoint is a solid, Home Fitness Award–winning option. Its dense, textured grid has long, smooth sections for rolling out sensitive areas that need a gentler touch, as well as smaller spikes to dig into deep knots.
Add some vibes:
Hyperice’s Vyper 3 ups the ante by adding a little vibration. Bomgren loves the hard, rigid surface for soothing sore areas.

Suspension trainer
“If used correctly, the all-in-one TRX system can be the only piece of equipment that you need,” Victoria Nolan, an ACSM–certified personal trainer based in Houston, tells SELF. The Home2 System, in particular, won a SELF Home Fitness Award in 2023 for its low-tech setup that’s easy to use and provides a full-body workout with minimal fuss. “It’s perfect for home workouts,” Thompson says, since this one piece of equipment is versatile enough to build strength, improve mobility, and enhance stability and flexibility.
Bonus: The design helps make some exercises (like pistol squats) more accessible while amping up the intensity of others (think:
push-ups
with your feet in the straps).

25 Signs of a Successful Workout That Have Nothing to Do With Sweat or Soreness
There are more legit ways to measure a great session—and, no, they’re not all physical.

You’re
gushing sweat
as your heart rate spikes. Your muscles feel like they’re on fire—and you know that tomorrow you’ll have trouble getting down the stairs (or even lowering yourself onto your toilet).
Surely all this means you’re crushing your workout, right? Not necessarily, physical therapist and strength coach
Susie Spirlock, DPT
, tells SELF. Metrics like sweat and soreness “are basically your Amazon two-day shipping style of markers for progress,” she says.
They might offer instant gratification, but in the end they’re essentially meaningless, if not counterproductive. That means that, whether you’re starting a new fitness routine or getting back to it, focusing on them can mess with your ability to create an actual, sustainable routine.
No, sweat and soreness don’t tell you if your workout is “working.”
Yes, you might drip more if you’re exercising more intensely. But factors like age and genetics matter too,
Nicole Winter
, a certified personal trainer, marathoner, and senior coach at the fitness app
Ladder
, tells SELF. For example, she often finds herself soaked in sweat while some of her running-group friends are barely glistening. Plus you’ll likely sweat more doing the exact same workout in the summer than in the cold of winter—that doesn’t mean it was more effective in June than December, Dr. Spirlock points out.
As for soreness, while it does sometimes indicate you’ve worked your muscles hard enough for them to adapt and rebuild stronger, that isn’t a requirement to making progress. In fact, Dr. Spirlock says she typically programs workouts so her clients don’t get too sore at first.
Extreme soreness
is often unpleasant enough to make people skip their next workout or put them off resistance training altogether—and it may mask the signs of a developing injury,
Christel Oerum
, a certified personal trainer and the cofounder and head coach of
Diabetes Strong
, tells SELF.
Finally, soreness naturally diminishes the more you work out, thanks to something called the repeated bout effect. The subsequent times you do a particular move, you sustain less painful muscle damage, according to a 2017 review of the topic published in
Exercise and Sport Science Reviews
.
So the more adept you get at a particular exercise, the
less
likely you are to feel sore from it. In fact, if you’re still feeling super achy a couple weeks into a new program, you might be bumping up your intensity too quickly or not allowing enough recovery time, Dr. Spirlock says.
Fortunately, there are many far more legit ways to measure a good workout—and not all of them are physical. Whether you’re a data-driven fitness geek or a more intuitive exerciser, here are some signs you can (and should!) count that day’s workout as a victory.
1. You feel better than when you started.
Not all the gains of exercise occur in your muscles, anyway. “We often neglect the
emotional benefits of just moving our bodies
,”
Leeja Carter, PhD
, an expert on inclusive and equity-focused practice in sport and health, tells SELF. “If it makes you feel good—if you feel like, ‘Hey, I’ve done something for my body and myself today and I’m just going to live in that gratitude’—I think that’s a win.”
2. Exercises you’ve done before seem easier.
Chicago-based certified personal trainer Rae Reichlin, founder of
Ladies Who Lift
, sets up her strength-building programs so clients are cycling through the same exercises for three to six weeks. She asks them to log their workouts, tracking not only their numbers, but also how each one felt.
Say you’re doing three sets of 12
goblet squats
with a 10-pound dumbbell. Week one, you might note: “That was so hard, I didn’t think I was gonna get through it,” she says. But the next week, the exact same pattern might feel much more manageable. That’s progress, she says.
Similar concepts apply to cardio. You might finish a fast interval less breathless than you did the week before, for instance, or be able to run for 10 minutes straight instead of alternating walking and running intervals, Oerum says.
3. Or you were able to make them harder.
Picking up a 12-pound weight instead of a 10-pound one for the same movement also means you’re building strength. If you’re using
resistance bands
, you might swap out a lighter blue band for a heavier purple one.
Added difficulty can also come from using a fuller range of motion (say, a lower squat) or trying a more advanced movement pattern. For example, holding the same weight but pausing at the bottom of that squat or adding a pulse to a lunge, Beverley Cheng, a Toronto-based trainer with a coaching company called
Born to Sweat
, tells SELF.
With cardio,
adding an incline on the treadmill,
an uphill to an outdoor run, or resistance to your indoor cycling bike is a sign you’ve moved forward. “It’s like in life—you need a little bit of pushback sometimes to make you a better person,”
Kellen Townsend
, a cycling instructor in Chicago, tells SELF.
4. You feel proud of your trends over time.
Those in-the-moment progressions can feel tiny and barely perceptible from one session to the next. And, in reality, you don’t always see linear progress. Injuries, a poor night of sleep, or a high-stress day at work can mean you can’t go as hard one day as you could the previous workout.
So Winter often encourages her Ladder clients to keep a journal of their workouts over time and flip back a few weeks or months to gauge how far they’ve come. “When you look back, you can see—‘Oh my gosh, I started doing a shoulder press with just 10 pounds, now I’m doing 20 pounds,” she says. This way, you can feel proud of each day’s contribution to the bigger picture.
5. You played with factors like tempo and time under tension.
Another reason you might not go heavier every single time, but are still making the most of each session: In a strength program, the weight you use and the pace at which you perform a movement can vary based on the goal of the exercise, Dr. Spirlock points out.
For instance, moving faster can increase power and improve tendon health; going slower and heavier builds strength and muscle mass. Knowing the difference—and being able to incorporate both, safely, into your routine—is a major sign of success, she says.
6. You hit the muscle groups you’d planned on.
For
Nichele Cihlar
—a certified strength and conditioning coach and the director of training at
GoRuck
—a
well-rounded week of workouts
includes a couple of cardio sessions and at least one day of strength work for each major muscle group. So she counts it a win for the day when she works her lower body on
leg day
or her arms, chest, and back on an upper body day (and a successful week when she gets it all in). That’s opposed to going to the gym without a plan at all or intending to tackle leg day, but instead cramming in a bunch of core work or treadmill sprints.
7. Your form improved.
Regardless of the weights you’re using while strength training, you’ll know you’ve crushed it if you can execute each move with better form. While form exists along a spectrum, Dr. Spirlock says—there’s no single “right” way to do most exercises—there’s a range of movement patterns that will likely feel safer and more effective for your body.
For instance, you might keep your back flatter during a move like a deadlift or a bent-over row, Reichlin says, or notice you’re using less momentum and more core strength to power you through a leg raise.
Tracking this is challenging if you don’t have an in-person trainer or coach, but Dr. Spirlock recommends filming yourself periodically and watching how your form changes over time. Even just feeling a greater sense of control throughout your movement or executing each rep at a steadier pace means you’re nailing it.
8. You’re actually
less
achy.
Back to soreness for a minute. You’ll likely feel less of it in areas you shouldn’t—say, your lower back after deadlifting or in joints like your knees instead of muscles like your glutes after squatting—as you progress in your plan and your form improves, Reichlin adds.
9. You’re standing a little taller.
Many people spend much of their work and leisure hours hunched over screens.
Exercises that strengthen your back muscles
—such as rows, pull-overs, assisted pull-ups (or even walking with a weighted pack)—can improve your posture, Cihlar says.
10. You’re more coordinated.
Not everyone has natural rhythm, but if you’re doing complex or fast-paced cardio, you’ll know you’re advancing when you master more steps or sequences. Alongside that, you’ll likely feel a surge of confidence. “Maybe I looked like a baby chicken that was just born when I first started, and now I look like a stallion,” dance fitness instructor Keaira LaShae, creator of the platform
If You Can Move
, tells SELF.
11. You feel empowered in a way that transcends fitness.
That self-assurance can also carry over into the rest of your life—say, work, school, relationships, or any other area where you might face challenges. Reichlin has a client whose mother passed away. “Within her grief, she’s coming back to that idea that, five days a week, she’s proving she can get through something really tough all on her own,” she says.
Townsend counts a class as a success when its feel-good vibes motivate him to keep that trend going: “If it encourages me to take some type of action in my life that isn’t necessarily tied to working out but is tied to my overall well-being,” he says. That might mean drinking more water, focusing on sleep,
planning some low-key hangs
with your pals, or even taking political action to advance a cause you care about.
12. You find everyday tasks easier (and maybe even a bit more fun).
Whether it’s having the endurance to chase after your kid or the
grip strength
to haul all your groceries inside in one trip, a great sign of a successful workout is the way it translates into your everyday life.
“I always think about carrying luggage,” Winter says. “Am I able to be the person that puts my bag up in the overhead bin—and am I also the person that can help somebody else do it? I want to be that person.”
13. You slept more soundly that night.
In a 2017 review of 34 studies published in
Advances in Preventive Medicine
, 29 found exercise improves both the quantity and quality of sleep. (Here’s
more about making the most of the connection
). For Carter, scheduling workouts for early evenings also acts as a cap on her workday. She’s less tempted to keep staring at her laptop screen into the evening, which translates into more quality sleep.
14. You felt the right muscles firing.
Another measure of success is a stronger mind-muscle connection, Reichlin says. That starts by knowing which areas each exercise is intended to work. If you don’t have a trainer or instructor cueing you, do a little background research on any moves you’re unsure about. (SELF’s
workouts
can help break it down for you.)
Then pay close attention to which muscles feel like they’re driving your movement. “Say you’re doing reverse lunges. You want to feel it in your glutes, your
hamstrings
, and a little bit in your quads,” Cheng says. If you do—and especially if the sensation is similar on both sides of a one-sided move—count it as a win. (And if not, you have a great goal for next time.)
15. You kept it up for longer.
As you gain fitness and endurance, you’ll notice you can keep moving for longer before you fatigue. You might start by being able to run 10 minutes, but eventually you can work your way up to 15, 20, and longer, Oerum says.
A similar calculus applies to strength training. “A sign of improved strength can be more weight, but it can also be more sets and more reps,” Reichlin says—extra helpful if you’re limited in your home equipment.
16. You’re less tired afterward.
As upbeat as they are, LaShae’s
dance workouts
aren’t easy: “Your legs may be shaking after the workout,” she says. That quivering itself means you worked hard—but so too does the fact that you don’t feel it as much once you start getting used to the workout.
17. And you maintain that energy buzz for longer.
In fact, once you get into a groove, regular workouts actually increase—rather than deplete—your energy throughout the day. “People think, I should be more tired because I’m working out harder,” Winter says. “But if you’re finding a good cadence of exercise that works for your body, you should find that you’re more energized throughout the day.”
For instance, long runs that might have once banished you to the couch for the rest of the weekend should eventually start to feel more routine. If you’re taking care of your body well and gradually building up, you’ll find you can successfully knock out a significant distance and still make a plan or two for Saturday and Sunday.
18. You’re looking forward to the next one.
Effective workouts should challenge you, but not to the point of dreading another one. At the end, you want to feel accomplished and invigorated: “You showed up, you showed out, you did your thing, and you can’t wait to do another one,” LaShae says.
That’s also one way Townsend measures his success as an instructor. “You want people to think about the workout the next day and to be like, I want to go back and do that again,” he says.
19. Your mood improved.
After her second baby, LaShae developed
postpartum depression
. Moving her body again was a big part of regaining her mental health. “Every day, I felt more like myself, more alive.” Even if you’re just a little down in the dumps, movement can lift you up. A short-term boost of feel-good chemicals like endorphins often follows a run or high-intensity interval session.
Of course, exercise doesn’t represent a standalone treatment for serious conditions like anxiety and depression, though it can go hand in hand with other treatments,
Michele Kerulis
, EdD, LCPC, an associate professor who specializes in general mental health, sport and exercise, and lifestyle and wellness at Northwestern University’s Family Institute, says. You should still seek help from a medical professional if you’re overwhelmed or thinking about hurting yourself or others. (Here’s
how to find a therapist
that works for you.) If you are in a crisis and need immediate help, don’t hesitate to contact your local hospital or the confidential
National Suicide Prevention Hotline
at 988, which is available 24/7.
20. You took a step in managing a physical condition.
Exercise also benefits people with a wide range of physical ailments, from arthritis to heart conditions. And while some of these perks add up over time, others can appear after a single session.
For people with type 2 diabetes, even 15 minutes of movement after a meal can have an instant impact on blood glucose management, Oerum says. Physical activity can also increase your insulin sensitivity; this means your blood sugar will come down by itself more efficiently, and if you use insulin you’ll need less of it.
“A benchmark of success is knowing that, by engaging in this physical activity, you’re taking that one step further in managing health issues,” Carter says.
21. You created space for yourself in a tumultuous time.
Between political turmoil, climate-related natural disasters, and the ability to follow it all (and fight about it) in real time via social media, the world can feel like a never-ending dumpster fire. “One benefit of physical activity, if you allow yourself to go there, is allowing you that time to be completely off from what’s happening in the world,” Carter says.
If you can essentially quiet your brain and enter a flow state—or even just succeed in putting your phone down for a few minutes—you’ll likely finish your workout feeling like a burden has been lifted. And that, in turn, can refresh you in a way that helps you take action toward the problems you care about, rather than simply spiral with anxiety.
22. You made a new or deeper connection with someone else.
Townsend thrives on the vibe of collective movement and aims to create visible space for people of color, the queer community, and others who
don’t always see themselves represented in boutique fitness
.
But as virtual fitness opportunities have proliferated these past few years, it’s become clear that social connections can exist outside physical proximity. Take Carter and her Peloton treadmill—by signing into a class, she feels linked to others with a goal of self-care. “I’m participating in a culture of health, virtually,” she says. “And being part of that culture, that community, feels really good.”
These associations don’t have to be in real time, either. Cheng’s
online programs
come with access to a Facebook group. There, she watches people who didn’t know each other at first turn into each others’ biggest cheerleaders. “It’s a big part of why they’re so successful,” she says.
23. You got in touch with music.
Studies
show
cranking up some music can help you work out longer and harder with less effort. Beyond that, lyrics can also reinforce powerful social messages, something Townsend has long kept in mind when building playlists for his classes.
He often places a premium on songs projecting empowerment and inclusivity—for instance, “My Love Is Your Love” by Whitney Houston. “I’m intentional with the messages that I want to get across around community and support and love, bringing those topics to light,” he says.
24. You showed up at all…
Really, any workout you completed and felt good about is an effective one. Setting aside time for physical activity is an important commitment to self-care and well-being, Carter says. If you honor that pledge even when your motivation is low, you’re reinforcing your own value and self-worth.
25. …or you listened to your body and didn’t.
Of course, there are some days when you’re not feeling it for good reason—you’re getting over an illness, preventing or
coming back from injury
, or just plain need a little more sleep instead of an early morning run or lifting session. In some cases, despite the always-push messages you may see on social media, the best workout for your overall fitness well-being might be
the one that you skip
.
“The purpose of exercising is to strengthen your muscles, your heart, your lungs, and your overall health,” Kerulis says. “But part of the psychological connection comes with being kind to yourself and knowing today is just not a good day for me to get out and get moving.

25 Signs of a Successful Workout That Have Nothing to Do With Sweat or Soreness

You’re
gushing sweat
as your heart rate spikes. Your muscles feel like they’re on fire—and you know that tomorrow you’ll have trouble getting down the stairs (or even lowering yourself onto your toilet).
Surely all this means you’re crushing your workout, right? Not necessarily, physical therapist and strength coach
Susie Spirlock, DPT
, tells SELF. Metrics like sweat and soreness “are basically your Amazon two-day shipping style of markers for progress,” she says.
They might offer instant gratification, but in the end they’re essentially meaningless, if not counterproductive. That means that, whether you’re starting a new fitness routine or getting back to it, focusing on them can mess with your ability to create an actual, sustainable routine.
No, sweat and soreness don’t tell you if your workout is “working.”
Yes, you might drip more if you’re exercising more intensely. But factors like age and genetics matter too,
Nicole Winter
, a certified personal trainer, marathoner, and senior coach at the fitness app
Ladder
, tells SELF. For example, she often finds herself soaked in sweat while some of her running-group friends are barely glistening. Plus you’ll likely sweat more doing the exact same workout in the summer than in the cold of winter—that doesn’t mean it was more effective in June than December, Dr. Spirlock points out.
As for soreness, while it does sometimes indicate you’ve worked your muscles hard enough for them to adapt and rebuild stronger, that isn’t a requirement to making progress. In fact, Dr. Spirlock says she typically programs workouts so her clients don’t get too sore at first.
Extreme soreness
is often unpleasant enough to make people skip their next workout or put them off resistance training altogether—and it may mask the signs of a developing injury,
Christel Oerum
, a certified personal trainer and the cofounder and head coach of
Diabetes Strong
, tells SELF.
Finally, soreness naturally diminishes the more you work out, thanks to something called the repeated bout effect. The subsequent times you do a particular move, you sustain less painful muscle damage, according to a 2017 review of the topic published in
Exercise and Sport Science Reviews
.
So the more adept you get at a particular exercise, the
less
likely you are to feel sore from it. In fact, if you’re still feeling super achy a couple weeks into a new program, you might be bumping up your intensity too quickly or not allowing enough recovery time, Dr. Spirlock says.
Fortunately, there are many far more legit ways to measure a good workout—and not all of them are physical. Whether you’re a data-driven fitness geek or a more intuitive exerciser, here are some signs you can (and should!) count that day’s workout as a victory.
1. You feel better than when you started.
Not all the gains of exercise occur in your muscles, anyway. “We often neglect the
emotional benefits of just moving our bodies
,”
Leeja Carter, PhD
, an expert on inclusive and equity-focused practice in sport and health, tells SELF. “If it makes you feel good—if you feel like, ‘Hey, I’ve done something for my body and myself today and I’m just going to live in that gratitude’—I think that’s a win.”
2. Exercises you’ve done before seem easier.
Chicago-based certified personal trainer Rae Reichlin, founder of
Ladies Who Lift
, sets up her strength-building programs so clients are cycling through the same exercises for three to six weeks. She asks them to log their workouts, tracking not only their numbers, but also how each one felt.
Say you’re doing three sets of 12
goblet squats
with a 10-pound dumbbell. Week one, you might note: “That was so hard, I didn’t think I was gonna get through it,” she says. But the next week, the exact same pattern might feel much more manageable. That’s progress, she says.
Similar concepts apply to cardio. You might finish a fast interval less breathless than you did the week before, for instance, or be able to run for 10 minutes straight instead of alternating walking and running intervals, Oerum says.
3. Or you were able to make them harder.
Picking up a 12-pound weight instead of a 10-pound one for the same movement also means you’re building strength. If you’re using
resistance bands
, you might swap out a lighter blue band for a heavier purple one.
Added difficulty can also come from using a fuller range of motion (say, a lower squat) or trying a more advanced movement pattern. For example, holding the same weight but pausing at the bottom of that squat or adding a pulse to a lunge, Beverley Cheng, a Toronto-based trainer with a coaching company called
Born to Sweat
, tells SELF.
With cardio,
adding an incline on the treadmill,
an uphill to an outdoor run, or resistance to your indoor cycling bike is a sign you’ve moved forward. “It’s like in life—you need a little bit of pushback sometimes to make you a better person,”
Kellen Townsend
, a cycling instructor in Chicago, tells SELF.
4. You feel proud of your trends over time.
Those in-the-moment progressions can feel tiny and barely perceptible from one session to the next. And, in reality, you don’t always see linear progress. Injuries, a poor night of sleep, or a high-stress day at work can mean you can’t go as hard one day as you could the previous workout.
So Winter often encourages her Ladder clients to keep a journal of their workouts over time and flip back a few weeks or months to gauge how far they’ve come. “When you look back, you can see—‘Oh my gosh, I started doing a shoulder press with just 10 pounds, now I’m doing 20 pounds,” she says. This way, you can feel proud of each day’s contribution to the bigger picture.
5. You played with factors like tempo and time under tension.
Another reason you might not go heavier every single time, but are still making the most of each session: In a strength program, the weight you use and the pace at which you perform a movement can vary based on the goal of the exercise, Dr. Spirlock points out.
For instance, moving faster can increase power and improve tendon health; going slower and heavier builds strength and muscle mass. Knowing the difference—and being able to incorporate both, safely, into your routine—is a major sign of success, she says.
6. You hit the muscle groups you’d planned on.
For
Nichele Cihlar
—a certified strength and conditioning coach and the director of training at
GoRuck
—a
well-rounded week of workouts
includes a couple of cardio sessions and at least one day of strength work for each major muscle group. So she counts it a win for the day when she works her lower body on
leg day
or her arms, chest, and back on an upper body day (and a successful week when she gets it all in). That’s opposed to going to the gym without a plan at all or intending to tackle leg day, but instead cramming in a bunch of core work or treadmill sprints.
7. Your form improved.
Regardless of the weights you’re using while strength training, you’ll know you’ve crushed it if you can execute each move with better form. While form exists along a spectrum, Dr. Spirlock says—there’s no single “right” way to do most exercises—there’s a range of movement patterns that will likely feel safer and more effective for your body.
For instance, you might keep your back flatter during a move like a deadlift or a bent-over row, Reichlin says, or notice you’re using less momentum and more core strength to power you through a leg raise.
Tracking this is challenging if you don’t have an in-person trainer or coach, but Dr. Spirlock recommends filming yourself periodically and watching how your form changes over time. Even just feeling a greater sense of control throughout your movement or executing each rep at a steadier pace means you’re nailing it.
8. You’re actually
less
achy.
Back to soreness for a minute. You’ll likely feel less of it in areas you shouldn’t—say, your lower back after deadlifting or in joints like your knees instead of muscles like your glutes after squatting—as you progress in your plan and your form improves, Reichlin adds.
9. You’re standing a little taller.
Many people spend much of their work and leisure hours hunched over screens.
Exercises that strengthen your back muscles
—such as rows, pull-overs, assisted pull-ups (or even walking with a weighted pack)—can improve your posture, Cihlar says.
10. You’re more coordinated.
Not everyone has natural rhythm, but if you’re doing complex or fast-paced cardio, you’ll know you’re advancing when you master more steps or sequences. Alongside that, you’ll likely feel a surge of confidence. “Maybe I looked like a baby chicken that was just born when I first started, and now I look like a stallion,” dance fitness instructor Keaira LaShae, creator of the platform
If You Can Move
, tells SELF.
11. You feel empowered in a way that transcends fitness.
That self-assurance can also carry over into the rest of your life—say, work, school, relationships, or any other area where you might face challenges. Reichlin has a client whose mother passed away. “Within her grief, she’s coming back to that idea that, five days a week, she’s proving she can get through something really tough all on her own,” she says.
Townsend counts a class as a success when its feel-good vibes motivate him to keep that trend going: “If it encourages me to take some type of action in my life that isn’t necessarily tied to working out but is tied to my overall well-being,” he says. That might mean drinking more water, focusing on sleep,
planning some low-key hangs
with your pals, or even taking political action to advance a cause you care about.
12. You find everyday tasks easier (and maybe even a bit more fun).
Whether it’s having the endurance to chase after your kid or the
grip strength
to haul all your groceries inside in one trip, a great sign of a successful workout is the way it translates into your everyday life.
“I always think about carrying luggage,” Winter says. “Am I able to be the person that puts my bag up in the overhead bin—and am I also the person that can help somebody else do it? I want to be that person.”
13. You slept more soundly that night.
In a 2017 review of 34 studies published in
Advances in Preventive Medicine
, 29 found exercise improves both the quantity and quality of sleep. (Here’s
more about making the most of the connection
). For Carter, scheduling workouts for early evenings also acts as a cap on her workday. She’s less tempted to keep staring at her laptop screen into the evening, which translates into more quality sleep.
14. You felt the right muscles firing.
Another measure of success is a stronger mind-muscle connection, Reichlin says. That starts by knowing which areas each exercise is intended to work. If you don’t have a trainer or instructor cueing you, do a little background research on any moves you’re unsure about. (SELF’s
workouts
can help break it down for you.)
Then pay close attention to which muscles feel like they’re driving your movement. “Say you’re doing reverse lunges. You want to feel it in your glutes, your
hamstrings
, and a little bit in your quads,” Cheng says. If you do—and especially if the sensation is similar on both sides of a one-sided move—count it as a win. (And if not, you have a great goal for next time.)
15. You kept it up for longer.
As you gain fitness and endurance, you’ll notice you can keep moving for longer before you fatigue. You might start by being able to run 10 minutes, but eventually you can work your way up to 15, 20, and longer, Oerum says.
A similar calculus applies to strength training. “A sign of improved strength can be more weight, but it can also be more sets and more reps,” Reichlin says—extra helpful if you’re limited in your home equipment.
16. You’re less tired afterward.
As upbeat as they are, LaShae’s
dance workouts
aren’t easy: “Your legs may be shaking after the workout,” she says. That quivering itself means you worked hard—but so too does the fact that you don’t feel it as much once you start getting used to the workout.
17. And you maintain that energy buzz for longer.
In fact, once you get into a groove, regular workouts actually increase—rather than deplete—your energy throughout the day. “People think, I should be more tired because I’m working out harder,” Winter says. “But if you’re finding a good cadence of exercise that works for your body, you should find that you’re more energized throughout the day.”
For instance, long runs that might have once banished you to the couch for the rest of the weekend should eventually start to feel more routine. If you’re taking care of your body well and gradually building up, you’ll find you can successfully knock out a significant distance and still make a plan or two for Saturday and Sunday.
18. You’re looking forward to the next one.
Effective workouts should challenge you, but not to the point of dreading another one. At the end, you want to feel accomplished and invigorated: “You showed up, you showed out, you did your thing, and you can’t wait to do another one,” LaShae says.
That’s also one way Townsend measures his success as an instructor. “You want people to think about the workout the next day and to be like, I want to go back and do that again,” he says.
19. Your mood improved.
After her second baby, LaShae developed
postpartum depression
. Moving her body again was a big part of regaining her mental health. “Every day, I felt more like myself, more alive.” Even if you’re just a little down in the dumps, movement can lift you up. A short-term boost of feel-good chemicals like endorphins often follows a run or high-intensity interval session.
Of course, exercise doesn’t represent a standalone treatment for serious conditions like anxiety and depression, though it can go hand in hand with other treatments,
Michele Kerulis
, EdD, LCPC, an associate professor who specializes in general mental health, sport and exercise, and lifestyle and wellness at Northwestern University’s Family Institute, says. You should still seek help from a medical professional if you’re overwhelmed or thinking about hurting yourself or others. (Here’s
how to find a therapist
that works for you.) If you are in a crisis and need immediate help, don’t hesitate to contact your local hospital or the confidential
National Suicide Prevention Hotline
at 988, which is available 24/7.
20. You took a step in managing a physical condition.
Exercise also benefits people with a wide range of physical ailments, from arthritis to heart conditions. And while some of these perks add up over time, others can appear after a single session.
For people with type 2 diabetes, even 15 minutes of movement after a meal can have an instant impact on blood glucose management, Oerum says. Physical activity can also increase your insulin sensitivity; this means your blood sugar will come down by itself more efficiently, and if you use insulin you’ll need less of it.
“A benchmark of success is knowing that, by engaging in this physical activity, you’re taking that one step further in managing health issues,” Carter says.
21. You created space for yourself in a tumultuous time.
Between political turmoil, climate-related natural disasters, and the ability to follow it all (and fight about it) in real time via social media, the world can feel like a never-ending dumpster fire. “One benefit of physical activity, if you allow yourself to go there, is allowing you that time to be completely off from what’s happening in the world,” Carter says.
If you can essentially quiet your brain and enter a flow state—or even just succeed in putting your phone down for a few minutes—you’ll likely finish your workout feeling like a burden has been lifted. And that, in turn, can refresh you in a way that helps you take action toward the problems you care about, rather than simply spiral with anxiety.
22. You made a new or deeper connection with someone else.
Townsend thrives on the vibe of collective movement and aims to create visible space for people of color, the queer community, and others who
don’t always see themselves represented in boutique fitness
.
But as virtual fitness opportunities have proliferated these past few years, it’s become clear that social connections can exist outside physical proximity. Take Carter and her Peloton treadmill—by signing into a class, she feels linked to others with a goal of self-care. “I’m participating in a culture of health, virtually,” she says. “And being part of that culture, that community, feels really good.”
These associations don’t have to be in real time, either. Cheng’s
online programs
come with access to a Facebook group. There, she watches people who didn’t know each other at first turn into each others’ biggest cheerleaders. “It’s a big part of why they’re so successful,” she says.
23. You got in touch with music.
Studies
show
cranking up some music can help you work out longer and harder with less effort. Beyond that, lyrics can also reinforce powerful social messages, something Townsend has long kept in mind when building playlists for his classes.
He often places a premium on songs projecting empowerment and inclusivity—for instance, “My Love Is Your Love” by Whitney Houston. “I’m intentional with the messages that I want to get across around community and support and love, bringing those topics to light,” he says.
24. You showed up at all…
Really, any workout you completed and felt good about is an effective one. Setting aside time for physical activity is an important commitment to self-care and well-being, Carter says. If you honor that pledge even when your motivation is low, you’re reinforcing your own value and self-worth.
25. …or you listened to your body and didn’t.
Of course, there are some days when you’re not feeling it for good reason—you’re getting over an illness, preventing or
coming back from injury
, or just plain need a little more sleep instead of an early morning run or lifting session. In some cases, despite the always-push messages you may see on social media, the best workout for your overall fitness well-being might be
the one that you skip
.
“The purpose of exercising is to strengthen your muscles, your heart, your lungs, and your overall health,” Kerulis says. “But part of the psychological connection comes with being kind to yourself and knowing today is just not a good day for me to get out and get moving.

Full-body routines
are great and all, but there’s just something special about leg day. A solid leg workout plan gives you a chance to challenge some of your biggest and strongest muscles. After all, the very nature of most leg exercises means you’re bound to hit your glutes—the largest muscles of them all—in addition to your lower parts, making for a perfect chance to show your entire lower body (and even your core) the love it deserves.
So what’s the best program to get it done? This isn’t a case where more equals better. But with smart exercise selection and evidence-backed training, you can build an amazing leg workout plan that will help you reach your goals in the gym
and
feel better outside of it.
Below, your guide to building a leg workout routine that’s smart, effective, and doesn’t require you to waste a ton of extra time.
What muscles should you work during leg day?
“On leg day, it’s important to hit all of the major muscle groups of your lower body—the glutes, quadriceps, and hamstrings—in some capacity, while also making sure to hit the smaller muscle groups that may not receive as much outright love or acknowledgement, like the hip flexors, abductors, adductors, and calves,”
Jowan Ortega, MS, CSCS
, partner at
Form Fitness Brooklyn
, tells SELF. Those muscles all play a role in the function and strength of your legs, and ultimately your entire body.
According to
Or Artzi, CPT
, founder of the
Orriors App
and Equinox group fitness instructor, here’s a quick breakdown on what each does:
Quadriceps
(front of the thighs): Responsible for knee extension, or straightening your knee
Hamstrings
(back of the thighs): Control knee flexion (bending it) and assist with hip extension (like if you were to bring your leg back behind you before kicking a soccer ball)
Glutes
(butt): Crucial for hip stability, strength, and power
Calves
(lower legs): Support ankle stability and movement
Adductors and
abductors
(inner and outer thighs): Aid hip stability and control movement in multiple planes of motion
As a bonus, most exercises that hit the leg muscles will also involve some sneaky core work. “The core stabilizes and supports all lower-body movements,” Artzi tells SELF.
What kind of exercises should you include in a leg workout?
On leg day, you want to hit all of the major movement patterns that your lower body can do,
Christine Torde, CPT
, strength coach at
Bodyspace Fitness
in New York City, tells SELF. That includes the squat, hinge, and both bilateral (engaging body sides of the body at once) and unilateral (single-side) exercises. Basically, a squat involves bending the knees and moving the hips downward, while a hinge keeps the bending movement at the hips and focuses on pushing them back.
Some of the best leg exercises in these categories include:
Bilateral squat: front squat, air squat, goblet squat, sumo squat
Unilateral squat: split squat, reverse lunge, walking lunge, Bulgarian split squat, lateral lunge, curtsy lunge
Bilateral hinge: deadlift, hip thrust, kettlebell swing
Unilateral hinge: kickstand deadlift, single-leg deadlift, single-leg glute bridge
These are all known as
compound exercises
, which work multiple muscle groups in one fell swoop—and, according to Ortega, should make up the lion’s share of your lower-body workouts. She suggests building them around a few compound exercises that work your leg muscles using the squat and hinge movement patterns, and then adding in some accessory or isolation movements (like a leg curl, leg extension, or calf raise) to complement them (if you want) and zero in more closely on the smaller related muscles.
The direction in which you move matters too. “If you are someone who likes to participate in sports like running, tennis, golf, soccer, or basketball, I also recommend training in different planes of motion,” Torde tells SELF. A plane of motion essentially refers to the direction your body moves in. In everyday life, we primarily move forward and backward, but sometimes we move side-to-side or in a twisting motion (say, when you’re getting into a car or swinging a tennis racket). “We live in a world that requires us to move in all three planes,” Ortega explains. “Having a balance of movements that challenge you within these planes is a way to reduce your risk for injury, improve your ability to function day-to-day, and make you more likely to achieve your fitness goals.”
Here, Ortega suggests some good leg-day exercises that fall under each of the body’s planes of motion:
Forward and backward (sagittal plane): back squats, forward lunges, vertical jumping, step-up
Side-to-side (frontal plane): lateral lunges, side-lying leg raises, lateral shuffles
Twisting (transverse plane): seated hip abduction and adduction machines, clam shell, banded fire hydrant
Torde suggests using a mix of free-weight exercises—those that use equipment like dumbbells, barbells, and kettlebells—and machine exercises (like the leg press machine) and to hit on all of these movement patterns and train your body in every direction. If you’re just starting out, you can stick with bodyweight for most of these exercises until you feel comfortable adding weight.
How many exercises, sets, and reps should you do in your leg workout?
“If you are intentional about your movement choices, you don’t have to do 15 different movements or spend two-plus hours working out to achieve your goals,” Ortega says. An effective leg-day workout routine can have just four or five exercises, Artzi says. “One exercise per movement pattern can be enough if you focus on consistent,
progressive overload
,” she adds, meaning that you increase the resistance as you get stronger to keep challenging your muscles. “You don’t need a long list of exercises—just work on form, intensity, and progression.”
The exact number of exercises, sets, and reps that you do on leg day comes down to your goals, Artzi adds. To figure out the magic numbers for you, consider the following:
What is your goal? (e.g., building muscle mass, increasing strength for running or another sport, maintaining strength as you age)
How much time do you have? How many leg workouts can you fit into your week?
What is your level of experience?
Some general suggestions: If you’re more of a beginner or it has been quite a while since you have worked out and are looking for a general place to start, Ortega recommends staying in the 8–12 rep range, performing two to three sets of each movement. “This is a nice way to set yourself up to work until fatigue as opposed to failure.” Meaning, you don’t need to be totally spent, unable to do one more rep, by the end. But you should be lifting something heavy enough that you feel tired and ready for a recovery period when you’re done. In between sets, rest around 60 seconds.
For hypertrophy, or building muscle mass, aim for three sets of 12 reps with moderately heavy weights. You’ll want to choose a weight for both of these that leaves you feeling pretty spent—like you can barely eke out one more rep with good form. Between sets, you’ll want to rest for 60 to 90 seconds, so that your muscles can recover enough for the next round.
If you are looking to
really
max out on absolute strength gains, Torde recommends lifting heavy weights in four sets of about six reps. (if you’re comfortable with the moves, you can go even lower, to five or fewer). When you’re lifting this heavy, rest between sets should be in the three to five minute range.
What’s a good leg day schedule?
Again, this depends on your goals and experience. In general, you don’t want to work the same muscle groups too often, since it’s “important to give your muscles time to recover and rebuild between workouts,” Ortega says. “Traditional rule of thumb is to train each muscle group two to three times a week with at least one day of rest in between.” Torde and Artzi agree that two days per week is a good leg-day schedule for many people.
And once you’re at the gym, should you
only
do your lifting or can you use that time to get in some cardio too? “There have been some questions whether or not to perform cardio on leg day but, again, that can be quite subjective,” Ortega says. The controversy comes from
old research
that found folks who did cardio in the same session as strength training didn’t gain as much leg strength over the course of 10 weeks as those who focused solely on resistance training. However,
newer research
has found that combining aerobic and strength training does not mess with gains in muscle mass and strength.
Ortega says that, ultimately, there’s no perfect one-size-fits-all answer, and for most people, it’s absolutely fine to do cardio on leg day. “I sometimes suggest doing cardio as the warm-up so you can get it over with and out of the way. Others prefer to do it at the end of their workout routine, because it ensures that they won’t overdo it.” (There’s something to be said for going into the strength portion of your session with fresh legs.) For more detailed info on how to structure your leg day and cardio work,
check out our recs here
.
Even if you decide to go with just your leg day, there can be a nice benefit to ending with a little sweat: A quick high-intensity finisher—say, kettlebell swings, burpees, or squat jumps—at the end of your workout can also be a nice way to get your heart in on the action before wrapping up, Torde adds.
What’s an example of a good leg day workout?
Using the experts’ advice, we put together a couple sample leg-day workouts to help you get started. Before jumping into it, make sure to do a dynamic warm-up (like
these two
that feature bodyweight versions of the key movement patterns) to get your muscles primed and ready for the work ahead.
Leg-Day Workout #1
Do 8-12 reps of each exercise below. Rest for 60 to 90 seconds after each set. Repeat for a total of 3 sets, then go onto the next exercise.
Goblet Squat
Katie Thompson
Stand with your feet slightly wider than hip-width apart, toes slightly turned out, holding a dumbbell with both hands in front of your chest so it hangs vertically. (You can also do this with a kettlebell if you prefer.)
Engage your core and keep your chest lifted and back flat as you shift your weight into your heels, push your hips back, and bend your knees to lower into a squat.
Drive through your heels to stand and squeeze your glutes at the top. This is 1 rep.
Single-Leg Deadlift
Katie Thompson
Stand with your feet together, holding a dumbbell in your left hand in front of your legs. This is the starting position.
Shift your weight to your right leg, and while keeping a slight bend in your right knee, raise your left leg straight behind your body, hinging at the hips to bring your torso parallel to the floor, and lower the weight toward the floor.
Keep your back flat. At the bottom of the movement, your torso and left leg should be almost parallel to the floor, with the weight a few inches off the ground. (If your hamstrings are tight, you may not be able to lift your leg as high.)
Keeping your core tight, push through your right heel to stand up straight and pull the weight back up to the starting position. Bring your left leg back down to meet your right, but try to keep the majority of the weight on your right foot.
Pause there and squeeze your butt. That’s 1 rep.
After completing all your reps on one side, repeat on the other side.
Hamstring Curl
Katie Thompson
Lie face down on a mat with your legs extended and arms supporting your chest. Grasp a dumbbell securely between your feet. (You can have a friend place it there, or you can stand up your dumbbell and grab it with your feet). This is starting position.
Engage your glutes and curl your legs up toward your butt.
Slowly lower back to the starting position. This is 1 rep.
Lateral Lunge
Katie Thompson
Stand with your feet hip-width apart. Hold your hands together at your chest. (You can also do this weighted if you’d prefer; hold a dumbbell in both hands at your chest as pictured.) This is the starting position.
Take a big step out to the left. Bend your left knee, hinge forward at the hips, and sit your butt back to lower into a lateral lunge. Keep your chest lifted and core engaged, and make sure your knee doesn't move forward beyond your toes.
Push through your left heel to return to the starting position. That’s 1 rep. Do all your reps on one leg and then repeat on the other side.
Leg-Day Workout #2
Do 8-12 reps of each exercise below. Rest for 60 to 90 seconds after each set. Repeat for a total of 3 sets, then go onto the next exercise. Repeat for a total of 3 sets.
Romanian Deadlift
Katie Thompson
Stand with your feet hip-width apart, knees slightly bent, and your arms relaxed by the front of your quads, with a dumbbell in each hand. This is the starting position.
Hinge forward at your hips and bend your knees slightly as you push your butt way back. Keeping your back flat, slowly lower the weight along your shins. Your torso should be almost parallel to the floor.
Keeping your core engaged, push through your heels to stand up straight and return to the starting position. Keep the weight close to your shins as you pull.
Pause at the top and squeeze your butt. That’s 1 rep.
Curtsy Lunge
Katie Thompson
Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and hold a pair of dumbbells at your side. This is the starting position.
Step your right foot diagonally behind you and lower your right knee until it almost touches the floor. Your front knee should bend to about 90 degrees.
Drive through your left heel to stand back up and return to the starting position. This is 1 rep. Do all your reps on one side, then switch sides.
Sumo Squat
Katie Thompson
Stand with your feet wider than shoulder-width apart, toes turned out. Hold a dumbbell with both hands in front of your chest so it hangs vertically.
Engage your core and keep your chest lifted and back flat as you shift your weight into your heels. Push your hips back and bend your knees to lower into a squat.
Drive through your heels to stand and squeeze your glutes at the top for 1 rep.
Kneeling Leg Extension
Katie Thompson
Get into a kneeling position with your knees hip-distance apart, torso tall, core and legs engaged, and hands on your hips. This is the starting position.
Keeping a flat back and hips extended, slowly tip your torso backward until your butt is a few inches away from your heels. Pause, then slowly reverse the movement to return to the starting position. This is 1 rep.

are great and all, but there’s just something special about leg day. A solid leg workout plan gives you a chance to challenge some of your biggest and strongest muscles. After all, the very nature of most leg exercises means you’re bound to hit your glutes—the largest muscles of them all—in addition to your lower parts, making for a perfect chance to show your entire lower body (and even your core) the love it deserves.
So what’s the best program to get it done? This isn’t a case where more equals better. But with smart exercise selection and evidence-backed training, you can build an amazing leg workout plan that will help you reach your goals in the gym
and
feel better outside of it.
Below, your guide to building a leg workout routine that’s smart, effective, and doesn’t require you to waste a ton of extra time.
What muscles should you work during leg day?
“On leg day, it’s important to hit all of the major muscle groups of your lower body—the glutes, quadriceps, and hamstrings—in some capacity, while also making sure to hit the smaller muscle groups that may not receive as much outright love or acknowledgement, like the hip flexors, abductors, adductors, and calves,”
Jowan Ortega, MS, CSCS
, partner at
Form Fitness Brooklyn
, tells SELF. Those muscles all play a role in the function and strength of your legs, and ultimately your entire body.
According to
Or Artzi, CPT
, founder of the
Orriors App
and Equinox group fitness instructor, here’s a quick breakdown on what each does:
Quadriceps
(front of the thighs): Responsible for knee extension, or straightening your knee
Hamstrings
(back of the thighs): Control knee flexion (bending it) and assist with hip extension (like if you were to bring your leg back behind you before kicking a soccer ball)
Glutes
(butt): Crucial for hip stability, strength, and power
Calves
(lower legs): Support ankle stability and movement
Adductors and
abductors
(inner and outer thighs): Aid hip stability and control movement in multiple planes of motion
As a bonus, most exercises that hit the leg muscles will also involve some sneaky core work. “The core stabilizes and supports all lower-body movements,” Artzi tells SELF.
What kind of exercises should you include in a leg workout?
On leg day, you want to hit all of the major movement patterns that your lower body can do,
Christine Torde, CPT
, strength coach at
Bodyspace Fitness
in New York City, tells SELF. That includes the squat, hinge, and both bilateral (engaging body sides of the body at once) and unilateral (single-side) exercises. Basically, a squat involves bending the knees and moving the hips downward, while a hinge keeps the bending movement at the hips and focuses on pushing them back.
Some of the best leg exercises in these categories include:
Bilateral squat: front squat, air squat, goblet squat, sumo squat
Unilateral squat: split squat, reverse lunge, walking lunge, Bulgarian split squat, lateral lunge, curtsy lunge
Bilateral hinge: deadlift, hip thrust, kettlebell swing
Unilateral hinge: kickstand deadlift, single-leg deadlift, single-leg glute bridge
These are all known as
compound exercises
, which work multiple muscle groups in one fell swoop—and, according to Ortega, should make up the lion’s share of your lower-body workouts. She suggests building them around a few compound exercises that work your leg muscles using the squat and hinge movement patterns, and then adding in some accessory or isolation movements (like a leg curl, leg extension, or calf raise) to complement them (if you want) and zero in more closely on the smaller related muscles.
The direction in which you move matters too. “If you are someone who likes to participate in sports like running, tennis, golf, soccer, or basketball, I also recommend training in different planes of motion,” Torde tells SELF. A plane of motion essentially refers to the direction your body moves in. In everyday life, we primarily move forward and backward, but sometimes we move side-to-side or in a twisting motion (say, when you’re getting into a car or swinging a tennis racket). “We live in a world that requires us to move in all three planes,” Ortega explains. “Having a balance of movements that challenge you within these planes is a way to reduce your risk for injury, improve your ability to function day-to-day, and make you more likely to achieve your fitness goals.”
Here, Ortega suggests some good leg-day exercises that fall under each of the body’s planes of motion:
Forward and backward (sagittal plane): back squats, forward lunges, vertical jumping, step-up
Side-to-side (frontal plane): lateral lunges, side-lying leg raises, lateral shuffles
Twisting (transverse plane): seated hip abduction and adduction machines, clam shell, banded fire hydrant
Torde suggests using a mix of free-weight exercises—those that use equipment like dumbbells, barbells, and kettlebells—and machine exercises (like the leg press machine) and to hit on all of these movement patterns and train your body in every direction. If you’re just starting out, you can stick with bodyweight for most of these exercises until you feel comfortable adding weight.
How many exercises, sets, and reps should you do in your leg workout?
“If you are intentional about your movement choices, you don’t have to do 15 different movements or spend two-plus hours working out to achieve your goals,” Ortega says. An effective leg-day workout routine can have just four or five exercises, Artzi says. “One exercise per movement pattern can be enough if you focus on consistent,
progressive overload
,” she adds, meaning that you increase the resistance as you get stronger to keep challenging your muscles. “You don’t need a long list of exercises—just work on form, intensity, and progression.”
The exact number of exercises, sets, and reps that you do on leg day comes down to your goals, Artzi adds. To figure out the magic numbers for you, consider the following:
What is your goal? (e.g., building muscle mass, increasing strength for running or another sport, maintaining strength as you age)
How much time do you have? How many leg workouts can you fit into your week?
What is your level of experience?
Some general suggestions: If you’re more of a beginner or it has been quite a while since you have worked out and are looking for a general place to start, Ortega recommends staying in the 8–12 rep range, performing two to three sets of each movement. “This is a nice way to set yourself up to work until fatigue as opposed to failure.” Meaning, you don’t need to be totally spent, unable to do one more rep, by the end. But you should be lifting something heavy enough that you feel tired and ready for a recovery period when you’re done. In between sets, rest around 60 seconds.
For hypertrophy, or building muscle mass, aim for three sets of 12 reps with moderately heavy weights. You’ll want to choose a weight for both of these that leaves you feeling pretty spent—like you can barely eke out one more rep with good form. Between sets, you’ll want to rest for 60 to 90 seconds, so that your muscles can recover enough for the next round.
If you are looking to
really
max out on absolute strength gains, Torde recommends lifting heavy weights in four sets of about six reps. (if you’re comfortable with the moves, you can go even lower, to five or fewer). When you’re lifting this heavy, rest between sets should be in the three to five minute range.
What’s a good leg day schedule?
Again, this depends on your goals and experience. In general, you don’t want to work the same muscle groups too often, since it’s “important to give your muscles time to recover and rebuild between workouts,” Ortega says. “Traditional rule of thumb is to train each muscle group two to three times a week with at least one day of rest in between.” Torde and Artzi agree that two days per week is a good leg-day schedule for many people.
And once you’re at the gym, should you
only
do your lifting or can you use that time to get in some cardio too? “There have been some questions whether or not to perform cardio on leg day but, again, that can be quite subjective,” Ortega says. The controversy comes from
old research
that found folks who did cardio in the same session as strength training didn’t gain as much leg strength over the course of 10 weeks as those who focused solely on resistance training. However,
newer research
has found that combining aerobic and strength training does not mess with gains in muscle mass and strength.
Ortega says that, ultimately, there’s no perfect one-size-fits-all answer, and for most people, it’s absolutely fine to do cardio on leg day. “I sometimes suggest doing cardio as the warm-up so you can get it over with and out of the way. Others prefer to do it at the end of their workout routine, because it ensures that they won’t overdo it.” (There’s something to be said for going into the strength portion of your session with fresh legs.)

.
Even if you decide to go with just your leg day, there can be a nice benefit to ending with a little sweat: A quick high-intensity finisher—say, kettlebell swings, burpees, or squat jumps—at the end of your workout can also be a nice way to get your heart in on the action before wrapping up, Torde adds.
What’s an example of a good leg day workout?
Using the experts’ advice, we put together a couple sample leg-day workouts to help you get started. Before jumping into it, make sure to do a dynamic warm-up (like
these two
that feature bodyweight versions of the key movement patterns) to get your muscles primed and ready for the work ahead.
Leg-Day Workout #1
Do 8-12 reps of each exercise below. Rest for 60 to 90 seconds after each set. Repeat for a total of 3 sets, then go onto the next exercise.
Goblet Squat
Katie Thompson
Stand with your feet slightly wider than hip-width apart, toes slightly turned out, holding a dumbbell with both hands in front of your chest so it hangs vertically. (You can also do this with a kettlebell if you prefer.)
Engage your core and keep your chest lifted and back flat as you shift your weight into your heels, push your hips back, and bend your knees to lower into a squat.
Drive through your heels to stand and squeeze your glutes at the top. This is 1 rep.
Single-Leg Deadlift
Katie Thompson
Stand with your feet together, holding a dumbbell in your left hand in front of your legs. This is the starting position.
Shift your weight to your right leg, and while keeping a slight bend in your right knee, raise your left leg straight behind your body, hinging at the hips to bring your torso parallel to the floor, and lower the weight toward the floor.
Keep your back flat. At the bottom of the movement, your torso and left leg should be almost parallel to the floor, with the weight a few inches off the ground. (If your hamstrings are tight, you may not be able to lift your leg as high.)
Keeping your core tight, push through your right heel to stand up straight and pull the weight back up to the starting position. Bring your left leg back down to meet your right, but try to keep the majority of the weight on your right foot.
Pause there and squeeze your butt. That’s 1 rep.
After completing all your reps on one side, repeat on the other side.
Hamstring Curl
Katie Thompson
Lie face down on a mat with your legs extended and arms supporting your chest. Grasp a dumbbell securely between your feet. (You can have a friend place it there, or you can stand up your dumbbell and grab it with your feet). This is starting position.
Engage your glutes and curl your legs up toward your butt.
Slowly lower back to the starting position. This is 1 rep.
Lateral Lunge
Katie Thompson
Stand with your feet hip-width apart. Hold your hands together at your chest. (You can also do this weighted if you’d prefer; hold a dumbbell in both hands at your chest as pictured.) This is the starting position.
Take a big step out to the left. Bend your left knee, hinge forward at the hips, and sit your butt back to lower into a lateral lunge. Keep your chest lifted and core engaged, and make sure your knee doesn't move forward beyond your toes.
Push through your left heel to return to the starting position. That’s 1 rep. Do all your reps on one leg and then repeat on the other side.
Leg-Day Workout #2
Do 8-12 reps of each exercise below. Rest for 60 to 90 seconds after each set. Repeat for a total of 3 sets, then go onto the next exercise. Repeat for a total of 3 sets.
Romanian Deadlift
Katie Thompson
Stand with your feet hip-width apart, knees slightly bent, and your arms relaxed by the front of your quads, with a dumbbell in each hand. This is the starting position.
Hinge forward at your hips and bend your knees slightly as you push your butt way back. Keeping your back flat, slowly lower the weight along your shins. Your torso should be almost parallel to the floor.
Keeping your core engaged, push through your heels to stand up straight and return to the starting position. Keep the weight close to your shins as you pull.
Pause at the top and squeeze your butt. That’s 1 rep.
Curtsy Lunge
Katie Thompson
Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and hold a pair of dumbbells at your side. This is the starting position.
Step your right foot diagonally behind you and lower your right knee until it almost touches the floor. Your front knee should bend to about 90 degrees.
Drive through your left heel to stand back up and return to the starting position. This is 1 rep. Do all your reps on one side, then switch sides.
Sumo Squat
Katie Thompson
Stand with your feet wider than shoulder-width apart, toes turned out. Hold a dumbbell with both hands in front of your chest so it hangs vertically.
Engage your core and keep your chest lifted and back flat as you shift your weight into your heels. Push your hips back and bend your knees to lower into a squat.
Drive through your heels to stand and squeeze your glutes at the top for 1 rep.
Kneeling Leg Extension
Katie Thompson
Get into a kneeling position with your knees hip-distance apart, torso tall, core and legs engaged, and hands on your hips. This is the starting position.
Keeping a flat back and hips extended, slowly tip your torso backward until your butt is a few inches away from your heels. Pause, then slowly reverse the movement to return to the starting position. This is 1 rep.

If you’re wondering
where to find
your next pair of
running shoes
, we have one suggestion: Asics. Experienced, long-time runners (including some SELF editors) swear by the brand’s supportive, comfy kicks—the kind you can put through the wringer and will still feel great next time you lace up.
“Asics are known for their reliability and durability,”
Ashley Mateo
, a UESCA- and RRCA-certified run coach based in Denver, tells SELF. Thanks to their sturdy construction, they offer more cushion than a lot of other shoes. It also makes them ideal for folks who like a bit more support, stability, and shock absorption when they run, whether that’s simply because they prefer the feel or because they’re injury-prone.
Not sure which pair is right for you? We spoke with experts to pinpoint the best Asics running shoes for sprints, daily runs, and more.

What should you look for in Asics running shoes?
Fit

“The right running shoe is the one that you never think about when you’re actually running,” Mateo says. First and foremost, that means finding shoes that fit well. For a comfortable, pain-free ride,
your running shoes should actually be bigger
than your regular kicks,
Alicia Canzanese, DPM, ATC
, a board-certified podiatrist, athletic trainer, and former collegiate track athlete, previously told SELF. You want to be able to move your toes, so a thumbnail's length of extra space at the front of the shoe is ideal. There should be no rubbing or pressure around the laces or tongue; and the back of your heel should be secure, so it doesn't slip around. Make sure your arch is supported too—it should feel cradled, not like it’s collapsing or forced upwards.
Cushioning
AccordionItemContainerButton
LargeChevron
If you’re looking to run longer distances or concerned about shock absorption, thick cushioning might be a priority. Whereas if you’re reaching for speed goals, a thinner, more responsive midsole (a.k.a. one that feels energetic and springy) might be important. A lightweight shoe can help you conserve some energy, while heavier padding can keep your feet pain-free over long miles and rocky terrain.
Heel-to-toe drop
AccordionItemContainerButton
LargeChevron
A shoe with a height difference between its forefoot and heel (known as the shoe’s “drop”) may feel more comfortable for runners with calf or Achilles tendon issues, but could aggravate hip and knee problems. Think about what most of your runs will look like and what you prefer in other sneakers—do you usually wear flatter, more minimalist shoes, or something ultra-cushy?
Price
AccordionItemContainerButton
LargeChevron
If you’re looking for a more specialized pair, like a long-distance or race shoe, you might feel better and run faster in one with more performance-driven technology (like a carbon plate or super-high stack height), says Mateo (just keep in mind they’ll probably be more expensive than your average sneaker). Otherwise, you don’t necessarily need to buy the priciest sneaks for the best experience.

If you’re looking for a shoe that will give you the most bang for your buck, the Asics Novablast does it all. “It provides enough bounce for running fast, and it's light enough not to weigh you down, but it also has ample cushion to support you for longer distances. You can wear it for easy runs, hard workouts, and everything in between,”
Laura Norris, CPT
, RRCA-certified run coach, tells SELF.
Mateo also praises the Novablast, noting that one of its previous iterations performed great as her go-to daily trainer: “It’s a super reliable shoe I can count on for easy jogs, uptempo workouts, and even long runs.” While it’s not designed for speed, its ample stack of responsive foam makes it capable of picking up the pace, she says. It’s also a great option for half-marathon and
marathon runners
who don’t want (or need) a more expensive, carbon-plated shoe.

Some Zappos and Asics reviewers found the ankle opening irritating
The Asics Gel-Kayano provides stability without aggressively altering your footstrike (meaning which part of your foot hits the ground first as you run), says Norris. “The [level of] support is ideal for runners who may overpronate—when your ankles roll in as you land—or who have
low arches
, but don’t want a traditional stability shoe that impacts their gait too much,” she explains.
The midsole features lightweight foam, which keeps this shoe from dragging you down at any distance. A previous version of the Gel-Kayano even took home a
SELF Sneaker Award
, thanks to its not-too-little, not-too-much approach to stride correction and support.

The Asics Gel-Nimbus offers a cloudlike ride, with a high stack height (there’s 41 millimeters of material between your heel and the ground) and sleek silhouette. “It’s so plush and cushy, your foot just feels like it’s being hugged through every part of the gait cycle,” says Mateo.
All that padding makes it a great option if you deal with heel pain related to
plantar fasciitis
.
Carla Gamez, DPM
, a podiatrist at Illinois Bone & Joint Institute (IBJI), previously recommended the Gel-Nimbus to SELF, noting that its cushy, shock-absorbing design should help relieve some pressure on your heels to help make your runs and walks more comfortable.

Need a new race day shoe or sneaks for tough workouts that can pick up the pace? Check out the
Sneaker Award
–winning Metaspeed Sky Paris, an impressively lightweight shoe that our tester described as “super bouncy and fast.”
“They feel light, comfortable, and definitely like they’re powering me forward—like an extension of my foot, but one that makes me springier and speedier,” they said. That feeling of propulsion comes from the shoe’s carbon plate, while the springiness our tester noted is due to the updated, energetic foam through the midsole. “They were equally fun on the pavement and on the track,” they added.

If you’re looking to run long and go off-road, the Gel-Trabuco 12 is a great option. Its wide platform is padded with foam and gel to keep you comfortable and absorb the impact from your steps, while a rock plate protects your feet as you travel over roots, gravel, and mud. The rubber outsole has lugs that follow an uphill and downhill pattern, to help you grip the ground when navigating tricky terrain.
Just keep in mind that the Gel-Trabuco 12 isn’t waterproof. If that’s a

Stabilizing heel
Cushy yet bouncy

If the Novablast and Metaspeed had a baby, you’d get the Superblast. “The midsole combines a big hunk of lightweight and responsive foam, and the bottom layer has a soft, bouncy foam,” Mateo says. The sole might look thick and unwieldy, but she says its layered design keeps you grounded: “There’s no wobbling—that bottom layer of foam helps stabilize the top.”
The Superblast doesn’t have a carbon plate, but in Mateo’s experience running in previous versions of the shoe, the glue that holds the two foams together adds rigidity without feeling too stiff. “You're not going to get quite the same pop of a plated shoe on tired legs, but this multitasker can handle long, easy runs as well as it can handle
race day
,” says Mateo.

The Glideride is a solid choice for half-marathon enthusiasts. It combines energy return with cushioning to help you run fast and far—exactly what you need during a 13.1 mile race.
The curved rocker bottom allows you to push off smoothly with each stride, and the midsole provides a springy rebound without weighing the shoe down a ton. The pros approve too: “This shoe makes easy runs and recovery runs feel light and smooth, even if your legs are tired. It can also work for
longer runs
, since it has ample cushioning,” says Norris.

It can be hard to find a shoe that supports your arches without feeling heavy, but the GT-2000 13 toes that line nicely. It uses Asics’s 3D Guidance System technology, which stabilizes your steps and prevents your feet and ankles from rolling inward, but still bends and flexes with your foot when you’re on the move.
An earlier iteration of the Asics GT-2000 won a
Sneaker Award
back in 2021. “This shoe feels completely natural,” our tester wrote then, adding that its comfy padding didn’t interfere with their natural stride. “I felt like I both had contact with the road but also adequate protection from it.”

If you’re wondering
where to find
your next pair of
running shoes
, we have one suggestion: Asics. Experienced, long-time runners (including some SELF editors) swear by the brand’s supportive, comfy kicks—the kind you can put through the wringer and will still feel great next time you lace up.
“Asics are known for their reliability and durability,”
Ashley Mateo
, a UESCA- and RRCA-certified run coach based in Denver, tells SELF. Thanks to their sturdy construction, they offer more cushion than a lot of other shoes. It also makes them ideal for folks who like a bit more support, stability, and shock absorption when they run, whether that’s simply because they prefer the feel or because they’re injury-prone.
Not sure which pair is right for you? We spoke with experts to pinpoint the best Asics running shoes for sprints, daily runs, and more.

Novablast 5

Gel-Kayano 31
Best for Cushioning:

What should you look for in Asics running shoes?
Fit
AccordionItemContainerButton
LargeChevron
“The right running shoe is the one that you never think about when you’re actually running,” Mateo says. First and foremost, that means finding shoes that fit well. For a comfortable, pain-free ride,
your running shoes should actually be bigger
than your regular kicks,
Alicia Canzanese, DPM, ATC
, a board-certified podiatrist, athletic trainer, and former collegiate track athlete, previously told SELF. You want to be able to move your toes, so a thumbnail's length of extra space at the front of the shoe is ideal. There should be no rubbing or pressure around the laces or tongue; and the back of your heel should be secure, so it doesn't slip around. Make sure your arch is supported too—it should feel cradled, not like it’s collapsing or forced upwards.
Cushioning
AccordionItemContainerButton
LargeChevron
If you’re looking to run longer distances or concerned about shock absorption, thick cushioning might be a priority. Whereas if you’re reaching for speed goals, a thinner, more responsive midsole (a.k.a. one that feels energetic and springy) might be important. A lightweight shoe can help you conserve some energy, while heavier padding can keep your feet pain-free over long miles and rocky terrain.
Heel-to-toe drop
AccordionItemContainerButton
LargeChevron
A shoe with a height difference between its forefoot and heel (known as the shoe’s “drop”) may feel more comfortable for runners with calf or Achilles tendon issues, but could aggravate hip and knee problems. Think about what most of your runs will look like and what you prefer in other sneakers—do you usually wear flatter, more minimalist shoes, or something ultra-cushy?
Price
AccordionItemContainerButton
LargeChevron
If you’re looking for a more specialized pair, like a long-distance or race shoe, you might feel better and run faster in one with more performance-driven technology (like a carbon plate or super-high stack height), says Mateo (just keep in mind they’ll probably be more expensive than your average sneaker). Otherwise, you don’t necessarily need to buy the priciest sneaks for the best experience.

Pros

Cons
Some Amazon and Asics reviewers found the toe box too wide
If you’re looking for a shoe that will give you the most bang for your buck, the Asics Novablast does it all. “It provides enough bounce for running fast, and it's light enough not to weigh you down, but it also has ample cushion to support you for longer distances. You can wear it for easy runs, hard workouts, and everything in between,”
Laura Norris, CPT
, RRCA-certified run coach, tells SELF.
Mateo also praises the Novablast, noting that one of its previous iterations performed great as her go-to daily trainer: “It’s a super reliable shoe I can count on for easy jogs, uptempo workouts, and even long runs.” While it’s not designed for speed, its ample stack of responsive foam makes it capable of picking up the pace, she says. It’s also a great option for half-marathon and
marathon runners
who don’t want (or need) a more expensive, carbon-plated shoe.

Pros

Not too heavy for a stability shoe
Highly cushioned
Cons
Some Zappos and Asics reviewers found the ankle opening irritating
The Asics Gel-Kayano provides stability without aggressively altering your footstrike (meaning which part of your foot hits the ground first as you run), says Norris. “The [level of] support is ideal for runners who may overpronate—when your ankles roll in as you land—or who have
low arches
, but don’t want a traditional stability shoe that impacts their gait too much,” she explains.
The midsole features lightweight foam, which keeps this shoe from dragging you down at any distance. A previous version of the Gel-Kayano even took home a
SELF Sneaker Award
, thanks to its not-too-little, not-too-much approach to stride correction and support.

Asics reviewers noticed some wear and tear within the first year
The Asics Gel-Nimbus offers a cloudlike ride, with a high stack height (there’s 41 millimeters of material between your heel and the ground) and sleek silhouette. “It’s so plush and cushy, your foot just feels like it’s being hugged through every part of the gait cycle,” says Mateo.
All that padding makes it a great option if you deal with heel pain related to
plantar fasciitis
.
Carla Gamez, DPM
, a podiatrist at Illinois Bone & Joint Institute (IBJI), previously recommended the Gel-Nimbus to SELF, noting that its cushy, shock-absorbing design should help relieve some pressure on your heels to help make your runs and walks more comfortable.

Need a new race day shoe or sneaks for tough workouts that can pick up the pace? Check out the
Sneaker Award
–winning Metaspeed Sky Paris, an impressively lightweight shoe that our tester described as “super bouncy and fast.”
“They feel light, comfortable, and definitely like they’re powering me forward—like an extension of my foot, but one that makes me springier and speedier,” they said. That feeling of propulsion comes from the shoe’s carbon plate, while the springiness our tester noted is due to the updated, energetic foam through the midsole. “They were equally fun on the pavement and on the track,” they added.

Pros
Rock plate protects you from underfoot hazards
Grippy outsole
Stable yet responsive ride
Cons
Not waterproof
If you’re looking to run long and go off-road, the Gel-Trabuco 12 is a great option. Its wide platform is padded with foam and gel to keep you comfortable and absorb the impact from your steps, while a rock plate protects your feet as you travel over roots, gravel, and mud. The rubber outsole has lugs that follow an uphill and downhill pattern, to help you grip the ground when navigating tricky terrain.
Just keep in mind that the Gel-Trabuco 12 isn’t waterproof. If that’s a
trail running shoe
must-have for you, consider
Asics’s Gel-Sonoma 8 GTX
, which uses a Gore-Tex membrane to seal out rain and snow.

Pros
Stabilizing heel
Cushy yet bouncy
Cons
Pricey
If the Novablast and Metaspeed had a baby, you’d get the Superblast. “The midsole combines a big hunk of lightweight and responsive foam, and the bottom layer has a soft, bouncy foam,” Mateo says. The sole might look thick and unwieldy, but she says its layered design keeps you grounded: “There’s no wobbling—that bottom layer of foam helps stabilize the top.”
The Superblast doesn’t have a carbon plate, but in Mateo’s experience running in previous versions of the shoe, the glue that holds the two foams together adds rigidity without feeling too stiff. “You're not going to get quite the same pop of a plated shoe on tired legs, but this multitasker can handle long, easy runs as well as it can handle
race day
,” says Mateo.

Lightweight cushioning

Cons
May run small, according to Asics
The Glideride is a solid choice for half-marathon enthusiasts. It combines energy return with cushioning to help you run fast and far—exactly what you need during a 13.1 mile race.
The curved rocker bottom allows you to push off smoothly with each stride, and the midsole provides a springy rebound without weighing the shoe down a ton. The pros approve too: “This shoe makes easy runs and recovery runs feel light and smooth, even if your legs are tired. It can also work for
longer runs
, since it has ample cushioning,” says Norris.

Supportive yet lightweight
Great for long periods on your feet, according to some Asics and Amazon reviewers
Cons
May run small if you wear half sizes or have wider feet, per Asics
It can be hard to find a shoe that supports your arches without feeling heavy, but the GT-2000 13 toes that line nicely. It uses Asics’s 3D Guidance System technology, which stabilizes your steps and prevents your feet and ankles from rolling inward, but still bends and flexes with your foot when you’re on the move.
An earlier iteration of the Asics GT-2000 won a
Sneaker Award
back in 2021. “This shoe feels completely natural,” our tester wrote then, adding that its comfy padding didn’t interfere with their natural stride. “I felt like I both had contact with the road but also adequate protection from it.”

Does Walking Backwards on a Treadmill Actually Do Anything?

I’m typically one to
mind my own business at the gym
. It’s my me time, so I don’t really concern myself with what others are doing. (Plus, staring at strangers is rude!). But recently, I noticed something that made my head instinctively turn: People walking backwards on the treadmill.
After witnessing several instances of this reverse strolling, I got curious and went down an internet search rabbit hole. Turns out, it’s not just a thing at my gym—backwards walking is a
TikTok
trend too.
Influencers on social have made
all sorts of claims about it
, saying it’s great for alleviating knee pain, mitigating injuries at that joint, and
strengthening your hamstrings
. But since these aren’t fitness pros talking, I was naturally a little skeptical. So I tapped two
actual
experts to help sort fact from fiction: physical therapist and run coach
Spencer Agnew, PT, DPT
, founder of
Peak Endurance Performance and Physical Therapy
in Madison, Wisconsin, and
Nicole Haas, PT, DPT
, founder of
Boulder Physiolab
in Boulder. With their help, I uncovered which backward walking benefits are actually legit—and what to consider before flipping around on your treadmill.
So why are people so hyped on backwards walking?
Most of the ideas swirling around out there about backwards walking revolve around knee health: that it can strengthen the muscles around your knee that tend to get a little ignored on a daily basis, which could help increase joint stability (and prevent injury). Other ideas floating around out there are that backwards walking is great for
alleviating back pain
, boosting fitness, and improving balance, Dr. Haas tells SELF.
Let’s look at the biggie—knee health—first. According to our experts, it
can
help with
knee pain
…with some caveats.
That’s because it helps fire up your quads, the large muscles along the front of your thighs that allow you to extend your knee. But you need to really focus on straightening your legs as you walk backwards to make the most of it, and many folks shy away from that position when their knee joint hurts, Dr. Agnew tells SELF. It’s an important part of the process, though: By straightening your legs, you can help better activate your quads, since one of the roles of that muscle group is to help extend the knee. Another job of the quads is to help stabilize the knees, so when those muscles are strong enough, that can help reduce discomfort, since the knee joint is better supported, he explains.
In that vein, some people who are wrestling with knee pain—either due to limitations in their range of motion or difficulty activating their quads—find that backwards walking feels more comfortable than forward strolling, Dr. Agnew says. A possible reason: According to a 2019
study
in
BMC Musculoskeletal Disorders,
backward walking causes less compressive force on the patella than forward walking, which can lead to less discomfort.
“The slight shift in forces can give them an activity that their body can do successfully without flaring up or irritating their pain,” Dr. Agnew explains. And this can help them get back to moving as soon as possible by providing them with an activity they can do without discomfort.
Research on backwards walking is limited, but a 2013
study
published in
Northern American Journal of Medical Sciences
did find that it is helpful for improving symptoms for people with knee osteoarthritis when combined with conventional treatments (like strength exercises), possibly because it reduces abnormal joint movements and improves muscle activation. And according to the
BMC Musculoskeletal Disorders
study, which also focused on people with osteoarthritis, folks who did six weeks of backwards walking training had a greater reduction in pain and disability compared to those who did forward walking or no walking program.
But if you’re looking to stop knee issues from happening in the first place, you might be better off with tried-and-true prevention tactics, Dr. Agnew says. If that’s your goal, there are plenty of other things—like
strength training
, for example—that would probably give you more bang for your buck.
Long story short, backwards walking
can
help with knee pain if you focus on fully straightening your legs, but it’s probably not your ticket for preventing it in the first place.
What about the other claims?
While reducing knee pain is the big purported benefit of backwards walking, it’s not the only one. So what about back pain? Well, a 2020
study
published in the
International Journal of Preventative Medicine
found backward walking can help mitigate back aches, since it helps increase the activation and endurance of the muscles that help support and stabilize the spine—something not seen with forward or sideways walking. The catch: The study was small (only 30 men) and the testing took place in a pool…so it’s hard to extrapolate those results for a broader population doing dry-land movements.
As for the notion that backwards walking can create
superstrong hamstrings
, you definitely
do
hit those big back-of-the-leg muscles as you pull your foot behind you, Dr Angew says. But it’s probably not any better than what you’d get from actually strength training that muscle group, he explains. Basically, big, multi-joint exercises like good mornings and deadlifts that use external resistance and tailored programming to really challenge your hammies are going to be better for bolstering muscle strength. And strength training is
also
likely a better call if general improvement in fitness is what you’re after.
But the whole unchartered territory aspect of backwards walking
does
bring a specific benefit: It provides a novel stimulus for your body. “It’s a new skill for people to learn,” Dr. Agnew says. “And we know there’s benefits to having new movement patterns introduced into the nervous system.” These include boosted brain activation and increased proprioception (sense of where your body is in space), Dr. Agnew says. And improving your proprioception can in turn better your balance, he adds. In fact, a small
2023 study
found that backwards walking improved balance and function in people with multiple sclerosis. That’s obviously a “very specific type of patient,” Dr. Haas says. But because it does deliver that novel stimulus like we mentioned, it can be an effective balance booster for all types of people, she explains. So
that
is one legit perk.
Okay, so how can you walk backwards without falling on your face?
Backwards treadmill walking isn’t foolproof. “There's obviously a risk of falling, because we’re not used to doing this movement,” Dr. Agnew says.
That’s why he recommends starting with a very slow speed (a good rule of thumb is half the pace you’d walk forward at, he says), attaching the treadmill safety clip (if there is one) to your clothing, and placing your hands on the rails for support.
Once you get used to that speed, you can consider increasing it slightly, but just know picking up the pace isn’t the goal—you’re not after cardio here. In fact, you may never walk backwards as quickly as you walk forward, and that’s okay, Dr. Haas says. Instead, it’s more important to get comfortable with the speed you’re at, Dr. Agnew says. And anyways, pumping up the speed while you’re already on the treadmill requires flipping forward to access the button, which could get a little…dicey. That’s why your safest bet is to just select a comfy pace and stick with it.
As you’re stepping back, think about reaching your toes behind you first, then pushing through your entire foot, then pushing through your heel as you straighten your leg. Think of it as a toe-to-heel rocking motion, Dr. Agnew says.
There’s no magic number of minutes to walk for, but Dr. Agnew says he typically has people try it for 5 to 10 minutes. Backwards walking fits really well as a
warm-up
or a cooldown to a strength routine or other workout, Dr. Agnew says. No matter how you slot it in, if you start feeling tired, like you’re losing your balance, or some area of your body is tightening up as you stroll, Dr. Haas advises calling it quits.
And if you’re serious about relieving knee pain, walking backwards probably shouldn’t be the
sole
thing you’re doing to address it. Depending on what’s causing your discomfort, other things like strength training can play an important role. Of course, seeing an expert, like a physical therapist, is your best bet for determining the wisest way to address your knee pain. Dr. Agnew recommends seeing someone if you have
any
type of knee pain—even mild discomfort that’s just started nagging you—as addressing things early can help you get back to activity and recovery much more quickly than waiting it out, he explains.
So should you add backwards walking to your routine?
If you’re looking to spice up your gym routine and enhance your balance, backwards walking is “an interesting thing to try for variety,” Dr. Haas says. Just keep in mind a lot of the research on it has been focused on small groups of people with very specific diagnoses, which makes it tough to give blanket statements on the benefits of backwards walking for the general population.
“It doesn’t mean it’s wrong to try it, but just keep in mind it’s probably not the magic bullet—it’s just one option,” Dr. Haas says. To that end, if you’re trying to solve an issue related to knee pain or back pain, instead of hopping on the treadmill and twirling around, “it’s probably better to get to the root of the issue with a skilled professional, like a physical therapist or a trainer, instead,” Dr. Haas says.

And strength training is
also
likely a better call if general improvement in fitness is what you’re after.
But the whole unchartered territory aspect of backwards walking
does
bring a specific benefit: It provides a novel stimulus for your body. “It’s a new skill for people to learn,” Dr. Agnew says. “And we know there’s benefits to having new movement patterns introduced into the nervous system.” These include boosted brain activation and increased proprioception (sense of where your body is in space), Dr. Agnew says. And improving your proprioception can in turn better your balance, he adds. In fact, a small
2023 study
found that backwards walking improved balance and function in people with multiple sclerosis. That’s obviously a “very specific type of patient,” Dr. Haas says. But because it does deliver that novel stimulus like we mentioned, it can be an effective balance booster for all types of people, she explains. So
that
is one legit perk.
Okay, so how can you walk backwards without falling on your face?
Backwards treadmill walking isn’t foolproof. “There's obviously a risk of falling, because we’re not used to doing this movement,” Dr. Agnew says.
That’s why he recommends starting with a very slow speed (a good rule of thumb is half the pace you’d walk forward at, he says), attaching the treadmill safety clip (if there is one) to your clothing, and placing your hands on the rails for support.
Once you get used to that speed, you can consider increasing it slightly, but just know picking up the pace isn’t the goal—you’re not after cardio here. In fact, you may never walk backwards as quickly as you walk forward, and that’s okay, Dr. Haas says. Instead, it’s more important to get comfortable with the speed you’re at, Dr. Agnew says. And anyways, pumping up the speed while you’re already on the treadmill requires flipping forward to access the button, which could get a little…dicey. That’s why your safest bet is to just select a comfy pace and stick with it.
As you’re stepping back, think about reaching your toes behind you first, then pushing through your entire foot, then pushing through your heel as you straighten your leg. Think of it as a toe-to-heel rocking motion, Dr. Agnew says.
There’s no magic number of minutes to walk for, but Dr. Agnew says he typically has people try it for 5 to 10 minutes. Backwards walking fits really well as a
warm-up
or a cooldown to a strength routine or other workout, Dr. Agnew says. No matter how you slot it in, if you start feeling tired, like you’re losing your balance, or some area of your body is tightening up as you stroll, Dr. Haas advises calling it quits.
And if you’re serious about relieving knee pain, walking backwards probably shouldn’t be the
sole
thing you’re doing to address it. Depending on what’s causing your discomfort, other things like strength training can play an important role. Of course, seeing an expert, like a physical therapist, is your best bet for determining the wisest way to address your knee pain. Dr. Agnew recommends seeing someone if you have
any
type of knee pain—even mild discomfort that’s just started nagging you—as addressing things early can help you get back to activity and recovery much more quickly than waiting it out, he explains.
So should you add backwards walking to your routine?
If you’re looking to spice up your gym routine and enhance your balance, backwards walking is “an interesting thing to try for variety,” Dr. Haas says. Just keep in mind a lot of the research on it has been focused on small groups of people with very specific diagnoses, which makes it tough to give blanket statements on the benefits of backwards walking for the general population.
“It doesn’t mean it’s wrong to try it, but just keep in mind it’s probably not the magic bullet—it’s just one option,” Dr. Haas says. To that end, if you’re trying to solve an issue related to knee pain or back pain, instead of hopping on the treadmill and twirling around, “it’s probably better to get to the root of the issue with a skilled professional, like a physical therapist or a trainer, instead,” Dr. Haas says.

17 Simple Fitness Tips to Help You Get the Most Out of Your Workouts in 2025
These tiny tweaks can be game changers for your routine.

A quick scroll through social media will cement the fact there’s a
lot
going on in the exercise space: new classes, workouts, and products claiming to bust boredom and give you results, stat; influencers promising the secrets to
better recovery
and performance; and a host of research aiming to change the status quo of what we thought to be fitness truths.
But with all that info out there, how do you know what tidbits to actually focus on, and which to allow to blend back into the noise of it all? We’ve got you: As SELF’s fitness director, I’ve vetted a whole bunch of fitness tips—everything we publish on our site must pass muster, after all—and, over the past year, there have definitely been a few standouts that can really up your workout game. Then, of course, there are the strategies that have actually
worked
in the real world, recommended by none other than the folks putting in the sweat day after day.
Below, we’ve pulled together the best nuggets of exercise intel we’ve learned from reporting fitness content this past year, plus some extra bits of wisdom our staff members have worked into their own lives along the way. Of course, none of these fitness tips on their own is a workout panacea that’ll transform your routine. But try a few of our favorites from 2024 here and there as you slip into 2025, and you just might find yourself
getting stronger
, running faster, moving easier, or simply just feeling a hell of a lot better. And isn’t that what we’re looking for with our fitness routine anyway?!
1. Focus on the main movements, and all the good stuff will follow.
GymTok may have you believe that exercises need to be fancy in order to “work,” but that couldn't be further from the truth. As writer and certified personal trainer Amy Marturana Winderl reported, focusing on the tried-and-true basics—the movement patterns that mimic the way we go through everyday life—can help you build greater strength and improve mobility, especially as you enter your 30s and beyond. So what are they? There are just seven: Push (like with a chest press), pull (a row), hinge (a Romanian deadlift), squat (a goblet squat), single-leg (a reverse lunge), rotate (a wood-chop), and core stability (a plank).
Build your workout program around these basic movements
and you can hone the balanced strength that’ll allow you to move your best over time.
2. In particular, don’t forget the all-important pull.
Yes, your workout routine should include moves that work
all
of your body, but the fact is, lots of folks end up prioritizing muscles along the frontside (think: shoulders, quads, and rectus abdominis—the
core muscles
that run vertically along your abdomen). As a result, the backside of your body tends to be weaker, which can leave you vulnerable to injury if some muscles end up taking on too much work, as writer and certified personal trainer Jenny McCoy reported. So make sure you’re adding enough pulling exercises to your routine, which can include upper-body moves like rows, assisted chin-ups, or lat pull-downs; or lower-body ones, like deadlifts or good mornings. Bonus: Pulling works the muscles that play a big role in posture, so doing them regularly might help you stand up taller too. Here’s
how to work the pulling moves into your program
.
3. Embrace the B-stance.
The what, you ask? B-stance—also known as kickstand—is a type of setup that puts
most
but not all of your weight on your working side while still keeping your other leg around for some support (like a bike’s kickstand!). It’s ultimately a more accessible way to reap the rewards of single-leg moves—like balanced strength from side to side, and a boost to the small stabilizing muscles, for starters—without having to worry about losing your footing and splatting on the floor, writer Jennifer Heimlich reported. You can do this with popular moves like the deadlift and the hip thrust. Here’s
how to slot B-stance exercises into your workout
(and more intel on why it matters).
4. Stretching might not always be the answer.
A scroll through social will have you believe that stretching is the cure to all your body’s ills, but that’s not always the case. In fact, there are a couple situations where it won’t do much at all—and can even hurt, as writer and certified running coach Cindy Kuzma reported. If your muscles feel tight because they’re sore (the
DOMS
that comes after a new or intense workout), static stretching could result in more microdamage, possibly prolonging that achy feeling. Muscle weakness can also manifest as tightness: When you hold a fixed position for longer than your current strength can handle, the muscles can become overworked and start to feel achy and fatigued. In that case, strengthening rather than stretching is going to be the better move. Here’s
how to tell what might be behind the achy tightness
—and what to do about it to feel better, fast.
5. Your big toe might play a more important workout role than you think.
Your big toe helps you do a lot of things: stride more efficiently, keep your balance, or just simply push off the floor to reach for something from a high shelf. You probably don’t consider its duties when all is going well, but if your big toe becomes stiff or inflexible, you may end up with problems higher up on your kinetic chain, as SELF’s senior health writer Erica Sloan reported—for instance, plantar fasciitis, ankle arthritis, or even hip pain. That’s why spending some time on boosting your range of motion there can be helpful:
Big-toe mobility drills
like the towel scrunch (picking up a towel with just your toes) and others can have body-wide benefits.
6. Consider your core—even when you’re not doing “core exercises.”
Training your core is important, but one thing you might not realize: If you’re doing compound exercises with good form (particularly if you’re using a challenging weight), your
deep core is getting a workout
too, as writer Carolyn Todd reported. So paying some targeted attention to those muscles while you’re lifting can help them fire even more: Focus on bracing your core when pulling your deadlift from the floor, pushing a barbell overhead, or trying not to topple over on a step-up. It’s surprisingly easy to forget this when you’re thinking about your arms or legs, but actively engaging your core keeps you more stable, making it easier to do most movements and decreasing your risk of injury. And, as SELF's commerce director Abbey Stone can attest to, it can simply help ward off wobbliness during some balance-focused moves.
7. Tuck a small weight plate underneath your heels if you butt-wink.
If you’ve noticed that your butt tucks under when you squat, you might be butt-winking. While some experts think it’s just a regular ol’ form quirk, others believe the rounding of your lower back could cause pain and injury down the line, especially if you’re squatting with added load, McCoy reported. A lack of ankle mobility can be the culprit for some folks, which is why squatting with a one-inch weight plate under your heels can help eliminate it. (Added bonus: Elevating your heels also shifts more of the focus on your quads, making it a favorite variation for SELF’s food and fitness writer Caroline Tien.) Read more about that tweak and
other possible butt-wink fixes here
.
8. Hang from a bar, for a few good reasons.
Shake up your regular warm-up by going to the bar. A pull-up bar, that is. The dead hang, which is exactly as it sounds—you grip a bar and hang from it, keeping your core tight to resist swaying around—is a solid way to loosen up your back and shoulders for any lifting that’s coming next. But there’s a solid strength benefit too: Hanging is great for your grip because it strengthens the muscles in your hands, wrists, and forearms, Heimlich wrote, and that has
carryover to your gym performance
and
tons of everyday tasks. It can be tough at first to support your full weight, but
these modifications
can help you hang in no time.
9. You’re probably focusing on your butt—but don’t forget the tiny muscles along the side of it.
Lunges, hip thrusts, deadlifts—all of the lower-body staples work your gluteus maximus, or the biggest muscle in your butt. It’s important to show that major muscle group some love, but we need to give some attention to the smaller glute muscles too. Namely, your gluteus minimus and medius, the two muscles that make up your side-butt. These help support and stabilize your pelvis when you’re doing anything on one leg, from running to lunging, McCoy reported. So if they’re weak, your ankles, knees, and lower back might end up paying the price. Thankfully,
a side-butt workout like this one
can help get everything back in balance.
10. Pencil in a whole lot of less-sweaty cardio.
HIIT has been hyped for years, but zone 2 cardio is having its moment now. These workouts, which keep your heart rate at between 60% to 70% of your max, come with a lot of perks: Your heart becomes stronger, you sprout more capillaries (the smallest blood vessels in your circulatory system), and your energy-producing mitochondria (essentially the batteries of every cell in your body) grow more plentiful. All of this helps build your aerobic base, or the ability to move for longer, Kuzma reported—with less of a risk of overdoing it and getting injured, which can occur when you stack your routine with a bunch of hard efforts. But obsessing over a certain number (your heart rate) can be stressful itself, particularly at first when your body’s still adjusting, so focusing on factors like “feel” instead can be
a better way to use zone 2 cardio
in your own workouts.
11. Protect your wrists without giving up your gains.
There are tons of great moves that involve high plank position, whether we’re talking plank variations to work your core, a traditional push-up to hit your upper body, or downward dog to stretch out your hammies. But for many folks, this brings a lot of extra pressure (and pain) to the wrists. So modify: Grab a pair of dumbbells (you’ll want the hex kind so they don’t roll around) and grip them with your palms facing each other. Place them on the floor, and get into your high plank. This wrist-sparing mod is a favorite of SELF’s Westry Green, and allows him to keep on keeping on with his favorite exercises—sans wrist pain. Or you might simply want to try a cushier yoga mat first. SELF’s senior commerce editor Sarah Felbin notes that choosing one that’s at least five millimeters thick helps protect her wrists during those kinds of yoga moves.
12. Stop futzing with the incline on your treadmill.
Unless you want to mimic a hill climb, of course. If you’re simply itching for a “regular” run, you probably don’t need to mess with the incline at all, despite the much-spouted tip that a 1% grade better mirrors the conditions outdoors. In fact, this only holds true if you’re super speedy—say, going faster than that seven-minute mile (about 8.6 miles per hour, if that’s how your machine displays it), Kuzma reported. Otherwise, keeping the incline at zero will help you log some easy miles (remember, zone 2 cardio?!) without maxing out your effort. And no,
running on a treadmill isn’t easier,
either, though there are some solid benefits to choosing an indoor run when the temp drops (or even when it’s just fine outside).
13. Treat your sports bras right and you won’t be burdened by the bunch.
The bane of many an exerciser’s existence:
removable sports bra pads that bunch up
, crease, or simply migrate to places they shouldn’t. It doesn’t have to be this way, according to writer Julia Ries. In fact, as she reported, a simple step before laundering can alleviate it. Take the pads out of your bra, put them in a separate washer bag, and then stuff them back in when they’re clean and dried. There you have it—no more creases.
14. Eat protein—but not so much that you neglect other nutrients.
A protein shake is a post-workout staple for good reason. It really is a convenient, easily accessible vessel for the protein an athlete’s body needs to recover from all the work they’ve just put in. While it’s a great invention, particularly for busy people who might not have time to cook after a workout (or who can’t stomach a slab of chicken in the immediate aftermath), it shouldn’t be the crux of your diet, Tien reported. That’s because shakes often lack the other macronutrients your body needs to function its best (particularly carbs, plus a full variety of micronutrients like vitamins and minerals). If you
cap your protein shakes at one per day
, you should be better able to fill the void with real meals, which tend to include more of a variety of all the good stuff your body needs.
15. Rest, rest, and rest some more.
SELF’s commerce writer Jessica Kasparian makes sure to take enough of a breather between sets so her body can be prepped and ready to do it all over again—she says it makes all the difference in helping her tackle each additional set. And she’s definitely got it right: This is a vital component of programming if you want to get stronger, and, thus, a huge tenet of SELF’s new workout program
6 Weeks to Stronger
. If you’re going for max strength, you’ll want at least two to three minutes rest; if muscle building is your goal, you can shorten that to about 60 to 90 seconds.
16. Address small issues before they become bigger ones.
Little aches and pains are not uncommon for people who work out a lot; ignoring them—and simply hoping they poof, disappear—is a common yet unrecommended strategy for dealing with them when they do pop up. Please reconsider. Here, SELF’s senior commerce writer Sara Coughlin recounts her own story that has taught her to always be proactive about her pain in the future: “I should have been seeing a physical therapist for months before I actually made my first appointment. I thought that I could deal with my near-constant lower-back pain with whatever massage tools I had lying around,” she says. “In reality, I had muscle weakness that needed addressing with targeted exercises—ones that only a physical therapist could provide me with. And it’ll shock no one that my quality of life and my workouts vastly improved when I actually took steps to manage (and prevent!) my back pain.”
17. If you do get injured, follow a smart return-to-play plan so you can get back at it.
Despite your best efforts—and even if you’re under an expert’s care—you
can
find yourself injured and out of commission for a while, which really, really sucks for folks who consider exercise a nonnegotiable part of their routine (hello, it’s me). But it’s possible to embrace the suck and use your experience as a learning tool to come back stronger, reported Kuzma, who has literally
written the book
and
hosted the podcast
on the emotional challenges of being sidelined from sport. The
return-to-play process
won’t look the same for everyone, but there are a few key tenets: track your pain, practice patience, fuel smartly, avoid the particularly insidious comparison trap, and celebrate your new wins. All of these can help you safely get back to your typical level of activity so that you can keep moving throughout this year, and for many years to come.

A quick scroll through social media will cement the fact there’s a
lot
going on in the exercise space: new classes, workouts, and products claiming to bust boredom and give you results, stat; influencers promising the secrets to
better recovery
and performance; and a host of research aiming to change the status quo of what we thought to be fitness truths.
But with all that info out there, how do you know what tidbits to actually focus on, and which to allow to blend back into the noise of it all? We’ve got you: As SELF’s fitness director, I’ve vetted a whole bunch of fitness tips—everything we publish on our site must pass muster, after all—and, over the past year, there have definitely been a few standouts that can really up your workout game. Then, of course, there are the strategies that have actually
worked
in the real world, recommended by none other than the folks putting in the sweat day after day.
Below, we’ve pulled together the best nuggets of exercise intel we’ve learned from reporting fitness content this past year, plus some extra bits of wisdom our staff members have worked into their own lives along the way. Of course, none of these fitness tips on their own is a workout panacea that’ll transform your routine. But try a few of our favorites from 2024 here and there as you slip into 2025, and you just might find yourself
getting stronger
, running faster, moving easier, or simply just feeling a hell of a lot better. And isn’t that what we’re looking for with our fitness routine anyway?!
1. Focus on the main movements, and all the good stuff will follow.
GymTok may have you believe that exercises need to be fancy in order to “work,” but that couldn't be further from the truth. As writer and certified personal trainer Amy Marturana Winderl reported, focusing on the tried-and-true basics—the movement patterns that mimic the way we go through everyday life—can help you build greater strength and improve mobility, especially as you enter your 30s and beyond. So what are they? There are just seven: Push (like with a chest press), pull (a row), hinge (a Romanian deadlift), squat (a goblet squat), single-leg (a reverse lunge), rotate (a wood-chop), and core stability (a plank).
Build your workout program around these basic movements
and you can hone the balanced strength that’ll allow you to move your best over time.
2. In particular, don’t forget the all-important pull.
Yes, your workout routine should include moves that work
all
of your body, but the fact is, lots of folks end up prioritizing muscles along the frontside (think: shoulders, quads, and rectus abdominis—the
core muscles
that run vertically along your abdomen). As a result, the backside of your body tends to be weaker, which can leave you vulnerable to injury if some muscles end up taking on too much work, as writer and certified personal trainer Jenny McCoy reported. So make sure you’re adding enough pulling exercises to your routine, which can include upper-body moves like rows, assisted chin-ups, or lat pull-downs; or lower-body ones, like deadlifts or good mornings. Bonus: Pulling works the muscles that play a big role in posture, so doing them regularly might help you stand up taller too. Here’s
how to work the pulling moves into your program
.
3. Embrace the B-stance.
The what, you ask? B-stance—also known as kickstand—is a type of setup that puts
most
but not all of your weight on your working side while still keeping your other leg around for some support (like a bike’s kickstand!). It’s ultimately a more accessible way to reap the rewards of single-leg moves—like balanced strength from side to side, and a boost to the small stabilizing muscles, for starters—without having to worry about losing your footing and splatting on the floor, writer Jennifer Heimlich reported. You can do this with popular moves like the deadlift and the hip thrust. Here’s
how to slot B-stance exercises into your workout
(and more intel on why it matters).
4. Stretching might not always be the answer.
A scroll through social will have you believe that stretching is the cure to all your body’s ills, but that’s not always the case. In fact, there are a couple situations where it won’t do much at all—and can even hurt, as writer and certified running coach Cindy Kuzma reported. If your muscles feel tight because they’re sore (the
DOMS
that comes after a new or intense workout), static stretching could result in more microdamage, possibly prolonging that achy feeling. Muscle weakness can also manifest as tightness: When you hold a fixed position for longer than your current strength can handle, the muscles can become overworked and start to feel achy and fatigued. In that case, strengthening rather than stretching is going to be the better move. Here’s
how to tell what might be behind the achy tightness
—and what to do about it to feel better, fast.
5. Your big toe might play a more important workout role than you think.
Your big toe helps you do a lot of things: stride more efficiently, keep your balance, or just simply push off the floor to reach for something from a high shelf. You probably don’t consider its duties when all is going well, but if your big toe becomes stiff or inflexible, you may end up with problems higher up on your kinetic chain, as SELF’s senior health writer Erica Sloan reported—for instance, plantar fasciitis, ankle arthritis, or even hip pain. That’s why spending some time on boosting your range of motion there can be helpful:
Big-toe mobility drills
like the towel scrunch (picking up a towel with just your toes) and others can have body-wide benefits.
6. Consider your core—even when you’re not doing “core exercises.”
Training your core is important, but one thing you might not realize: If you’re doing compound exercises with good form (particularly if you’re using a challenging weight), your
deep core is getting a workout
too, as writer Carolyn Todd reported. So paying some targeted attention to those muscles while you’re lifting can help them fire even more: Focus on bracing your core when pulling your deadlift from the floor, pushing a barbell overhead, or trying not to topple over on a step-up. It’s surprisingly easy to forget this when you’re thinking about your arms or legs, but actively engaging your core keeps you more stable, making it easier to do most movements and decreasing your risk of injury. And, as SELF's commerce director Abbey Stone can attest to, it can simply help ward off wobbliness during some balance-focused moves.
7. Tuck a small weight plate underneath your heels if you butt-wink.
If you’ve noticed that your butt tucks under when you squat, you might be butt-winking. While some experts think it’s just a regular ol’ form quirk, others believe the rounding of your lower back could cause pain and injury down the line, especially if you’re squatting with added load, McCoy reported. A lack of ankle mobility can be the culprit for some folks, which is why squatting with a one-inch weight plate under your heels can help eliminate it. (Added bonus: Elevating your heels also shifts more of the focus on your quads, making it a favorite variation for SELF’s food and fitness writer Caroline Tien.) Read more about that tweak and
other possible butt-wink fixes here
.
8. Hang from a bar, for a few good reasons.
Shake up your regular warm-up by going to the bar. A pull-up bar, that is. The dead hang, which is exactly as it sounds—you grip a bar and hang from it, keeping your core tight to resist swaying around—is a solid way to loosen up your back and shoulders for any lifting that’s coming next. But there’s a solid strength benefit too: Hanging is great for your grip because it strengthens the muscles in your hands, wrists, and forearms, Heimlich wrote, and that has
carryover to your gym performance
and
tons of everyday tasks. It can be tough at first to support your full weight, but
these modifications
can help you hang in no time.
9. You’re probably focusing on your butt—but don’t forget the tiny muscles along the side of it.
Lunges, hip thrusts, deadlifts—all of the lower-body staples work your gluteus maximus, or the biggest muscle in your butt. It’s important to show that major muscle group some love, but we need to give some attention to the smaller glute muscles too. Namely, your gluteus minimus and medius, the two muscles that make up your side-butt. These help support and stabilize your pelvis when you’re doing anything on one leg, from running to lunging, McCoy reported. So if they’re weak, your ankles, knees, and lower back might end up paying the price. Thankfully,
a side-butt workout like this one
can help get everything back in balance.
10. Pencil in a whole lot of less-sweaty cardio.
HIIT has been hyped for years, but zone 2 cardio is having its moment now. These workouts, which keep your heart rate at between 60% to 70% of your max, come with a lot of perks: Your heart becomes stronger, you sprout more capillaries (the smallest blood vessels in your circulatory system), and your energy-producing mitochondria (essentially the batteries of every cell in your body) grow more plentiful. All of this helps build your aerobic base, or the ability to move for longer, Kuzma reported—with less of a risk of overdoing it and getting injured, which can occur when you stack your routine with a bunch of hard efforts. But obsessing over a certain number (your heart rate) can be stressful itself, particularly at first when your body’s still adjusting, so focusing on factors like “feel” instead can be
a better way to use zone 2 cardio
in your own workouts.
11. Protect your wrists without giving up your gains.
There are tons of great moves that involve high plank position, whether we’re talking plank variations to work your core, a traditional push-up to hit your upper body, or downward dog to stretch out your hammies. But for many folks, this brings a lot of extra pressure (and pain) to the wrists. So modify: Grab a pair of dumbbells (you’ll want the hex kind so they don’t roll around) and grip them with your palms facing each other. Place them on the floor, and get into your high plank. This wrist-sparing mod is a favorite of SELF’s Westry Green, and allows him to keep on keeping on with his favorite exercises—sans wrist pain. Or you might simply want to try a cushier yoga mat first. SELF’s senior commerce editor Sarah Felbin notes that choosing one that’s at least five millimeters thick helps protect her wrists during those kinds of yoga moves.
12. Stop futzing with the incline on your treadmill.
Unless you want to mimic a hill climb, of course. If you’re simply itching for a “regular” run, you probably don’t need to mess with the incline at all, despite the much-spouted tip that a 1% grade better mirrors the conditions outdoors. In fact, this only holds true if you’re super speedy—say, going faster than that seven-minute mile (about 8.6 miles per hour, if that’s how your machine displays it), Kuzma reported. Otherwise, keeping the incline at zero will help you log some easy miles (remember, zone 2 cardio?!) without maxing out your effort. And no,
running on a treadmill isn’t easier,
either, though there are some solid benefits to choosing an indoor run when the temp drops (or even when it’s just fine outside).
13. Treat your sports bras right and you won’t be burdened by the bunch.
The bane of many an exerciser’s existence:
removable sports bra pads that bunch up
, crease, or simply migrate to places they shouldn’t. It doesn’t have to be this way, according to writer Julia Ries. In fact, as she reported, a simple step before laundering can alleviate it. Take the pads out of your bra, put them in a separate washer bag, and then stuff them back in when they’re clean and dried. There you have it—no more creases.
14. Eat protein—but not so much that you neglect other nutrients.
A protein shake is a post-workout staple for good reason. It really is a convenient, easily accessible vessel for the protein an athlete’s body needs to recover from all the work they’ve just put in. While it’s a great invention, particularly for busy people who might not have time to cook after a workout (or who can’t stomach a slab of chicken in the immediate aftermath), it shouldn’t be the crux of your diet, Tien reported. That’s because shakes often lack the other macronutrients your body needs to function its best (particularly carbs, plus a full variety of micronutrients like vitamins and minerals). If you
cap your protein shakes at one per day
, you should be better able to fill the void with real meals, which tend to include more of a variety of all the good stuff your body needs.
15. Rest, rest, and rest some more.
SELF’s commerce writer Jessica Kasparian makes sure to take enough of a breather between sets so her body can be prepped and ready to do it all over again—she says it makes all the difference in helping her tackle each additional set. And she’s definitely got it right: This is a vital component of programming if you want to get stronger, and, thus, a huge tenet of SELF’s new workout program
6 Weeks to Stronger
. If you’re going for max strength, you’ll want at least two to three minutes rest; if muscle building is your goal, you can shorten that to about 60 to 90 seconds.
16. Address small issues before they become bigger ones.
Little aches and pains are not uncommon for people who work out a lot; ignoring them—and simply hoping they poof, disappear—is a common yet unrecommended strategy for dealing with them when they do pop up. Please reconsider. Here, SELF’s senior commerce writer Sara Coughlin recounts her own story that has taught her to always be proactive about her pain in the future: “I should have been seeing a physical therapist for months before I actually made my first appointment. I thought that I could deal with my near-constant lower-back pain with whatever massage tools I had lying around,” she says. “In reality, I had muscle weakness that needed addressing with targeted exercises—ones that only a physical therapist could provide me with. And it’ll shock no one that my quality of life and my workouts vastly improved when I actually took steps to manage (and prevent!) my back pain.”
17. If you do get injured, follow a smart return-to-play plan so you can get back at it.
Despite your best efforts—and even if you’re under an expert’s care—you
can
find yourself injured and out of commission for a while, which really, really sucks for folks who consider exercise a nonnegotiable part of their routine (hello, it’s me). But it’s possible to embrace the suck and use your experience as a learning tool to come back stronger, reported Kuzma, who has literally
written the book
and
hosted the podcast
on the emotional challenges of being sidelined from sport. The
return-to-play process
won’t look the same for everyone, but there are a few key tenets: track your pain, practice patience, fuel smartly, avoid the particularly insidious comparison trap, and celebrate your new wins. All of these can help you safely get back to your typical level of activity so that you can keep moving throughout this year, and for many years to come.

Unless you’re on the crew team or an Orangetheory regular, rowing probably isn’t top of mind when mulling your workout options. But there are tons of benefits to rowing that might just convince you to give the ergometer at your gym a whirl—and maybe even make it a staple in your exercise routine.
Not only can rowing deliver stellar cardio, helping to bolster your heart health, but it’s also great for challenging your muscles,
enhancing your posture
, improving mobility, and a whole lot more.
In case you need more convincing, we tapped two instructors to learn all you can gain from making rowing part of your routine, plus what type of workout it “counts” as, which muscles it engages, and the best at-home rowers to shop for. Read on for all you need to know about this underrated full-body workout machine.
What kind of workout is rowing considered?
Hop on a rowing machine for a few minutes and you’ll probably notice your breathing gets ragged
and
your muscles start to burn. That begs the question:
What does rowing “count” as—cardio or strength
? Turns out, it’s both.
Rowing is “excellent aerobic exercise,” certified personal trainer Michelle Parolini, CPT, Concept2 rowing master trainer and manager of coach development at
Row House
, tells SELF. That’s because it’s a continuous movement that engages lots of big muscle groups, which effectively jacks up your heart rate. At the same time, rowing
also
delivers a dose of strengthening thanks to the resistance created by the machine, she explains. In particular, your
quads
, hamstrings, glutes, and calves work really hard through the drive of the stroke—the motion where you press through your feet, lean back, and pull the handles toward you, Parolini says. Your core, upper-back muscles, and biceps are also firing during this time.
Just keep in mind: The
strength benefits
rowing provides fall under the category of muscular endurance (the ability of your muscles to work for long periods of time), Parolini says. Rowing won’t tick the box for muscle growth or maximum strength, since it doesn’t involve short bursts of intense effort where you lift heavy loads, which is what’s needed to achieve those two goals. Instead, it’s about performing lots of reps over a longer period of time. Consider, if you’re doing a 30-minute workout and row 30 strokes per minute, that would be 900 reps without a rest! Because of this, even though rowing offers both cardio and strength, it errs
more
on the side of cardio.
What muscles does rowing work?
Rowing engages so many different parts of your body that instead of listing them all out, “it would actually almost be easier to say what it’s
not
working,” Parolini says. Indeed, rowing fires up a majority of the muscles in your body, Peloton rowing instructor
Ash Pryor, CPT,
tells SELF.
But the legs, in particular, are the “powerhouse,” Parolini says. That’s because they are the main force helping you complete the rowing stroke, she explains. Specifically, the quads, hamstrings, glutes, and calves help power the drive portion, while your lats, upper-back muscles, biceps, shoulders, and forearms fire up as you pull the handles toward you.
All the while, your core—including your rectus abdominis (frontside ab muscles), obliques (side torso muscles),
transverse abdominis
(deep trunk muscles) and erectors (spinal muscles)—work hard to stabilize you. “Your core is active 100% of the time,” Parolini says. Basically, rowing engages so many different muscles that you can confidently consider it a full-body activity.
So what
are
the benefits of rowing?
If you’re wondering if rowing is a good workout we’re here to tell you it most certainly is. From awesome cardio and functional resistance training to enhanced posture, mobility, coordination, and more, there’s a lot to love about this activity—and plenty of rowing machine benefits worth knowing about.
1. It provides stellar low-impact cardio.
Like we mentioned, rowing is an awesome cardiovascular exercise. It simultaneously engages lots of large muscle groups throughout the body, which causes your heart and lungs to work extra hard to deliver oxygen to all those players.
Parolini, who’s tried all sorts of aerobic workouts—including running, cycling, and bootcamp classes—says nothing has challenged her heart and lungs quite like rowing. “Overall cardiovascular health is probably one of the biggest improvements that you’ll see with rowing,” she says. To boot, rowing is low-impact, so, unlike other activities (think: running and jumping), it provides those heart-healthy benefits without pummeling your joints. A small 2023
study
of postmenopausal women published in the
International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,
found that 10 weeks of rowing effectively boosted the subjects’ VO2 max (the amount of oxygen you can take in and use during exercise, which is often considered a stellar marker of cardio fitness.) The low-impact nature of rowing can make it a smart choice for a wide number of people, including older folks and those with physical limitations. In fact, in a small 2023
study
, published in the
European Journal of Applied Physiology,
adults with spinal cord injury who completed 12 weeks of upper-body ergometer rowing saw improvements in their cardio fitness.
2. It boosts your muscular endurance.
Anyone who’s hopped on a rower knows it can seriously burn out your legs, arms, back, core… basically, your entire body. That’s the muscular endurance work at play. With rowing, you’re essentially improving the ability of your muscles to work for a sustained period of time.
And not only can that muscular endurance benefit you in the gym and with sports—improving your overall stamina—it can also come in clutch in daily life. Things like
climbing the stairs
to your seats at a sports stadium or dragging a cooler through the sand at the beach rely on muscular endurance,
DeAnne Davis Brooks, EdD, CSCS
, certified exercise physiologist and director of graduate studies in the department of kinesiology at University of North Carolina Greensboro, previously told SELF. So the more you have of it, the easier you can perform these everyday tasks.
3. Rowing smokes your abs—no crunches required.
As you move from the front to the back of the machine, you’re using a ton of core muscles to hold your torso up, including your rectus abdominis, transverse abdominis, obliques, and erectors. But these midsection muscles don’t just keep you from toppling over; they also help shift force from your legs into your arms so you can effectively pull the handle. “The more muscles you engage in your core, the quicker and stronger that transfer of power is to the handle,” Parolini explains.
The core stabilization you build through rowing can improve your day-to-day functioning in lots of ways, whether we’re talking about in the gym or outside of it—for example, allowing you to pick up heavy objects without straining yourself and keeping you upright when your foot hits a patch of ice or a dog barrels into your knees.
4. Your coordination gets a much-needed challenge.
Experienced rowers can make the activity look effortless, but it’s actually a pretty complicated movement. In fact, though it can seem like one fluid motion, there are actually four distinct parts of the rowing stroke: the catch, drive, finish, and recovery. And executing all four of these components with proper form is no easy feat. It’s no surprise then that among the many benefits of rowing machine workouts is that they’re “so good for coordination,” Parolini says. “Other types of gym workouts don’t require a ton of focus or harmony between the brain and the muscles,” Parolini says—like mindlessly pedaling on the indoor cycling bike or strolling on the treadmill, for example. But rowing “forces your brain to talk to your body,” she explains. And the control over your movement that you develop with rowing can help you find greater control in other moments of life, like when you’re decelerating to walk down stairs, lowering objects to the floor, or even bracing your core to swing your child around as you play with them, Parolini says.
5. You’ll stand up a little straighter.
Proper rowing form involves holding yourself upright on the seat, which engages all the muscles that help support good posture, including those in your core and back. Practicing this positioning through rowing can have carryover benefits to your day to day, Pryor says, since it makes you more mindful of how you’re holding your body in tons of scenarios. So whether you’re walking the dog, working at your desk, or chopping veggies in the kitchen, rowing you can help you sit (or stand) up a little straighter.
6. Your hips might feel a little looser.
It may not look like it at first glance, but rowing is essentially a deadlift in a horizontal position, Parolini says. And that classic exercise involves flexing and extending through the hip—a movement known as the hip hinge. When you do that rep after rep (after rep) on the rower, you load and unload your hamstrings on every stroke. This can boost your flexibility there and ultimately improve mobility in the hip joint, Parolini explains, since your hamstrings attach to your hips. That’s huge, since a lot of folks have tight, cranky hips and hammies thanks to all the time we spend sitting on our butts.
7. Your lower back might bark that much less.
Chronic low back pain is an unfortunately common ailment affecting nearly a quarter of adults worldwide, according to
Cleveland Clinic
. Tightness in the hamstrings and lack of mobility in your hips can contribute to it, Parolini says, so by opening up these areas through rowing, you may find some
relief for your achy back
. That’s no small win!
8. You can gain a seriously cool sense of accomplishment.
Because rowing can be such a challenging activity to master, it can breed a certain type of mental toughness, Pryor says. You likely won’t nail perfect form the first (or second…or tenth) time you give it a whirl, but persevering and eventually seeing yourself break through to the next level can usher in an immense sense of accomplishment. In turn, feeling like a badass on the rower may just imbue you with confidence that spills over into other areas of your life, like finally asking for the promotion at work or drumming up the nerve to invite that cute barista on a date.
9. And cultivate ultimate zen vibes once you’ve got it down.
The repetitive, rhythmic nature of rowing can be incredibly calming, Pryor says. In particular, moving from the back of the machine towards the front is a “really cool” gliding feeling, Parolini says. In that sense, rowing can be a very soothing activity that puts you in a calm, meditative state. And with all the stress that’s swirling around the universe these days, who doesn’t want that?
10. It’s something you can do for the long haul.
There are tons of ways to adapt the rower to your body and mobility level—for example, by adjusting the seat positioning or fiddling with the resistance level—which makes it an activity you can do throughout your lifetime, Pryor explains. And like we mentioned before, it’s low impact, which means it’s a great pick for people who have limitations with higher-impact cardio, either chronically or temporarily, like if they’re pregnant, for example, or rehabbing an injury.
“The cool thing about the rower is it’s an effort-based machine, which means it gives you what you give it,” Parolini explains. In other words, the harder you push during the drive, the harder the workout becomes. This means that as you build your strength and stamina on the rower, you’re able to continue challenging yourself. “You can never tap out on a rower,” Parolini says.
Okay, so what’s the best rowing machine out there to reap all these benefits?
Indoor rowing machines are pricey, but they can be a great choice if you’re looking to make rowing a regular habit, especially given all the awesome rowing benefits you stand to gain. The best one depends on your budget and fitness goals, but as a starting point,
we love
the
Concept2 RowErg
, which is size-inclusive, durable, and simple to set up. Other SELF-approved rowers include the
Hydrow Rower
, which our tester found to be “sleek, smart, and super user-friendly”—as well as the
NordicTrack RW600 Rower
, an overall awesome
budget pick
. And if you don’t want to take the plunge (sorry) yourself, most gyms have at least one kind of rowing machine on their floor, so you can either get your workouts in there, or test out the waters to see what you want for your own.
Regardless of which you choose, know you’re getting a truly terrific full-body workout that can benefit not just your heart, lungs, joints, and muscles, but your brain and mental well-being too. Now that’s what we call a worthwhile investment.

Unless you’re on the crew team or an Orangetheory regular, rowing probably isn’t top of mind when mulling your workout options. But there are tons of benefits to rowing that might just convince you to give the ergometer at your gym a whirl—and maybe even make it a staple in your exercise routine.
Not only can rowing deliver stellar cardio, helping to bolster your heart health, but it’s also great for challenging your muscles,
enhancing your posture
, improving mobility, and a whole lot more.
In case you need more convincing, we tapped two instructors to learn all you can gain from making rowing part of your routine, plus what type of workout it “counts” as, which muscles it engages, and the best at-home rowers to shop for. Read on for all you need to know about this underrated full-body workout machine.
What kind of workout is rowing considered?
Hop on a rowing machine for a few minutes and you’ll probably notice your breathing gets ragged
and
your muscles start to burn. That begs the question:
What does rowing “count” as—cardio or strength
? Turns out, it’s both.
Rowing is “excellent aerobic exercise,” certified personal trainer Michelle Parolini, CPT, Concept2 rowing master trainer and manager of coach development at
Row House
, tells SELF. That’s because it’s a continuous movement that engages lots of big muscle groups, which effectively jacks up your heart rate. At the same time, rowing
also
delivers a dose of strengthening thanks to the resistance created by the machine, she explains. In particular, your
quads
, hamstrings, glutes, and calves work really hard through the drive of the stroke—the motion where you press through your feet, lean back, and pull the handles toward you, Parolini says. Your core, upper-back muscles, and biceps are also firing during this time.
Just keep in mind: The
strength benefits
rowing provides fall under the category of muscular endurance (the ability of your muscles to work for long periods of time), Parolini says. Rowing won’t tick the box for muscle growth or maximum strength, since it doesn’t involve short bursts of intense effort where you lift heavy loads, which is what’s needed to achieve those two goals. Instead, it’s about performing lots of reps over a longer period of time. Consider, if you’re doing a 30-minute workout and row 30 strokes per minute, that would be 900 reps without a rest! Because of this, even though rowing offers both cardio and strength, it errs
more
on the side of cardio.
What muscles does rowing work?
Rowing engages so many different parts of your body that instead of listing them all out, “it would actually almost be easier to say what it’s
not
working,” Parolini says. Indeed, rowing fires up a majority of the muscles in your body, Peloton rowing instructor
Ash Pryor, CPT,
tells SELF.
But the legs, in particular, are the “powerhouse,” Parolini says. That’s because they are the main force helping you complete the rowing stroke, she explains. Specifically, the quads, hamstrings, glutes, and calves help power the drive portion, while your lats, upper-back muscles, biceps, shoulders, and forearms fire up as you pull the handles toward you.
All the while, your core—including your rectus abdominis (frontside ab muscles), obliques (side torso muscles),
transverse abdominis
(deep trunk muscles) and erectors (spinal muscles)—work hard to stabilize you. “Your core is active 100% of the time,” Parolini says. Basically, rowing engages so many different muscles that you can confidently consider it a full-body activity.
So what
are
the benefits of rowing?
If you’re wondering if rowing is a good workout we’re here to tell you it most certainly is. From awesome cardio and functional resistance training to enhanced posture, mobility, coordination, and more, there’s a lot to love about this activity—and plenty of rowing machine benefits worth knowing about.
1. It provides stellar low-impact cardio.
Like we mentioned, rowing is an awesome cardiovascular exercise. It simultaneously engages lots of large muscle groups throughout the body, which causes your heart and lungs to work extra hard to deliver oxygen to all those players.
Parolini, who’s tried all sorts of aerobic workouts—including running, cycling, and bootcamp classes—says nothing has challenged her heart and lungs quite like rowing. “Overall cardiovascular health is probably one of the biggest improvements that you’ll see with rowing,” she says. To boot, rowing is low-impact, so, unlike other activities (think: running and jumping), it provides those heart-healthy benefits without pummeling your joints. A small 2023
study
of postmenopausal women published in the
International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health,
found that 10 weeks of rowing effectively boosted the subjects’ VO2 max (the amount of oxygen you can take in and use during exercise, which is often considered a stellar marker of cardio fitness.) The low-impact nature of rowing can make it a smart choice for a wide number of people, including older folks and those with physical limitations. In fact, in a small 2023
study
, published in the
European Journal of Applied Physiology,
adults with spinal cord injury who completed 12 weeks of upper-body ergometer rowing saw improvements in their cardio fitness.
2. It boosts your muscular endurance.
Anyone who’s hopped on a rower knows it can seriously burn out your legs, arms, back, core… basically, your entire body. That’s the muscular endurance work at play. With rowing, you’re essentially improving the ability of your muscles to work for a sustained period of time.
And not only can that muscular endurance benefit you in the gym and with sports—improving your overall stamina—it can also come in clutch in daily life. Things like
climbing the stairs
to your seats at a sports stadium or dragging a cooler through the sand at the beach rely on muscular endurance,
DeAnne Davis Brooks, EdD, CSCS
, certified exercise physiologist and director of graduate studies in the department of kinesiology at University of North Carolina Greensboro, previously told SELF. So the more you have of it, the easier you can perform these everyday tasks.
3. Rowing smokes your abs—no crunches required.
As you move from the front to the back of the machine, you’re using a ton of core muscles to hold your torso up, including your rectus abdominis, transverse abdominis, obliques, and erectors. But these midsection muscles don’t just keep you from toppling over; they also help shift force from your legs into your arms so you can effectively pull the handle. “The more muscles you engage in your core, the quicker and stronger that transfer of power is to the handle,” Parolini explains.
The core stabilization you build through rowing can improve your day-to-day functioning in lots of ways, whether we’re talking about in the gym or outside of it—for example, allowing you to pick up heavy objects without straining yourself and keeping you upright when your foot hits a patch of ice or a dog barrels into your knees.
4. Your coordination gets a much-needed challenge.
Experienced rowers can make the activity look effortless, but it’s actually a pretty complicated movement. In fact, though it can seem like one fluid motion, there are actually four distinct parts of the rowing stroke: the catch, drive, finish, and recovery. And executing all four of these components with proper form is no easy feat. It’s no surprise then that among the many benefits of rowing machine workouts is that they’re “so good for coordination,” Parolini says. “Other types of gym workouts don’t require a ton of focus or harmony between the brain and the muscles,” Parolini says—like mindlessly pedaling on the indoor cycling bike or strolling on the treadmill, for example. But rowing “forces your brain to talk to your body,” she explains. And the control over your movement that you develop with rowing can help you find greater control in other moments of life, like when you’re decelerating to walk down stairs, lowering objects to the floor, or even bracing your core to swing your child around as you play with them, Parolini says.
5. You’ll stand up a little straighter.
Proper rowing form involves holding yourself upright on the seat, which engages all the muscles that help support good posture, including those in your core and back. Practicing this positioning through rowing can have carryover benefits to your day to day, Pryor says, since it makes you more mindful of how you’re holding your body in tons of scenarios. So whether you’re walking the dog, working at your desk, or chopping veggies in the kitchen, rowing you can help you sit (or stand) up a little straighter.
6. Your hips might feel a little looser.
It may not look like it at first glance, but rowing is essentially a deadlift in a horizontal position, Parolini says. And that classic exercise involves flexing and extending through the hip—a movement known as the hip hinge. When you do that rep after rep (after rep) on the rower, you load and unload your hamstrings on every stroke. This can boost your flexibility there and ultimately improve mobility in the hip joint, Parolini explains, since your hamstrings attach to your hips. That’s huge, since a lot of folks have tight, cranky hips and hammies thanks to all the time we spend sitting on our butts.
7. Your lower back might bark that much less.
Chronic low back pain is an unfortunately common ailment affecting nearly a quarter of adults worldwide, according to
Cleveland Clinic
. Tightness in the hamstrings and lack of mobility in your hips can contribute to it, Parolini says, so by opening up these areas through rowing, you may find some
relief for your achy back
. That’s no small win!
8. You can gain a seriously cool sense of accomplishment.
Because rowing can be such a challenging activity to master, it can breed a certain type of mental toughness, Pryor says. You likely won’t nail perfect form the first (or second…or tenth) time you give it a whirl, but persevering and eventually seeing yourself break through to the next level can usher in an immense sense of accomplishment. In turn, feeling like a badass on the rower may just imbue you with confidence that spills over into other areas of your life, like finally asking for the promotion at work or drumming up the nerve to invite that cute barista on a date.
9. And cultivate ultimate zen vibes once you’ve got it down.
The repetitive, rhythmic nature of rowing can be incredibly calming, Pryor says. In particular, moving from the back of the machine towards the front is a “really cool” gliding feeling, Parolini says. In that sense, rowing can be a very soothing activity that puts you in a calm, meditative state. And with all the stress that’s swirling around the universe these days, who doesn’t want that?
10. It’s something you can do for the long haul.
There are tons of ways to adapt the rower to your body and mobility level—for example, by adjusting the seat positioning or fiddling with the resistance level—which makes it an activity you can do throughout your lifetime, Pryor explains. And like we mentioned before, it’s low impact, which means it’s a great pick for people who have limitations with higher-impact cardio, either chronically or temporarily, like if they’re pregnant, for example, or rehabbing an injury.
“The cool thing about the rower is it’s an effort-based machine, which means it gives you what you give it,” Parolini explains. In other words, the harder you push during the drive, the harder the workout becomes. This means that as you build your strength and stamina on the rower, you’re able to continue challenging yourself. “You can never tap out on a rower,” Parolini says.
Okay, so what’s the best rowing machine out there to reap all these benefits?
Indoor rowing machines are pricey, but they can be a great choice if you’re looking to make rowing a regular habit, especially given all the awesome rowing benefits you stand to gain. The best one depends on your budget and fitness goals, but as a starting point,
we love
the
Concept2 RowErg

Hydrow Rower
, which our tester found to be “sleek, smart, and super user-friendly”—as well as the
NordicTrack RW600 Rower
, an overall awesome
budget pick
. And if you don’t want to take the plunge (sorry) yourself, most gyms have at least one kind of rowing machine on their floor, so you can either get your workouts in there, or test out the waters to see what you want for your own.
Regardless of which you choose, know you’re getting a truly terrific full-body workout that can benefit not just your heart, lungs, joints, and muscles, but your brain and mental well-being too. Now that’s what we call a worthwhile investment.

This article is part of SELF’s third annual
Rest Week
, an editorial package dedicated to doing less. Taking care of yourself, physically and emotionally, is impossible without genuine downtime. With that in mind, we’ll be publishing articles up until the new year to help you make a habit of taking breaks, chilling out, and slowing down. (And we’re taking our own advice: The SELF staff will be OOO during this time!) We hope to inspire you to take it easy and get some rest, whatever that looks like for you.
As you can see, we’re all for taking intentional time to relax and unwind. But there’s a flipside to vegging out for long durations: It can leave your body feeling tight, achy, and all-around cranky. And that’s not exactly restorative.
So what’s a chill-seeking person to do? We have an idea: A quick stretch sequence that can boost your mobility and loosen up tense areas so you can more comfortably unwind. Created for SELF by registered yoga instructor
Tahl Rinsky
, a master trainer with Centr, this five-move routine hits on the main muscle groups that can tighten up after lots of time sitting on your butt: your
hip flexors
, glutes, lower back, and shoulders.
You’ll start with the lunging hip flexor stretch, a standing move that targets your front hip muscles. Then, you’ll get your blood flowing a little with the forward to reverse lunge, an exercise that lengthens your hip flexors some more, along with your hamstrings, while also delivering bonus balance and stability work. Next up is the cat-cow, a dynamic yoga pose that’s great for mobilizing your lower back, which can get cranky after long periods of staying still. Then, you’ll target your upper-body—specifically your shoulders, neck, and upper back—with thread the needle, since those areas can become stiff from inactivity too. Finally, you’ll finish with figure-four, a classic stretch that can loosen up tight outer hips and glutes.
Doing this routine on the reg can help to “counteract stiffness,
improve flexibility
, and promote better alignment,” Rinsky tells SELF, which is really key after spending hours on the couch reading, catching up on your fave shows, doing some crafts—whatever your mode of relaxation may be. You may also get a mental boost from this flow, since moving your body (in addition to giving yourself downtime!) can be really helpful for managing everyday-life stress, Rinsky says. Another perk of this routine: You don’t need a ton of time to knock it out. In fact, the sequence will take you less than five minutes total, making it super easy to slot into your Netflix marathon or bed rotting session.
Of course, if your body is craving
more
movement, you can repeat it or prolong the amount of time you do each move, Rinksy says. You could also do it several times throughout the day, she adds—for example, once in the morning to set a relaxing tone for your day, once midday to relieve stiff muscles, and once before bed to help you unwind before your head hits the pillow. As Rinsky puts it, there’s “never a bad time to prioritize your health and your body.”
With that ethos, here’s all the info you need for a quick-yet-invigorating stretch sequence to help feel—and rest!—your best.
The Workout
What you need:
Just your bodyweight! You may also want a yoga mat for comfort.
Exercises
Lunging Hip Flexor Stretch
Forward to Reverse Lunge
Cat-Cow
Thread the Needle
Figure-Four Stretch
Directions
Do the following moves, holding or performing reps of each for the duration of time listed. You can do them in the order listed, or mix it up if a different sequence feels better for you. “Any order is fine,” Rinsky says.
Pinterest
Meiko Arquillos
Lunging Hip Flexor Stretch
Kneel on your right knee. Place your left foot flat on the floor in front of you, knee bent.
Lean forward slightly, stretching your right hip toward the floor.
Squeeze your butt; this will allow you to stretch your hip flexor even more. You should feel this in your right hip flexor.
Hold for 30 seconds.
Switch sides and repeat.
Sitting for long periods of time can shorten up your hip flexors and often cause discomfort in both your hips and lower back, Rinsky explains. That’s because those areas are connected, so tightness in one spot can lead to issues in the other. This stretch combats all that by loosening up the front of your hips.
Pinterest
Katie Thompson
Forward to Reverse Lunge
Start standing with your feet shoulder-width apart.
Lift your right foot, step forward about 2 feet, and plant it firmly on the floor. Bend both knees until your right quad and left shin are approximately parallel to the floor. Your torso should lean slightly forward so your back is flat and not arched or rounded. Your right knee should be above your right foot and your butt and core should be engaged.
Push through the heel of your right foot to return to the starting position.
Then, step your right foot back about 2 feet, landing on the ball of your foot and keeping your heel off the floor. Bend both knees until your left quad and right shin are approximately parallel to the floor. Your torso should lean slightly forward so your back is flat and not arched or rounded. Your left knee should be above your left foot and your butt and core should be engaged.
Push through the heel of your left foot to return to the starting position. That's 1 rep.
Continue performing reps for 30 seconds, then repeat for another 30 seconds with the other leg.
You may think of the lunge as a strength move, but it’s also a great dynamic stretch. Specifically, it helps lengthen your hip flexors and hamstrings—two areas that can tighten up from lots of couch time—while also delivering stability and balance work.
Pinterest
Katie Thompson
Cat-Cow
Start in a tabletop position with your shoulders stacked directly over your wrists and hips over your knees.
Slowly inhale, and on the exhale, round your spine, dropping your head toward the floor and lifting your belly toward the ceiling. This is cat pose.
On the next inhale, lift your head, chest, and tailbone toward the ceiling, arching your lower back. This is cow pose.
Continue performing reps for 30 seconds.
Another dynamic stretch, this classic yoga pose boosts overall spinal mobility and reduces stiffness in your lower back specifically. “It gently mobilizes the spine, easing tightness and improving posture,” Rinsky says.
Pinterest
Katie Thompson
Thread the Needle
Start in a tabletop position with your shoulders stacked directly over your wrists and hips over your knees.
Reach your right arm underneath your left and across your body with your palm facing up.
Bend your left elbow as you gently lean into your right side; you should feel a stretch in the back of your right shoulder.
Hold for 30 seconds, then repeat on the other side.
Being sedentary for long stretches of time doesn’t just do a number on your lower body—it can tighten things up in your shoulders, neck, and upper back, too. This stretch targets those areas to help loosen your upper body.
Pinterest
Figure-Four Stretch
​​Lie on your back.
Cross your right foot over your left quad, and bend your left knee.
Hold the back of your left leg and gently pull it toward your chest.
When you feel a comfortable stretch, hold there for at least 30 seconds.
Repeat on the other side.
Sitting on your butt can tighten it up and also shorten your outer hip muscles. This stretch helps release tension in both areas, Rinsky says
.
For more of a challenge (especially to your balance), you can perform this stretch from a
standing position
.

9 Questions to Ask Yourself Before Choosing a New Gym, According to a Personal Trainer
Because the “best” option is the one that meets your needs.

With the new year looming, one of the biggest to-dos on many people’s lists is to finally figure out a
fitness program
. In lots of cases, joining a gym is step one here. But with all the options staring you in the face—boutique studio, 24/7 commercial chain, bonus sauna that you may or may not even use—it can start to feel overwhelming before you even lace up your sneakers.
But it doesn’t have to be. As SELF’s fitness director and an ACE-certified personal trainer, I’ve joined, scrapped, rejoined, and switched up many a gym in my nearly 20 years of strength training. One thing I’ve learned? The “best” gym on paper means squat if it’s not the best one for
you.
The same fitness space that can inspire some folks to push to PRs can make others not even want to step through the doors.
That’s why I’ve found it beneficial to vet your space first with a list of questions that can help you suss out whether the gym you’re considering is the right spot for you. Below, a few things to ask yourself before you sign on that dotted line.
1. What does getting there look like?
This one’s the biggest for me: If making your way to your gym is a giant pain in the ass, chances are good that you’re not going to want to do it.
Quick story. My current gym has a few different locations. One is absolutely beautiful: a double-decker with huge floor-to-ceiling windows, state-of-the-art machines, a turf track up on the top level, and even a café to help you
fuel up when you’re done
. The other is literally in a basement, and its equipment, though completely serviceable, would look right at home in a Gold’s circa 1990. Which one is my go-to? Basement gym FTW.
That’s because the new, gorgeous location is smack dab downtown, meaning you’ve got to fight city traffic and lots of one-ways, and then navigate the bowels of a parking garage to make it through the doors. I normally go to the gym after work, and if I know that headache is waiting for me after a full day…it very well might not happen. The other is an easy-breezy straight shot.
So check out the logistics before you commit—make sure you do it yourself rather than relying solely on Google Maps—and set your trial run for a day and time when you’d want to work out. If the drive, commute, train switch, walk over, whatever, has you even vaguely annoyed during your test, just realize it’s only going to be amplified once you’re in everyday mode. And only you can weigh whether a shiny new StairClimber can make up for that.
2. What kinds of workouts do you want to do?
In my experience, a gym is usually going to have one facet where it particularly shines, whether it’s offering an immense array of
cardio equipment
, enough power racks so nearly everyone can squat in peace, or a class schedule that would make Peloton envious. Ideally, this should match up pretty well with where you see the majority of your workouts heading.
If you love to switch it up with different fitness classes, you’re probably going to get bored with a gym that offers the same handful on repeat—but you just might love one that works in new additions every month. If the goal of your fitness plan is to build endurance to finally crush a 10K, you’re likely going to get frustrated with a space that has only a handful of treadmills that are always in use. But one with cardio machines as far as the eye can see? That might make a great new home for you.
Just be wary of gyms boasting tons of shiny new amenities that sound cool in theory but really don’t do it for you. If it’s a feature you
think
you should want—Pilates Reformer classes included in your membership, for instance, and you’re a barbell lifter through and through—but you don’t see yourself actually using it, try not to let that overwhelm your other criteria.
3. When do you want to work out?
This is a big one, because it has a trickle down effect on lots of other factors. A gym that’s annoying to get to during rush hour might be just fine during the day. One made up mostly of professionals might be packed in the after-work hours, while another one that caters to the retiree crowd may clear out well before 5 p.m. You can ask the front desk folks when the busy times are, but this is another one where you’ll get the best info by doing a trial run yourself.
Another thing to keep in mind regarding timing: Do you intend to go right to work after your workout, straight to brunch, etc.? If that’s the case, the locker room situation is going to be more important than if you’re only stashing your coat there. Which brings me to:
4. Will you be showering?
Not all gyms—even the ones that look fancy on the floor—are created equal behind closed doors. And by that I mean the bathroom door. Some spaces have showers, vanities, and even complimentary toiletries that make your regular ol’ GRWM routine at home pale in comparison. Others will have you dousing your foot in rubbing alcohol if you accidentally step off your flip-fop onto the bare shower floor.
Relatedly, towel service: One of the pushes in favor of my current gym was the fact that I never have to worry about bringing my own, washing it, stuffing it in a gym bag, etc. Freeing up that mental load is well worth the extra cost of this amenity, and it’s one I’d encourage you to consider as well. After all, it makes you more likely to actually use the showers, which can greatly improve your post-workout comfort. (Once you’ve stepped into the cold January air after a hard interval run sans shower and immediately got the chills, you’ll see what I mean.)
5. Are you a headphones-in exerciser or do you prefer a little chat?
I’ve been to gyms where groups form on the floor, folks chat each other up, and a spotter is always a nod away. I’ve also belonged to ones where everyone does their own thing. Neither is better or worse, but if there’s a vibes mismatch with what you prefer, it can seriously impede your enjoyment—and thus your likelihood to keep coming back. So when you check out your potential place, keep an eye on how much interaction is going on (and gauge your gut reaction to it).
6. Where’s the nearest spray bottle or container of wipes?
If neither of these are hitting you right in the face, it’s not a good sign for the overall cleanliness of the place. If gym-goers have to traipse the floor to snag the one singular bottle of spray cleaner off the front desk to wipe down their bench, you can probably guess pretty accurately that most of the equipment isn’t being sanitized between uses. It’s unfortunate, but as I’ve noticed firsthand, a lot of folks aren’t going to expend the extra effort to clean up. If there’s a bottle, roll of paper towels, or container of wipes near every station? You can be better assured that a spritz and swipe will occur, and that you’re not going to sink right into someone’s back sweat when you hit the mat.
7. Does the place exemplify the kind of fitness you want it to?
Another thing to keep in mind when checking the place out: Do you see a lot of different kinds of bodies represented, whether we’re talking about the class instructors or even other gym-goers? Is the fitness equipment made for lighter (or taller) bodies, or can it work for a wider array of users? Is the messaging on track with how
you
view fitness?
One pretty accurate way to suss this out is to check out their signage, special programming, challenges, or awards. Do they emphasize weight loss as a goal, and celebrate folks who hit arbitrary numbers? Do they call their cardio class “Bikini Shred 101” and create five-minute finishers to build “tank top arms?” Or are they more focused on the function and performance benefits? Say, maybe they create a class that’ll help you get to your first push-up, invite folks to write down a new squat PR on the wall, or even simply share motivational playlists rather than “transformational” photos. Believe me, these are the things that are going to foster motivation in the long run.
8. What’s its vibe on social?
This is another great way to really get a good feel on how a place thinks about fitness holistically—give the place a follow, and you can see what accounts it promotes, what kinds of posts it likes, and which members (doing what kind of activities) it chooses to spotlight.
The user-generated stuff can also come in clutch here. Take a look at their tagged content—what videos are users sharing? Are there lots of flexing and muscle shots, which might make a bodybuilder feel right at home, but a gen-pop exerciser feel a little out of their element? Or are there exhausted yet euphoric selfies simply sharing a tough workout in the books? (Hell, even the
amount
of content you can find can tell you a lot about a gym: If there’s a ton each day, you might want to brace yourself for tripods taking over the floor and maybe even popping up in the locker room.)
9. Do you even need a physical gym in the first place?
Give these questions a ponder, and they can help you ID a great place for you—if that’s what your end goal is, of course. It doesn’t need to be! You can still get started with fitness or continue on with a great routine without having an external place to do it. In fact, for some folks, joining a gym might
not

9 Questions to Ask Yourself Before Choosing a New Gym, According to a Personal Trainer
Because the “best” option is the one that meets your needs.

With the new year looming, one of the biggest to-dos on many people’s lists is to finally figure out a
fitness program
. In lots of cases, joining a gym is step one here. But with all the options staring you in the face—boutique studio, 24/7 commercial chain, bonus sauna that you may or may not even use—it can start to feel overwhelming before you even lace up your sneakers.
But it doesn’t have to be. As SELF’s fitness director and an ACE-certified personal trainer, I’ve joined, scrapped, rejoined, and switched up many a gym in my nearly 20 years of strength training. One thing I’ve learned? The “best” gym on paper means squat if it’s not the best one for
you.
The same fitness space that can inspire some folks to push to PRs can make others not even want to step through the doors.
That’s why I’ve found it beneficial to vet your space first with a list of questions that can help you suss out whether the gym you’re considering is the right spot for you. Below, a few things to ask yourself before you sign on that dotted line.
1. What does getting there look like?
This one’s the biggest for me: If making your way to your gym is a giant pain in the ass, chances are good that you’re not going to want to do it.
Quick story. My current gym has a few different locations. One is absolutely beautiful: a double-decker with huge floor-to-ceiling windows, state-of-the-art machines, a turf track up on the top level, and even a café to help you
fuel up when you’re done
. The other is literally in a basement, and its equipment, though completely serviceable, would look right at home in a Gold’s circa 1990. Which one is my go-to? Basement gym FTW.
That’s because the new, gorgeous location is smack dab downtown, meaning you’ve got to fight city traffic and lots of one-ways, and then navigate the bowels of a parking garage to make it through the doors. I normally go to the gym after work, and if I know that headache is waiting for me after a full day…it very well might not happen. The other is an easy-breezy straight shot.
So check out the logistics before you commit—make sure you do it yourself rather than relying solely on Google Maps—and set your trial run for a day and time when you’d want to work out. If the drive, commute, train switch, walk over, whatever, has you even vaguely annoyed during your test, just realize it’s only going to be amplified once you’re in everyday mode. And only you can weigh whether a shiny new StairClimber can make up for that.
2. What kinds of workouts do you want to do?
In my experience, a gym is usually going to have one facet where it particularly shines, whether it’s offering an immense array of
cardio equipment
, enough power racks so nearly everyone can squat in peace, or a class schedule that would make Peloton envious. Ideally, this should match up pretty well with where you see the majority of your workouts heading.
If you love to switch it up with different fitness classes, you’re probably going to get bored with a gym that offers the same handful on repeat—but you just might love one that works in new additions every month. If the goal of your fitness plan is to build endurance to finally crush a 10K, you’re likely going to get frustrated with a space that has only a handful of treadmills that are always in use. But one with cardio machines as far as the eye can see? That might make a great new home for you.
Just be wary of gyms boasting tons of shiny new amenities that sound cool in theory but really don’t do it for you. If it’s a feature you
think
you should want—Pilates Reformer classes included in your membership, for instance, and you’re a barbell lifter through and through—but you don’t see yourself actually using it, try not to let that overwhelm your other criteria.
3. When do you want to work out?
This is a big one, because it has a trickle down effect on lots of other factors. A gym that’s annoying to get to during rush hour might be just fine during the day. One made up mostly of professionals might be packed in the after-work hours, while another one that caters to the retiree crowd may clear out well before 5 p.m. You can ask the front desk folks when the busy times are, but this is another one where you’ll get the best info by doing a trial run yourself.
Another thing to keep in mind regarding timing: Do you intend to go right to work after your workout, straight to brunch, etc.? If that’s the case, the locker room situation is going to be more important than if you’re only stashing your coat there. Which brings me to:
4. Will you be showering?
Not all gyms—even the ones that look fancy on the floor—are created equal behind closed doors. And by that I mean the bathroom door. Some spaces have showers, vanities, and even complimentary toiletries that make your regular ol’ GRWM routine at home pale in comparison. Others will have you dousing your foot in rubbing alcohol if you accidentally step off your flip-fop onto the bare shower floor.
Relatedly, towel service: One of the pushes in favor of my current gym was the fact that I never have to worry about bringing my own, washing it, stuffing it in a gym bag, etc. Freeing up that mental load is well worth the extra cost of this amenity, and it’s one I’d encourage you to consider as well. After all, it makes you more likely to actually use the showers, which can greatly improve your post-workout comfort. (Once you’ve stepped into the cold January air after a hard interval run sans shower and immediately got the chills, you’ll see what I mean.)
5. Are you a headphones-in exerciser or do you prefer a little chat?
I’ve been to gyms where groups form on the floor, folks chat each other up, and a spotter is always a nod away. I’ve also belonged to ones where everyone does their own thing. Neither is better or worse, but if there’s a vibes mismatch with what you prefer, it can seriously impede your enjoyment—and thus your likelihood to keep coming back. So when you check out your potential place, keep an eye on how much interaction is going on (and gauge your gut reaction to it).
6. Where’s the nearest spray bottle or container of wipes?
If neither of these are hitting you right in the face, it’s not a good sign for the overall cleanliness of the place. If gym-goers have to traipse the floor to snag the one singular bottle of spray cleaner off the front desk to wipe down their bench, you can probably guess pretty accurately that most of the equipment isn’t being sanitized between uses. It’s unfortunate, but as I’ve noticed firsthand, a lot of folks aren’t going to expend the extra effort to clean up. If there’s a bottle, roll of paper towels, or container of wipes near every station? You can be better assured that a spritz and swipe will occur, and that you’re not going to sink right into someone’s back sweat when you hit the mat.
7. Does the place exemplify the kind of fitness you want it to?
Another thing to keep in mind when checking the place out: Do you see a lot of different kinds of bodies represented, whether we’re talking about the class instructors or even other gym-goers? Is the fitness equipment made for lighter (or taller) bodies, or can it work for a wider array of users? Is the messaging on track with how
you
view fitness?
One pretty accurate way to suss this out is to check out their signage, special programming, challenges, or awards. Do they emphasize weight loss as a goal, and celebrate folks who hit arbitrary numbers? Do they call their cardio class “Bikini Shred 101” and create five-minute finishers to build “tank top arms?” Or are they more focused on the function and performance benefits? Say, maybe they create a class that’ll help you get to your first push-up, invite folks to write down a new squat PR on the wall, or even simply share motivational playlists rather than “transformational” photos. Believe me, these are the things that are going to foster motivation in the long run.
8. What’s its vibe on social?
This is another great way to really get a good feel on how a place thinks about fitness holistically—give the place a follow, and you can see what accounts it promotes, what kinds of posts it likes, and which members (doing what kind of activities) it chooses to spotlight.
The user-generated stuff can also come in clutch here. Take a look at their tagged content—what videos are users sharing? Are there lots of flexing and muscle shots, which might make a bodybuilder feel right at home, but a gen-pop exerciser feel a little out of their element? Or are there exhausted yet euphoric selfies simply sharing a tough workout in the books? (Hell, even the
amount
of content you can find can tell you a lot about a gym: If there’s a ton each day, you might want to brace yourself for tripods taking over the floor and maybe even popping up in the locker room.)
9. Do you even need a physical gym in the first place?
Give these questions a ponder, and they can help you ID a great place for you—if that’s what your end goal is, of course. It doesn’t need to be! You can still get started with fitness or continue on with a great routine without having an external place to do it. In fact, for some folks, joining a gym might
not
be the best or most convenient way to work fitness into their lives, and that’s okay. As long as you’ve got a
great home set-up
and a host of
fun and exciting workouts to try,
you can crush whatever goal you’ve got—no special space required.

The Superman Exercise Is the Core Move Your Workout Might Be Missing

Any workout move that has you lying on your stomach may sound way too easy. But the Superman exercise is anything but—providing a muscle-trembling challenge and full-body benefits that are truly no joke.
There are several variations of this no-equipment move (which you may have seen before in yoga classes, Pilates, or
bodyweight strength workouts
), but the one we’re talking about here involves lying face down with your arms extended in front of you and legs straight out behind you. Then, you lift your limbs off the ground and, voilà, you’re in the pose. (If you picture the namesake comic book character in flight, you’ll understand where the exercise gets its title.)
“It’s a fun one,”
Nicole Haas, PT, DPT
, founder of
Boulder Physiolab
in Boulder, tells SELF. Not only does the Superman fire up important backside muscles, but it also technically checks the box for core strength work.
Here, we dig into all that this mighty move has to offer, including which muscles it targets, the full-body benefits, common form mistakes to avoid, how to weave it into your routine, and step-by-step instructions for doing it correctly. So unfurl your yoga mat and get ready to move like Clark Kent.
What muscles does the Superman work?
The Superman is a bodyweight exercise that really fires up your posterior chain—a.k.a. the back of your body, Dr. Haas says. In particular, it hits your erector spinae, a group of muscles that help arch your spine and run down the length of it, all the way from your neck to your lower back, Haas says. It also works your glutes and
hamstrings
, as well as your posterior deltoids (rear shoulder muscles), she adds.
Depending on how you do the exercise, you can also target the multifidus, a group of low back muscles that help stabilize the spine. To get more specific, if you lift your arms and legs just a couple of inches off the ground and focus on really lengthening through your back—extending from the crown of your head all the way to your feet—you’ll activate your multifidus, Dr. Haas says. You can also fire up this player by lifting up just one arm and the opposite leg at a time (for example, your right arm and left leg, or left arm and right leg, similar to the
bird dog
exercise). In that scenario, the multifidus kicks on to prevent your spine from rotating, Dr. Haas explains, which is what it naturally wants to do when you’re moving just one upper-body and one lower-body limb at a time.
Keep in mind if you raise your arms and legs higher, you’re not necessarily engaging more muscles or doing an advanced version of the move—it just means you have greater range of motion in back extension, Dr. Haas explains. In fact, for some people, keeping their limbs closer to the ground will deliver more of a challenge.
What are the benefits of the Superman?
The Superman probably isn’t what you envision when you picture
core exercises
—chances are, moves like crunches, sit-ups, or
planks
more readily come to mind—but it technically
is
a core move. That’s because your core isn’t
just
about your abs (those frontside torso muscles): It also includes the ones in your lower back. And for your core strength to be as well-rounded as possible, it’s important that
all
these muscles get worked, which is where the Superman can come in clutch, especially if you typically just do crunch-type ab moves. In particular, building lower back strength can help you stabilize better as you perform bigger moves, like squats, allowing you to do them more effectively and safely.
Beyond that, the Superman exercise can help folks who have lower back pain caused by lots of time spent sitting and leaning forward, like those of us who work desk jobs and thus spend the day in a flexion-based pattern, where we’re rounding our spine. Since the Superman moves the body in the opposite direction, into an extension-based pattern where your spine arches back, it can help undo the tension created from parking our butts in a chair all day. Not only does the Superman open up the back in the opposite direction, but it can help alleviate tightness in the front of the hips too.
What kind of exercise is the Superman?
The move certainly makes your muscles quake, but it also puts your back into a bendy position, which begs the question: Is the Superman a strength move or a mobility drill? The verdict: “It’s officially a strength exercise,” Dr. Haas says. In fact, she warns
agains
t using it for mobility gains, since it’s really not intended for that—similar to how you shouldn’t grab a pair of dumbbells and do deadlifts if your goal is to lengthen your hamstrings. In the Superman, “you’re not trying to
stretch
out the front side by going into an arch,” Dr. Haas explains. “You’re trying to
strengthen
the posterior chain.”
What are common Superman form mistakes?
The goal of the Superman is to fire up your posterior chain, so that’s where you should feel muscles working, Dr. Haas explains. But it shouldn’t be painful, so if you feel pinching in your lower back or neck or crankiness in your shoulders as you do this exercise, it could mean you’re dealing with some muscle tightnesses that warrant making some adjustments so you can do it more comfortably.
For example, having
tight hip flexors
can shift the load to your lower back as you lift your legs up and cause discomfort there, Dr. Haas says. A possible fix? Reaching outward through your legs and spine instead of focusing on how high you lift them off the ground. Moreover, tightness in your upper back or shoulders can aggravate those areas when you reach your arms overhead. An easy remedy is to bring your arms down by your side.
Another mistake is lifting your legs and arms too high for your current mobility level. Pushing yourself into ranges of motion that are too much for your body can cause pain, so it’s important to respect your limits and only raise your limbs as high as feels comfortable.
Super as it may be, the Superman isn’t for everyone. In particular, people who are pregnant and no longer able to safely lie on their belly should avoid it, as well as folks who’ve recently gotten abdominal surgery, Dr. Haas says. It’s also a must-skip for people who find that pretty much
any
iteration of the movement causes them pain, she adds. Remember, the Superman exercise should not hurt.
How to slot in Supermans into your routine.
The Superman is an exercise you can do as often as every day, so long as that frequency doesn’t cause pain or make you feel overly sore afterward, Dr. Haas says. Doing it at the end of a work day—if you’re one of those people who sits a lot—can be helpful for alleviating back stiffness that comes from all that sedentary time.
For general strengthening, though, you probably don’t need to do it daily. Slotting it in a minimum of two times a week may be all you need to see gains. There’s no magic number of repetitions and sets—the right amount will depend on your current fitness level and goals—but as a general rule of thumb, you can aim for what the American College of Sports Medicine recommends for any beginner strength training: 1 to 3 sets of 8 to 12 reps. If you don’t want to get that technical, just tune into your body and do an amount that’s challenging but still doable with good form.
You can do it as a dynamic movement—where you’re moving in and out of the pose, as our GIF below shows. Or you can do it as an isometric exercise, where you get into the position and hold for a set time, which would challenge your muscular endurance more. Another option: Do a little of each, suggests Dr. Haas. For example, do 5 to 10 dynamic reps and then hold for 10 seconds.
How to do the Superman exercise:
Katie Thompson
Lie on your stomach with your legs extended behind you and your arms extended in front of you, palms resting on the floor. This is the starting position.
Keep your abs and butt tight as you lift your upper body and lower body off the ground at the same time. Keep your neck in line with your spine by resting your gaze on your fingertips as they move.
Pause for 2 seconds, then lower back down. This is 1 rep.

Any workout move that has you lying on your stomach may sound way too easy. But the Superman exercise is anything but—providing a muscle-trembling challenge and full-body benefits that are truly no joke.
There are several variations of this no-equipment move (which you may have seen before in yoga classes, Pilates, or
bodyweight strength workouts
), but the one we’re talking about here involves lying face down with your arms extended in front of you and legs straight out behind you. Then, you lift your limbs off the ground and, voilà, you’re in the pose. (If you picture the namesake comic book character in flight, you’ll understand where the exercise gets its title.)
“It’s a fun one,”
Nicole Haas, PT, DPT
, founder of
Boulder Physiolab
in Boulder, tells SELF. Not only does the Superman fire up important backside muscles, but it also technically checks the box for core strength work.
Here, we dig into all that this mighty move has to offer, including which muscles it targets, the full-body benefits, common form mistakes to avoid, how to weave it into your routine, and step-by-step instructions for doing it correctly. So unfurl your yoga mat and get ready to move like Clark Kent.
What muscles does the Superman work?
The Superman is a bodyweight exercise that really fires up your posterior chain—a.k.a. the back of your body, Dr. Haas says. In particular, it hits your erector spinae, a group of muscles that help arch your spine and run down the length of it, all the way from your neck to your lower back, Haas says. It also works your glutes and
hamstrings
, as well as your posterior deltoids (rear shoulder muscles), she adds.
Depending on how you do the exercise, you can also target the multifidus, a group of low back muscles that help stabilize the spine. To get more specific, if you lift your arms and legs just a couple of inches off the ground and focus on really lengthening through your back—extending from the crown of your head all the way to your feet—you’ll activate your multifidus, Dr. Haas says. You can also fire up this player by lifting up just one arm and the opposite leg at a time (for example, your right arm and left leg, or left arm and right leg, similar to the
bird dog
exercise). In that scenario, the multifidus kicks on to prevent your spine from rotating, Dr. Haas explains, which is what it naturally wants to do when you’re moving just one upper-body and one lower-body limb at a time.
Keep in mind if you raise your arms and legs higher, you’re not necessarily engaging more muscles or doing an advanced version of the move—it just means you have greater range of motion in back extension, Dr. Haas explains. In fact, for some people, keeping their limbs closer to the ground will deliver more of a challenge.
What are the benefits of the Superman?
The Superman probably isn’t what you envision when you picture
core exercises
—chances are, moves like crunches, sit-ups, or
planks
more readily come to mind—but it technically
is
a core move. That’s because your core isn’t
just
about your abs (those frontside torso muscles): It also includes the ones in your lower back. And for your core strength to be as well-rounded as possible, it’s important that
all
these muscles get worked, which is where the Superman can come in clutch, especially if you typically just do crunch-type ab moves. In particular, building lower back strength can help you stabilize better as you perform bigger moves, like squats, allowing you to do them more effectively and safely.
Beyond that, the Superman exercise can help folks who have lower back pain caused by lots of time spent sitting and leaning forward, like those of us who work desk jobs and thus spend the day in a flexion-based pattern, where we’re rounding our spine. Since the Superman moves the body in the opposite direction, into an extension-based pattern where your spine arches back, it can help undo the tension created from parking our butts in a chair all day. Not only does the Superman open up the back in the opposite direction, but it can help alleviate tightness in the front of the hips too.
What kind of exercise is the Superman?
The move certainly makes your muscles quake, but it also puts your back into a bendy position, which begs the question: Is the Superman a strength move or a mobility drill? The verdict: “It’s officially a strength exercise,” Dr. Haas says. In fact, she warns
agains
t using it for mobility gains, since it’s really not intended for that—similar to how you shouldn’t grab a pair of dumbbells and do deadlifts if your goal is to lengthen your hamstrings. In the Superman, “you’re not trying to
stretch
out the front side by going into an arch,” Dr. Haas explains. “You’re trying to
strengthen
the posterior chain.”
What are common Superman form mistakes?
The goal of the Superman is to fire up your posterior chain, so that’s where you should feel muscles working, Dr. Haas explains. But it shouldn’t be painful, so if you feel pinching in your lower back or neck or crankiness in your shoulders as you do this exercise, it could mean you’re dealing with some muscle tightnesses that warrant making some adjustments so you can do it more comfortably.
For example, having
tight hip flexors
can shift the load to your lower back as you lift your legs up and cause discomfort there, Dr. Haas says. A possible fix? Reaching outward through your legs and spine instead of focusing on how high you lift them off the ground. Moreover, tightness in your upper back or shoulders can aggravate those areas when you reach your arms overhead. An easy remedy is to bring your arms down by your side.
Another mistake is lifting your legs and arms too high for your current mobility level. Pushing yourself into ranges of motion that are too much for your body can cause pain, so it’s important to respect your limits and only raise your limbs as high as feels comfortable.
Super as it may be, the Superman isn’t for everyone. In particular, people who are pregnant and no longer able to safely lie on their belly should avoid it, as well as folks who’ve recently gotten abdominal surgery, Dr. Haas says. It’s also a must-skip for people who find that pretty much
any
iteration of the movement causes them pain, she adds. Remember, the Superman exercise should not hurt.

We love
a soft, strappy bralette
when we’re lounging at home—but certainly not when we’re hitting the pavement. For high-impact workouts, only the best running sports bras will do. And by that, we mean supportive, sweat-wicking bras that won’t let you down (literally) when you pick up the pace.
We’ve tested tons of sports bras over the years—as part of SELF’s annual Activewear Awards and in our own lives as runners and movement-lovers—so it’s safe to say we have some opinions on the matter. Here, we’ve highlighted our absolute favorite sports bras for runs,
cardio
, and other high-intensity activities. We also checked in with experts about what makes a bra better for these types of workouts to help you shop smarter.

Why is it important to wear a supportive sports bra during high-impact activities?
AccordionItemContainerButton
LargeChevron
Besides feeling comfortable (and avoiding a black eye), there are quite a few expert-backed reasons to wear supportive bras during runs and other high-impact workouts.
For one thing, your form changes if your chest isn’t well-supported,
Lindsay Nunamacher, PT, DPT
, a physical therapist at Hartford HealthCare, tells SELF. Running and jumping can cause your breasts to swing from side to side or bounce up and down. If you aren’t wearing anything that can help distribute the weight of your chest and reduce this movement, you’re more likely to change how you work out. Your pace might slow, your strides might shorten, or your posture might tip forward. “These mechanical changes can negatively affect [your] performance,” Dr. Nunamacher says.
Wearing bras that lack support may also lead to back and neck pain, Dr. Nunamacher says. Too much breast movement strains the rest of your upper body, which can cause your muscles to feel tired and sore more easily. Over time, your back may round and your head and neck may shift forward to compensate for that discomfort, she says. And
slouching
isn’t just bad for these areas—as SELF has previously reported, it can create aches throughout your entire body.
So for your short- and long-term comfort, it’s worth your while to spend some extra time browsing bras: “A good sports bra allows you to focus on your workout and continue your journey towards your own fitness and health goals without distraction,” Dr. Nunamacher says.
What to look for
AccordionItemContainerButton
LargeChevron
You probably already have some preferences when it comes to sports bras—maybe you like a zip-front closure or a racerback. In addition to those personal must-haves, below are a few other features you should keep in mind as you shop.
Fit:
Your bra should suit your measurements and cup size while providing some compression, NASM-certified
Peloton Tread instructor
Marcel Dinkins, CSCS
, tells SELF. That’ll help hold your breasts in and limit their motion (but you should still be able to move and breathe comfortably). She adds that those with larger busts—think DD cups and above—should look for encapsulation bras that have built-in, structured cups for a better fit.
Fabric:
Running bras should be built for sweat. Look for moisture-wicking, quick-drying materials like mesh and nylon, as well as breathable inserts or panels. Your bra should also feel smooth and comfortable when you’re working out (read: it shouldn’t chafe or rub against your skin). Seamless or flat-seamed designs are less likely to cause irritation, Dr. Nunamacher says.
Straps:
The right shoulder straps will help distribute the weight of your breasts. They should be wide, adjustable, and, for bonus points, padded. Skip skinny or trendy strap configurations like halters or one-shoulder necklines,
Hayley Akradi, CPT,
classes operations manager and national ultra fit program lead at Life Time, tells SELF. They’re cute for
low-impact workouts
, but they won’t offer the support you need during runs—and, Dr. Nunamacher points out that they can dig into and pull on your shoulders, neck, and traps (ouch).
Coverage:
Some extra coverage can help you feel more secure as you run. Dinkins recommends looking for higher-cut necklines and avoiding scoop neck sports bras.
Band:
Think of the band as the foundation of your bra’s support system: You want it to be sturdy and snug. Akradi looks for bras with bands that fit right under her bust, and Dinkins prioritizes thicker, wider bands—ideally, your bra will check all of these boxes.
Is it okay to wear a sports bra all day?
AccordionItemContainerButton
LargeChevron
Wearing a sports bra all day long is fine, as long as you feel comfortable. If the band is too tight and you feel restricted, take it off and keep searching for a better fitting bra. If you notice your bra is messing with your posture, restricting your normal breathing, or causing any skin irritation or breakouts, that’s also a sign to try a different style (or none at all) and see how you feel.
How tight should a running sports bra be?
AccordionItemContainerButton
LargeChevron
A running sports bra should fit snugly, but it shouldn’t be so tight that you feel like it’s hard to breathe, and the straps shouldn’t cause pain and discomfort by digging into your shoulders. A general rule of thumb: You should be able to fit two fingers under your straps. If the fabric around the cups is wrinkled, that’s a sign the bra is too big or doesn’t fit properly. Your sports bra should make you feel supported but comfortable, both when you are and aren’t running.

SheFit
Pros
Highly adjustable
Durable
Available in cute colors
Cons
Next to none—practically perfect
Talk about staying power—SheFit’s viral Ultimate Sports Bra has won multiple
SELF Activewear Awards
, including
last year’s Reader’s Choice Award
. “This is the first and only bra that actually holds me together while still being comfortable,” one reader told us. “It's the perfect merger of real support and style, and keeps my 38Fs from hitting me in the face during a full marathon.” Another reader said that after this bra entered their life, they no longer had to layer sports bras to keep their chest bounce-free while refereeing soccer games.
The wide band and padded straps are adjustable, up to 15 and 8 inches, respectively (one reader noted that their SheFit bra fits perfectly, even though they have a larger bust and a smaller rib cage). Its front zip closure adds further security, and the convertible straps can be worn as an X- or H-back. In a world where it’s still perplexingly hard to find a bra that fits, SheFit and its many customizable details meets you right where you are.

ThirdLove
Pros
Very comfortable
Adjustable, convertible straps
Molded cups don’t have any underwire
Cons
Normally more expensive than our overall pick
ThirdLove won our 2024 Activewear Award for Best High-Impact Sports Bra because it defied expectations. “It seems like the more high-impact [sports bras] get, the less comfortable they get,” one of our judges said. “The ThirdLove Kinetic adjustable sports bra isn’t that—it’s very supportive without feeling extremely tight and heavy.”
It strikes that balance with the help of a few small, intentional features: Its band offers a bit of adjustability with a hook-and-loop closure, and the convertible straps can also be adjusted. Even better? ThirdLove swaps underwires for molded cups, which lift and separate your breasts without any unpleasant digging.

Cons
Some reviewers say the straps are too short
One SELF staffer swears by Old Navy for affordable, colorful, surprisingly supportive sports bras (she wore one marketed as “medium support” for a half marathon without complaints).
While her personal faves are no longer in stock, you can find similarly budget-friendly, bounce-limiting options available now, like the best-selling High Support PowerSoft Bra. It’s smooth, sweat-wicking, and lightly compressive. Reviewers love it for its ability to keep their breasts still on runs, as well as its super soft feel.

“I like this one because it gives me a little more coverage if I want to run shirtless in the summer,” one SELF staffer says, adding that she loves how much storage the Brooks 3 Pocket Sport Bra has. (That’s one mesh pocket on each side and a third between your shoulder blades, while we’re counting.) The larger pocket is perfect for your phone, while the other two can hold your keys, credit card, or (in our staffer’s case) extra gels. Considered a medium support sports bra, this option has a decent amount of compression and comes with removable cups, so you can move freely and securely.

Pros
Moisture-wicking fabric
Retains stretch without losing its structure
Cons

Another SELF staffer considers Nike’s Swoosh line of sports bras a “classic” for anyone, including those with large breasts. This non-padded, high-support style is ideal for higher-impact workouts. The band has a sleek, extendable closure for a dialed-in fit, while the mesh lining in the front and back of the bra sheds sweat and boosts airflow. In other words, when you up the intensity, this bra keeps moving with you and helps you cool down faster.

Athleta
Interval Bra
$49
Athleta
Pros
Works for many different activities
Comfortable pullover racerback style
UPF 40+ fabric protects your skin from the sun
Cons
Not adjustable
Athleta’s Interval Bra is cherished by reviewers (it has a near perfect rating on the brand’s website) for its supportive feel and well-placed back cutouts. Available in a range of sizes in two different cuts (one designed for
A to C cups
and one for
D-DD cups
), this bra is also made from fabric that’s rated UPF 40+, meaning it’ll help protect your skin from the sun’s UV rays when you go for a jog outside.
“I love this bra. I wear it for tennis, walking, rowing, barre. Not too tight and holds everything where it needs to be,” wrote one reviewer. “This is the first sports bra I’ve tried made for a D cup, and the fit is so much better.” It’s designed to be a medium-support bra, so you can wear it comfortably for lots of different types of exercise. But it’s also compressive enough to help you feel contained, if you want to wear it while running.

Pros
Extremely supportive and bounce-reducing
Wide, comfortable, adjustable band

Cons

Limited color options
One SELF staffer exclusively runs in Knix’s Catalyst: “It’s the only sports bra for bigger boobs I’ve tried that keeps bounce to a minimum when running and doesn’t squeeze the shit out of your rib cage and back,” she says. Its wide band (which features five rows of hook-and-loop closures) is snug, smooth, and doesn’t dig or cause any back bulges, she adds. The straps are adjustable, the cups are built in for a smoother silhouette, and the entire bra was found to drastically reduce motion in a 2018 treadmill study.
One thing to note: Our staffer says the Catalyst bra may feel a little
too
snug at first, but she found that it eventually stretched and molded to fit her nicely.

Not supportive enough for people with larger chests
A SELF staffer who “doesn’t need a ton of support” and usually wears a AAA cup size has multiple Wundermost bralettes in different colors—and says she pretty much only wears them on runs. Made with Lululemon’s super-soft, brushed Nulu fabric, this bra has a lightweight feel that won’t distract you when you’re on the move. It’s also made to wick sweat and stretch in four directions. Just bear in mind that this bra isn’t designed to provide a locked-in feel, like many other options on our list are.

This

from Adidas is another staffer favorite for its slightly longer length (you can wear it as a standalone workout top, if you so choose), medium level of support, and cleverly placed pockets. They’re located along the bra’s front—so, in the words of one SELF editor, “you can easily stick a gel in there and don’t have to contort yourself to reach it.”
And here’s one more feature that helps ensure consistent coverage: The bra’s padding is removable, but if you decide to keep it, you don’t have to worry about it shifting around in the middle of your run. The padding features little grippy dots to help it stay put (genius).

One SELF writer is a big fan of New Balance’s sports bras for marathon training. “They’re super soft and I’ve never had chafing issues with them, which is super important during long runs,” she says. “I also find that the padding is high quality, doesn’t fold up in the laundry, and looks really flattering on my small chest.”
While the style she loves is no longer available, this classic racerback is similar. With a thick, wide band and a high neck, it should keep you locked in during any high-impact activities.

“I love all things Vuori; their leggings and sports bras are made of peach-fuzz-soft fabric and somehow stay in place as you move without feeling constructive,” says one SELF writer. This classic sports bra hits all of those marks too, with a higher neckline than most of Vuori’s bras, which makes it a solid pick for running (or really any activity).
“It is SO hard for me to find bras that fit loosely enough to be comfortable and not feel compressed in, but fit enough to contain my breasts in a yoga class that includes lots of going upside down, lying down, twisting, etc. This one is a rare winner!” one Vuori reviewer wrote.

It should be a staple in every runner or gym-goer's wardrobe.”

The adjustable straps mean you can dial in the fit, the mesh panels keep the air flowing, and the molded cups will be particularly comfy for bigger breast sizes. “This bra definitely keeps the girls in and secured,” wrote one Champion reviewer. Just keep in mind that the zipper doesn’t have a cover at the top, so if you tend to chafe there, you might want to invest in a different style.

We love
a soft, strappy bralette
when we’re lounging at home—but certainly not when we’re hitting the pavement. For high-impact workouts, only the best running sports bras will do. And by that, we mean supportive, sweat-wicking bras that won’t let you down (literally) when you pick up the pace.
We’ve tested tons of sports bras over the years—as part of SELF’s annual Activewear Awards and in our own lives as runners and movement-lovers—so it’s safe to say we have some opinions on the matter. Here, we’ve highlighted our absolute favorite sports bras for runs,
cardio
, and other high-intensity activities. We also checked in with experts about what makes a bra better for these types of workouts to help you shop smarter.

Why is it important to wear a supportive sports bra during high-impact activities?
AccordionItemContainerButton
LargeChevron
Besides feeling comfortable (and avoiding a black eye), there are quite a few expert-backed reasons to wear supportive bras during runs and other high-impact workouts.
For one thing, your form changes if your chest isn’t well-supported,
Lindsay Nunamacher, PT, DPT
, a physical therapist at Hartford HealthCare, tells SELF. Running and jumping can cause your breasts to swing from side to side or bounce up and down. If you aren’t wearing anything that can help distribute the weight of your chest and reduce this movement, you’re more likely to change how you work out. Your pace might slow, your strides might shorten, or your posture might tip forward. “These mechanical changes can negatively affect [your] performance,” Dr. Nunamacher says.
Wearing bras that lack support may also lead to back and neck pain, Dr. Nunamacher says. Too much breast movement strains the rest of your upper body, which can cause your muscles to feel tired and sore more easily. Over time, your back may round and your head and neck may shift forward to compensate for that discomfort, she says. And
slouching
isn’t just bad for these areas—as SELF has previously reported, it can create aches throughout your entire body.
So for your short- and long-term comfort, it’s worth your while to spend some extra time browsing bras: “A good sports bra allows you to focus on your workout and continue your journey towards your own fitness and health goals without distraction,” Dr. Nunamacher says.
What to look for
AccordionItemContainerButton
LargeChevron
You probably already have some preferences when it comes to sports bras—maybe you like a zip-front closure or a racerback. In addition to those personal must-haves, below are a few other features you should keep in mind as you shop.
Fit:
Your bra should suit your measurements and cup size while providing some compression, NASM-certified
Peloton Tread instructor
Marcel Dinkins, CSCS
, tells SELF. That’ll help hold your breasts in and limit their motion (but you should still be able to move and breathe comfortably). She adds that those with larger busts—think DD cups and above—should look for encapsulation bras that have built-in, structured cups for a better fit.
Fabric:
Running bras should be built for sweat. Look for moisture-wicking, quick-drying materials like mesh and nylon, as well as breathable inserts or panels. Your bra should also feel smooth and comfortable when you’re working out (read: it shouldn’t chafe or rub against your skin). Seamless or flat-seamed designs are less likely to cause irritation, Dr. Nunamacher says.
Straps:
The right shoulder straps will help distribute the weight of your breasts. They should be wide, adjustable, and, for bonus points, padded. Skip skinny or trendy strap configurations like halters or one-shoulder necklines,
Hayley Akradi, CPT,
classes operations manager and national ultra fit program lead at Life Time, tells SELF. They’re cute for
low-impact workouts
, but they won’t offer the support you need during runs—and, Dr. Nunamacher points out that they can dig into and pull on your shoulders, neck, and traps (ouch).
Coverage:
Some extra coverage can help you feel more secure as you run. Dinkins recommends looking for higher-cut necklines and avoiding scoop neck sports bras.
Band:
Think of the band as the foundation of your bra’s support system: You want it to be sturdy and snug. Akradi looks for bras with bands that fit right under her bust, and Dinkins prioritizes thicker, wider bands—ideally, your bra will check all of these boxes.
Is it okay to wear a sports bra all day?
AccordionItemContainerButton
LargeChevron
Wearing a sports bra all day long is fine, as long as you feel comfortable. If the band is too tight and you feel restricted, take it off and keep searching for a better fitting bra. If you notice your bra is messing with your posture, restricting your normal breathing, or causing any skin irritation or breakouts, that’s also a sign to try a different style (or none at all) and see how you feel.
How tight should a running sports bra be?
AccordionItemContainerButton
LargeChevron
A running sports bra should fit snugly, but it shouldn’t be so tight that you feel like it’s hard to breathe, and the straps shouldn’t cause pain and discomfort by digging into your shoulders. A general rule of thumb: You should be able to fit two fingers under your straps. If the fabric around the cups is wrinkled, that’s a sign the bra is too big or doesn’t fit properly. Your sports bra should make you feel supported but comfortable, both when you are and aren’t running.

SheFit
Pros
Highly adjustable
Durable
Available in cute colors
Cons
Next to none—practically perfect
Talk about staying power—SheFit’s viral Ultimate Sports Bra has won multiple
SELF Activewear Awards
, including
last year’s Reader’s Choice Award
. “This is the first and only bra that actually holds me together while still being comfortable,” one reader told us. “It's the perfect merger of real support and style, and keeps my 38Fs from hitting me in the face during a full marathon.” Another reader said that after this bra entered their life, they no longer had to layer sports bras to keep their chest bounce-free while refereeing soccer games.
The wide band and padded straps are adjustable, up to 15 and 8 inches, respectively (one reader noted that their SheFit bra fits perfectly, even though they have a larger bust and a smaller rib cage). Its front zip closure adds further security, and the convertible straps can be worn as an X- or H-back. In a world where it’s still perplexingly hard to find a bra that fits, SheFit and its many customizable details meets you right where you are.

Cons
Normally more expensive than our overall pick
ThirdLove won our 2024 Activewear Award for Best High-Impact Sports Bra because it defied expectations. “It seems like the more high-impact [sports bras] get, the less comfortable they get,” one of our judges said. “The ThirdLove Kinetic adjustable sports bra isn’t that—it’s very supportive without feeling extremely tight and heavy.”
It strikes that balance with the help of a few small, intentional features: Its band offers a bit of adjustability with a hook-and-loop closure, and the convertible straps can also be adjusted. Even better? ThirdLove swaps underwires for molded cups, which lift and separate your breasts without any unpleasant digging.

While her personal faves are no longer in stock, you can find similarly budget-friendly, bounce-limiting options available now, like the best-selling High Support PowerSoft Bra. It’s smooth, sweat-wicking, and lightly compressive. Reviewers love it for its ability to keep their breasts still on runs, as well as its super soft feel.

“I like this one because it gives me a little more coverage if I want to run shirtless in the summer,” one SELF staffer says, adding that she loves how much storage the Brooks 3 Pocket Sport Bra has. (That’s one mesh pocket on each side and a third between your shoulder blades, while we’re counting.) The larger pocket is perfect for your phone, while the other two can hold your keys, credit card, or (in our staffer’s case) extra gels. Considered a medium support sports bra, this option has a decent amount of compression and comes with removable cups, so you can move freely and securely.

Another SELF staffer considers Nike’s Swoosh line of sports bras a “classic” for anyone, including those with large breasts. This non-padded, high-support style is ideal for higher-impact workouts. The band has a sleek, extendable closure for a dialed-in fit, while the mesh lining in the front and back of the bra sheds sweat and boosts airflow. In other words, when you up the intensity, this bra keeps moving with you and helps you cool down faster.

Athleta
Pros
Works for many different activities
Comfortable pullover racerback style
UPF 40+ fabric protects your skin from the sun
Cons
Not adjustable
Athleta’s Interval Bra is cherished by reviewers (it has a near perfect rating on the brand’s website) for its supportive feel and well-placed back cutouts. Available in a range of sizes in two different cuts (one designed for
A to C cups
and one for
D-DD cups
), this bra is also made from fabric that’s rated UPF 40+, meaning it’ll help protect your skin from the sun’s UV rays when you go for a jog outside.
“I love this bra. I wear it for tennis, walking, rowing, barre. Not too tight and holds everything where it needs to be,” wrote one reviewer. “This is the first sports bra I’ve tried made for a D cup, and the fit is so much better.” It’s designed to be a medium-support bra, so you can wear it comfortably for lots of different types of exercise. But it’s also compressive enough to help you feel contained, if you want to wear it while running.

Pros

Limited color options
One SELF staffer exclusively runs in Knix’s Catalyst: “It’s the only sports bra for bigger boobs I’ve tried that keeps bounce to a minimum when running and doesn’t squeeze the shit out of your rib cage and back,” she says. Its wide band (which features five rows of hook-and-loop closures) is snug, smooth, and doesn’t dig or cause any back bulges, she adds. The straps are adjustable, the cups are built in for a smoother silhouette, and the entire bra was found to drastically reduce motion in a 2018 treadmill study.
One thing to note: Our staffer says the Catalyst bra may feel a little
too
snug at first, but she found that it eventually stretched and molded to fit her nicely.

A SELF staffer who “doesn’t need a ton of support” and usually wears a AAA cup size has multiple Wundermost bralettes in different colors—and says she pretty much only wears them on runs. Made with Lululemon’s super-soft, brushed Nulu fabric, this bra has a lightweight feel that won’t distract you when you’re on the move. It’s also made to wick sweat and stretch in four directions. Just bear in mind that this bra isn’t designed to provide a locked-in feel, like many other options on our list are.

And here’s one more feature that helps ensure consistent coverage: The bra’s padding is removable, but if you decide to keep it, you don’t have to worry about it shifting around in the middle of your run. The padding features little grippy dots to help it stay put (genius).

This classic sports bra hits all of those marks too, with a higher neckline than most of Vuori’s bras, which makes it a solid pick for running (or really any activity).
“It is SO hard for me to find bras that fit loosely enough to be comfortable and not feel compressed in, but fit enough to contain my breasts in a yoga class that includes lots of going upside down, lying down, twisting, etc. This one is a rare winner!” one Vuori reviewer wrote.

How to Do the Clam Shell Exercise to Fire Up Your Side-Butt
Pretty much everyone could benefit from doing this move.

Anyone who spends a lot of the day sitting could probably stand to strengthen their glutes. And the clam shell exercise is an excellent way to do just that.
But it also offers a whole lot more. This exercise—which is a staple in rehab and
prehab
physical therapy programs, as well as a fixture in some
Pilates classes
—ushers in a host of total-body benefits that go beyond the butt. Think: injury prevention, reduced pain, and overall better movement.
In case you’re not familiar, the clam shell involves lying on your side with your hips, knees, and ankles stacked on top of each other and knees bent to a 90-degree angle. Then, keeping your feet pressed together, you simply lift and then lower your top leg, performing a motion called hip abduction (basically using your hip muscles to move your leg away from your body). Watch a demo and you’ll understand where it gets its name: The exercise mimics the motion of its namesake sea creature.
The clam shell is simple, yes, but its benefits are seriously legit. Here we cover all you need to know about this super-effective move, including which muscles it works, what type of exercise it counts as, what you’ll gain by doing it on the reg, form errors to avoid, and tips for weaving it into your routine. Then we have a GIF and step-by-step instructions so you can try out the clam shell for yourself!
What muscles does the clam shell work?
Do enough reps of the clam shell and you’ll feel your gluteal muscles put to
work.
Specifically, this exercise really fires up your gluteus maximus (your biggest butt muscle) as well as your gluteus medius, a smaller muscle that forms your
side butt
,
Femi Betiku, PT, DPT, CSCS
, a physical therapist and Pilates instructor in Westchester, New York, tells SELF.
It also engages your tensor fasciae latae (TFL), one of the hip flexors, as well as your external
obliques
, core muscles that run along the sides of your torso, he adds. These two muscles get especially fired up if you use some type of resistance to complete the move—people most commonly do it with a mini-band placed above their knees—since that requires your body to work extra hard to help stabilize your trunk as you complete the clam shell motion.
What kind of exercise is the clam shell?
What box the clam shell ticks depends on your current activity level. If you’re new to exercise, it can be a muscular strength and endurance move, Dr. Betiku says. In other words, it can help your muscles get stronger and boost their ability to work for long periods of time. But if you’re already pretty active, then it’s more of a warm-up drill that can help engage your muscles before you use them more intensely during a workout. That’s because the glutes are one of the strongest muscles in the body, and in order to grow and strengthen them, you need resistance that’s heavy enough to really challenge them. Depending on your current strength level, a band may do this initially, but sooner or later, it won’t be up to snuff.
The clamshell is also commonly used in the rehab and prehab world, meaning it’s prescribed to help people recover from pain and injury, as well as prevent those issues in the first place (more on that below!).
One thing the clam shell definitely
isn’t
is a mobility exercise. Yes, it involves moving your glute muscles through a range of motion, which may possibly boost mobility there, but that’s not the main idea of the exercise. Instead, think of that as “just an added benefit,” Dr. Betiku explains.
What are the benefits of the clam shell?
By incorporating clam shells into your routine, you can bolster the strength of your glutes, get them ready to work, and reduce your chances of aches, niggles, and issues in a whole bunch of areas.
Here’s why: The gen population generally has weak glutes, thanks to spending a lot of time sitting, Dr. Betiku says. That’s a problem, since this powerhouse muscle group is designed to support a bunch of other areas of the body—including your lower back, hips, and knees, Dr. Betiku explains. So when their strength isn’t up to snuff, you can have pain and injuries in all those surrounding regions, since they’re not getting the support they need. This is why the clam shell is ubiquitous in rehab and rehab settings. It’s effective for both preventing and alleviating a host of issues throughout the body, whether that’s
knee pain
that flares up with running or lower back pain that’s triggered by toting your child’s car seat.
The banded version of the clam shell also hits your external obliques, which kick on when you complete rotational movements, like running, walking, playing sports or even everyday life tasks like picking up and carrying a heavy bag of groceries. When the external obliques (plus other
core muscles
) aren’t strong enough for these tasks, your lower back can start to compensate, Dr. Betiku explains. That can lead to back pain, providing yet another example of how the clam shell can really come in clutch.
Long story short: Doing clam shells on the reg can help lower your injury risk and generally just make you a better mover—both in and out of the gym.
What are some mistakes people make with the clam shell?
The clam shell may
seem
like a simple exercise—and in a lot of ways, it
is
—but it’s not foolproof. The biggest form error, according to Dr. Betiku, is using other body parts to complete the movement instead of allowing the glutes to be the stars of the show. This makes the exercise not as effective.
When done correctly, the only thing that should be moving is your top knee and top hip—everything above the waist and below the knee should be still, Dr. Betiku says. If you struggle with this, try doing the move alongside a wall: Press your head, upper back, lower back, and heels against it and perform the move from there. “The only thing that's protruding away from the wall is your knee,” Dr. Betiku says. As you move your top knee up and down, keep everything pressed against the wall. This will ensure your glutes take charge.
How should you include clam shells in your workout routine?
This is another one that depends on your current activity level. If you’re new to exercise, do it with no equipment (use just your bodyweight) to start, aiming for 3 sets of 10 reps, Dr. Betiku says. If propping yourself up onto your forearm, like the below GIF shows, feels too challenging, rest your head on your bottom arm or a pillow. You can weave the clam shell into whatever workout you have planned, slotting it alongside other strengthening exercises, and repeat it as often as every other day.
Folks who are already active can do it with a light resistance band (place it just above your knees) and again, complete 3 sets of 10 reps. In this scenario, the move works great as a warm-up activation drill before a workout, Dr. Betiku says—like this four-move
lower-body dumbbell routine
, for example.
How to do the clam shell exercise:
Katie Thompson
​​Lie on your right side with your hips, knees, and ankles stacked on top of each other. Bend your knees to 90 degrees and wrap the band around your thighs just above your knees. Rest your top hand on the ground. This is the starting position.
Keeping your feet together, lift your left knee open, then slowly lower it back to meet your left. This is 1 repetition.
Focus on keeping your core engaged and your back straight as you do these moves. Try not to lean forward or tip back.
Do all your reps, then switch sides and repeat.
If the OG clam shell feels easy, try this more advanced version:
Katie Thompson
Prop your body up on your right arm, with your elbow stacked underneath your shoulder and your hand in front of your body.
Stack your left leg and foot on top of your right, and bend your knees to form a 45-degree angle. Place your left hand on your hip. This is the starting position.
Drive through your knees and left forearm to lift your hips off the ground. As you do, lift your left knee up toward the ceiling, keeping your feet touching. Use your glutes to initiate the movement, and squeeze them as you lift.
Lower your left leg back to meet the right. At the same time, lower your hips back to starting position. This is 1 rep.
Complete 10 reps per side, then switch sides.
In this advanced variation of the move, you’ll work your glutes as well as your shoulder stabilizing muscles. Plus, you’ll fire up your hips and obliques on the side of the body that’s moving as well as the side that’s holding still. Make it harder by lifting your top hip up, holding it still and moving just your top knee.

Anyone who spends a lot of the day sitting could probably stand to strengthen their glutes. And the clam shell exercise is an excellent way to do just that.
But it also offers a whole lot more. This exercise—which is a staple in rehab and
prehab
physical therapy programs, as well as a fixture in some
Pilates classes
—ushers in a host of total-body benefits that go beyond the butt. Think: injury prevention, reduced pain, and overall better movement.
In case you’re not familiar, the clam shell involves lying on your side with your hips, knees, and ankles stacked on top of each other and knees bent to a 90-degree angle. Then, keeping your feet pressed together, you simply lift and then lower your top leg, performing a motion called hip abduction (basically using your hip muscles to move your leg away from your body). Watch a demo and you’ll understand where it gets its name: The exercise mimics the motion of its namesake sea creature.
The clam shell is simple, yes, but its benefits are seriously legit. Here we cover all you need to know about this super-effective move, including which muscles it works, what type of exercise it counts as, what you’ll gain by doing it on the reg, form errors to avoid, and tips for weaving it into your routine. Then we have a GIF and step-by-step instructions so you can try out the clam shell for yourself!
What muscles does the clam shell work?
Do enough reps of the clam shell and you’ll feel your gluteal muscles put to
work.
Specifically, this exercise really fires up your gluteus maximus (your biggest butt muscle) as well as your gluteus medius, a smaller muscle that forms your
side butt
,
Femi Betiku, PT, DPT, CSCS
, a physical therapist and Pilates instructor in Westchester, New York, tells SELF.
It also engages your tensor fasciae latae (TFL), one of the hip flexors, as well as your external
obliques
, core muscles that run along the sides of your torso, he adds. These two muscles get especially fired up if you use some type of resistance to complete the move—people most commonly do it with a mini-band placed above their knees—since that requires your body to work extra hard to help stabilize your trunk as you complete the clam shell motion.
What kind of exercise is the clam shell?
What box the clam shell ticks depends on your current activity level. If you’re new to exercise, it can be a muscular strength and endurance move, Dr. Betiku says. In other words, it can help your muscles get stronger and boost their ability to work for long periods of time. But if you’re already pretty active, then it’s more of a warm-up drill that can help engage your muscles before you use them more intensely during a workout. That’s because the glutes are one of the strongest muscles in the body, and in order to grow and strengthen them, you need resistance that’s heavy enough to really challenge them. Depending on your current strength level, a band may do this initially, but sooner or later, it won’t be up to snuff.
The clamshell is also commonly used in the rehab and prehab world, meaning it’s prescribed to help people recover from pain and injury, as well as prevent those issues in the first place (more on that below!).
One thing the clam shell definitely
isn’t
is a mobility exercise. Yes, it involves moving your glute muscles through a range of motion, which may possibly boost mobility there, but that’s not the main idea of the exercise. Instead, think of that as “just an added benefit,” Dr. Betiku explains.
What are the benefits of the clam shell?
By incorporating clam shells into your routine, you can bolster the strength of your glutes, get them ready to work, and reduce your chances of aches, niggles, and issues in a whole bunch of areas.
Here’s why: The gen population generally has weak glutes, thanks to spending a lot of time sitting, Dr. Betiku says. That’s a problem, since this powerhouse muscle group is designed to support a bunch of other areas of the body—including your lower back, hips, and knees, Dr. Betiku explains. So when their strength isn’t up to snuff, you can have pain and injuries in all those surrounding regions, since they’re not getting the support they need. This is why the clam shell is ubiquitous in rehab and rehab settings. It’s effective for both preventing and alleviating a host of issues throughout the body, whether that’s
knee pain
that flares up with running or lower back pain that’s triggered by toting your child’s car seat.
The banded version of the clam shell also hits your external obliques, which kick on when you complete rotational movements, like running, walking, playing sports or even everyday life tasks like picking up and carrying a heavy bag of groceries. When the external obliques (plus other
core muscles
) aren’t strong enough for these tasks, your lower back can start to compensate, Dr. Betiku explains. That can lead to back pain, providing yet another example of how the clam shell can really come in clutch.
Long story short: Doing clam shells on the reg can help lower your injury risk and generally just make you a better mover—both in and out of the gym.
What are some mistakes people make with the clam shell?
The clam shell may
seem
like a simple exercise—and in a lot of ways, it
is
—but it’s not foolproof. The biggest form error, according to Dr. Betiku, is using other body parts to complete the movement instead of allowing the glutes to be the stars of the show. This makes the exercise not as effective.
When done correctly, the only thing that should be moving is your top knee and top hip—everything above the waist and below the knee should be still, Dr. Betiku says. If you struggle with this, try doing the move alongside a wall: Press your head, upper back, lower back, and heels against it and perform the move from there. “The only thing that's protruding away from the wall is your knee,” Dr. Betiku says. As you move your top knee up and down, keep everything pressed against the wall. This will ensure your glutes take charge.
How should you include clam shells in your workout routine?
This is another one that depends on your current activity level. If you’re new to exercise, do it with no equipment (use just your bodyweight) to start, aiming for 3 sets of 10 reps, Dr. Betiku says. If propping yourself up onto your forearm, like the below GIF shows, feels too challenging, rest your head on your bottom arm or a pillow. You can weave the clam shell into whatever workout you have planned, slotting it alongside other strengthening exercises, and repeat it as often as every other day.
Folks who are already active can do it with a light resistance band (place it just above your knees) and again, complete 3 sets of 10 reps. In this scenario, the move works great as a warm-up activation drill before a workout, Dr. Betiku says—like this four-move
lower-body dumbbell routine
, for example.
How to do the clam shell exercise:
Katie Thompson
​​Lie on your right side with your hips, knees, and ankles stacked on top of each other. Bend your knees to 90 degrees and wrap the band around your thighs just above your knees. Rest your top hand on the ground. This is the starting position.
Keeping your feet together, lift your left knee open, then slowly lower it back to meet your left. This is 1 repetition.

enjoying a vinyasa flow
while wearing leggings that slip down, pinch, or pull in all the wrong places, you know this to be true.)
With that in mind, we curated a list of great exercise leggings for all sorts of activities, selected from tons of pairs we’ve tested and had recommended to us by experts over the years.
Our top picks

Athleta Salutation Stash Tight

What to look for when shopping for exercise leggings
If you’re ready to update your leggings collection, here are a few tips we recommend keeping in mind as you shop.
Activity
AccordionItemContainerButton
LargeChevron
High-impact activities, like running, and gentler movements, like stretching, call for different types of leggings. For the former, you may want a pair that’s thicker, more compressive, and sweatproof. Meanwhile, you’ll probably prefer softer, lighter-weight leggings for yoga,
Pilates
, and other lower-intensity workouts.
Length
AccordionItemContainerButton
LargeChevron
Leggings come in a range of lengths, from full-length (meaning they go all the way to the bottom of your ankle) to 7/8 (which hit around or just above the ankle) to capri (which usually stop at the middle of your calf). When in doubt, measure your inseam length—the distance from your crotch to the spot on your leg or ankle where you want the leggings to hit—and have your number handy while you browse.
Material
AccordionItemContainerButton
LargeChevron
Any leggings should have a good amount of spandex, Lycra, elastane, or other stretchy material to ensure they fit close to your body without restricting your movement. Beyond that, look for pairs made with moisture-wicking, breathable, squat-proof, extra soft, or cold-weather-ready materials. As mentioned above, your go-to workouts can also help you determine which fabrics will work best.
Rise
AccordionItemContainerButton
LargeChevron
This is more a personal preference than anything else, but it’s still important to check how high the waistband goes on a new pair of leggings, especially if coverage and support are key for you. You can find low-, medium-, and high-rise options, but high-rise is the most common.
Additional features
AccordionItemContainerButton
LargeChevron
Don’t forget nice-to-have elements like a drawstring, well-placed pockets, and breathable mesh panels. Depending on what you like, these add-ons can turn a solid pair of leggings into an exceptional one.
FAQs about shopping for exercise leggings
Should I size up or down in leggings?
AccordionItemContainerButton
LargeChevron
If you’re between sizes, you should usually size down in leggings. Since they’re typically made of stretchy fabrics, they should expand to fit you, and they tend to get looser over time, so starting with a tighter pair is usually better. (After all, leggings are meant to be snug—and you don’t want them to be falling down as you work out.) That being said, if you’re considering a super compressive pair of leggings, you might want to size up, since the fabric will fit tighter and may feel too restrictive in a smaller size.
Why do my leggings roll down at the waist?
AccordionItemContainerButton
LargeChevron
Leggings that are too big, have lost their elasticity, or are lower-rise may be more likely to roll down. So if this is a common issue for you, look for styles that are high-waisted, with a thick, compressive waistband and a drawstring.
On the other hand, sometimes super-high-waisted styles can roll down to meet the indent of your natural waist. Ideally, the top of your leggings’ waistband will hit you right at your natural waist or only slightly above. When you try them on, jump around, bend, and stretch in your leggings to make sure they’ll stay put.

Athleta
Pros
Extremely comfortable and versatile
Breathable fabric
Durable
Cons
Next to none—practically perfect
Wherever your day takes you, you’ll be prepared in Athleta’s best-selling Salutation Stash High Rise Legging. It’s one of the brand’s most popular leggings for its wonderfully deep pockets (that somehow don’t add a ton of bulk); wide, comfy waistband; and thick fabric.
Incredible durability was another reason we named the Salutation Stash the Best Leggings for Pretty Much Anything in our 2024 Activewear Awards—one of our judges was confident that these can last for years of wear. “These are my everything leggings,” they wrote. “I have been buying the Stash from Athleta for years, and they hold up. I teach barre, lift weights, hike trails, and browse the aisles of Trader Joe’s in them constantly.”

These Old Navy leggings were our readers’ pick for this year’s
Activewear Awards
—and wow, did they have a lot to say: “I literally have 25 pairs, and they’re the only bottoms I’ll do races in. The side pockets are so great, I don’t even need to wear running belts during my training runs to keep my phone, gum, and keys handy,” one explained.
Another reader shouted out their price point, durability, compression level, and, perhaps most importantly, sweat resistance: “I wear them for my long runs on the treadmill, and they don’t show sweat stains.”

Arguably
the most-loved Lulu bottoms
across the board, the Aligns belong in the dictionary under “yoga leggings.” Extra soft and non-constricting, they’re designed to feel like a second skin that moves with you as you stretch, bend, and flow.
“It truly doesn’t feel like you’re wearing pants, and they never cause chafing,” wrote one 2024 Activewear Awards judge. While they’re basically ideal for yoga, our judges and one SoulCycle instructor also recommended the Align leggings for indoor cycling and simply wearing around the house.

Cons

Pricey
Every distance runner knows that pockets are everything, and this pair packs plenty. With two large, envelope-style pockets and a third, zippered one in the back of the waistband, you won’t have to wear a running belt on longer loops.
These high-waisted leggings are made from a double-sided fabric that’ll keep you warm on chilly mornings or evenings—plus, they have a drawstring, so you can adjust the fit (meaning they’ll still feel good after the post-gel bloat). Zippers at the ankles also make them easy to get off when you’re sweaty.

Pros
Relatively affordable for the quality
Compressive, supportive fit and feel
Extra high-rise waistband
Cons
Some may find the compression too strong
If you’re looking for workhorse leggings that’ll keep up with you through HIIT classes, lifting sessions, and
cardio workouts
, you need a pair of supportive, ultra-high-waisted Reebok Luxes, which won a 2023 Activewear Award for their reliability and versatility.
“Sometimes full-length leggings look ‘bunchy’ at the ankles, but these were perfect,” one SELF tester wrote. “The high waistband is extremely comfortable and flattering. They’re absolutely squat-proof as well. I felt very confident, and I was able to complete all workouts without having to pull them up or adjust them at all (even during a sweaty vinyasa yoga class).”

Cons
May run small, according to reviewers
A two-time Activewear Award winner in 2021 and
2022
, Spanx’s Booty Boost Active leggings are about as reliable as leggings get (and win bonus points for their highly flattering fit). “These are perfection,” wrote one tester, who wears a size 2X. “They did not move. The leggings are high-waist and cover my entire tummy as a plus-size woman. Where have these leggings been all my life?”
Another SELF tester raved about their versatility: “I could wear these leggings to the office and no one would know that they are for workouts.” They fit like a glove and look great even after hours of wear, making the Booty Boost Active our top pick for all-day wear (no contest!).

SuperFit Hero
Pros

At this point, it’s an odd year when SuperFit Hero’s highly compressive, squat-test-passing SuperHold pocket leggings
don’t
win an Activewear Award (their earliest appearance was in
2019
). Throughout the years, they’ve wowed our testers with their extremely secure fit, inclusive size range, and overall great look (an influencer who tested a pair in 2022 said the SuperHolds were their go-to leggings for on-camera work).
“The leggings definitely did everything they were supposed to do,” one 2023 tester wrote. “They were supportive, comfortable, cute, and helped me stay dry when I was really sweaty. I especially appreciated how the waistband stayed in place, and overall I didn’t have to adjust anything during my workouts.”

Cons

When you have a long day of nothing planned, a supremely comfy pair of leggings makes for a great uniform. The ones that come to mind for us are easily Beyond Yoga’s super-soft, smooth Spacedye tights.
“These leggings definitely lived up to my expectations,” wrote one 2023 Activewear Awards tester. “I found myself reaching for them again and again, since they were so comfortable, cute, and I didn’t have to fiddle with them while teaching or practicing yoga.” In 2024, we also gave a nod to the
Out of Pocket
version of these leggings, which are just as cuddly but feature two drop-in side pockets too.

Pros

Cons

If you brave icy temps in the name of your workout (or commute), you need a pair of Baleaf’s refreshingly affordable
fleece-lined leggings
. “The wind doesn’t pierce through them like a lot of other leggings. They are also sweat-wicking, so they are great for working out,”
Lindsey Quebedeaux
, a track and cross-country coach, runner, and walker from New Braunfels, Texas, previously told SELF.
They’re available in several styles: The one-pocket version has a mid-rise waist; the three-pocket is high-rise; and the water-resistant version has an extra-high waist that should come in handy when it’s cold
and
wet outside.

Outdoor Research
Pros
Very durable
Stretchy
UPF 30 helps protect your skin from the sun’s rays
Cons
Too lightweight for hiking in cold weather
Limited color options
Hikers ask a lot of their leggings
: They should be easy to move in, but they can’t rip or snag when the trail gets rough. Few pairs strike a balance between stretchy and tough quite like the Ad-Vantage from Outdoor Research.
Made with rock climbing in mind, they’re abrasion-resistant through the knees and hips and provide full range of motion. As our 2023 Activewear Awards tester put it, “I am able to move at any angle in these and they stay in place. I also feel like they’re perfect for travel because they are durable, lightweight, and have some compression.”

They have three small pockets (two at the front waistband and one at the back) and are made with cozy, peach-fuzz-like fabric.

7/8 length may be too short for tall people
If you feel like your tights never stay in place, you need to try Vuori’s Daily Legging. One SELF writer swears by it for running, HIIT workouts, or really any exercise that’ll have you bouncing around.
“The super high, wide, segmented waistband and drawstring combo really helps them stay put and not roll down, no matter what I’m doing. I never have to pull these up and adjust them during workouts, which makes me reach for them over and over,” she says. They’re cut to a 7/8 length, so they’re perfect for anyone on the shorter side who hates when their full-length leggings bunch up. The thick fabric makes them ideal for sweaty workouts, and, per our writer, they’re incredibly soft and flattering.

Compressive and supportive, with an extra-wide waistband, these will keep up with you as you run, squat, and hike.

This pair from LNDR is perfect for anyone who doesn’t like bulky side pockets, but wants more storage space than a zippered back pocket. The drop-in pockets on these are uniquely placed high on the waistband, so you can easily cover them with a shirt or tank.
These leggings are also very smoothing and lightweight, so they’ll feel particularly good in hot settings. “These are my favorite leggings of all time,” wrote one LNDR customer. “They’re tight in all the right places and super comfortable.”

How SELF tests and selects exercise leggings
For SELF’s Activewear Awards, we tap staffers, everyday exercisers, and experts of all stripes (including hikers,
marathon runners
, weight lifting trainers, and fitness coaches) to test dozens of leggings. They put their gear through the wringer, sweating, moving, and living in their apparel for weeks throughout the testing period, then use our official
Activewear Buying Guide
to determine which items were truly the best. You can rest assured that the leggings that made the cut were road-tested to the fullest.
When we look for recommendations outside of our yearly awards, we ask trusted fitness experts in the field for their absolute favorites. While a flashy new pair that they’re excited about is always of interest, we want to know which leggings they come back to time after time—those are the ones we feature.

Not to toot our own horn, but we know a thing or two about the best exercise leggings here at SELF—in fact, we recognize a select few of them every year during our
Activewear Awards
. While it may sound dramatic, we think a high-quality pair of leggings can make all the difference in how your day goes. (If you’ve ever tried lifting weights or
enjoying a vinyasa flow
while wearing leggings that slip down, pinch, or pull in all the wrong places, you know this to be true.)
With that in mind, we curated a list of great exercise leggings for all sorts of activities, selected from tons of pairs we’ve tested and had recommended to us by experts over the years.

What to look for when shopping for exercise leggings
If you’re ready to update your leggings collection, here are a few tips we recommend keeping in mind as you shop.
Activity
AccordionItemContainerButton
LargeChevron
High-impact activities, like running, and gentler movements, like stretching, call for different types of leggings. For the former, you may want a pair that’s thicker, more compressive, and sweatproof. Meanwhile, you’ll probably prefer softer, lighter-weight leggings for yoga,
Pilates
, and other lower-intensity workouts.
Length
AccordionItemContainerButton
LargeChevron
Leggings come in a range of lengths, from full-length (meaning they go all the way to the bottom of your ankle) to 7/8 (which hit around or just above the ankle) to capri (which usually stop at the middle of your calf). When in doubt, measure your inseam length—the distance from your crotch to the spot on your leg or ankle where you want the leggings to hit—and have your number handy while you browse.
Material
AccordionItemContainerButton
LargeChevron
Any leggings should have a good amount of spandex, Lycra, elastane, or other stretchy material to ensure they fit close to your body without restricting your movement. Beyond that, look for pairs made with moisture-wicking, breathable, squat-proof, extra soft, or cold-weather-ready materials. As mentioned above, your go-to workouts can also help you determine which fabrics will work best.
Rise
AccordionItemContainerButton
LargeChevron
This is more a personal preference than anything else, but it’s still important to check how high the waistband goes on a new pair of leggings, especially if coverage and support are key for you. You can find low-, medium-, and high-rise options, but high-rise is the most common.
Additional features
AccordionItemContainerButton
LargeChevron
Don’t forget nice-to-have elements like a drawstring, well-placed pockets, and breathable mesh panels. Depending on what you like, these add-ons can turn a solid pair of leggings into an exceptional one.
FAQs about shopping for exercise leggings
Should I size up or down in leggings?
AccordionItemContainerButton
LargeChevron
If you’re between sizes, you should usually size down in leggings. Since they’re typically made of stretchy fabrics, they should expand to fit you, and they tend to get looser over time, so starting with a tighter pair is usually better. (After all, leggings are meant to be snug—and you don’t want them to be falling down as you work out.) That being said, if you’re considering a super compressive pair of leggings, you might want to size up, since the fabric will fit tighter and may feel too restrictive in a smaller size.
Why do my leggings roll down at the waist?
AccordionItemContainerButton
LargeChevron
Leggings that are too big, have lost their elasticity, or are lower-rise may be more likely to roll down. So if this is a common issue for you, look for styles that are high-waisted, with a thick, compressive waistband and a drawstring.
On the other hand, sometimes super-high-waisted styles can roll down to meet the indent of your natural waist. Ideally, the top of your leggings’ waistband will hit you right at your natural waist or only slightly above. When you try them on, jump around, bend, and stretch in your leggings to make sure they’ll stay put.

Athleta
Pros
Extremely comfortable and versatile

Durable
Cons
Next to none—practically perfect
Wherever your day takes you, you’ll be prepared in Athleta’s best-selling Salutation Stash High Rise Legging. It’s one of the brand’s most popular leggings for its wonderfully deep pockets (that somehow don’t add a ton of bulk); wide, comfy waistband; and thick fabric.
Incredible durability was another reason we named the Salutation Stash the Best Leggings for Pretty Much Anything in our 2024 Activewear Awards—one of our judges was confident that these can last for years of wear. “These are my everything leggings,” they wrote. “I have been buying the Stash from Athleta for years, and they hold up. I teach barre, lift weights, hike trails, and browse the aisles of Trader Joe’s in them constantly.”

These Old Navy leggings were our readers’ pick for this year’s
Activewear Awards
—and wow, did they have a lot to say: “I literally have 25 pairs, and they’re the only bottoms I’ll do races in. The side pockets are so great, I don’t even need to wear running belts during my training runs to keep my phone, gum, and keys handy,” one explained.
Another reader shouted out their price point, durability, compression level, and, perhaps most importantly, sweat resistance: “I wear them for my long runs on the treadmill, and they don’t show sweat stains.”

the most-loved Lulu bottoms
across the board, the Aligns belong in the dictionary under “yoga leggings.” Extra soft and non-constricting, they’re designed to feel like a second skin that moves with you as you stretch, bend, and flow.
“It truly doesn’t feel like you’re wearing pants, and they never cause chafing,” wrote one 2024 Activewear Awards judge. While they’re basically ideal for yoga, our judges and one SoulCycle instructor also recommended the Align leggings for indoor cycling and simply wearing around the house.

Every distance runner knows that pockets are everything, and this pair packs plenty. With two large, envelope-style pockets and a third, zippered one in the back of the waistband, you won’t have to wear a running belt on longer loops.
These high-waisted leggings are made from a double-sided fabric that’ll keep you warm on chilly mornings or evenings—plus, they have a drawstring, so you can adjust the fit (meaning they’ll still feel good after the post-gel bloat). Zippers at the ankles also make them easy to get off when you’re sweaty.

Pros

Cons
Some may find the compression too strong
If you’re looking for workhorse leggings that’ll keep up with you through HIIT classes, lifting sessions, and
cardio workouts
, you need a pair of supportive, ultra-high-waisted Reebok Luxes, which won a 2023 Activewear Award for their reliability and versatility.
“Sometimes full-length leggings look ‘bunchy’ at the ankles, but these were perfect,” one SELF tester wrote. “The high waistband is extremely comfortable and flattering. They’re absolutely squat-proof as well. I felt very confident, and I was able to complete all workouts without having to pull them up or adjust them at all (even during a sweaty vinyasa yoga class).”

Cons
May run small, according to reviewers
A two-time Activewear Award winner in 2021 and
2022
, Spanx’s Booty Boost Active leggings are about as reliable as leggings get (and win bonus points for their highly flattering fit). “These are perfection,” wrote one tester, who wears a size 2X. “They did not move. The leggings are high-waist and cover my entire tummy as a plus-size woman. Where have these leggings been all my life?”
Another SELF tester raved about their versatility: “I could wear these leggings to the office and no one would know that they are for workouts.” They fit like a glove and look great even after hours of wear, making the Booty Boost Active our top pick for all-day wear (no contest!).

At this point, it’s an odd year when SuperFit Hero’s highly compressive, squat-test-passing SuperHold pocket leggings
don’t
win an Activewear Award (their earliest appearance was in
2019
). Throughout the years, they’ve wowed our testers with their extremely secure fit, inclusive size range, and overall great look (an influencer who tested a pair in 2022 said the SuperHolds were their go-to leggings for on-camera work).
“The leggings definitely did everything they were supposed to do,” one 2023 tester wrote. “They were supportive, comfortable, cute, and helped me stay dry when I was really sweaty. I especially appreciated how the waistband stayed in place, and overall I didn’t have to adjust anything during my workouts.”

Cons

When you have a long day of nothing planned, a supremely comfy pair of leggings makes for a great uniform. The ones that come to mind for us are easily Beyond Yoga’s super-soft, smooth Spacedye tights.
“These leggings definitely lived up to my expectations,” wrote one 2023 Activewear Awards tester. “I found myself reaching for them again and again, since they were so comfortable, cute, and I didn’t have to fiddle with them while teaching or practicing yoga.” In 2024, we also gave a nod to the
Out of Pocket
version of these leggings, which are just as cuddly but feature two drop-in side pockets too.

If you brave icy temps in the name of your workout (or commute), you need a pair of Baleaf’s refreshingly affordable
fleece-lined leggings
. “The wind doesn’t pierce through them like a lot of other leggings. They are also sweat-wicking, so they are great for working out,”
Lindsey Quebedeaux
, a track and cross-country coach, runner, and walker from New Braunfels, Texas, previously told SELF.
They’re available in several styles: The one-pocket version has a mid-rise waist; the three-pocket is high-rise; and the water-resistant version has an extra-high waist that should come in handy when it’s cold
and
wet outside.

Cons

Hikers ask a lot of their leggings
: They should be easy to move in, but they can’t rip or snag when the trail gets rough. Few pairs strike a balance between stretchy and tough quite like the Ad-Vantage from Outdoor Research.
Made with rock climbing in mind, they’re abrasion-resistant through the knees and hips and provide full range of motion. As our 2023 Activewear Awards tester put it, “I am able to move at any angle in these and they stay in place. I also feel like they’re perfect for travel because they are durable, lightweight, and have some compression.”

If you feel like your tights never stay in place, you need to try Vuori’s Daily Legging. One SELF writer swears by it for running, HIIT workouts, or really any exercise that’ll have you bouncing around.
“The super high, wide, segmented waistband and drawstring combo really helps them stay put and not roll down, no matter what I’m doing. I never have to pull these up and adjust them during workouts, which makes me reach for them over and over,” she says. They’re cut to a 7/8 length, so they’re perfect for anyone on the shorter side who hates when their full-length leggings bunch up. The thick fabric makes them ideal for sweaty workouts, and, per our writer, they’re incredibly soft and flattering.

How SELF tests and selects exercise leggings
For SELF’s Activewear Awards, we tap staffers, everyday exercisers, and experts of all stripes (including hikers,
marathon runners
, weight lifting trainers, and fitness coaches) to test dozens of leggings. They put their gear through the wringer, sweating, moving, and living in their apparel for weeks throughout the testing period, then use our official
Activewear Buying Guide
to determine which items were truly the best. You can rest assured that the leggings that made the cut were road-tested to the fullest.
When we look for recommendations outside of our yearly awards, we ask trusted fitness experts in the field for their absolute favorites. While a flashy new pair that they’re excited about is always of interest, we want to know which leggings they come back to time after time—those are the ones we feature.

Gifting season is upon us, and if you’re shopping for a loved one who pounds the pavement, a thoughtful present could really get their heart rate going. And anyone who runs knows that the right gear—like a
durable pair of shoes
or
snug, sweatproof headphones
—can make the miles feel more enjoyable.
Unsure where to start? We connected with joggers, speedsters, marathoners, and other outdoor enthusiasts to round up the best running gifts out there (including leggings, hydration packs, massage guns, fitness trackers, and other essentials from Amazon, Lululemon, Nike, and more). Whether your friend or family member aims to complete their first 5K or hit a new PR in their 50th marathon, you’ll find plenty of great options to choose from.

During longer training runs, it’s important to bring fuel (like gels or energy chews) to keep you going. But, honestly, holding everything can feel awkward, which is why your loved one may appreciate this handy running belt.

A foam roller is an essential recovery tool for any runner, as it can help ease muscle soreness and prepare your body for a workout. This one is a

Pockets are a major bonus for long-distance runners—and the ones in these Lululemon leggings (a

A running watch is a great tool to help your giftee track their pace and record workouts—and the Garmin Forerunner is a standout choice. “I love that you can program speed workouts via the Garmin Connect app, and then send them to your phone so that you don’t have to memorize intervals,” Colorado-based runner Erika Barnes tells SELF. “Another favorite feature is the race predictor, which gives me a snapshot of my marathon training progress relative to my goals.”
Swiftwick Aspire Four Crew Socks

Throwing on these recovery sandals after a long run feels like a sigh of relief—the plush foam absorbs impact and cradles your foot like a comforting pillow. “Trust me, your feet will feel immediately better in these cushiony sandals, especially if they’re swollen and blistered up after a hard run,” says Barnes.

“I’m always on the hunt for a pair of running shorts that are breezy and comfortable, don’t ride up, have a non-binding waistband, and, especially, have pockets bigger than a thumbnail,” Vallee Ross, a runner in Houston, Texas tells SELF.

If you deal with heel and arch pain related to
plantar fasciitis
, then you know the struggle of trying to find comfortable footwear. While no pair is perfect, the best shoes for plantar fasciitis can help relieve the tension in your feet and help you avoid frustrating flare-ups in the first place.
To help you find the right shoe, we spoke with physical therapists and podiatrists to learn what to look out for and what to avoid in pairs for plantar fasciitis. We also gathered a few recommendations from SELF staffers. Below, shop our favorite options from brands like Asics, Hoka, Brooks, and more.

What is plantar fasciitis?
“Plantar fasciitis is inflammation and irritation of the plantar fascia, which is a broad, ligament-like structure that originates on the bottom of the heel bone and fans out across the arch on the bottom of your foot,”
Alicia Canzanese, DPM, ATC
, a board-certified podiatrist, athletic trainer, and former collegiate track athlete, tells SELF. “Picture it as a structure that is supporting the arch.”
If this structure is inflamed, you’ll likely feel pain on the bottom of your heels, particularly when you get out of bed or take the first couple of steps after sitting for a while. That first-step stiffness may ease up as you move around, but the pain often gets worse with increased activity, like continued walking or running, Dr. Canzanese says.
What causes plantar fasciitis?
Plantar fasciitis can be caused by all kinds of things, like muscle imbalances and overuse (more on that below), but one common precursor to the condition is doing a lot of activity in inadequate footwear, says Dr. Canzanese. Still, “footwear is only one piece of the puzzle,” she says. Some other factors that can make plantar fasciitis worse include
tight calf muscles
, repetitive high-impact activities like running, a rapid increase in weight-bearing activity, and standing or walking for long periods of time.
You can have plantar fasciitis with
flat feet
, high arches, wide feet, or narrow feet…. The condition doesn’t discriminate. So, Dr. Canzanese points out, it’s important to try many kinds of shoes to find out what feels good on your feet and offers the support you need. In other words, some shoes are better for plantar fasciitis than others (typically those that have more cushioning in the heel and good arch support), but there isn’t one kind of shoe that’s best for everyone.
FAQs about shopping for shoes for plantar fasciitis
While no footwear can promise that you’ll stay pain-free, selecting well-cushioned and more supportive shoes is a solid step (heh) toward
reducing
discomfort in the future. If you’re still on the lookout for the right pair of shoes for you, here’s some criteria to keep in mind while you shop.
What to look for
AccordionItemContainerButton
LargeChevron
In general, the best shoes for plantar fasciitis will fit correctly (i.e., they’re not too small, and they’re wide enough to fit your foot comfortably). “You’ll want a shoe with a deep heel counter and plenty of midfoot arch support,”
Carla Gamez, DPM
, a podiatrist at Illinois Bone & Joint Institute (IBJI), tells SELF.
Consider wearing your shoes with orthotics or
insoles
that have substantial heel cups to help with cushioning and shock absorption too,
Susan Eby, PT, MS
, owner of Eby Physical Therapy in New York City, adds. These inserts will also provide additional arch support, which can offer further pain relief,
Yolanda Ragland, DPM
, a podiatrist and founder of Fix Your Feet in New York City, tells SELF.
What to avoid
AccordionItemContainerButton
LargeChevron
Avoid flat, nonsupportive footwear like flimsy sandals or backless clogs, Dr. Gamez says. Those cute flip-flops that sell for $10? Probably not the best plantar fasciitis shoes. The same goes for sneakers without arch support (unless you add orthotics, heel cups, or insoles) and flats.
If you need dressier shoes for work or a special occasion, look for those with a slight heel (around a half inch) to minimize stretching the plantar fascia, as well as styles that stay on your foot without toe gripping (i.e., a shoe that has elastic or other straps to secure it to your foot).

Quantum 2

Kuru
Pros
Very sturdy and supportive
Specifically designed to prevent foot and heel pain
Cons
Somewhat heavy
This comfortable walking shoe from Kuru is designed to help alleviate foot pain, including the discomfort that comes with plantar fasciitis. The brand’s patented Kurusole technology supports your heels and arches to help them better absorb impact while you stand and walk.
The previous model of the Quantum was recommended by
Bianca Beldini, DPT
, a physical therapist, founder of Sundala Wellness, and a USA Triathlon level-one coach in New York City. Minor design tweaks that make this latest version the greatest one yet include a wider base and roomier toe box than the first Quantum. These additions also make the 2.0 a good option for folks with issues like
bunions
.

Pros
Surprisingly lightweight

Cons
May lack some of the Quantum 2’s support and intentional design
Hoka shoes
have deep heel counters (the part of the shoe that surrounds the back of your foot) and cloudlike cushioning, which makes them feel like a glorious hug. That snug, plush fit makes them some of the
best walking shoes
for people with plantar fasciitis. Dr. Gamez also recommends the Clifton because of its responsive midsole, which, despite its higher amount of cushion, helps propel you forward as you walk.
The latest version, the Clifton 9, helped alleviate plantar fasciitis pain for SELF’s former executive editor: “As someone who has recently started dealing with plantar fasciitis, I’ve tried a lot of sneakers that claim to be comfortable and supportive. I was gifted the Clifton 9s, and they do not disappoint!” she says. “I actually like them much more than my Clifton 8s, which would still lead to small flare-ups for me. These shoes don’t hurt my feet at all, get me through long walking days in New York City, and are also weirdly cute.” Safe to say, it secured its place as her go-to sneaker.

With a sturdy design and a high level of arch support, Vionic’s Walk Strider can help relieve plantar fasciitis pain,
Gigee Bhular, DPM
, a foot and ankle physician at Virtua Health in New Jersey, tells SELF. While its rigid midfoot helps prevent rolling, its flexible upper bends with your foot when you’re on the move.
SELF’s commerce director has been putting a pair of the Vionic Walk Striders through its paces the past few weeks and confirms that the sneakers are comfortable right out of the box. “I struggle with new shoes creating ‘hot spots’ and blisters by rubbing on my heels and the sides of my feet—I’m known to bust out the Band-Aids at my desk after commuting into the office. But the Vionic Walk Strider didn’t require any breaking-in time,” she says. “These aren’t the cushiest, bounciest kicks I’ve ever worn, but the arch support helps my former ballerina feet feel lifted and supported, even after hours on the go.”

One SELF tester who deals with plantar fasciitis loves her pair: “I always wear my Nimbus 26 for recovery runs and on days when my feet could use a little more cushion underneath them. They’re super supportive and hug my high arches. I love that this shoe also comes in solid colorways, making it easier to match them with the rest of my outfit.”

The
2023 SELF Sneaker Award–winning
Hoka Bondi 8
is known for its maximalist cushioning that delivers a marshmallowy ride without weighing you down too much. All that extra padding makes it one of the best options for people with plantar fasciitis, says Dr. Beldini.
One Sneaker Awards tester happily wore their Bondis through a four-hour concert, and SELF’s manager of social creative development says her pair perfectly suits her feet: “I have wide feet and high arches, and they were specifically recommended to me by the employee at my local Fleet Feet store,” she says. “I tried on a few other pairs of sneakers along with the Bondi 8s, but I just kept coming back to them. They were light on my feet—almost like I wasn’t wearing shoes at all—but also provided strong support around my heels and ankles.”

Laces tend to come untied, according to reviewers
Erik Sims, DPM
, managing partner of Sims & Associates Podiatry in New York, recommends the Brooks Ghost to patients of all ages, noting that it strikes a good balance between comfort and style. And our 2023 Sneaker Awards tester recommended the previous version (the Ghost 15) to runners of all levels: “I’ve been running for six years now, have completed many races—including a half marathon—and have never loved a shoe so instantly or easily,” they said. “I would recommend these to any runner, from the casual jogger to the
marathon trainer
.”
This pair from Brooks uses a plush, lightweight foam to cushion your feet without feeling clunky and has ample space through the upper (although it won’t feel like you’re swimming in them). It’s a good pick for arch pain too, Dr. Sims says.

hikers with plantar fasciitis
. They’re mostly impressed by how light it feels while still providing plenty of cushion, which is a tough balance to strike in a rugged, outdoorsy boot. Dr. Japs also points out the Kaha’s durable treaded outsole and ankle-wrapping cuff, both of which should help you feel more stable on the trail.

Pros
Lightweight for a hiking shoe
Good traction on sole
Protective heel cap
Upper has breathable perforations
Cons
Not waterproof
May not provide enough ankle support for some
These sneakers are the preferred hiking shoes of one SELF writer with plantar fasciitis. “I live in Colorado, and I’m hiking or trail running all the time, and I swear by these shoes,” she says. “They hit that sweet spot where they have enough structure to make me feel supported and secure and enough flexibility to be comfortable and move
with
my feet over rocks and roots. I especially appreciate the protective heel cap and good traction. These are the type of shoes you can hike in right out of the box without any stiffness or pain.”
The leather upper holds up well against the elements—it’s not waterproof, but it is fairly water-resistant and cold-resistant, and the shoes fit just like a regular running shoe, allowing for plenty of upper foot and ankle mobility, she adds. “That’s the type of shoe I prefer to hike in—I can’t stand hiking boots; they feel clunky and restrictive to me. But if you like something lighter and more minimalist, this Danner shoe might be your new favorite hiking sneaker.”

Earned an APMA seal of approval
Cons
May chafe
Not only are these foam-laden sandals approved by the
American Podiatric Medical Association (APMA)
for supporting foot health, but they also get rave reviews from shoppers. Customers on Zappos compared them to marshmallows and clouds: “I have plantar fasciitis, and the minute I put them on I can walk without pain. They are magic slippers,” one wrote.
“These squishy sandals are perfect for running errands, going to the beach, camping, or sliding on as a recovery shoe post-run,” says a SELF writer who deals with plantar fasciitis. “I have high arches, and these provide a comfortable amount of contouring to help them feel properly supported. I bring them on every outdoorsy vacation—it feels SO GOOD to put them on after a hike or bike ride—and I swear by them for any walking around I have to do after a big race.”
“I wore these after the New York City and Chicago marathons when my feet were
really
struggling, and they felt like a massage for my tired, achy arches,” she adds. “These will be your go-to when you don’t want to lace up, but still need that extra support.” Enough said.

Pros
Supportive yet comfy

Cons
Some reviewers report difficulties with the straps’ Velcro fastenings
This
sporty sandal
from Teva is comfortable, easy to clean, and has great arch support,
Theresa Marko, PT, DPT, MS
, owner of Marko Physical Therapy, tells SELF. It’s also a great pick for vacations and hiking trips, according to one SELF staffer: “They take up zero space, they’re SO comfy, and they never smell, even after long days exploring very hot climates.”
The strap system across the top of the foot and around the back of the heel is adjustable, for a secure fit around your ankle, even after walking longer distances, Dr. Marko says. Unlike a standard flip-flop—which can exacerbate plantar fasciitis by requiring you to grip your toes in order to keep the shoe on—the back strap on the Teva Verra keeps your foot comfortably in place all day long, she adds.

Cons

The Torhill Penny Loafer is a “perfect dress shoe for someone with plantar fasciitis,” according to Dr. Bhular. Not only is it supportive (the footbed is contoured to better fit the shape of your foot), but it’s also durable and stylish, he says. To his last point, this is definitely a shoe you can
dress up for the office
or down for brunch on weekends.

Pros
Warm, fuzzy lining

Cons
Pricey, for a slipper
If you have wide feet, this may be the slipper for you. The OrthoFeet Charlotte comes in three widths, with orthotic-like inserts that provide arch support and foam cushioning under the heel. “The suede uppers are lined for comfort, and the low heel counter allows for use of alternate insoles or orthotics, and gives some heel stability while still allowing you to slide in and out of the slipper,” Eby says. “The toe box is also extra deep to accommodate any toe issues, with Velcro adjustment so the slipper fits snug to your feet.”

More shoes to consider
These pairs were also recommended to us by podiatrists, but they might not be as universally appealing as the shoes featured above. Some address additional foot issues, like overpronation (when your ankles roll inward while you stand or walk), and others don’t meet all of the criteria we took into account (but are still great options if you mainly deal with mild or occasional plantar fasciitis flare-ups).

Pros

Cons
May be too wide for some
Dr. Sims often recommends Saucony’s Echelon 9 to people with plantar fasciitis because of its solid support. It’s one of the brand’s “comfort shoes,” meaning it has a thick foam footbed and a snug midfoot to keep your feet well-cushioned and stable. Dr. Sims points out that it’s also compatible with many inserts, including bulkier custom orthotics. However, people with narrower feet may find the Echelon too wide.

Dr. Bhular recommends Asics’s Gel-Excite line of running shoes because of their cushioning: Although they’re less padded than the Gel-Nimbus pair featured above, they have a good amount of foam throughout the sole, plus extra gel cushioning in the midfoot and heel to further soften the impact of your steps.

Dr. Japs says the Adrenaline GTS is another popular Brooks shoe that’s great for plantar fasciitis. Its sizable heel-to-toe drop helps shift weight away from your heel, which should help relieve some pressure and pain, he explains. It also has solid cushioning and support overall (like many of our other top picks).

Pros
Super soft, springy feel underfoot
Lots of support through the heel and arch
Cons
May cause you to grip with your toes
This cushiony, cloudlike
Oofos sandal is a SELF Fave
for workout recovery (and wearing around the house), thanks to its thick soles and fun range of colors. According to Dr. Marko, it checks some plantar fasciitis boxes too, like good arch support and heel cushioning. It should be noted, though, that slip-on style shoes can cause you to subconsciously grip your feet, which can lead to foot pain and aggravate plantar fasciitis.
For a slimmer profile that might be easier to walk in, try the brand’s
OOlala sandal instead,
a recommendation from Dr. Sims.

, which can put added strain on your plantar fascia. And we like them because they come in just about every color of the rainbow.

Pros
Large heel-to-toe drop
Supportive insole
Stylish design
Cons
May need a break-in period
Most classic Mary Janes have flat soles and no arch support—a double whammy for folks with plantar fasciitis. But thanks to this sweet pair of platforms from Dr. Scholl’s, you don’t need to sit out the style’s resurgence because of your heel pain. All shoes in the Dr. Scholl’s
Nice Day line
—which also includes
loafers
,
oxfords
, and
boots
—have a squishy foam insole that cups your heel and supports your arch.
“Don’t sleep on Dr. Scholl’s,” says SELF’s commerce director. “The brand has long been synonymous with comfort and support, but the latest designs don’t look like your grandma’s orthopedics. While the Mary Janes need a little wearing in—or a pair of socks—I can depend on them to get me to the subway, to work, and to dinner without worrying about sore feet.”

Pros
Adjustable fit
Well-cushioned under the heel
Soft straps
Cons
Some reviewers report they scuff quickly
One SELF writer used to walk 30 minutes to work in a very similar pair of Vionic shoes every day without any pain. “I have plantar fasciitis and high arches that need a lot of support, and it’s hard to find heels that don’t totally destroy my feet. The Solana heels (an older model of the Chardonnay) were a game changer for me. I could commute in New York City and walk around the office all day with no issues,” she says.
Dr. Japs considers the Vionic brand to be “above average in support and comfort,” and this applies to even its dressier shoes. “Sometimes orthopedic shoes aren’t the most fashionable, but Vionic does great work,” Dr. Japs says. We’re also fans of this pair’s adjustable ankle strap, which provides a better fit than a slip-on heel might.

Made to be slipped on without having to bend over or tie the laces, the Kita is a great option for anyone with limited mobility or recovering from an injury. With a wide toe box, plenty of cushioning, and orthopedic insoles, they’re designed to ease arch and heel pain like the kind that can come with plantar fasciitis. The knitted mesh upper and mesh lining are highly breathable
for sweaty feet
too.

How SELF tests and selects shoes for plantar fasciitis
For SELF’s Sneaker Awards, we tap staffers, everyday exercisers, and all kinds of experts (like avid runners, backpackers, professional trainers, and coaches) to test hundreds of shoes. They’ll wear their pairs for hours each day over months before determining which ones are truly the best. In this guide, we’ve included shoes that have been featured in past Sneaker Awards, so you can be sure they’ve been thoroughly vetted.
When we seek out recommendations outside of our yearly awards, we ask trusted experts in the field for the pairs they suggest to clients over and over. After hearing from foot health experts, we take a closer look at the shoes they recommended to make sure they have plantar-fasciitis-friendly features like extra padding, sturdy arch support, and a secure fit. We also consulted with SELF staffers and people who have tried some of these pairs firsthand (foot?) to see how they hold up with regular wear. From there, we highlighted the very best of the best in this list.

If you deal with heel and arch pain related to
plantar fasciitis
, then you know the struggle of trying to find comfortable footwear. While no pair is perfect, the best shoes for plantar fasciitis can help relieve the tension in your feet and help you avoid frustrating flare-ups in the first place.
To help you find the right shoe, we spoke with physical therapists and podiatrists to learn what to look out for and what to avoid in pairs for plantar fasciitis. We also gathered a few recommendations from SELF staffers. Below, shop our favorite options from brands like Asics, Hoka, Brooks, and more.

What is plantar fasciitis?
“Plantar fasciitis is inflammation and irritation of the plantar fascia, which is a broad, ligament-like structure that originates on the bottom of the heel bone and fans out across the arch on the bottom of your foot,”
Alicia Canzanese, DPM, ATC
, a board-certified podiatrist, athletic trainer, and former collegiate track athlete, tells SELF. “Picture it as a structure that is supporting the arch.”
If this structure is inflamed, you’ll likely feel pain on the bottom of your heels, particularly when you get out of bed or take the first couple of steps after sitting for a while. That first-step stiffness may ease up as you move around, but the pain often gets worse with increased activity, like continued walking or running, Dr. Canzanese says.
What causes plantar fasciitis?
Plantar fasciitis can be caused by all kinds of things, like muscle imbalances and overuse (more on that below), but one common precursor to the condition is doing a lot of activity in inadequate footwear, says Dr. Canzanese. Still, “footwear is only one piece of the puzzle,” she says. Some other factors that can make plantar fasciitis worse include
tight calf muscles
, repetitive high-impact activities like running, a rapid increase in weight-bearing activity, and standing or walking for long periods of time.
You can have plantar fasciitis with
flat feet
, high arches, wide feet, or narrow feet…. The condition doesn’t discriminate. So, Dr. Canzanese points out, it’s important to try many kinds of shoes to find out what feels good on your feet and offers the support you need. In other words, some shoes are better for plantar fasciitis than others (typically those that have more cushioning in the heel and good arch support), but there isn’t one kind of shoe that’s best for everyone.
FAQs about shopping for shoes for plantar fasciitis
While no footwear can promise that you’ll stay pain-free, selecting well-cushioned and more supportive shoes is a solid step (heh) toward
reducing
discomfort in the future. If you’re still on the lookout for the right pair of shoes for you, here’s some criteria to keep in mind while you shop.
What to look for
AccordionItemContainerButton
LargeChevron
In general, the best shoes for plantar fasciitis will fit correctly (i.e., they’re not too small, and they’re wide enough to fit your foot comfortably). “You’ll want a shoe with a deep heel counter and plenty of midfoot arch support,”
Carla Gamez, DPM
, a podiatrist at Illinois Bone & Joint Institute (IBJI), tells SELF.
Consider wearing your shoes with orthotics or
insoles
that have substantial heel cups to help with cushioning and shock absorption too,
Susan Eby, PT, MS
, owner of Eby Physical Therapy in New York City, adds. These inserts will also provide additional arch support, which can offer further pain relief,
Yolanda Ragland, DPM
, a podiatrist and founder of Fix Your Feet in New York City, tells SELF.
What to avoid
AccordionItemContainerButton
LargeChevron
Avoid flat, nonsupportive footwear like flimsy sandals or backless clogs, Dr. Gamez says. Those cute flip-flops that sell for $10? Probably not the best plantar fasciitis shoes. The same goes for sneakers without arch support (unless you add orthotics, heel cups, or insoles) and flats.
If you need dressier shoes for work or a special occasion, look for those with a slight heel (around a half inch) to minimize stretching the plantar fascia, as well as styles that stay on your foot without toe gripping (i.e., a shoe that has elastic or other straps to secure it to your foot).

Below, you’ll find comfy, expert-approved (and, frankly, pretty darn cute) sneakers, dress shoes,

Kuru
Quantum 2
$165
Kuru
Pros
Very sturdy and supportive
Specifically designed to prevent foot and heel pain
Cons
Somewhat heavy
This comfortable walking shoe from Kuru is designed to help alleviate foot pain, including the discomfort that comes with plantar fasciitis. The brand’s patented Kurusole technology supports your heels and arches to help them better absorb impact while you stand and walk.
The previous model of the Quantum was recommended by
Bianca Beldini, DPT
, a physical therapist, founder of Sundala Wellness, and a USA Triathlon level-one coach in New York City. Minor design tweaks that make this latest version the greatest one yet include a wider base and roomier toe box than the first Quantum. These additions also make the 2.0 a good option for folks with issues like
bunions
.

Pros
Surprisingly lightweight
Great for long-term wear
Very comfortable
Cons
May lack some of the Quantum 2’s support and intentional design
Hoka shoes
have deep heel counters (the part of the shoe that surrounds the back of your foot) and cloudlike cushioning, which makes them feel like a glorious hug. That snug, plush fit makes them some of the
best walking shoes
for people with plantar fasciitis. Dr. Gamez also recommends the Clifton because of its responsive midsole, which, despite its higher amount of cushion, helps propel you forward as you walk.
The latest version, the Clifton 9, helped alleviate plantar fasciitis pain for SELF’s former executive editor: “As someone who has recently started dealing with plantar fasciitis, I’ve tried a lot of sneakers that claim to be comfortable and supportive. I was gifted the Clifton 9s, and they do not disappoint!” she says. “I actually like them much more than my Clifton 8s, which would still lead to small flare-ups for me. These shoes don’t hurt my feet at all, get me through long walking days in New York City, and are also weirdly cute.” Safe to say, it secured its place as her go-to sneaker.

With a sturdy design and a high level of arch support, Vionic’s Walk Strider can help relieve plantar fasciitis pain,
Gigee Bhular, DPM
, a foot and ankle physician at Virtua Health in New Jersey, tells SELF. While its rigid midfoot helps prevent rolling, its flexible upper bends with your foot when you’re on the move.
SELF’s commerce director has been putting a pair of the Vionic Walk Striders through its paces the past few weeks and confirms that the sneakers are comfortable right out of the box. “I struggle with new shoes creating ‘hot spots’ and blisters by rubbing on my heels and the sides of my feet—I’m known to bust out the Band-Aids at my desk after commuting into the office. But the Vionic Walk Strider didn’t require any breaking-in time,” she says. “These aren’t the cushiest, bounciest kicks I’ve ever worn, but the arch support helps my former ballerina feet feel lifted and supported, even after hours on the go.”

Dr. Gamez recommends Asics Gel-Nimbus running shoes for a cushioned ride. This best-selling style is built with gel technology that absorbs shock as you pound the pavement. It also has a breathable mesh upper that has plenty of space through the forefoot, giving your toes some extra wiggle room.
One SELF tester who deals with plantar fasciitis loves her pair: “I always wear my Nimbus 26 for recovery runs and on days when my feet could use a little more cushion underneath them. They’re super supportive and hug my high arches. I love that this shoe also comes in solid colorways, making it easier to match them with the rest of my outfit.”

The
2023 SELF Sneaker Award–winning
Hoka Bondi 8
is known for its maximalist cushioning that delivers a marshmallowy ride without weighing you down too much. All that extra padding makes it one of the best options for people with plantar fasciitis, says Dr. Beldini.
One Sneaker Awards tester happily wore their Bondis through a four-hour concert, and SELF’s manager of social creative development says her pair perfectly suits her feet: “I have wide feet and high arches, and they were specifically recommended to me by the employee at my local Fleet Feet store,” she says. “I tried on a few other pairs of sneakers along with the Bondi 8s, but I just kept coming back to them. They were light on my feet—almost like I wasn’t wearing shoes at all—but also provided strong support around my heels and ankles.”

Pros

Cons
Laces tend to come untied, according to reviewers
Erik Sims, DPM
, managing partner of Sims & Associates Podiatry in New York, recommends the Brooks Ghost to patients of all ages, noting that it strikes a good balance between comfort and style. And our 2023 Sneaker Awards tester recommended the previous version (the Ghost 15) to runners of all levels: “I’ve been running for six years now, have completed many races—including a half marathon—and have never loved a shoe so instantly or easily,” they said. “I would recommend these to any runner, from the casual jogger to the
marathon trainer
.”
This pair from Brooks uses a plush, lightweight foam to cushion your feet without feeling clunky and has ample space through the upper (although it won’t feel like you’re swimming in them). It’s a good pick for arch pain too, Dr. Sims says.

Both Dr. Bhular and
Nicholas Japs, DPT
, a physical therapist at St. Vincent’s Medical Center in Bridgeport, Connecticut, recommend Hoka’s Kaha 2 boot for
hikers with plantar fasciitis
. They’re mostly impressed by how light it feels while still providing plenty of cushion, which is a tough balance to strike in a rugged, outdoorsy boot. Dr. Japs also points out the Kaha’s durable treaded outsole and ankle-wrapping cuff, both of which should help you feel more stable on the trail.

Pros
Lightweight for a hiking shoe
Good traction on sole
Protective heel cap
Upper has breathable perforations
Cons
Not waterproof
May not provide enough ankle support for some
These sneakers are the preferred hiking shoes of one SELF writer with plantar fasciitis. “I live in Colorado, and I’m hiking or trail running all the time, and I swear by these shoes,” she says. “They hit that sweet spot where they have enough structure to make me feel supported and secure and enough flexibility to be comfortable and move
with
my feet over rocks and roots. I especially appreciate the protective heel cap and good traction. These are the type of shoes you can hike in right out of the box without any stiffness or pain.”
The leather upper holds up well against the elements—it’s not waterproof, but it is fairly water-resistant and cold-resistant, and the shoes fit just like a regular running shoe, allowing for plenty of upper foot and ankle mobility, she adds. “That’s the type of shoe I prefer to hike in—I can’t stand hiking boots; they feel clunky and restrictive to me. But if you like something lighter and more minimalist, this Danner shoe might be your new favorite hiking sneaker.”

Not only are these foam-laden sandals approved by the
American Podiatric Medical Association (APMA)
for supporting foot health, but they also get rave reviews from shoppers. Customers on Zappos compared them to marshmallows and clouds: “I have plantar fasciitis, and the minute I put them on I can walk without pain. They are magic slippers,” one wrote.
“These squishy sandals are perfect for running errands, going to the beach, camping, or sliding on as a recovery shoe post-run,” says a SELF writer who deals with plantar fasciitis. “I have high arches, and these provide a comfortable amount of contouring to help them feel properly supported. I bring them on every outdoorsy vacation—it feels SO GOOD to put them on after a hike or bike ride—and I swear by them for any walking around I have to do after a big race.”
“I wore these after the New York City and Chicago marathons when my feet were
really
struggling, and they felt like a massage for my tired, achy arches,” she adds. “These will be your go-to when you don’t want to lace up, but still need that extra support.” Enough said.

This

from Teva is comfortable, easy to clean, and has great arch support,
Theresa Marko, PT, DPT, MS
, owner of Marko Physical Therapy, tells SELF. It’s also a great pick for vacations and hiking trips, according to one SELF staffer: “They take up zero space, they’re SO comfy, and they never smell, even after long days exploring very hot climates.”
The strap system across the top of the foot and around the back of the heel is adjustable, for a secure fit around your ankle, even after walking longer distances, Dr. Marko says. Unlike a standard flip-flop—which can exacerbate plantar fasciitis by requiring you to grip your toes in order to keep the shoe on—the back strap on the Teva Verra keeps your foot comfortably in place all day long, she adds.

dress up for the office
or down for brunch on weekends.

If you have wide feet, this may be the slipper for you.

Dr. Sims often recommends Saucony’s Echelon 9 to people with plantar fasciitis because of its solid support. It’s one of the brand’s “comfort shoes,” meaning it has a thick foam footbed and a snug midfoot to keep your feet well-cushioned and stable. Dr. Sims points out that it’s also compatible with many inserts, including bulkier custom orthotics. However, people with narrower feet may find the Echelon too wide.

It also has solid cushioning and support overall (like many of our other top picks).

This cushiony, cloudlike
Oofos sandal is a SELF Fave
for workout recovery (and wearing around the house), thanks to its thick soles and fun range of colors. According to Dr. Marko, it checks some plantar fasciitis boxes too, like good arch support and heel cushioning. It should be noted, though, that slip-on style shoes can cause you to subconsciously grip your feet, which can lead to foot pain and aggravate plantar fasciitis.
For a slimmer profile that might be easier to walk in, try the brand’s
OOlala sandal instead,
a recommendation from Dr. Sims.

Pros
Large heel-to-toe drop
Supportive insole
Stylish design
Cons
May need a break-in period
Most classic Mary Janes have flat soles and no arch support—a double whammy for folks with plantar fasciitis. But thanks to this sweet pair of platforms from Dr. Scholl’s, you don’t need to sit out the style’s resurgence because of your heel pain. All shoes in the Dr. Scholl’s
Nice Day line
—which also includes
loafers
,
oxfords
, and
boots
—have a squishy foam insole that cups your heel and supports your arch.
“Don’t sleep on Dr. Scholl’s,” says SELF’s commerce director. “The brand has long been synonymous with comfort and support, but the latest designs don’t look like your grandma’s orthopedics. While the Mary Janes need a little wearing in—or a pair of socks—I can depend on them to get me to the subway, to work, and to dinner without worrying about sore feet.”

Pros
Adjustable fit
Well-cushioned under the heel
Soft straps
Cons
Some reviewers report they scuff quickly
One SELF writer used to walk 30 minutes to work in a very similar pair of Vionic shoes every day without any pain. “I have plantar fasciitis and high arches that need a lot of support, and it’s hard to find heels that don’t totally destroy my feet. The Solana heels (an older model of the Chardonnay) were a game changer for me. I could commute in New York City and walk around the office all day with no issues,” she says.
Dr. Japs considers the Vionic brand to be “above average in support and comfort,” and this applies to even its dressier shoes. “Sometimes orthopedic shoes aren’t the most fashionable, but Vionic does great work,” Dr. Japs says. We’re also fans of this pair’s adjustable ankle strap, which provides a better fit than a slip-on heel might.

Made to be slipped on without having to bend over or tie the laces, the Kita is a great option for anyone with limited mobility or recovering from an injury. With a wide toe box, plenty of cushioning, and orthopedic insoles, they’re designed to ease arch and heel pain like the kind that can come with plantar fasciitis. The knitted mesh upper and mesh lining are highly breathable
for sweaty feet
too.

These New Balance sneaks are one of the brand’s stability shoes, meaning they’re designed to help keep your feet aligned as you walk and run (which can be tough when you have arch issues). They also offer major cushioning for a comfortable ride and a wide toe box that’ll allow your forefoot to spread out.

How SELF tests and selects shoes for plantar fasciitis
For SELF’s Sneaker Awards, we tap staffers, everyday exercisers, and all kinds of experts (like avid runners, backpackers, professional trainers, and coaches) to test hundreds of shoes. They’ll wear their pairs for hours each day over months before determining which ones are truly the best. In this guide, we’ve included shoes that have been featured in past Sneaker Awards, so you can be sure they’ve been thoroughly vetted.
When we seek out recommendations outside of our yearly awards, we ask trusted experts in the field for the pairs they suggest to clients over and over. After hearing from foot health experts, we take a closer look at the shoes they recommended to make sure they have plantar-fasciitis-friendly features like extra padding, sturdy arch support, and a secure fit. We also consulted with SELF staffers and people who have tried some of these pairs firsthand (foot?) to see how they hold up with regular wear. From there, we highlighted the very best of the best in this list.

The temps are dropping—and if your motivation to get outside is too, some new seasonally appropriate gear could help give you the boost you need to leave your cozy cave. Fleece-lined leggings can help keep you toasty on that jog around the block, mental health stroll in the sunshine, or at home on the couch (hey, heat doesn’t come free!). To find the very best ones for any of your winter activities, we asked SELF staff, experienced runners, and year-round hikers which pairs they reach for when the weather gets nippy.

What to consider when shopping for fleece-lined leggings
To find a pair of fleece-lined leggings that’ll keep you warm and allow you to move and groove however you want, we recommend keeping the following factors in mind.
Materials
AccordionItemContainerButton
LargeChevron
Leggings made of sweat-wicking materials like polyester or nylon will help draw moisture away from your skin in order to prevent damp, clammy, cold-in-your-bones feeling,
Alysha Flynn
, founder of the female running community What Runs You, tells SELF. She also recommends looking for leggings made from stretchy fabric blends that’ll move with you, especially if you plan to wear them for workouts.
Thickness
AccordionItemContainerButton
LargeChevron
Fleece-lined leggings that are thinner and lighter in weight are better for more intense activities like running and hiking, Flynn says, because they usually allow for more flexibility in your movements. But if your goal is to find a cozy pair for when you run errands or grab coffee with your friends, there’s no harm in going with a thicker pair.
FAQs about shopping for fleece-lined leggings
What’s the difference between thermal leggings and fleece leggings?
AccordionItemContainerButton
LargeChevron
Thermals are designed to be worn underneath your clothes on cold days. They can be super helpful during activities like skiing because you can layer them under your snow pants and jacket without feeling like the Michelin Man. Fleece-lined leggings are meant to be worn on their own and are sometimes treated with weatherproof coatings to help them stand up to wet and windy conditions.
How do you care for fleece-lined leggings?
AccordionItemContainerButton
LargeChevron
“Fleece-lined leggings usually come at a higher price point, so you really want to pay attention to caring for them,” Flynn says. “I’ve had some of mine for years because I’ll always machine wash in cold [water], I’ll avoid fabric softeners, and hang to dry.” Fabric softener and heat from hot water or a dryer can damage elastane and cause your pants to lose some of their stretch, so if you want to make sure your leggings last for years to come, follow in Flynn’s footsteps.
What temperatures should you wear fleece-lined leggings in?
AccordionItemContainerButton
LargeChevron
Flynn recommends reaching for fleece-lined leggings when the temps dip below 40 degrees Fahrenheit. “But it really depends on the intensity of your workout,” she says. “If it’s 35 degrees and you’re going for a more casual hike, totally jump into a fleece-lined pair of leggings and just wear one layer.” If your workout is more intense, like a run, she recommends holding off on wearing them until the temperature is below 30 degrees to avoid overheating.
Also, “during single-digit temperatures and below, having just a fleece-lined layer of leggings is not going to be enough,” Flynn says. “That would really have to become a mid-layer, and you’d have another layer on top of that.”

Lululemon
Pros
Durable
Comfortable for workouts
Extensive size range
Cons
Not warm enough for very low temperatures
One SELF editor calls these Lululemon tights her “go-to” for chilly runs: “This is the pair I reach for when it’s 30 to 40 degrees out,” she says. “The material feels cozy but not too thick, and they still look good after wearing and washing them at least once a week last winter.”
Flynn says many members of her running community swear by these too. She points out that they come in multiple inseam lengths and sizes 0 to 20 (in some colors). Plus, the high-waisted design stays in place during workouts.
It’s the details that help these leggings pull ahead of the pack though: There are two pockets on the legs to hold your phone or some tissues and three waistband pockets for little items like a credit card or a house key. The band also has a hidden drawstring so you can adjust the waist. And if you typically run or walk beside the road when it’s dark (which can be hard to avoid when the sun sets during regular business hours), the reflective details on the legs can help keep you safe from cars.

These leggings have many of the same great features as the Lululemon pair, like pockets and a high waistband, but they’re a fraction of the price. They also have an impressive 23,000 five-star Amazon reviews (and counting). Shoppers like the snug, supportive fit and say the fleecy inside keeps out the chill.
“I run in other Baleaf products, but I bought these for an Alaskan trip,” one reviewer wrote. “They kept me warm and dry and were comfortable when doing a lot of walking!” Another reviewer called them “the most comfortable pants [they] have ever worn!”

“There’s no way I'm ever buying any other brand of legging because these are so perfect it’s almost unbelievable,” one Amazon reviewer said. “They’re tight enough that you feel held in, but not so tight that it’s a struggle to pull them on or uncomfortable in any way. The material is soft, not too thick, flexible, [and] keeps you feeling dry and cool even during intense activity.”

This pair snagged an
Activewear Award
for keeping our tester warm and dry during a 40-minute run outside; she said they were so comfortable, she kept them on for hours after her workout. “They really do a great job of blocking out the cold, but they weren’t so thick that you’re sweating when you’re in the house,” she said.
We also love the leggings’ deep side pockets; even if you load them up with your phone, keys, and earbuds, reviewers say the pants won’t slide down from the extra weight. Plus: They’re super stretchy, and they have a UPF 30 rating, which means they’ll
block out the sun
(because yes, you still need sun protection in the winter!).

Flynn says that these are the first fleece leggings she ever tried and remain one of her favorites. “As a kid [running] cross country and track and field, the fleece lining was a game changer,” she says. “Instead of wearing bulky layers to stay warm, I was able to run or jump and the fabric would move with me.” Other perks: Flat seams make these Under Armour feel like a second skin and help prevent chafing.
“I like [this Under Armour pair] because they offer the perfect warmth on chilly runs,”
Hallie Martin
, an ultra trail runner in Dubuque, Iowa, previously told SELF. “The leggings are a shiny black color and are the perfect length.”

Ready to hit the trails? These leggings have all of the features you’d want in a pair of hiking pants: They’re made from a thick, moisture-wicking fabric that can protect you from the sun’s UV rays and keep you from feeling damp once you break a sweat on your climb. The tights also feature Polygiene, Eddie Bauer’s proprietary odor-controlling technology to help you stay as fresh as possible while three pockets—including one with a zipper—make it easy to keep your essentials close at hand.

Flynn also recommends this pair of Nike leggings, which she says are warm and stretchy—both qualities she needs for running in frigid temps—and have a sleek fit, thanks to their high-rise waist. “In the winter, you want to be able to tuck your top layers into your pants so that you’re not getting that draft, especially when you’re out there running or hiking,” she says. The higher waist also helps the leggings stay put under snow pants or sweats.

These are the only leggings on our list that aren’t made up of entirely synthetic materials—instead, they’re made of mostly cotton, which makes them feel more like sweatpants than activewear. They might not be the best choice for workouts, but you can definitely clean your apartment, scroll TikTok in bed, or run some errands in them. One Lands’ End shopper says they live in these all winter long: “I have these in every color! They are as comfortable as cozy pajamas but look nice enough to wear with a tunic or jacket going out and about.”

Athleta kills it at making soft, comfy gear that’ll last you for years—at least that’s been my experience with the brand—and these leggings are no exception. They have three pockets including two zippered ones for your must-haves, reflective details for your dawn or dusk workouts, and enough compression to stay put. They also come in a solid range of sizes and tall and petite inseams to make sure they fit you just right.

The temps are dropping—and if your motivation to get outside is too, some new seasonally appropriate gear could help give you the boost you need to leave your cozy cave. Fleece-lined leggings can help keep you toasty on that jog around the block, mental health stroll in the sunshine, or at home on the couch (hey, heat doesn’t come free!). To find the very best ones for any of your winter activities, we asked SELF staff, experienced runners, and year-round hikers which pairs they reach for when the weather gets nippy.

What to consider when shopping for fleece-lined leggings
To find a pair of fleece-lined leggings that’ll keep you warm and allow you to move and groove however you want, we recommend keeping the following factors in mind.
Materials
AccordionItemContainerButton
LargeChevron
Leggings made of sweat-wicking materials like polyester or nylon will help draw moisture away from your skin in order to prevent damp, clammy, cold-in-your-bones feeling,
Alysha Flynn
, founder of the female running community What Runs You, tells SELF. She also recommends looking for leggings made from stretchy fabric blends that’ll move with you, especially if you plan to wear them for workouts.
Thickness
AccordionItemContainerButton
LargeChevron
Fleece-lined leggings that are thinner and lighter in weight are better for more intense activities like running and hiking, Flynn says, because they usually allow for more flexibility in your movements. But if your goal is to find a cozy pair for when you run errands or grab coffee with your friends, there’s no harm in going with a thicker pair.
FAQs about shopping for fleece-lined leggings
What’s the difference between thermal leggings and fleece leggings?
AccordionItemContainerButton
LargeChevron
Thermals are designed to be worn underneath your clothes on cold days. They can be super helpful during activities like skiing because you can layer them under your snow pants and jacket without feeling like the Michelin Man. Fleece-lined leggings are meant to be worn on their own and are sometimes treated with weatherproof coatings to help them stand up to wet and windy conditions.
How do you care for fleece-lined leggings?
AccordionItemContainerButton
LargeChevron
“Fleece-lined leggings usually come at a higher price point, so you really want to pay attention to caring for them,” Flynn says. “I’ve had some of mine for years because I’ll always machine wash in cold [water], I’ll avoid fabric softeners, and hang to dry.” Fabric softener and heat from hot water or a dryer can damage elastane and cause your pants to lose some of their stretch, so if you want to make sure your leggings last for years to come, follow in Flynn’s footsteps.
What temperatures should you wear fleece-lined leggings in?
AccordionItemContainerButton
LargeChevron
Flynn recommends reaching for fleece-lined leggings when the temps dip below 40 degrees Fahrenheit. “But it really depends on the intensity of your workout,” she says. “If it’s 35 degrees and you’re going for a more casual hike, totally jump into a fleece-lined pair of leggings and just wear one layer.” If your workout is more intense, like a run, she recommends holding off on wearing them until the temperature is below 30 degrees to avoid overheating.
Also, “during single-digit temperatures and below, having just a fleece-lined layer of leggings is not going to be enough,” Flynn says. “That would really have to become a mid-layer, and you’d have another layer on top of that.”

Lululemon
Pros
Durable
Comfortable for workouts
Extensive size range
Cons
Not warm enough for very low temperatures
One SELF editor calls these Lululemon tights her “go-to” for chilly runs: “This is the pair I reach for when it’s 30 to 40 degrees out,” she says. “The material feels cozy but not too thick, and they still look good after wearing and washing them at least once a week last winter.”
Flynn says many members of her running community swear by these too. She points out that they come in multiple inseam lengths and sizes 0 to 20 (in some colors). Plus, the high-waisted design stays in place during workouts.
It’s the details that help these leggings pull ahead of the pack though: There are two pockets on the legs to hold your phone or some tissues and three waistband pockets for little items like a credit card or a house key. The band also has a hidden drawstring so you can adjust the waist. And if you typically run or walk beside the road when it’s dark (which can be hard to avoid when the sun sets during regular business hours), the reflective details on the legs can help keep you safe from cars.

Reviewers say they run long
These leggings have many of the same great features as the Lululemon pair, like pockets and a high waistband, but they’re a fraction of the price. They also have an impressive 23,000 five-star Amazon reviews (and counting). Shoppers like the snug, supportive fit and say the fleecy inside keeps out the chill.
“I run in other Baleaf products, but I bought these for an Alaskan trip,” one reviewer wrote. “They kept me warm and dry and were comfortable when doing a lot of walking!” Another reviewer called them “the most comfortable pants [they] have ever worn!”

“There’s no way I'm ever buying any other brand of legging because these are so perfect it’s almost unbelievable,” one Amazon reviewer said. “They’re tight enough that you feel held in, but not so tight that it’s a struggle to pull them on or uncomfortable in any way. The material is soft, not too thick, flexible, [and] keeps you feeling dry and cool even during intense activity.”

for keeping our tester warm and dry during a 40-minute run outside; she said they were so comfortable, she kept them on for hours after her workout. “They really do a great job of blocking out the cold, but they weren’t so thick that you’re sweating when you’re in the house,” she said.
We also love the leggings’ deep side pockets; even if you load them up with your phone, keys, and earbuds, reviewers say the pants won’t slide down from the extra weight. Plus: They’re super stretchy, and they have a UPF 30 rating, which means they’ll
block out the sun
(because yes, you still need sun protection in the winter!).

Flynn says that these are the first fleece leggings she ever tried and remain one of her favorites. “As a kid [running] cross country and track and field, the fleece lining was a game changer,” she says. “Instead of wearing bulky layers to stay warm, I was able to run or jump and the fabric would move with me.” Other perks: Flat seams make these Under Armour feel like a second skin and help prevent chafing.
“I like [this Under Armour pair] because they offer the perfect warmth on chilly runs,”
Hallie Martin
, an ultra trail runner in Dubuque, Iowa, previously told SELF. “The leggings are a shiny black color and are the perfect length.”

Flynn also recommends this pair of Nike leggings, which she says are warm and stretchy—both qualities she needs for running in frigid temps—and have a sleek fit, thanks to their high-rise waist. “In the winter, you want to be able to tuck your top layers into your pants so that you’re not getting that draft, especially when you’re out there running or hiking,” she says. The higher waist also helps the leggings stay put under snow pants or sweats.

These are the only leggings on our list that aren’t made up of entirely synthetic materials—instead, they’re made of mostly cotton, which makes them feel more like sweatpants than activewear. They might not be the best choice for workouts, but you can definitely clean your apartment, scroll TikTok in bed, or run some errands in them. One Lands’ End shopper says they live in these all winter long: “I have these in every color! They are as comfortable as cozy pajamas but look nice enough to wear with a tunic or jacket going out and about.”

Athleta kills it at making soft, comfy gear that’ll last you for years—at least that’s been my experience with the brand—and these leggings are no exception. They have three pockets including two zippered ones for your must-haves, reflective details for your dawn or dusk workouts, and enough compression to stay put. They also come in a solid range of sizes and tall and petite inseams to make sure they fit you just right.

How Many Protein Shakes a Day Is Too Many?
Yes, the macro is important—but more of these beverages isn’t necessarily better.

When you’re pressed for time, it’s easy to reach for a bottle to fuel up. But that begs the question: How many protein shakes a day is okay to drink?
While these beverages should never be the centerpiece of your diet—you want the majority of your nutrients to come from whole food sources, as registered dietitian and certified specialist in sports nutrition
Amy Stephens, MS, RDN
tells SELF—they certainly can have a place in your day, especially if intense physical activity leaves you with a hankering for more of that macro. For example, downing a post-workout shake (ideally along with a carb source) is a quick and convenient way to accelerate recovery and jumpstart muscle protein synthesis, or the fancy term for muscle growth,
Jessica Isaacs, RD, CSSD
, a sports dietitian who specializes in performance nutrition for elite athletes, tells SELF. Many of the athletes she works with find that ready-to-drink shakes help them get enough protein when they don’t have the appetite to tuck into a plate of chicken (or the time, really). In fact, that’s why these beverages came about in the first place, Stephens says: as an efficient means “to obtain those nutrients without having to make food.” Used to supplement a balanced diet, a shake can help satisfy your daily protein requirement and provide the essential amino acids your body needs to build muscle mass or simply recover better. Yes, all by mixing some liquid and protein powder in a shaker bottle or chugging a grab-and-go option.
With that background info in mind, what should be your daily cap? Unlike the answer to the question “
Are protein shakes actually good for you?
,” this one is simple: It should be a one-and-done thing for the average person. “We really don't need more than one a day,” Isaacs says. “The rest [of our nutrients] should come from food.”
In fact, drinking more than one protein shake per day means you’re “losing out on all those other nutrients that you might be getting if you’re eating food,” Stephens says. Nutritionally speaking, whole foods contain a diverse mix of nutrients that many protein shakes just can’t replicate, no matter how fortified they are. We’re not just talking about macronutrients like
carbohydrates
and
healthy fats
(and, of course, protein), but also micronutrients like vitamins and minerals. Because this diversity is key to strengthening your gut microbiome, whole foods are your best bet from a
gut health
standpoint, which, as research suggests, may also affect other facets of your well-being like your mental state and immune system. Basically, shakes tend to be an amazing source of protein, but not much else.
What’s more, overprioritizing protein shakes, in turn, could affect the state of your stomach, including how easily and frequently you poop. For example, lots of them lack
fiber
, so stacking your diet with these beverages could increase your risk of
constipation
, setting you up for a tough few bathroom trips. Or it could push you over to the
other
extreme. Some shakes contain ingredients (like artificial sweeteners or sugar alcohols) that can cause digestive issues—so the more you drink, the more likely you are to experience side effects like
bloating
,
gas
, and diarrhea if you have a sensitive stomach.
Of course, that one-per-day recommendation comes with some caveats, since the amount of protein people need can differ across the board for a wide range of reasons. For example, folks who have chronic kidney disease may be told to reduce their daily protein intake because their kidneys have trouble filtering out the resulting waste,
Jason Machowsky, MS, RD
, a sports dietitian and registered clinical exercise physiologist, tells SELF—so even one shake could theoretically pile on too much protein for their organs to comfortably handle if they’ve already met their daily limit. On the other end of the spectrum, very physically active people, like athletes, likely need extra protein to maximize recovery and muscle growth. Besides, the actual amount you’re taking in differs between shakes (though you typically want to shoot for 10 to 20 grams of protein if you’re drinking one as a snack between meals rather than a meal substitute), so multiple drinks at the lower end of that range could deliver the same protein content as one at the higher end. In other words, “it’s hard to generalize,” Isaacs says.
For that reason, don’t feel completely tied down when it comes to the earlier gen-pop guidance: For those who have higher protein needs—say, you’ve got lofty fitness goals that have you working out hard and often—it may well be just fine to drink more than one shake per day, according to Isaacs. “In situations where time is limited, appetite is reduced, or there’s a need for quick recovery after a workout before a meal, protein shakes can be a convenient option,” she says.
The bottom line: Whether you’re sticking to one protein shake a day or you're edging above it thanks to higher dietary protein requirements, you should still consider what you’re drinking a complement to your meals rather than something to replace them entirely, Isaacs says. Otherwise, you may be “missing out on important nutrients,” she adds. Sure, there may be special cases “where someone would need more or less,” Machowsky says, but if that’s the situation, you should consult a professional—say, a registered dietitian nutritionist—for medical advice. And if you’d prefer to get your protein from solids rather than liquids but want to nibble on something a little less dull than a

How Many Protein Shakes a Day Is Too Many?

When you’re pressed for time, it’s easy to reach for a bottle to fuel up. But that begs the question: How many protein shakes a day is okay to drink?
While these beverages should never be the centerpiece of your diet—you want the majority of your nutrients to come from whole food sources, as registered dietitian and certified specialist in sports nutrition
Amy Stephens, MS, RDN
tells SELF—they certainly can have a place in your day, especially if intense physical activity leaves you with a hankering for more of that macro. For example, downing a post-workout shake (ideally along with a carb source) is a quick and convenient way to accelerate recovery and jumpstart muscle protein synthesis, or the fancy term for muscle growth,
Jessica Isaacs, RD, CSSD
, a sports dietitian who specializes in performance nutrition for elite athletes, tells SELF. Many of the athletes she works with find that ready-to-drink shakes help them get enough protein when they don’t have the appetite to tuck into a plate of chicken (or the time, really). In fact, that’s why these beverages came about in the first place, Stephens says: as an efficient means “to obtain those nutrients without having to make food.” Used to supplement a balanced diet, a shake can help satisfy your daily protein requirement and provide the essential amino acids your body needs to build muscle mass or simply recover better. Yes, all by mixing some liquid and protein powder in a shaker bottle or chugging a grab-and-go option.
With that background info in mind, what should be your daily cap? Unlike the answer to the question “
Are protein shakes actually good for you?
,” this one is simple: It should be a one-and-done thing for the average person. “We really don't need more than one a day,” Isaacs says. “The rest [of our nutrients] should come from food.”
In fact, drinking more than one protein shake per day means you’re “losing out on all those other nutrients that you might be getting if you’re eating food,” Stephens says. Nutritionally speaking, whole foods contain a diverse mix of nutrients that many protein shakes just can’t replicate, no matter how fortified they are. We’re not just talking about macronutrients like
carbohydrates
and
healthy fats
(and, of course, protein), but also micronutrients like vitamins and minerals. Because this diversity is key to strengthening your gut microbiome, whole foods are your best bet from a
gut health
standpoint, which, as research suggests, may also affect other facets of your well-being like your mental state and immune system. Basically, shakes tend to be an amazing source of protein, but not much else.
What’s more, overprioritizing protein shakes, in turn, could affect the state of your stomach, including how easily and frequently you poop. For example, lots of them lack
fiber
, so stacking your diet with these beverages could increase your risk of
constipation
, setting you up for a tough few bathroom trips. Or it could push you over to the
other
extreme. Some shakes contain ingredients (like artificial sweeteners or sugar alcohols) that can cause digestive issues—so the more you drink, the more likely you are to experience side effects like
bloating
,
gas
, and diarrhea if you have a sensitive stomach.
Of course, that one-per-day recommendation comes with some caveats, since the amount of protein people need can differ across the board for a wide range of reasons. For example, folks who have chronic kidney disease may be told to reduce their daily protein intake because their kidneys have trouble filtering out the resulting waste,
Jason Machowsky, MS, RD
, a sports dietitian and registered clinical exercise physiologist, tells SELF—so even one shake could theoretically pile on too much protein for their organs to comfortably handle if they’ve already met their daily limit.

In other words, “it’s hard to generalize,” Isaacs says.
For that reason, don’t feel completely tied down when it comes to the earlier gen-pop guidance: For those who have higher protein needs—say, you’ve got lofty fitness goals that have you working out hard and often—it may well be just fine to drink more than one shake per day, according to Isaacs. “In situations where time is limited, appetite is reduced, or there’s a need for quick recovery after a workout before a meal, protein shakes can be a convenient option,” she says.

Is Running on a Treadmill Easier, Harder, or Exactly the Same as Logging Your Miles Outside?
Yes, using it still ‘counts’—but there are some little differences to be aware of.

With
shorter days
, colder temps, and the possibility of black ice lurking on the pavement, moving your run indoors might be looking a lot more appealing. But it can also bring up the question: Is running on a treadmill easier than logging the same distance outdoors? Are you shortchanging your workout—or might the two actually be interchangeable?
The short answer: For the vast majority of pavement pounders, there won’t be much of a difference. Your heart rate and oxygen uptake—how much energy you’re expending—are “quite similar” when you run the same speed on a treadmill and outside,
Rich Willy, PT, PhD,
an associate professor at the University of Montana and director of the
Montana Running Lab
, tells SELF.
There are, however, a few nuances to it. Slight biomechanical shifts in the way you run on a treadmill make it gentler on some aches and pains and harder on others. Super speedy folks may need to make a few adjustments, and yep, using one might require a bit more mental toughness than loping through a scenic park or by a waterfront vista. We tapped a bunch of experts—all of whom spend some of their own miles on the ’mill—to break down the differences and how to manage them.
First: A treadmill can make running safer and more accessible, so quit ragging on it.
Please, please, stop calling it the “dreadmill” or saying it’s a
torture device
. “I always hate seeing people demonize it,” Dr. Willy says. “For some people, that’s the only place that they can run for personal safety, or from a traffic standpoint.”
Take
Allison Gruber, PhD
, an associate professor of kinesiology at Indiana University Bloomington. “I live in an area where people drive terribly on curvy, wooded roads. There are no sidewalks,” she tells SELF. If she wants to run in the morning—before the sun comes up, which is the most convenient time for her—and
avoid
a collision with a car or coyote, the treadmill is the best choice.
It also can be a godsend for times when the weather is not ideal (or when snowstorms, freezing wind chills, or icy sidewalks make it downright unsafe), as well when you’re stuck in the house but still want to get some movement in. For instance,
Kaitlin Goodman
, a former pro runner and the founder and head coach of
Running Joyfully
, uses it on the days when she doesn’t have childcare for her toddler. “It might be a tool that you don’t love, but it is a tool at your disposal,” she says. “And if the option is run during nap time or don’t run, it’s a great option to have.”
Another way a treadmill can make running more accessible? Say you’re training for a race in a different location—maybe the Boston Marathon, with its famous hills—but you live in the pancake-flat Plains. With a treadmill, you’d be able to use incline to practice the ascents and prepare your body for them (without having to, you know, hop a plane to Massachusetts.) In fact, treadmills like the NordicTrack, with its iFit
programming
, have certain races pre-programmed; if yours doesn’t, the
RunBetter App
guides you through when to adjust your incline manually for more than 50 different
courses
.
But you’re not imagining it: Treadmill running can definitely feel harder than when you’re outside.
In a systematic review and
meta-analysis
of 34 studies published in the journal
Sports Medicine
, Dr. Willy and his colleagues found no major physiological differences between running on the treadmill and what researchers call overground running at most speeds. (That holds true for motorized treadmills. Those you power on your own—like the
Woodway Curve
or the
TrueForm Trainer
—are more demanding, he says.)
But the data do show the rate of perceived exertion—how much effort it feels like you’re putting in to keep up the pace—is higher on the treadmill.
Why? For one thing, you’re lacking optical flow, or the experience of seeing your surroundings change as you speed by, he says. And, you won’t feel the air rushing past you, either. Because both of these provide information to your brain about how fast you’re moving, any pace feels like a bit more of a slog without them.
The fact that there’s no scenery to distract you also plays a role. That’s why many people turn to
TV
,
podcasts
, or even
reading
to make the miles pass more quickly,
Brian Cleven, MS, ATC
, an ACSM-certified clinical exercise physiologist at Bellin Health in Marinette, Wisconsin, tells SELF. (Dr. Willy, for instance, can read journal articles during some of his easier treadmill runs.)
You might also find having the pace or time constantly in your face makes it all drag even more. After all, when you’re running outside, you can only steal occasional glances at your watch. In that case, Goodman recommends covering up the display with a towel. Go by heart rate or how hard you feel like you’re working rather than by minutes per mile or miles per hour, and use the buttons on the arms or side of the machine to control pace and incline.
Playing with the incline or other settings can help, but you don’t need to in order to get a “good” workout.
You might have heard that you need to bump up the incline to 1% to create similar conditions to outdoor running. But that’s based on old data, Dr. Willy says. The only time you might consider doing that is if you’re super speedy, going faster than that 7-minute mile (about 8.6 miles per hour, if that’s how your screen displays it). At that point, treadmill running does use a little less energy than running on the ground, and the slight incline offsets that shift, he says.
Still, there are other reasons you might want to toggle the tilt or
spice up your run with some speed
, including counteracting boredom. “If someone is going to be spending some time on the treadmill, I try to make it fun and dynamic, and we will change it up a lot,” Goodman says.
Some examples of what Goodman calls her “
treadmill specials
”: a Fartlek or “speedplay” run. After a warm-up, you run intervals of 1, 2, 3, 4, and then 5 minutes at a faster pace. In between the faster segments, run half the time at a slower pace to recover (so 1 minute faster, then 30 seconds slower; 2 minutes faster, then one minute slower; and on up the ladder). Another less-thinky option is to
put on a playlis
t and run one song faster, one song slower.
Just doing an easy run? Switching up the incline between 0 and 1 percent every half-mile, or throwing in a few quick one-minute faster surges every once in a while can help break up the monotony without amping up the intensity
too
much.
If you’re dealing with injury, there are a few differences between the treadmill and other surfaces you should know.
Dr. Willy has had two hip surgeries, and found the treadmill felt easier on that joint when he was returning to running. So, he studied it, and the
data
backed him up. Because the belt is moving, more of the force your body applies to the ground to carry you forward comes from your foot and ankle rather than higher up the kinetic chain. (Essentially, your leg is being pulled out from underneath you, rather than having your foot planted and needing to catapult your body over it, Gruber says.)
That means if you’re rehabbing some hip or hamstring pain, the tread might feel better. But if you’re dealing problems lower down, like Achilles issues or plantar fasciitis—inflammation of the band of tissue that runs on the bottom of your foot and a common cause of heel pain—there’s a chance the treadmill will aggravate the issue (and even more so if you crank up the incline). That doesn’t mean you can’t use it, but you should probably ease in even more slowly, Dr. Willy says.
When it comes to the risk of re-aggravating an injury, the treadmill has pros and cons. Of course, you have far less risk of tripping on a rock or a slick spot and falling, and level ground may make some achy spots feel better than navigating the uneven terrain outside. And most runners take shorter, faster steps on the treadmill, Dr. Willy says. A higher cadence is known to reduce tissue
damage
and may cut the risk of overuse injuries like stress fractures.
Meanwhile, if you’ve had patellofemoral pain syndrome (commonly known as runner’s knee) or pain in your iliotibial band or
IT band
, running uphill reduces the load on those tissues and may feel better than running downhill or even on the flat—and with the treadmill, you can get the uphills without the downs, so Dr. Willy often uses it during rehab for runners coming back from those injuries.
But on the flip side for the risk of overuse injuries,
studies
show there’s less variability between your steps on a treadmill, and that repetition may pose dangers. “Instead of just tapping the same spot all the time, we want to tap all over so that we're not wearing down that one spot,” Gruber says. “Increasing the variability in how you step can distribute the load [of running] better.”
That’s another reason to add some surges or changes in incline, which switch up the way you step. If you’re a treadmill regular, you can also rotate between different types of shoes to further mix things up, she says. (In fact, research
suggests
that might reduce injury risk regardless of where you run). Or, if your gym has multiple different brands or types of ‘mills, you can rotate between those, too.
So don’t be afraid to give treadmills a try—just ease into it for a smoother transition.
Just like anything else in fitness, try not to go from 0 to 60 when you’re making the switch from roads or trails to the treadmill. If you’ve been running outdoors regularly, you don’t have to start all over with a couch-to-treadmill-5K program. But it’s probably best not to make your first treadmill run a long run or grueling speed session, or to switch from 100% outdoor to 100% tread overnight, Goodman says.
One idea: If you’re training for a longer race and have, say, a 10- or 12-mile run on your schedule, you could run half of it outside and finish on the treadmill. “Just don’t do your first 12-mile run on the treadmill,” she says. “Break it in like you would a new pair of shoes.”
The bottom line? Treadmill running isn’t “cheating” or any less of a fitness boost than an outdoor run. As Dr. Willy points out, many elite runners—including Jakob Ingebrigtsen, an Olympic champion in the 1500 meters and 5,000 meters—do a lot of their interval running on the treadmill (in part, to keep close control of the pace). So if the tread is a safer, more appealing, or the only option, don’t sweat it. “Whatever can keep you running, do it,” Gruber says. “Don’t worry about the small little details.”

With
shorter days
, colder temps, and the possibility of black ice lurking on the pavement, moving your run indoors might be looking a lot more appealing. But it can also bring up the question: Is running on a treadmill easier than logging the same distance outdoors? Are you shortchanging your workout—or might the two actually be interchangeable?
The short answer: For the vast majority of pavement pounders, there won’t be much of a difference. Your heart rate and oxygen uptake—how much energy you’re expending—are “quite similar” when you run the same speed on a treadmill and outside,
Rich Willy, PT, PhD,
an associate professor at the University of Montana and director of the
Montana Running Lab
, tells SELF.
There are, however, a few nuances to it. Slight biomechanical shifts in the way you run on a treadmill make it gentler on some aches and pains and harder on others. Super speedy folks may need to make a few adjustments, and yep, using one might require a bit more mental toughness than loping through a scenic park or by a waterfront vista. We tapped a bunch of experts—all of whom spend some of their own miles on the ’mill—to break down the differences and how to manage them.
First: A treadmill can make running safer and more accessible, so quit ragging on it.
Please, please, stop calling it the “dreadmill” or saying it’s a
torture device
. “I always hate seeing people demonize it,” Dr. Willy says. “For some people, that’s the only place that they can run for personal safety, or from a traffic standpoint.”
Take
Allison Gruber, PhD
, an associate professor of kinesiology at Indiana University Bloomington. “I live in an area where people drive terribly on curvy, wooded roads. There are no sidewalks,” she tells SELF. If she wants to run in the morning—before the sun comes up, which is the most convenient time for her—and
avoid
a collision with a car or coyote, the treadmill is the best choice.
It also can be a godsend for times when the weather is not ideal (or when snowstorms, freezing wind chills, or icy sidewalks make it downright unsafe), as well when you’re stuck in the house but still want to get some movement in. For instance,
Kaitlin Goodman
, a former pro runner and the founder and head coach of
Running Joyfully
, uses it on the days when she doesn’t have childcare for her toddler. “It might be a tool that you don’t love, but it is a tool at your disposal,” she says. “And if the option is run during nap time or don’t run, it’s a great option to have.”
Another way a treadmill can make running more accessible? Say you’re training for a race in a different location—maybe the Boston Marathon, with its famous hills—but you live in the pancake-flat Plains. With a treadmill, you’d be able to use incline to practice the ascents and prepare your body for them (without having to, you know, hop a plane to Massachusetts.) In fact, treadmills like the NordicTrack, with its iFit
programming
, have certain races pre-programmed; if yours doesn’t, the
RunBetter App
guides you through when to adjust your incline manually for more than 50 different
courses
.
But you’re not imagining it: Treadmill running can definitely feel harder than when you’re outside.
In a systematic review and
meta-analysis
of 34 studies published in the journal
Sports Medicine
, Dr. Willy and his colleagues found no major physiological differences between running on the treadmill and what researchers call overground running at most speeds. (That holds true for motorized treadmills. Those you power on your own—like the
Woodway Curve
or the
TrueForm Trainer
—are more demanding, he says.)
But the data do show the rate of perceived exertion—how much effort it feels like you’re putting in to keep up the pace—is higher on the treadmill.
Why? For one thing, you’re lacking optical flow, or the experience of seeing your surroundings change as you speed by, he says. And, you won’t feel the air rushing past you, either. Because both of these provide information to your brain about how fast you’re moving, any pace feels like a bit more of a slog without them.
The fact that there’s no scenery to distract you also plays a role. That’s why many people turn to
TV
,
podcasts
, or even
reading
to make the miles pass more quickly,
Brian Cleven, MS, ATC
, an ACSM-certified clinical exercise physiologist at Bellin Health in Marinette, Wisconsin, tells SELF. (Dr. Willy, for instance, can read journal articles during some of his easier treadmill runs.)
You might also find having the pace or time constantly in your face makes it all drag even more. After all, when you’re running outside, you can only steal occasional glances at your watch. In that case, Goodman recommends covering up the display with a towel. Go by heart rate or how hard you feel like you’re working rather than by minutes per mile or miles per hour, and use the buttons on the arms or side of the machine to control pace and incline.
Playing with the incline or other settings can help, but you don’t need to in order to get a “good” workout.
You might have heard that you need to bump up the incline to 1% to create similar conditions to outdoor running. But that’s based on old data, Dr. Willy says. The only time you might consider doing that is if you’re super speedy, going faster than that 7-minute mile (about 8.6 miles per hour, if that’s how your screen displays it). At that point, treadmill running does use a little less energy than running on the ground, and the slight incline offsets that shift, he says.
Still, there are other reasons you might want to toggle the tilt or
spice up your run with some speed
, including counteracting boredom. “If someone is going to be spending some time on the treadmill, I try to make it fun and dynamic, and we will change it up a lot,” Goodman says.
Some examples of what Goodman calls her “
treadmill specials
”: a Fartlek or “speedplay” run. After a warm-up, you run intervals of 1, 2, 3, 4, and then 5 minutes at a faster pace. In between the faster segments, run half the time at a slower pace to recover (so 1 minute faster, then 30 seconds slower; 2 minutes faster, then one minute slower; and on up the ladder). Another less-thinky option is to
put on a playlis
t and run one song faster, one song slower.
Just doing an easy run? Switching up the incline between 0 and 1 percent every half-mile, or throwing in a few quick one-minute faster surges every once in a while can help break up the monotony without amping up the intensity
too
much.
If you’re dealing with injury, there are a few differences between the treadmill and other surfaces you should know.
Dr. Willy has had two hip surgeries, and found the treadmill felt easier on that joint when he was returning to running. So, he studied it, and the
data
backed him up. Because the belt is moving, more of the force your body applies to the ground to carry you forward comes from your foot and ankle rather than higher up the kinetic chain. (Essentially, your leg is being pulled out from underneath you, rather than having your foot planted and needing to catapult your body over it, Gruber says.)
That means if you’re rehabbing some hip or hamstring pain, the tread might feel better. But if you’re dealing problems lower down, like Achilles issues or plantar fasciitis—inflammation of the band of tissue that runs on the bottom of your foot and a common cause of heel pain—there’s a chance the treadmill will aggravate the issue (and even more so if you crank up the incline). That doesn’t mean you can’t use it, but you should probably ease in even more slowly, Dr. Willy says.
When it comes to the risk of re-aggravating an injury, the treadmill has pros and cons. Of course, you have far less risk of tripping on a rock or a slick spot and falling, and level ground may make some achy spots feel better than navigating the uneven terrain outside. And most runners take shorter, faster steps on the treadmill, Dr. Willy says. A higher cadence is known to reduce tissue
damage
and may cut the risk of overuse injuries like stress fractures.
Meanwhile, if you’ve had patellofemoral pain syndrome (commonly known as runner’s knee) or pain in your iliotibial band or
IT band
, running uphill reduces the load on those tissues and may feel better than running downhill or even on the flat—and with the treadmill, you can get the uphills without the downs, so Dr. Willy often uses it during rehab for runners coming back from those injuries.
But on the flip side for the risk of overuse injuries,
studies
show there’s less variability between your steps on a treadmill, and that repetition may pose dangers. “Instead of just tapping the same spot all the time, we want to tap all over so that we're not wearing down that one spot,” Gruber says. “Increasing the variability in how you step can distribute the load [of running] better.”
That’s another reason to add some surges or changes in incline, which switch up the way you step. If you’re a treadmill regular, you can also rotate between different types of shoes to further mix things up, she says. (In fact, research
suggests
that might reduce injury risk regardless of where you run). Or, if your gym has multiple different brands or types of ‘mills, you can rotate between those, too.
So don’t be afraid to give treadmills a try—just ease into it for a smoother transition.
Just like anything else in fitness, try not to go from 0 to 60 when you’re making the switch from roads or trails to the treadmill. If you’ve been running outdoors regularly, you don’t have to start all over with a couch-to-treadmill-5K program. But it’s probably best not to make your first treadmill run a long run or grueling speed session, or to switch from 100% outdoor to 100% tread overnight, Goodman says.
One idea: If you’re training for a longer race and have, say, a 10- or 12-mile run on your schedule, you could run half of it outside and finish on the treadmill. “Just don’t do your first 12-mile run on the treadmill,” she says. “Break it in like you would a new pair of shoes.”
The bottom line? Treadmill running isn’t “cheating” or any less of a fitness boost than an outdoor run. As Dr. Willy points out, many elite runners—including Jakob Ingebrigtsen, an Olympic champion in the 1500 meters and 5,000 meters—do a lot of their interval running on the treadmill (in part, to keep close control of the pace). So if the tread is a safer, more appealing, or the only option, don’t sweat it. “Whatever can keep you running, do it,” Gruber says. “Don’t worry about the small little details.”

Save on a
2024 Home Fitness Award
winner:
The 1750 is high-tech yet user-friendly, and powerful enough to impress our tester, a former marathoner. Plus, its large touchscreen can pivot to display off-equipment workouts
For a little less:
The 1250 has a lot in common with the 1750, including its HD touchscreen, iFit membership integration, and cushioned running deck. Its motor is slightly less powerful than the 1750's, but it's a top-notch machine for everyday runs.
For your next trek:
NordicTrack's highly rated hiking treads are on sale too. Both the X16 and X24 have a maximum incline of 40% and automatically adjusting fans. The X24's display is slightly larger, so it's the better choice if you want a truly immersive workout.
Want even more savings? You can take an additional $200 off your order of any treadmill when you sign up for an iFit membership.

Soften your stride:
The Tread+ has a cushioned slat belt instead of a traditional running deck, so it offers a slightly different ride—but still has all the same great classes to try.
Complete your gym setup:
Both the Tread and Tread+ are available as part of Starter Packages, which come with two sets of dumbbells, a reversible workout mat, and water bottle.

NordicTrack deals
Save on a
2024 Home Fitness Award
winner:
The 1750 is high-tech yet user-friendly, and powerful enough to impress our tester, a former marathoner. Plus, its large touchscreen can pivot to display off-equipment workouts
For a little less:
The 1250 has a lot in common with the 1750, including its HD touchscreen, iFit membership integration, and cushioned running deck. Its motor is slightly less powerful than the 1750's, but it's a top-notch machine for everyday runs.
For your next trek:
NordicTrack's highly rated hiking treads are on sale too. Both the X16 and X24 have a maximum incline of 40% and automatically adjusting fans. The X24's display is slightly larger, so it's the better choice if you want a truly immersive workout.
Want even more savings? You can take an additional $200 off your order of any treadmill when you sign up for an iFit membership.

Another great smart tread (with a smaller screen):
The Carbon Pro 2000 is also on sale—$1,800 off, to be exact—and has many of the same smart capabilities, like iFit workouts and Bluetooth connectivity.
ProForm's best budget pick:
For under $1,000, you can get the Carbon TLX, a high-performing foldable treadmill with a shock-absorbing deck.

The Peloton Tread won a

in 2023 for its immersive classes, which cover running, hiking, walking, and more (a Peloton membership gives you access to all of its classes and costs an extra $44 per month). “The instructors and platform make this piece of equipment what it is,” one of our judges said.
Soften your stride:
The Tread+ has a cushioned slat belt instead of a traditional running deck, so it offers a slightly different ride—but still has all the same great classes to try.
Complete your gym setup:
Both the Tread and Tread+ are available as part of Starter Packages, which come with two sets of dumbbells, a reversible workout mat, and water bottle.

As someone who works from home full time—read: my commute consists of moving from my bed to my couch—finding ways to move my body can be challenging. The past year, I’ve really noticed the toll such a sedentary lifestyle has taken on my body. Despite attempting to go for a walk most mornings, I’d find my upper neck and back area were constantly tight, my lower back would ache, and I’d even started getting occasional
migraine attacks
.
When I checked in with my doctor, the answer was obvious: Staying hunched over a laptop seven to eight hours a day isn’t good for anyone, and she suggested I try to incorporate more movement as I worked. Enter
FlexiSpot’s Deskcise V9 Pro
(usually $500, but currently on sale for $360), essentially a desk-bike hybrid that also works as a standing desk, so you can get your blood moving while you Slack, Zoom, and email.

I definitely had my doubts. How easy would it be to ride and type at the same time? Would I be able to work up a sweat? How long could I sit on it comfortably for? Would this just be another massive piece of equipment that takes up precious floor space in my home?
I’m actually writing this story as I ride my new favorite
work-from-home accessory
, so you can guess how all my fears panned out. Now I can’t imagine life without it. Here’s why I recommend the
Deskcise V9 Pro
to all my fellow WFH colleagues.
The setup
When the gigantic box arrived at my door, I had a moment of panic: It was the size of a small pony—how many pieces were inside?! Would I have to clear my entire weekend to put this thing together? But the setup turned out to be ridiculously simple—the whole process took less than five minutes from start to finish.
The V9 Pro comes almost fully pre-assembled. You only have to attach the desktop to the bike frame by sliding it into the designated slot. You’ll also have to track down two AA batteries for the display (so if you want to use your new desk right away, have them ready ahead of time).
After that, it’s just a matter of adjusting the seat and desk height to suit your body, and you’re ready to go.

Like everything else about the Deskcise Pro V9, its design is pleasantly simple and minimalist. I have the white version, which blends in seamlessly with the rest of my home. I’m also a big fan of the wheels (which also have the option to lock) on the bottom because they make it easy to move the desk around from room to room.
Even the display is straightforward—it tracks things like your time, distance, calories burned, and speed (among others). Want to adjust the flywheel’s resistance as you work? You can choose from eight different levels and ramp things up or cool ’em down with the turn of a knob.
Both the desktop and chair height are adjustable via an easy-to-use lever, and the desktop also moves forward and back for a more comfortable experience. A padded cushion helps keep your wrists in a neutral position—something I personally love, because I deal with occasional carpal tunnel symptoms (but, as always, consult with a medical professional instead of taking my word for it).
In between the seat and the display, there’s also a textured cup holder for drinks. While convenient, be warned: I’ve knocked over multiple coffees while getting on the bike and have now learned to place beverages in the holder
after
I’ve already settled into the seat.

The footprint
Also surprising: how compact the entire unit is. Like many people, I
invested in a Peloton bike
during the pandemic, so I was expecting the Deskcise to be a similar size. According to the brand, it measures 37.6 inches long, 22.8 inches wide, and 42.5 to 48.4 inches high (depending on how you adjust the desktop). It also weighs 51 pounds. My Peloton is significantly heavier and longer.
The wheels even tuck underneath the Deskcise to create even more floor space if needed. It’s so slim that I can roll it into my coat closet to keep it out of sight when guests come over. (That said, the compactness is relative to your space: Make sure to measure before buying and take note of the Deskcise’s dimensions.)
How it works
The first thing I noticed was that typing while cycling is much easier than it sounds. The Deskcise’s pedals turn smoothly and quietly—plus, the machine is fairly sturdy, so there was zero wobble as I was working away.

For reference, I’m five feet two and find it extremely comfortable to bike and type at the same time. My husband, who’s six feet four, was able to easily adjust the Deskcise’s height and raved about a similarly smooth work-ride session.
The desktop is well-sized at 20 by 22 inches. It fits my 13-inch laptop, a water bottle, and my notebook and pen. Once I get all my essentials in order, I normally start at resistance level -1, which feels effortless. On this setting or level 2, I’ve been averaging 40 to 50 minutes per ride—which may sound like a lot, but somehow the time just flies by. And even without a ton of resistance, I’m always sweating by the end of a ride.
Original photo by SELF writer Esther Carlstone
If I’m feeling particularly ambitious, or doing more mindless tasks like checking emails, I’ll twist the knob up to really feel the burn in my lower body. (The higher levels offer a true leg workout!) Other days, I find myself doing multiple shorter, easier 30-minute rides instead.When I’m not cycling, I often find myself using the Deskcise as a standing desk.
The benefits
“The big positive for having a desk bike is that you can get some
exercise during your workday
,” says
Lauren Brizendine, MPH, CPE
, director of ergonomics at Fit for Work.
After the first few days of using the Deskcise, my legs were definitely sore. Even more satisfying, I was finally able to close all my Apple Watch rings every day (IYKYK). My total activity minutes have increased significantly, per doctor’s orders. I’ve also found that my neck and shoulders aren’t as tight as they used to be—and I may be imagining it, but my legs already feel stronger.

One benefit I hadn’t anticipated was my increased productivity. Before, if I was just sitting at the counter working, I’d get distracted by small things like refilling my coffee or looking for that one pen I wanted. When I’m on the Deskcise, it’s too much of a hassle to get off the bike and I don’t want my time counter to stop, so I stay laser focused on my laptop instead. Now, my go-to “hack” is to hop on when there’s a certain project I’m not looking forward to tackling—I find I dive in quickly and more easily if I’m pedaling.
It’s also been amazing at combating the dreaded 2 p.m. post-lunch slump. Now I just climb astride the Deskcise and ride my way through the energy crash for 20 minutes or so.
While it’s great for quick brainstorming sessions, the Deskcise isn’t meant to be a replacement for your usual desk, according to Brizendine. “The seat does not provide adequate support for long periods of use, as it pushes your body into a forward position. Leaning forward in a seated position places stress on the discs of the low back and can cause
low back pain
,” she says. With this in mind, I’ll stick to using it two to three times throughout the work day for shorter periods when I really need a boost.
Bottom line
FlexiSpot’s Deskcise Pro V9
is an excellent investment for people who work from home on a computer all day long and want to get moving while also getting work done. If you find it difficult to squeeze in a workout, this multitasking bike-desk could really improve your 9-to-5, like it has mine.
Since using it, combined with other daily movements like walks, I’ve been successfully able to hit—and exceed—my 150 minutes of exercise goal each week. Between the increased activity and better productivity, this desk bike has become a total WFH savior in my book.

I definitely had my doubts. How easy would it be to ride and type at the same time? Would I be able to work up a sweat? How long could I sit on it comfortably for? Would this just be another massive piece of equipment that takes up precious floor space in my home?
I’m actually writing this story as I ride my new favorite
work-from-home accessory
, so you can guess how all my fears panned out. Now I can’t imagine life without it. Here’s why I recommend the
Deskcise V9 Pro
to all my fellow WFH colleagues.
The setup
When the gigantic box arrived at my door, I had a moment of panic: It was the size of a small pony—how many pieces were inside?! Would I have to clear my entire weekend to put this thing together? But the setup turned out to be ridiculously simple—the whole process took less than five minutes from start to finish.
The V9 Pro comes almost fully pre-assembled. You only have to attach the desktop to the bike frame by sliding it into the designated slot. You’ll also have to track down two AA batteries for the display (so if you want to use your new desk right away, have them ready ahead of time).
After that, it’s just a matter of adjusting the seat and desk height to suit your body, and you’re ready to go.

Like everything else about the Deskcise Pro V9, its design is pleasantly simple and minimalist. I have the white version, which blends in seamlessly with the rest of my home. I’m also a big fan of the wheels (which also have the option to lock) on the bottom because they make it easy to move the desk around from room to room.
Even the display is straightforward—it tracks things like your time, distance, calories burned, and speed (among others). Want to adjust the flywheel’s resistance as you work? You can choose from eight different levels and ramp things up or cool ’em down with the turn of a knob.
Both the desktop and chair height are adjustable via an easy-to-use lever, and the desktop also moves forward and back for a more comfortable experience. A padded cushion helps keep your wrists in a neutral position—something I personally love, because I deal with occasional carpal tunnel symptoms (but, as always, consult with a medical professional instead of taking my word for it).
In between the seat and the display, there’s also a textured cup holder for drinks. While convenient, be warned: I’ve knocked over multiple coffees while getting on the bike and have now learned to place beverages in the holder
after
I’ve already settled into the seat.

The footprint
Also surprising: how compact the entire unit is. Like many people, I
invested in a Peloton bike
during the pandemic, so I was expecting the Deskcise to be a similar size. According to the brand, it measures 37.6 inches long, 22.8 inches wide, and 42.5 to 48.4 inches high (depending on how you adjust the desktop). It also weighs 51 pounds. My Peloton is significantly heavier and longer.
The wheels even tuck underneath the Deskcise to create even more floor space if needed. It’s so slim that I can roll it into my coat closet to keep it out of sight when guests come over. (That said, the compactness is relative to your space: Make sure to measure before buying and take note of the Deskcise’s dimensions.)
How it works
The first thing I noticed was that typing while cycling is much easier than it sounds. The Deskcise’s pedals turn smoothly and quietly—plus, the machine is fairly sturdy, so there was zero wobble as I was working away.

For reference, I’m five feet two and find it extremely comfortable to bike and type at the same time. My husband, who’s six feet four, was able to easily adjust the Deskcise’s height and raved about a similarly smooth work-ride session.
The desktop is well-sized at 20 by 22 inches. It fits my 13-inch laptop, a water bottle, and my notebook and pen. Once I get all my essentials in order, I normally start at resistance level -1, which feels effortless. On this setting or level 2, I’ve been averaging 40 to 50 minutes per ride—which may sound like a lot, but somehow the time just flies by. And even without a ton of resistance, I’m always sweating by the end of a ride.

If I’m feeling particularly ambitious, or doing more mindless tasks like checking emails, I’ll twist the knob up to really feel the burn in my lower body. (The higher levels offer a true leg workout!) Other days, I find myself doing multiple shorter, easier 30-minute rides instead.When I’m not cycling, I often find myself using the Deskcise as a standing desk.
The benefits
“The big positive for having a desk bike is that you can get some
exercise during your workday
,” says
Lauren Brizendine, MPH, CPE
, director of ergonomics at Fit for Work.
After the first few days of using the Deskcise, my legs were definitely sore. Even more satisfying, I was finally able to close all my Apple Watch rings every day (IYKYK). My total activity minutes have increased significantly, per doctor’s orders. I’ve also found that my neck and shoulders aren’t as tight as they used to be—and I may be imagining it, but my legs already feel stronger.

One benefit I hadn’t anticipated was my increased productivity. Before, if I was just sitting at the counter working, I’d get distracted by small things like refilling my coffee or looking for that one pen I wanted. When I’m on the Deskcise, it’s too much of a hassle to get off the bike and I don’t want my time counter to stop, so I stay laser focused on my laptop instead. Now, my go-to “hack” is to hop on when there’s a certain project I’m not looking forward to tackling—I find I dive in quickly and more easily if I’m pedaling.
It’s also been amazing at combating the dreaded 2 p.m. post-lunch slump. Now I just climb astride the Deskcise and ride my way through the energy crash for 20 minutes or so.
While it’s great for quick brainstorming sessions, the Deskcise isn’t meant to be a replacement for your usual desk, according to Brizendine. “The seat does not provide adequate support for long periods of use, as it pushes your body into a forward position. Leaning forward in a seated position places stress on the discs of the low back and can cause
low back pain
,” she says. With this in mind, I’ll stick to using it two to three times throughout the work day for shorter periods when I really need a boost.
Bottom line
FlexiSpot’s Deskcise Pro V9
is an excellent investment for people who work from home on a computer all day long and want to get moving while also getting work done. If you find it difficult to squeeze in a workout, this multitasking bike-desk could really improve your 9-to-5, like it has mine.
Since using it, combined with other daily movements like walks, I’ve been successfully able to hit—and exceed—my 150 minutes of exercise goal each week. Between the increased activity and better productivity, this desk bike has become a total WFH savior in my book.

Google Pixel Buds Pro 2 Review: A Seamless Listening Experience for Your Workouts (And Outside of Them)

Pros
Easy setup and use with Android phones
Functional touch controls during workouts
Solid connectivity
Cons
Some ear soreness despite trying different tip sizes
Pricey
For the longest time, I was a Bluetooth holdout for my workouts: Up until just a few years ago, I exclusively used wired earbuds for my music-listening needs during my runs and gym sessions. But after my trusty iPod Shuffle finally croaked, I knew I needed an alternative. Once I found a smartwatch to take the place of my MP3 player, I tried out the
Apple AirPods Pro
to work with it.
That staple soon became my everyday combo, but I didn’t exactly
love
it, especially when I used the pods outside of my workouts. As an Android user, not all of the features were readily available to me. (The most annoying: Being unable to tell the battery charge). So when I was offered the opportunity to test the new
Google Pixel Buds Pro 2
($179, bestbuy.com)—designed to seamlessly integrate with my Pixel phone—I was eager to give them a try.
How I Tested
I used the Pixel Buds Pro 2 for over two weeks, spanning workouts (outdoor runs, indoor cycling classes, and strength training sessions at the gym), neighborhood walk breaks, workday stuff, and just plain music-listening. I wore them for up to 40 minutes at a time.
Unboxing the Google Pixel Buds Pro 2
First impression: The Buds are
pretty,
coming in an array of subtle colors—off-white, black, pink, and mint green. I tried them in mint, and thanks to the circular shape of the Buds themselves, they were strangely reminiscent of plugging Mentos into your ears.
The Buds came in an egg-shaped charging case (and use a USB-C cable to juice up, so no annoying proprietary cord needed) and with some extra goodies. Namely, three additional sizes of ear tips to ensure proper fit.
Christa Sgobba
How the Buds Feel
I tried both the default size (the mediums), as well as the smalls, and liked the feel of the former better. Once I got the placement right—you tuck it into your ear, then rotate to secure—they stayed put. They never really felt like
part
of my ear though; I wouldn’t say they hurt, but I was always cognizant that they were there. With my AirPods, I could honestly forget they were even in.
Getting Started
Setting up the Google Pixel Buds Pro 2 was ridiculously easy. All I had to do was unlock my phone, open the case and press the pairing light on the back, and my Pixel phone recognized my Buds immediately. (Full disclosure: I didn’t read the instructions first; the set-up was that intuitive.) They popped up on my Pixel’s screen, and I tapped the “connect” to begin set-up—I didn’t even have to futz with anything in my Bluetooth settings.

One of the first things the setup screen prompted me to do was test my ear seal. I performed the test wearing the mediums. I initially only got a thumbs up for the right one, but after I played around with the insertion of the left one a little more, I was able to achieve a proper fit with that one, too.
Then I acquainted myself with the touch controls:
Swipe forward to raise the volume.
Swipe backward to lower the volume.
Single tap to play or pause, or to answer a call.
Double tap to skip to the next track or reject a call.
Triple tap to go to the previous track.
Press and hold to turn on active noise control.
After that quick tutorial—and a confirmation that yes, I am now able to see battery level for both earbuds
and
the charging case in the Buds app and my phone’s Bluetooth settings—I started to put them to work.
Working Out With the the Pixel Buds 2
I had one order of business to take care of before I started sweating: pairing the Buds with my workout equipment. For my runs, that was my
Garmin Forerunner 265 smartwatch
—which allows me to listen to music on my run, sans phone—and my NordicTrack s27i for my iFIT cycling classes. My Garmin sometimes balks connecting to my Airpods, forcing me to restart it (and delaying my run in the process). But the watch recognized my Buds immediately, and they connected quickly and without any problem every subsequent time, too. My bike wasn’t quite so smooth: It would “see” my Buds, but wasn’t able to connect. I had to get off the bike and reboot it, after which the Buds did work.
On my runs—I wear only one Bud for safety reasons—I was able to use all the touch controls, but there were a few snags. The Buds sometimes confused a swipe for a tap, and instead of skipping the song, it would end up pausing it. The slower I ran, the easier it was for the Buds to get it right. (To be clear, I don’t think this is the fault of the Buds—when you’re in motion, what you
intend
to be a swipe can easily just become a thwack instead.)
On the bike where you’re stationary, the touch controls worked flawlessly. I was able to turn on noise cancellation with a press and hold, which really allowed me to immerse myself into my workout. The traffic underneath my window blended away, as did the hum of the fan and the slight rhythmic creak of the pedals, so the only thing I was hearing was my “coach” calling out intervals. When I unpaired the Buds from my bike and synced them with my phone to listen to music instead, I was able to go from song to song without having to unlock my phone and rummage each time. I wore the earbuds while lifting at the gym too, and the noise cancellation was a nice way to remove the literal background noise and concentrate on the dumbbells in front of me.

I’ve only been wearing the Buds for a couple weeks, but so far, my sweat hasn’t short-circuited them. According to Google, the Buds have a water protection rating of IP54, meaning that they should be able to withstand water spray. Temps have been pretty mild and cool in Pennsylvania where I’ve been testing these, so I am curious to see how they hold up during my normal swampy, humid runs in the summer, when my sweat pools
everywhere.
Taking Calls on the Pixel Buds Pro 2
My Buds came along on some workday walk-talk breaks, too. Call quality was great on them, and so was the connection: I have one spot on my regular route where my Airpods
always
drop, and my Buds stayed on the whole time. I used transparency mode on my walks for safety, so I was able to hear any cars coming up behind me.
Battery Life
With noise cancellation off, Google says you should get 12 total hours of listening time with just the Buds (and 48 hours if you store them in the case). In the two-plus weeks since I’ve been wearing the Buds, I haven’t had to charge them, and the case remains at 13%.
Price
At $229 as its regular retain price, the Pixel Buds Pro 2 are pretty pricey, though not quite as steep as the Airpods Pro 2, which retail at $249. They’re also $30 more than Google’s base A-series model. But for that upcharge, you do get a bunch more features, including: a twist-to-adjust stabilizer for a closer fit, active noise cancellation and transparency mode, the capability to charge wirelessly, and lots more hours of listening time. If premium listening is a priority for you, it could be worth the extra splurge.
Bottom Line
I really appreciated the ease of use with these Buds, since they’re made to seamlessly integrate with my phone. This took away a lot of the struggle that sometimes comes with my Airpods-Android combo, and, in many cases, they allow me to get started with my workout quicker since I don't have to mess around with anything. (Or try to connect…and connect…and connect.)
With earbuds, though, function is huge, but it’s not the only thing: Since you’re sticking them in your ears, they have to be comfy, too. With the Buds Pro 2, I never really forgot I was wearing them—I could always feel a little bit of pressure. And after a few times when my runs hit 40 minutes, I noticed some tenderness along the openings of my ear after I had taken them out. It wasn’t so much because of the tips, but more so the circular design that I think was just rubbing due to the shape of my ear. The fit for this kind of thing is just super individualized, and you really won’t know how it feels until you give it a try. If the fit works with your ear anatomy, though, and you’ve got an Android phone, the Buds Pro 2 could be a great addition to your workout routine—and outside of it, too.

The Buds came in an egg-shaped charging case (and use a USB-C cable to juice up, so no annoying proprietary cord needed) and with some extra goodies. Namely, three additional sizes of ear tips to ensure proper fit.

How the Buds Feel
I tried both the default size (the mediums), as well as the smalls, and liked the feel of the former better. Once I got the placement right—you tuck it into your ear, then rotate to secure—they stayed put. They never really felt like
part
of my ear though; I wouldn’t say they hurt, but I was always cognizant that they were there. With my AirPods, I could honestly forget they were even in.
Getting Started
Setting up the Google Pixel Buds Pro 2 was ridiculously easy. All I had to do was unlock my phone, open the case and press the pairing light on the back, and my Pixel phone recognized my Buds immediately. (Full disclosure: I didn’t read the instructions first; the set-up was that intuitive.) They popped up on my Pixel’s screen, and I tapped the “connect” to begin set-up—I didn’t even have to futz with anything in my Bluetooth settings.

One of the first things the setup screen prompted me to do was test my ear seal. I performed the test wearing the mediums. I initially only got a thumbs up for the right one, but after I played around with the insertion of the left one a little more, I was able to achieve a proper fit with that one, too.
Then I acquainted myself with the touch controls:
Swipe forward to raise the volume.
Swipe backward to lower the volume.
Single tap to play or pause, or to answer a call.
Double tap to skip to the next track or reject a call.
Triple tap to go to the previous track.
Press and hold to turn on active noise control.
After that quick tutorial—and a confirmation that yes, I am now able to see battery level for both earbuds
and
the charging case in the Buds app and my phone’s Bluetooth settings—I started to put them to work.
Working Out With the the Pixel Buds 2
I had one order of business to take care of before I started sweating: pairing the Buds with my workout equipment. For my runs, that was my
Garmin Forerunner 265 smartwatch
—which allows me to listen to music on my run, sans phone—and my NordicTrack s27i for my iFIT cycling classes. My Garmin sometimes balks connecting to my Airpods, forcing me to restart it (and delaying my run in the process). But the watch recognized my Buds immediately, and they connected quickly and without any problem every subsequent time, too. My bike wasn’t quite so smooth: It would “see” my Buds, but wasn’t able to connect. I had to get off the bike and reboot it, after which the Buds did work.
On my runs—I wear only one Bud for safety reasons—I was able to use all the touch controls, but there were a few snags. The Buds sometimes confused a swipe for a tap, and instead of skipping the song, it would end up pausing it. The slower I ran, the easier it was for the Buds to get it right. (To be clear, I don’t think this is the fault of the Buds—when you’re in motion, what you
intend
to be a swipe can easily just become a thwack instead.)
On the bike where you’re stationary, the touch controls worked flawlessly. I was able to turn on noise cancellation with a press and hold, which really allowed me to immerse myself into my workout. The traffic underneath my window blended away, as did the hum of the fan and the slight rhythmic creak of the pedals, so the only thing I was hearing was my “coach” calling out intervals. When I unpaired the Buds from my bike and synced them with my phone to listen to music instead, I was able to go from song to song without having to unlock my phone and rummage each time. I wore the earbuds while lifting at the gym too, and the noise cancellation was a nice way to remove the literal background noise and concentrate on the dumbbells in front of me.

I’ve only been wearing the Buds for a couple weeks, but so far, my sweat hasn’t short-circuited them. According to Google, the Buds have a water protection rating of IP54, meaning that they should be able to withstand water spray. Temps have been pretty mild and cool in Pennsylvania where I’ve been testing these, so I am curious to see how they hold up during my normal swampy, humid runs in the summer, when my sweat pools
everywhere.
Taking Calls on the Pixel Buds Pro 2
My Buds came along on some workday walk-talk breaks, too. Call quality was great on them, and so was the connection: I have one spot on my regular route where my Airpods
always
drop, and my Buds stayed on the whole time. I used transparency mode on my walks for safety, so I was able to hear any cars coming up behind me.
Battery Life
With noise cancellation off, Google says you should get 12 total hours of listening time with just the Buds (and 48 hours if you store them in the case). In the two-plus weeks since I’ve been wearing the Buds, I haven’t had to charge them, and the case remains at 13%.
Price
At $229 as its regular retain price, the Pixel Buds Pro 2 are pretty pricey, though not quite as steep as the Airpods Pro 2, which retail at $249. They’re also $30 more than Google’s base A-series model. But for that upcharge, you do get a bunch more features, including: a twist-to-adjust stabilizer for a closer fit, active noise cancellation and transparency mode, the capability to charge wirelessly, and lots more hours of listening time. If premium listening is a priority for you, it could be worth the extra splurge.
Bottom Line
I really appreciated the ease of use with these Buds, since they’re made to seamlessly integrate with my phone. This took away a lot of the struggle that sometimes comes with my Airpods-Android combo, and, in many cases, they allow me to get started with my workout quicker since I don't have to mess around with anything. (Or try to connect…and connect…and connect.)
With earbuds, though, function is huge, but it’s not the only thing: Since you’re sticking them in your ears, they have to be comfy, too. With the Buds Pro 2, I never really forgot I was wearing them—I could always feel a little bit of pressure. And after a few times when my runs hit 40 minutes, I noticed some tenderness along the openings of my ear after I had taken them out. It wasn’t so much because of the tips, but more so the circular design that I think was just rubbing due to the shape of my ear. The fit for this kind of thing is just super individualized, and you really won’t know how it feels until you give it a try. If the fit works with your ear anatomy, though, and you’ve got an Android phone, the Buds Pro 2 could be a great addition to your workout routine—and outside of it, too.

How we picked the winners
This year, SELF tapped a panel of fitness experts—as well as our very own staffers—to nominate their all-time favorite products. What do they reach for time and time again that makes home workout sessions easier, more accessible, and, most importantly, more enjoyable? They came back to us with a vast pool of picks that include large machines, smaller pieces, high-tech equipment, and recovery tools. We evaluated their nominations by cross-referencing them with past reporting we’ve done at SELF—we’ve been testing fitness equipment for a very, very long time—along with other online consumer reviews. Did more than one expert recommend a particular product? Have we covered an item’s evolution over the years—and is it consistently
that
good? Ultimately, we narrowed down the list to 36 truly exceptional winners perfect for lifters, runners, cardio enthusiasts, yoga lovers, and beyond.
Large equipment
Best Studio Bike—Budget: BowFlex C6 Bike

BowFlex
C6 Bike
$999
$799
BowFlex
Indoor cycling instructor and Home Fitness Awards judge Katie Pierson, CPT, bought Bowflex’s C6 Indoor Cycling Bike for her home gym four years ago and never looked back. “While it might not have all the advanced features of some more expensive alternatives, this bike is well-constructed, offers 100 levels of magnetic resistance, pairs nicely with apps like Peloton and Strava, and is affordable,” she says. A simple LCD screen helps you track stats like speed and distance, and we like that there’s a dedicated stand to hold a smartphone or tablet while you pedal. Also included in your purchase: a Bluetooth-enabled heart rate armband, SPD clips for
cycling shoes
, a pair of three-pound dumbbells, and a free one-month membership to BowFlex’s online fitness platform, JRNY.
Best Studio Bike—Splurge: NordicTrack S27i Studio Bike
Courtesy of brand
NordicTrack
S27i Studio Bike
$2,499
$2,199
NordicTrack
Have a little more wiggle room in your budget? Enter NordicTrack’s s27i Studio Bike, which earns its second SELF Home Fitness Award this year. A 27-inch touchscreen clearly displays your workout of choice, while incline and decline settings make your ride feel more realistic: “The programmed rides help you work different muscles and provide a mental shift so you don’t feel like you’re on a stationary bike,” our tester says. “It’s just a really nice, immersive workout.” To get the most out of your purchase, we highly recommend springing for an iFIT membership, which costs $39 a month and unlocks a large library of studio classes and scenic rides through countries all around the world. With the latest update, you can even watch your favorite Netflix or Amazon Prime shows.
Best Recumbent Bike: Merach S19 Recumbent Exercise Bike

Merach
S19 Recumbent Exercise Bike
$600
$400
Amazon
$600
$390
Walmart
For a more relaxed ride, Merach’s S19 Recumbent Bike is Pierson’s go-to. She loves how smoothly and almost silently the pedals move—plus the resistance is easy to tweak using a handle that looks similar to a car’s gear shift. The mesh seat is breathable, which prevents sweat from pooling in, well, undesired places, and adjustable, so you’ll never be crunched into an uncomfortable position. “I thought it was such a great piece of equipment that I gave it to my mom after I was done testing to help her with hip-replacement rehab,” Pierson says. “I still ride it when I go over to her house.”
Best Treadmill: NordicTrack Commercial 1750 Treadmill
Courtesy of brand
NordicTrack
Commercial 1750 Treadmill
$4,200
Amazon
$2,499
$1,999
Nordictrack
$1,999
Sam's Club
We’ve recommended the NordicTrack Commercial 1750 for runners
before
, and we’re pleased to report that it’s still
that
good. While on the pricier side, our tester (a former marathoner) says you definitely “get what you pay for.” It’s high-tech but still user-friendly (“All of the handles and adjustments are easily accessible, there are quick jump-buttons on the monitor beside the screen, and there are also manual adjustments on the front handlebar if you want a more precise speed or incline,” she says), and when you’re finished working out you can fold the treadmill flat to clear some space. Just note that, although it has wheels, it’s still pretty heavy, so it’s not the easiest machine to move around.
Best Budget Treadmill: ProForm Carbon TLX

ProForm
Carbon TLX
$999
Amazon
$2,199
ProForm
$1,000
DICK'S Sporting Goods
Compact, foldable, and less than half the price of the NordicTrack Commercial 1750, the ProForm Carbon TLX is the best budget-friendly treadmill we’ve tried. Our tester says that the controls were intuitive and responsive, allowing her to adjust the settings quickly and easily, and she found the deck to feel cushioned and sturdy: “I went from walking to running, and the treadmill remained stable the whole time,” she says. “I didn’t feel any wobble on the handles, either.” Her final verdict? While it’s less expensive than many competitors, “it doesn’t look cheap, and it doesn’t feel cheap.”
Best Walking Pad: Urevo SpaceWalk Lite Treadmill
Courtesy of brand
Urevo
SpaceWalk Lite Treadmill
$190
$180
Amazon
$400
$220
Walmart
$250
$170
Urevo
At under $500, Urevo’s Walking Pad isn’t as pricey as many other
under-desk treadmill
alternatives. It also has an impressive list of features, including a clear LED display, a foldable handlebar, and a maximum speed of 7.6 miles per hour. The best part? “I have to give props to the quiet motor,” our tester says. “For a budget treadmill, I was impressed with the lack of loud noise while in use."
Best Elliptical: NordicTrack FS10i Interactive Elliptical Trainer
Courtesy of brand
NordicTrack
FS10i Interactive Elliptical Trainer
$3,088
Amazon
$1,999
$1,799
Nordictrack
The best elliptical
is one that’s easy to use, with lots of incline and resistance settings so you can challenge yourself on push days or take it easy during
active recovery
. NordicTrack’s FS10i Free Strider checks all of these boxes and more, according to our tester. With an iFit membership (which, as aforementioned, costs $39 per month), you’ll unlock hundreds of classes and workouts in stunning locations: “One day I might hike in the Alps, the next day I can ski in Norway, and then the following day I can run on a beach in Hawaii,” he says. While an elliptical is no small investment, this is the one to get if you can swing the price and the space.
Best Rower: Concept2 RowErg
Courtesy of brand
Concept2
RowERG
$1,300
Amazon
$990
Concept2
Expert judge Morit Summers, CPT, has loved Concept 2’s Rower for years: “I use it for longer form endurance cardio, as well as shorter bursts of high-intensity cardio,” she says. It’s battery-powered—so no need to hunt for a conveniently located outlet—and comes with your choice of two leg heights for a more customized fit. Summers notes that, while there’s a slight learning curve for beginners, the results are worth it: “Once you understand how to create power, it’s awesome.” When you’re finished for the day, quickly break down the rower into two pieces (no tools required) and use the built-in wheels to tuck it away.

DICK'S Sporting Goods
It’s the third year in a row (dating back to our
inaugural Home Fitness Awards
in 2022!) that these dumbbells—adjustable from 5 to 52.5 pounds in 2.5-pound increments—have brought home the gold. This year their glowing endorsement comes from judge Kellen Scantlebury, DPT, CSCS, who recommends them to all of his clients, especially those who live in apartments. “They’re sturdy and built to last,” he says. “You can have multiple weights and not take up so much space.”
Best Dumbbells: Bells of Steel Ergo Rubber Hex Dumbbells
Courtesy of brand
Bells of Steel
Ergo Rubber Hex Dumbbells (20 lb.)
$90
Bells of Steel
If you prefer to own multiple sets of DBs, each a different weight, opt for these. With their ergonomic handles and rubber hexagonal heads, the Bells of Steel
dumbbells
impressed our experts and testers alike. They’re comfortable to use and help gradually progress your strength training: They’re available in 2.5-pound increments from 5 to 20 pounds, and then they jump up by 5 pounds for every pair up to 100 pounds.
Best Dumbbell Plates: Micro Gainz 1.25 lb. Dumbbell Fractional Weight Plates
Courtesy of brand
Micro Gainz
1.25 lb. Dumbbell Fractional Weight Plates
$100
Amazon (4-plate set)
$51
Walmart (2-plate set)
$51
Micro Gainz (2-plate set)
Judge Tina Tang, CPT, loves these small plates for slow and steady
progressive overload
, which can be hard to practice when you’re working with a limited amount of equipment at home. “They’re ideal for people who don’t have adjustable dumbbells,” she says. Easily clip them onto the handle of your dumbbell (they’re compatible with most models!) and bam—you’ve got added resistance without too big of a jump.
Best Kettlebells: Rep Fitness Kettlebells
Courtesy of brand
Rep Fitness
Kettlebells (12 kg)
$65
Amazon
$60
$54
Rep Fitness
These have been Tang’s go-tos for the last few years. She considers them a great bang for your buck compared to other brands, and she appreciates that they come in in-between weights that are often harder to find. She loves that the handles are wider than the bell itself—they’re more comfortable to wrangle than competition-style kettlebells, which can sometimes feel too bulky for the everyday user.
Best Ankle Weights—Budget: Henkelion Adjustable Ankle Weights
Courtesy of brand
Henkelion
Adjustable Ankle Weights
$23
Amazon
Our tester bought these ankle weights six months ago because they weren’t “extraordinarily expensive” and looked like they could get the job done for her physical therapy exercises. Since, they’ve exceeded her expectations by a mile. “They’ve come in handy for a wider range of exercises than I anticipated,” she says. “They fasten securely, fit well around my ankles, legs, and wrists, and have a really soft outer layer that feels nice against my skin.”
Best Ankle Weights—Splurge: Bala Bangles
Courtesy of brand
Bala
Bangles
$65
Target
$55
Bala
Willing to spend a little more money in the name of a cute mat setup? Bala is your brand. According to our tester, these cuffs are “a cute, easy way to feel like I’m making my everyday movement ‘count’ a little more.” She says they initially came in handy during the pandemic when she was doing Pilates classes from home and wanted a way to make them more challenging. Nowadays, she’ll strap them on for her hot girl walks. They’re available in one-, two-, and three-pound sizes and come with a color-coordinated carrying case that makes them easy to store (or show off at your next studio class).
Best Space-Saving Home Gym System: Kayezen Vector 1 System
Courtesy of brand
Kayezen Vector
Vector 1 System
$444
Amazon
$460
Kayezen
Once you secure this tech-free resistance tool to an anchor point, it functions like a cable machine “without the big bulky equipment and at a fraction of the cost,” Dr. Scantlebury says. It’s all you need to get a great workout at home: Use it for strength training moves like chest presses and rows, as well as flexibility and mobility exercises like hip and shoulder rotations, spinal twists, and lower-back stretches.
Best Mini-Band Set: Fit Simplify Resistance Loop Exercise Bands
Courtesy of brand
Fit Simplify
Resistance Loop Exercise Bands
$10
$9
Amazon
$16
Fit Simplify
Our tester has had her Fit Simplify Resistance Loops for the last four years and they’re still going strong in her home and gym workouts—no pun intended. The set consists of five bands, each with a different resistance level. They’re sturdy, portable, available in several cute color schemes, and just $20.
Best Mini-Band: Committed Hp The Better Band
Courtesy of brand
Committed HP
The Better Band
$26
$17
Committed Hp
The Better Band is a wonderfully well-made, inclusive piece of fitness gear—and thus it’s making its second Home Fitness Awards appearance this year. The fabric won’t pinch skin, and a hook-and-loop closure lets you increase or decrease the circumference of the band as you please. “I love that I can hook it on, versus wiggle it on like a pair of stockings,” Summers says. With the ability to adjust, you’ll also get greater control over the level of tension.
Best Yoga Mat: Manduka Pro Yoga Mat 6mm
Courtesy of brand
Manduka
Pro Yoga Mat 6mm
$160
Amazon
$138
DICK'S Sporting Goods
$138
Manduka
A high-quality
yoga mat
like the Manduka Pro will last for years—one instructor described it as “the Rolls Royce of yoga mats”—so it’s worth the investment if you practice regularly. It’s thick, durable, and extremely grippy: Your hands won’t shift in downward-facing dog, and the mat itself won’t slide around the floor during faster-paced flows. Plus it’s made of closed-cell material, which prevents sweat from soaking in. (No one likes a smelly mat.)
Best Yoga Mat: Lululemon The Mat 5mm
Courtesy of brand
Lululemon
The Mat 5mm
$98
Lululemon
Who doesn’t want options? This expert-approved, reversible mat is smooth on one side and textured on the other. Our tester was particularly impressed by its grip: “This is the only yoga mat I’ve ever tried that doesn’t make my hands slip,” she says. “It also has just the right amount of cushion to be comfortable—especially on my knees—without making me feel unstable.”
Best Yoga Blocks: Manduka Cork Yoga Block

Manduka
Cork Yoga Block

Manduka
Cork yoga blocks tend to be sturdier than foam ones, offering modifications that can make your asanas more accessible and stabilize a variety of balancing poses. Case in point: Our tester says these help bring the floor to her in poses like half moon and triangle. She also breaks them out any time she wants to feel more support, placing them under her knees or sacrum when lying on her back. “I feel really grounded when I use this block, which is exactly the purpose of yoga,” she says.
Best Big Mat: Yo Gorilla Mats Premium Large Exercise Mat
Courtesy of brand
Yo Gorilla Mats
Premium Large Exercise Mat
$130
Amazon
$180
Yo Gorilla Mats
Tang uses her Gorilla Mat to create a dedicated exercising area inside her apartment without resorting to utilitarian-looking gym floor tiles. She loves that it’s padded enough for stretching and yoga, but sticky enough for lifting and HIIT. And, at six-by-four-feet, it provides enough space to support your entire body.
Best All-Purpose Mat: All in Motion Premium Fitness Mat 15mm
Courtesy of brand
All in Motion
Premium Fitness Mat 15mm
$30
Target
If you’d rather not drop $100-plus on a workout surface, you’re in luck: Our tester has had this thick, cushy All in Motion mat for three years and swears by it. She’s used it indoors and outdoors, for yoga and stretching, and on uneven floors like carpeting and decks. She says it performs well pretty much wherever she takes it and prevents pressure from building in her hands, knees, and feet.
Best Bench for Small Spaces: Rep Fitness AB-3100 Adjustable Weight Bench
Courtesy of brand
Rep Fitness
AB-3100 Adjustable Weight Bench
$320
Amazon
$270
Rep Fitness
A workout bench might seem like a sleepy thing to shop for, but Dr. Scantlebury says it’s a key piece for upper and lower body exercises—and this adjustable model from Rep Fitness is an exemplary choice. “I love its durability and stability,” he says. “You can perform step ups on it without worrying that it will flip over. From a safety perspective, it’s a great option!”
Best Multipurpose Bench: Reebok Deck
Courtesy of brand
Reebok
Deck
$200
Amazon
$270
$185
Walmart
With over 20 different configurations and a textured surface that prevents slipping, Reebok’s Deck can serve as a bench, step, or incline for your workouts. Tang appreciates its versatility and lighter weight, noting that it’s a great option if you’re short on space or want to store other equipment when not in use. (It can decline to be completely flat,
and
it has an internal compartment for small gear like resistance bands).
Best Step: Yes4All Adjustable Workout Aerobic Exercise Step
Courtesy of brand
Yes4All
Adjustable Workout Aerobic Exercise Step
$68
Amazon
$70
$61
Walmart
Step workouts are alive and well
—and they’re a blast to do at home with this adjustable platform. Our tester says it’s durable and sturdy through an
Xtreme Hip Hop with Phil
class. “It’s a new, fun way to exercise if you’re totally sick of using a bike or some other home workout (like I am!),” she says. You can set its height to four, six, or eight inches, and it can support up to 300 pounds.
Best Space-Saving Dumbbell Rack: Cap A-Frame Dumbbell Weight Rack
Courtesy of brand
Cap
A-Frame Dumbbell Weight Rack
$28
Amazon
$30
Target
$49
$40
Walmart
Your dumbbell set doesn’t have to take up tons of floor space if you stack them in Cap’s vertical storage rack. It saves room, makes it easy to quickly grab DBs, and is built to last. “Sometimes weight trees can be flimsy or are made for small weights, but this can hold some medium-size ones,” our tester says. “I have 10s, 15s, 20s, 25s, and 30s on it, and I have had it for years, and it’s never been a problem.”

Best Timer App: Seconds Pro Interval Timer
Courtesy of brand
Seconds Pro
Interval Timer
$5
Apple
You don’t have to be a fitness instructor to get great use out of an app like Seconds Pro. It allows you to create specific interval, countdown, or stopwatch timers with customizable labels (unlike your smartphone’s clock), and has been Tang’s go-to for 10 years and, well, counting. She recommends it to clients for timing high-intensity interval training (HIIT) and
Tabata workouts
. More great features: large, easy-to-read numbers; verbal warnings when time’s about to run out; and the ability to add music that keeps your motivation up between sets. Don’t let the one-time $5 fee put you off—there are few other options out there that are this flexible, Tang says.
Best Virtual Classes: Peloton App
Courtesy of brand
Peloton
App
$24
Peloton (Monthly)
Pierson started using the Peloton Digital App during the pandemic to work out at home, and she’s stuck with it ever since. You don’t have to own a Bike, Tread, or other Peloton machine to try the hundreds of classes that are included with a monthly (or yearly) membership. Walk, stretch, run, cycle, and meditate anywhere along with one of the brand’s many trainers in real time or on your own schedule. Have a workout buddy or two? You can follow them on the app to see which classes they’re trying and cheer them on. While a membership can be a little pricey (at the time of publication, it costs $11 to $24 a month, depending on the plan you choose), the app’s high-production value and motivating instructors are well worth it.
Best Smartwatch: Garmin Venu 3S

Garmin’s Venu 3S hits the sweet spot between a sleek smartwatch and a data-heavy fitness tracker. Use it to track workouts, heart rate, hydration, sleep habits, and more, with a battery life that lasts up to 10 days. Beyond recording statistics, the Venu can also help you respond to text messages and take calls while you’re on the go. Users can even download Amazon Music playlists straight to the watch and listen without a phone nearby. “I can’t think of anything it’s missing that’d tempt me to look for an upgrade in a couple of years,” SELF’s Fitness Director, Christa Sgobba, wrote
in her review
. “It’s the kind of fitness tracker that’ll keep you in the know for the long haul.”

But what sets it apart from other trackers we’ve tried is the corresponding app’s ability to turn confusing numbers into easy-to-follow advice you can use to adjust your daily routine. Our tester wore the Oura 3 throughout most of her pregnancy, and found it a smart investment for anyone who wants to take charge of their health and wellness. The newest model—Oura 4, which came out just a few weeks ago—has slight design tweaks (largely unnoticeable unless you’re the one wearing the ring), a nicer-looking charging stand, and a longer battery life. There’s no denying that the ring is on the pricier side, and you’ll also need to purchase a $6 monthly (or $60 yearly) membership to take full advantage of its features. But again, it’s an investment, and for many it pays off: “While I could technically just listen to my body and act accordingly, I liked being a step ahead of the game and really leaning more into rest and self-care when needed,” she says.

Good earbuds should feel like comfy underwear—so reliable you’ll forget you have them on. The Studio Buds+ from Beats accomplish just that, with a secure fit and an impressive 36 hours of listening time. “I can spin around or jump up and down, and those suckers are glued in,” our tester says. “They are small enough to be discreet and have amazing sound quality.” We’re also fans of their effective transparency and noise-cancellation modes, which allow you to hear your surroundings—or block everything out entirely—while enjoying a playlist or

As the name implies, open-ear headphones go
around
your ears (not in them), so you can stay fully tuned into your environment without sacrificing your 2007 Britney jam session. This pair from Shokz stays put when you start to pick up the pace, is super lightweight, and is water-resistant, meaning it can withstand sweaty workouts and sudden drizzles. You also get up to 10 hours of listening time and phone calls on a full battery. If you need them in a pinch, enjoy 1.5 hours of battery life after just five minutes of charging.

If over-the-ear headphones are more your thing, we think it doesn’t get much better than Apple’s AirPods Max. “I’ve had them for about a year, and I use them every day,” our tester said. “They feel really snug and secure on my head.” The large foam cushions on each side aren’t just for comfort—they block out noisy distractions to help you focus on your workout. These also have transparency and noise-cancellation settings, plus up to 20 hours of battery life on a single charge. And at just over 13 ounces, they won’t weigh you down while you’re on the run or at the gym.

Best Foam Roller: Lululemon Double Roller

Foam-rolling doesn’t just feel great—it can also help your muscles recover after a tough workout and boost circulation, as SELF has
previously reported
. Our tester loves this roller from Lululemon for its two-in-one design: Use both pieces together to target large areas, or pull the firmer corkscrew-shaped core out to release deep knots. “This is my go-to recovery tool. I use it more often than my Theragun,” she says. “I have yet to find a muscle it can’t reach and relax.” It also looks pretty enough to leave hanging out in your dedicated home workout corner—no storage required, she adds.

One tester picked up this buzzy roller after her physical therapist recommended it: “It’s super firm
and
it vibrates, which has really helped me get those pressure points,” she says. The surface is textured to help
soothe sore muscles
, and you can choose from four vibration speeds to find the combo that offers the most relief. It comes with a charging cable, a handy carrying bag, and three mini resistance bands to help you warm up before each session.

The Theragun Mini first won a Home Fitness Award in 2022. This year it’s back with a smaller, lighter design that has one tester reaching for it on the regular. “The device makes it easy to work on stubborn tight or achy areas while you’re just sitting around,” she says. “No need to get on the floor and fight with a foam roller (which, let’s be honest, you’re not always in the mood to do).” The chunky, triangular handle helps you get a good grip, while the three included attachment heads are designed to tackle most muscle groups.

Our testers and expert judges, who you can read more about below, set out to find the gear that’s actually worth your time and money. Because in a sea of options, it can be tough to know what’s high-quality, effective, safe, and easy to use. We’re confident that no matter which ones you choose, these winners will help you get the most out of your time, space, and routine. Find all of our favorites below—and happy sweating!

How we picked the winners
This year, SELF tapped a panel of fitness experts—as well as our very own staffers—to nominate their all-time favorite products. What do they reach for time and time again that makes home workout sessions easier, more accessible, and, most importantly, more enjoyable? They came back to us with a vast pool of picks that include large machines, smaller pieces, high-tech equipment, and recovery tools. We evaluated their nominations by cross-referencing them with past reporting we’ve done at SELF—we’ve been testing fitness equipment for a very, very long time—along with other online consumer reviews. Did more than one expert recommend a particular product? Have we covered an item’s evolution over the years—and is it consistently
that
good? Ultimately, we narrowed down the list to 36 truly exceptional winners perfect for lifters, runners, cardio enthusiasts, yoga lovers, and beyond.
Large equipment
Best Studio Bike—Budget: BowFlex C6 Bike
Courtesy of brand
BowFlex
C6 Bike
$999
$799
BowFlex
Indoor cycling instructor and Home Fitness Awards judge Katie Pierson, CPT, bought Bowflex’s C6 Indoor Cycling Bike for her home gym four years ago and never looked back. “While it might not have all the advanced features of some more expensive alternatives, this bike is well-constructed, offers 100 levels of magnetic resistance, pairs nicely with apps like Peloton and Strava, and is affordable,” she says. A simple LCD screen helps you track stats like speed and distance, and we like that there’s a dedicated stand to hold a smartphone or tablet while you pedal. Also included in your purchase: a Bluetooth-enabled heart rate armband, SPD clips for
cycling shoes
, a pair of three-pound dumbbells, and a free one-month membership to BowFlex’s online fitness platform, JRNY.
Best Studio Bike—Splurge: NordicTrack S27i Studio Bike
Courtesy of brand
NordicTrack
S27i Studio Bike
$2,499
$2,199
NordicTrack
Have a little more wiggle room in your budget? Enter NordicTrack’s s27i Studio Bike, which earns its second SELF Home Fitness Award this year. A 27-inch touchscreen clearly displays your workout of choice, while incline and decline settings make your ride feel more realistic: “The programmed rides help you work different muscles and provide a mental shift so you don’t feel like you’re on a stationary bike,” our tester says. “It’s just a really nice, immersive workout.” To get the most out of your purchase, we highly recommend springing for an iFIT membership, which costs $39 a month and unlocks a large library of studio classes and scenic rides through countries all around the world. With the latest update, you can even watch your favorite Netflix or Amazon Prime shows.
Best Recumbent Bike: Merach S19 Recumbent Exercise Bike

Merach
S19 Recumbent Exercise Bike
$600
$400
Amazon

$390
Walmart
For a more relaxed ride, Merach’s S19 Recumbent Bike is Pierson’s go-to. She loves how smoothly and almost silently the pedals move—plus the resistance is easy to tweak using a handle that looks similar to a car’s gear shift. The mesh seat is breathable, which prevents sweat from pooling in, well, undesired places, and adjustable, so you’ll never be crunched into an uncomfortable position. “I thought it was such a great piece of equipment that I gave it to my mom after I was done testing to help her with hip-replacement rehab,” Pierson says. “I still ride it when I go over to her house.”
Best Treadmill: NordicTrack Commercial 1750 Treadmill
Courtesy of brand
NordicTrack
Commercial 1750 Treadmill
$4,200
Amazon
$2,499
$1,999
Nordictrack
$1,999
Sam's Club
We’ve recommended the NordicTrack Commercial 1750 for runners
before
, and we’re pleased to report that it’s still
that
good. While on the pricier side, our tester (a former marathoner) says you definitely “get what you pay for.” It’s high-tech but still user-friendly (“All of the handles and adjustments are easily accessible, there are quick jump-buttons on the monitor beside the screen, and there are also manual adjustments on the front handlebar if you want a more precise speed or incline,” she says), and when you’re finished working out you can fold the treadmill flat to clear some space. Just note that, although it has wheels, it’s still pretty heavy, so it’s not the easiest machine to move around.
Best Budget Treadmill: ProForm Carbon TLX
Courtesy of brand
ProForm
Carbon TLX
$999
Amazon
$2,199
ProForm
$1,000
DICK'S Sporting Goods
Compact, foldable, and less than half the price of the NordicTrack Commercial 1750, the ProForm Carbon TLX is the best budget-friendly treadmill we’ve tried. Our tester says that the controls were intuitive and responsive, allowing her to adjust the settings quickly and easily, and she found the deck to feel cushioned and sturdy: “I went from walking to running, and the treadmill remained stable the whole time,” she says. “I didn’t feel any wobble on the handles, either.” Her final verdict? While it’s less expensive than many competitors, “it doesn’t look cheap, and it doesn’t feel cheap.”
Best Walking Pad: Urevo SpaceWalk Lite Treadmill
Courtesy of brand
Urevo
SpaceWalk Lite Treadmill
$190
$180
Amazon
$400
$220
Walmart
$250
$170
Urevo
At under $500, Urevo’s Walking Pad isn’t as pricey as many other
under-desk treadmill
alternatives. It also has an impressive list of features, including a clear LED display, a foldable handlebar, and a maximum speed of 7.6 miles per hour. The best part? “I have to give props to the quiet motor,” our tester says. “For a budget treadmill, I was impressed with the lack of loud noise while in use."
Best Elliptical: NordicTrack FS10i Interactive Elliptical Trainer
Courtesy of brand
NordicTrack
FS10i Interactive Elliptical Trainer
$3,088
Amazon
$1,999
$1,799
Nordictrack
The best elliptical
is one that’s easy to use, with lots of incline and resistance settings so you can challenge yourself on push days or take it easy during
active recovery
. NordicTrack’s FS10i Free Strider checks all of these boxes and more, according to our tester. With an iFit membership (which, as aforementioned, costs $39 per month), you’ll unlock hundreds of classes and workouts in stunning locations: “One day I might hike in the Alps, the next day I can ski in Norway, and then the following day I can run on a beach in Hawaii,” he says. While an elliptical is no small investment, this is the one to get if you can swing the price and the space.
Best Rower: Concept2 RowErg
Courtesy of brand
Concept2
RowERG
$1,300
Amazon
$990
Concept2
Expert judge Morit Summers, CPT, has loved Concept 2’s Rower for years: “I use it for longer form endurance cardio, as well as shorter bursts of high-intensity cardio,” she says. It’s battery-powered—so no need to hunt for a conveniently located outlet—and comes with your choice of two leg heights for a more customized fit. Summers notes that, while there’s a slight learning curve for beginners, the results are worth it: “Once you understand how to create power, it’s awesome.” When you’re finished for the day, quickly break down the rower into two pieces (no tools required) and use the built-in wheels to tuck it away.

Best Adjustable Dumbbells: BowFlex SelectTech 552 Adjustable Dumbbells

DICK'S Sporting Goods
It’s the third year in a row (dating back to our
inaugural Home Fitness Awards
in 2022!) that these dumbbells—adjustable from 5 to 52.5 pounds in 2.5-pound increments—have brought home the gold. This year their glowing endorsement comes from judge Kellen Scantlebury, DPT, CSCS, who recommends them to all of his clients, especially those who live in apartments. “They’re sturdy and built to last,” he says. “You can have multiple weights and not take up so much space.”
Best Dumbbells: Bells of Steel Ergo Rubber Hex Dumbbells
Courtesy of brand
Bells of Steel
Ergo Rubber Hex Dumbbells (20 lb.)
$90
Bells of Steel
If you prefer to own multiple sets of DBs, each a different weight, opt for these. With their ergonomic handles and rubber hexagonal heads, the Bells of Steel
dumbbells
impressed our experts and testers alike. They’re comfortable to use and help gradually progress your strength training: They’re available in 2.5-pound increments from 5 to 20 pounds, and then they jump up by 5 pounds for every pair up to 100 pounds.
Best Dumbbell Plates: Micro Gainz 1.25 lb. Dumbbell Fractional Weight Plates
Courtesy of brand
Micro Gainz
1.25 lb. Dumbbell Fractional Weight Plates
$100
Amazon (4-plate set)
$51
Walmart (2-plate set)
$51
Micro Gainz (2-plate set)
Judge Tina Tang, CPT, loves these small plates for slow and steady
progressive overload
, which can be hard to practice when you’re working with a limited amount of equipment at home. “They’re ideal for people who don’t have adjustable dumbbells,” she says. Easily clip them onto the handle of your dumbbell (they’re compatible with most models!) and bam—you’ve got added resistance without too big of a jump.
Best Kettlebells: Rep Fitness Kettlebells
Courtesy of brand
Rep Fitness
Kettlebells (12 kg)
$65
Amazon
$60
$54
Rep Fitness
These have been Tang’s go-tos for the last few years. She considers them a great bang for your buck compared to other brands, and she appreciates that they come in in-between weights that are often harder to find. She loves that the handles are wider than the bell itself—they’re more comfortable to wrangle than competition-style kettlebells, which can sometimes feel too bulky for the everyday user.
Best Ankle Weights—Budget: Henkelion Adjustable Ankle Weights
Courtesy of brand
Henkelion
Adjustable Ankle Weights
$23
Amazon
Our tester bought these ankle weights six months ago because they weren’t “extraordinarily expensive” and looked like they could get the job done for her physical therapy exercises. Since, they’ve exceeded her expectations by a mile. “They’ve come in handy for a wider range of exercises than I anticipated,” she says. “They fasten securely, fit well around my ankles, legs, and wrists, and have a really soft outer layer that feels nice against my skin.”
Best Ankle Weights—Splurge: Bala Bangles

Bala
Bangles
$65
Target
$55
Bala
Willing to spend a little more money in the name of a cute mat setup? Bala is your brand. According to our tester, these cuffs are “a cute, easy way to feel like I’m making my everyday movement ‘count’ a little more.” She says they initially came in handy during the pandemic when she was doing Pilates classes from home and wanted a way to make them more challenging. Nowadays, she’ll strap them on for her hot girl walks. They’re available in one-, two-, and three-pound sizes and come with a color-coordinated carrying case that makes them easy to store (or show off at your next studio class).
Best Space-Saving Home Gym System: Kayezen Vector 1 System

Kayezen Vector
Vector 1 System
$444
Amazon
$460
Kayezen
Once you secure this tech-free resistance tool to an anchor point, it functions like a cable machine “without the big bulky equipment and at a fraction of the cost,” Dr. Scantlebury says. It’s all you need to get a great workout at home: Use it for strength training moves like chest presses and rows, as well as flexibility and mobility exercises like hip and shoulder rotations, spinal twists, and lower-back stretches.
Best Mini-Band Set: Fit Simplify Resistance Loop Exercise Bands
Courtesy of brand
Fit Simplify
Resistance Loop Exercise Bands
$10
$9
Amazon
$16
Fit Simplify
Our tester has had her Fit Simplify Resistance Loops for the last four years and they’re still going strong in her home and gym workouts—no pun intended. The set consists of five bands, each with a different resistance level. They’re sturdy, portable, available in several cute color schemes, and just $20.
Best Mini-Band: Committed Hp The Better Band
Courtesy of brand
Committed HP
The Better Band
$26
$17
Committed Hp
The Better Band is a wonderfully well-made, inclusive piece of fitness gear—and thus it’s making its second Home Fitness Awards appearance this year. The fabric won’t pinch skin, and a hook-and-loop closure lets you increase or decrease the circumference of the band as you please. “I love that I can hook it on, versus wiggle it on like a pair of stockings,” Summers says. With the ability to adjust, you’ll also get greater control over the level of tension.
Best Yoga Mat: Manduka Pro Yoga Mat 6mm
Courtesy of brand
Manduka
Pro Yoga Mat 6mm
$160
Amazon
$138
DICK'S Sporting Goods
$138
Manduka
A high-quality
yoga mat
like the Manduka Pro will last for years—one instructor described it as “the Rolls Royce of yoga mats”—so it’s worth the investment if you practice regularly. It’s thick, durable, and extremely grippy: Your hands won’t shift in downward-facing dog, and the mat itself won’t slide around the floor during faster-paced flows. Plus it’s made of closed-cell material, which prevents sweat from soaking in. (No one likes a smelly mat.)
Best Yoga Mat: Lululemon The Mat 5mm
Courtesy of brand
Lululemon
The Mat 5mm
$98
Lululemon
Who doesn’t want options? This expert-approved, reversible mat is smooth on one side and textured on the other. Our tester was particularly impressed by its grip: “This is the only yoga mat I’ve ever tried that doesn’t make my hands slip,” she says. “It also has just the right amount of cushion to be comfortable—especially on my knees—without making me feel unstable.”
Best Yoga Blocks: Manduka Cork Yoga Block

Manduka
Cork Yoga Block

Amazon

Manduka
Cork yoga blocks tend to be sturdier than foam ones, offering modifications that can make your asanas more accessible and stabilize a variety of balancing poses. Case in point: Our tester says these help bring the floor to her in poses like half moon and triangle. She also breaks them out any time she wants to feel more support, placing them under her knees or sacrum when lying on her back. “I feel really grounded when I use this block, which is exactly the purpose of yoga,” she says.
Best Big Mat: Yo Gorilla Mats Premium Large Exercise Mat

Yo Gorilla Mats
Premium Large Exercise Mat
$130
Amazon
$180
Yo Gorilla Mats
Tang uses her Gorilla Mat to create a dedicated exercising area inside her apartment without resorting to utilitarian-looking gym floor tiles. She loves that it’s padded enough for stretching and yoga, but sticky enough for lifting and HIIT. And, at six-by-four-feet, it provides enough space to support your entire body.
Best All-Purpose Mat: All in Motion Premium Fitness Mat 15mm
Courtesy of brand
All in Motion
Premium Fitness Mat 15mm
$30
Target
If you’d rather not drop $100-plus on a workout surface, you’re in luck: Our tester has had this thick, cushy All in Motion mat for three years and swears by it. She’s used it indoors and outdoors, for yoga and stretching, and on uneven floors like carpeting and decks. She says it performs well pretty much wherever she takes it and prevents pressure from building in her hands, knees, and feet.
Best Bench for Small Spaces: Rep Fitness AB-3100 Adjustable Weight Bench
Courtesy of brand
Rep Fitness
AB-3100 Adjustable Weight Bench
$320
Amazon
$270
Rep Fitness
A workout bench might seem like a sleepy thing to shop for, but Dr. Scantlebury says it’s a key piece for upper and lower body exercises—and this adjustable model from Rep Fitness is an exemplary choice. “I love its durability and stability,” he says. “You can perform step ups on it without worrying that it will flip over. From a safety perspective, it’s a great option!”
Best Multipurpose Bench: Reebok Deck

Reebok
Deck
$200
Amazon
$270
$185
Walmart
With over 20 different configurations and a textured surface that prevents slipping, Reebok’s Deck can serve as a bench, step, or incline for your workouts. Tang appreciates its versatility and lighter weight, noting that it’s a great option if you’re short on space or want to store other equipment when not in use. (It can decline to be completely flat,
and
it has an internal compartment for small gear like resistance bands).
Best Step: Yes4All Adjustable Workout Aerobic Exercise Step

Yes4All
Adjustable Workout Aerobic Exercise Step
$68
Amazon

Step workouts are alive and well
—and they’re a blast to do at home with this adjustable platform. Our tester says it’s durable and sturdy through an
Xtreme Hip Hop with Phil
class. “It’s a new, fun way to exercise if you’re totally sick of using a bike or some other home workout (like I am!),” she says. You can set its height to four, six, or eight inches, and it can support up to 300 pounds.
Best Space-Saving Dumbbell Rack: Cap A-Frame Dumbbell Weight Rack

Your dumbbell set doesn’t have to take up tons of floor space if you stack them in Cap’s vertical storage rack. It saves room, makes it easy to quickly grab DBs, and is built to last. “Sometimes weight trees can be flimsy or are made for small weights, but this can hold some medium-size ones,” our tester says. “I have 10s, 15s, 20s, 25s, and 30s on it, and I have had it for years, and it’s never been a problem.”

Best Timer App: Seconds Pro Interval Timer
Courtesy of brand
Seconds Pro
Interval Timer
$5
Apple
You don’t have to be a fitness instructor to get great use out of an app like Seconds Pro. It allows you to create specific interval, countdown, or stopwatch timers with customizable labels (unlike your smartphone’s clock), and has been Tang’s go-to for 10 years and, well, counting. She recommends it to clients for timing high-intensity interval training (HIIT) and
Tabata workouts
. More great features: large, easy-to-read numbers; verbal warnings when time’s about to run out; and the ability to add music that keeps your motivation up between sets. Don’t let the one-time $5 fee put you off—there are few other options out there that are this flexible, Tang says.
Best Virtual Classes: Peloton App
Courtesy of brand
Peloton
App
$24
Peloton (Monthly)
Pierson started using the Peloton Digital App during the pandemic to work out at home, and she’s stuck with it ever since. You don’t have to own a Bike, Tread, or other Peloton machine to try the hundreds of classes that are included with a monthly (or yearly) membership. Walk, stretch, run, cycle, and meditate anywhere along with one of the brand’s many trainers in real time or on your own schedule. Have a workout buddy or two? You can follow them on the app to see which classes they’re trying and cheer them on. While a membership can be a little pricey (at the time of publication, it costs $11 to $24 a month, depending on the plan you choose), the app’s high-production value and motivating instructors are well worth it.
Best Smartwatch: Garmin Venu 3S

Garmin’s Venu 3S hits the sweet spot between a sleek smartwatch and a data-heavy fitness tracker. Use it to track workouts, heart rate, hydration, sleep habits, and more, with a battery life that lasts up to 10 days. Beyond recording statistics, the Venu can also help you respond to text messages and take calls while you’re on the go. Users can even download Amazon Music playlists straight to the watch and listen without a phone nearby. “I can’t think of anything it’s missing that’d tempt me to look for an upgrade in a couple of years,” SELF’s Fitness Director, Christa Sgobba, wrote
in her review
. “It’s the kind of fitness tracker that’ll keep you in the know for the long haul.”
Best Smart Ring: Oura Ring 4

Oura’s sleek titanium Ring works around the clock to measure stress levels, heart rate, body temperature, and more. But what sets it apart from other trackers we’ve tried is the corresponding app’s ability to turn confusing numbers into easy-to-follow advice you can use to adjust your daily routine. Our tester wore the Oura 3 throughout most of her pregnancy, and found it a smart investment for anyone who wants to take charge of their health and wellness. The newest model—Oura 4, which came out just a few weeks ago—has slight design tweaks (largely unnoticeable unless you’re the one wearing the ring), a nicer-looking charging stand, and a longer battery life. There’s no denying that the ring is on the pricier side, and you’ll also need to purchase a $6 monthly (or $60 yearly) membership to take full advantage of its features. But again, it’s an investment, and for many it pays off: “While I could technically just listen to my body and act accordingly, I liked being a step ahead of the game and really leaning more into rest and self-care when needed,” she says.

Good earbuds should feel like comfy underwear—so reliable you’ll forget you have them on. The Studio Buds+ from Beats accomplish just that, with a secure fit and an impressive 36 hours of listening time. “I can spin around or jump up and down, and those suckers are glued in,” our tester says. “They are small enough to be discreet and have amazing sound quality.” We’re also fans of their effective transparency and noise-cancellation modes, which allow you to hear your surroundings—or block everything out entirely—while enjoying a playlist or
podcast
.

As the name implies, open-ear headphones go
around
your ears (not in them), so you can stay fully tuned into your environment without sacrificing your 2007 Britney jam session. This pair from Shokz stays put when you start to pick up the pace, is super lightweight, and is water-resistant, meaning it can withstand sweaty workouts and sudden drizzles. You also get up to 10 hours of listening time and phone calls on a full battery. If you need them in a pinch, enjoy 1.5 hours of battery life after just five minutes of charging.

If over-the-ear headphones are more your thing, we think it doesn’t get much better than Apple’s AirPods Max. “I’ve had them for about a year, and I use them every day,” our tester said. “They feel really snug and secure on my head.” The large foam cushions on each side aren’t just for comfort—they block out noisy distractions to help you focus on your workout. These also have transparency and noise-cancellation settings, plus up to 20 hours of battery life on a single charge. And at just over 13 ounces, they won’t weigh you down while you’re on the run or at the gym.

Recovery
Best Foam Roller: Lululemon Double Roller
Courtesy of brand
Lululemon
Double Roller
$64
Lululemon
Foam-rolling doesn’t just feel great—it can also help your muscles recover after a tough workout and boost circulation, as SELF has
previously reported
. Our tester loves this roller from Lululemon for its two-in-one design: Use both pieces together to target large areas, or pull the firmer corkscrew-shaped core out to release deep knots. “This is my go-to recovery tool. I use it more often than my Theragun,” she says. “I have yet to find a muscle it can’t reach and relax.” It also looks pretty enough to leave hanging out in your dedicated home workout corner—no storage required, she adds.

One tester picked up this buzzy roller after her physical therapist recommended it: “It’s super firm
and
it vibrates, which has really helped me get those pressure points,” she says. The surface is textured to help
soothe sore muscles
, and you can choose from four vibration speeds to find the combo that offers the most relief. It comes with a charging cable, a handy carrying bag, and three mini resistance bands to help you warm up before each session.

The Theragun Mini first won a Home Fitness Award in 2022. This year it’s back with a smaller, lighter design that has one tester reaching for it on the regular. “The device makes it easy to work on stubborn tight or achy areas while you’re just sitting around,” she says. “No need to get on the floor and fight with a foam roller (which, let’s be honest, you’re not always in the mood to do).” The chunky, triangular handle helps you get a good grip, while the three included attachment heads are designed to tackle most muscle groups.

When you’re wearing lackluster footwear, everything else gets that much harder. Runs feel like a drag; walks become tedious; and workouts can get utterly pointless. On the other hand, a truly great pair of sneakers can take your everyday activities to the next level: They can help you feel lighter and springier, sync you up with your movement, and even inspire you to take up a new hobby altogether. And those are the types of shoes we set out to find for SELF’s annual Sneaker Awards.
Over the course of our monthlong testing period, SELF staffers slipped on nominated pairs for jogs, cardio dance classes, rugged hikes, races, dog walks, weightlifting sessions, and more of our favorite activities. We also tapped fellow movement lovers from outside our brand to really put the shoes through their paces. All in all, the testing pool included marathoners, city planners, new parents, National Park service rangers, med students, manufacturing workers, engineers, teachers, and outdoor influencers—just to name a few.
We tested shoes designed for running, walking, strength training, and hiking, as well as pairs with highly specialized features for sports like cycling and racing, and, for the very first time, tennis and pickleball. So however you like to exercise, experience nature, or just get from point A to point B on foot, there’s a shoe to suit your preferences. Below, learn more about how we selected the winners of the 2024 SELF Sneaker Awards, read our reviews, and pick your next pair.

How We Picked the Winners
This year, 50 brands submitted 167 styles—a record-setting number for our annual Sneaker Awards. We ultimately tested 157 models, including 14 pairs that SELF editors recommended from their own personal experience. Each shoe was rated on a scale from 1 to 10 and graded using a range of criteria including fit, shape, feel, and style. Trail shoes were also evaluated for traction, ankle support, and other key hiking-specific features. We chose winners that not only performed well for their intended activity, but also suited our testers’ feet, held up under multiple wears, and, as a nice little bonus, looked good too. (To read more about our testing process, see
Here’s How We Picked the Winners of SELF’s 2024 Sneaker Awards

At the end of our rigorous testing process,

Running
Best Do-It-All Running Shoe: Nike Pegasus 41
Nike
Nike
Pegasus 41
$140
Nike
$140
DICK’S Sporting Goods
What it does:
The ever popular Pegasus is back with less weight and increased airflow through the upper (a bonus for those of us who were blessed with
sweaty feet
). It has a balanced amount of cushioning (not too stiff; not too firm) and additional padding around the opening of the shoe, so you can stay comfy on medium-length runs and shorter efforts.
Who it’s for:
All experience levels; runners who want a single shoe that feels just as good on easy miles as it does for intervals and harder workouts.
How we tested:
Our testers took their Pegasuses on road and treadmill runs that lasted between 3.5 and about 6 miles, at varying speeds and intensities, including some fast interval work.
One tester said:
“On the treadmill, these shoes felt nimble and supportive. I also used them for some sprints—this is where they felt PERFECT. They were responsive, snappy, grippy, and snug enough that I didn’t need to think about whether or not my foot was steady when I pushed my pace. Overall, I love these shoes and would wear them regularly for workouts, treadmill runs, and medium-length outdoor runs.”
Best Everyday Running Shoe: Adidas Supernova Rise
Adidas
Adidas
Supernova Rise Shoes
$140

Adidas
$140
Marathon Sports
What it does:
Whether you’re a newbie looking for an introductory shoe or a more experienced runner who needs a workhorse for their everyday miles, you’ll almost definitely find something to like about the Supernova Rise. It’s highly cushioned and made with firm foam rods in the outsole to provide additional support—one tester reported zero lower-leg soreness the day after her test runs.
Who it’s for:
Runners who prioritize comfort and stability during their go-to workouts.
How we tested:
Our director of fitness and food wore the
Supernova Rise
for several road runs ranging from 4 to 10 miles when it came out last winter.
One tester said:
“I really enjoyed these as a great everyday trainer, and I think they’d be a solid choice for a beginner runner looking for comfortable everyday miles—with the opportunity to pick up the pace a little if they so desire.”
Best for Recovery and Easy Runs: Brooks Glycerin 21
Brooks
Brooks
Glycerin 21
$160
Amazon
$160
Zappos
$160
Brooks Running
What it does:
Outfitted with pillow-soft cushioning and a wide, stable outsole, the Glycerin 21 may seem like a whole lot of shoe—but our testers agree that it doesn’t feel clunky once it’s on your foot. Instead, it allows you to keep a steady stride and enjoy your runs at a leisurely pace.
Who it’s for:
New and experienced runners who need a cushy, stable shoe for easier speeds. (And those looking for a ride with even more support, there’s the
Glycerin GTS 21
version, which is designed to prevent your feet from rolling inward as you run.)
How we tested:
On road and mixed-terrain runs lasting between 4.5 and 7 miles, as well as 30-minute beginner runs around the neighborhood.
One tester said:
“These sneakers are very cushioned and have a nice rocker feel that guides me through my stride. For as comfy as they are, they don’t feel too heavy—they’re definitely not as springy and responsive as racing shoes, but they don’t feel like they’re slowing me down. I will definitely keep these in the rotation for easy runs and recovery runs.”
Best Max Cushion Running Shoe: On Cloudmonster Hyper
On
On

Chevron

Cloudmonster Hyper
$220

Fit2run
$220
Fleet Feet
What it does:
This plush sneaker is made to buoy and propel every step with On’s maximum amount of foam and a forward-rolling sole. It defies the stereotype of a maximalist shoe with its surprisingly lightweight construction, but still has a chunky-soled, high-stack height design that fans will love.
Who it’s for:
Runners and walkers who enjoy the blunted impact of high cushioning, want to feel like they have marshmallows under their feet at all times, and hope to look good doing it. (Our testers noted this shoe was stylish enough to wear with everyday outfits!)
How we tested:
On road runs up to 5 miles in length; long walks on a visit to Korea; a 3.4-mile hike on Mackinac Island, Michigan.
One tester said:
“This shoe says it has max cushioning for an On, and it really felt like it. On’s sneakers are usually too firm for me, but this actually felt perfect. So much so that I wear these on my walks, to the office, pretty much everywhere I go. Even without insoles, my high arches felt supported and comfortable throughout hour-long runs. My feet didn’t hurt, they felt secure as I ran, and I didn’t twist my ankle (which happens with some higher platform sneakers).”
Best for Runs and Walks: Under Armour Infinite Elite

Shock absorption is the name of the game with Under Armour’s Infinite Elite sneaker: It has a springy foam midsole to help your feet rebound easily upon impact, and its thick platform looks trendy and helps your feet feel fresh over long distances (without making the shoe feel unwieldy).
Who it’s for:
Everyday runners, as well as anyone who logs a ton of time walking on pavement.
How we tested:
On 5K treadmill and road runs, and walks of about 20,000 steps around New York City.
One tester said:
“I love wearing these to work, to coffee, or with any casual streetwear or athleisure clothing. Even if I wasn’t a runner, I would probably want to own these just to walk around in. The impact absorption, thick soles, and the overall style of this shoe is unbeatable.”
Best for Long Runs: Hoka Skyward X
Hoka
Hoka
Skyward X
$225
Zappos

Public Lands
$225
Hoka
What it does:
These seriously high shoes (their stack clocks in at 48 millimeters high) have foam for days, but don’t feel particularly smooshy or squishy. They have a surprisingly smooth, steady ride that our tester appreciated when her miles passed the double-digit mark. If you’re looking for speed, just be aware that these super-trainers are a bit too heavy for faster efforts.
Who it’s for:
Runners who want to log long miles at a steady pace, or anyone who just loves a high-stack, ultra-foam sneaker to make each step a little more comfy.
How we tested:
When the
Skyward X
launched, our lifestyle writer wore hers on a number of training runs leading up to a half marathon, including a 10-miler.
One tester said:
“Over time, I came to realize that the extra cushion wasn’t just for show: It blunted the impact of each step to make the experience pain- and ache-free (a real lifesaver when I’d be pounding the pavement for nearly two hours).”
Best for Racing: Asics MetaSpeed Sky Paris
Asics
Asics

Asics
$250
Fleet Feet
What it does:
The Metaspeed Sky Paris has one of Asics’ lightest builds (for greater speed), tons of springy cushioning (for impact absorption), and a carbon plate (for smooth propulsion). This combo amounts to an impressively nimble race shoe that helps you increase your speed without sacrificing comfort.
Who it’s for:
Anyone gearing up for a big race—and a PR.
How we tested:
On runs up to nine miles around the neighborhood; the Chicago Lakefront Trail, which consists of a combination of concrete, blacktop, and packed dirt; and on track workouts with short (and fast) intervals.
One tester said:
“These sneakers are super bouncy and fast! They feel light, comfortable, and definitely like they’re powering me forward—like an extension of my foot, but one that makes me springier and speedier. They were equally fun on the pavement and on the track.”
Best for Racing Shorter Distances: Puma Deviate Nitro Elite 3
Puma
Puma
Deviate Nitro Elite 3
$230
Puma
What it does:
Puma made the carbon-plated Deviate Nitro Elite even lighter this time around and added to the shoe’s foam stack, all in the name of faster speeds and lower wearer effort. Based on its fit and feel, one tester deemed it an excellent pick for races up to a half-marathon in length.
Who it’s for:
Experienced runners who want to avoid leg fatigue and sail over short racing distances.
How we tested:
For 45–60-minute training runs on pavement outdoors and indoors on the treadmill.
One tester said:
“The shoe is cushioned, but you feel a pop! It really helps your legs feel less tired if you are running fast or long. It provides great energy return and ultimately felt like I was doing less work with the same results. Even with its padding, I felt connected to the ground.”
Best Splurge for Racing: Nike Alphafly 3
Nike
Nike
Alphafly 3
$285
Nike
$285
Road Runner Sports
$285
DICK’S Sporting Goods
What it does:
Just one look and you’ll know Nike pulled out all the stops for this super-shoe: With a carbon plate, dual Air Zoom pods, and a foam-packed midsole, the latest iteration of the Alphafly line takes an
already fast shoe
and makes it even speedier. This extremely intentional design comes with the highest price tag of all our winners (clocking in at $285 per pair), but it’s worth it for serious, committed runners with specific time goals.
Who it’s for:
Big fans of super-shoes; serious runners who don’t mind spending a little more money on a racing pair.
How we tested:
When the
Alphafly 3 made its debut in January
, our director of fitness and food tested her pair on a 5.5-mile run with a fast 5K in the middle on a hilly neighborhood route. She also wore them for a handful of tempo (and faster) runs closer to this year’s Sneaker Awards.
One tester said:
“These shoes are super light, super cushioned, and super high (the stackheight and foam underfoot are legit). They’re also really, really fast. As soon as I picked up the pace from warm-up to speedwork, I immediately felt the bounce and push forward with each step. The shoes were so fast that it made hard workouts fun.”
Best Trail-Running Shoe: Altra Experience Wild
Altra
Altra
Experience Wild
$145
Zappos
$145
$101
REI
$145
Backcountry
What it does:
Our testers noticed right away how comfortable the Experience Wild felt—well-cushioned and like they arrived already broken in. At the same time, they felt in-tune with the ground: They could feel and grip the uneven terrain easily. This shoe has a roomy forefoot, so your toes can spread and splay naturally while you run, and a secure, fitted midsole. (One tester noted how little her foot shifted while wearing her Altras.)
Who it’s for:
Seasoned off-road runners who want a durable sneaker they can wear on all kinds of trails.
How we tested:
On a variety of terrains, including rocky hills, flat dirt paths, sand, and muddy trails. Our testers wore them for trail runs, two-hour-long hikes, and 12-hour days exploring Rocky Mountain National Park in Colorado.
One tester said:
“This shoe allowed me to feel in touch with the ground. I was able to trust my feet as I navigated rugged terrain. It also functioned well in mud and over rocks. The ankle support allowed me to feel comfortable going off trail. The grip was unbelievable. I really put these shoes through the wringer and am absolutely in love with them.”
Best for Beginner Trail Runners: Lululemon Beyondfeel Trail
Lululemon
Lululemon
Beyondfeel Trail Running Shoe
$168
Lululemon
What it does:
Lululemon’s road-to-trail shoe is comfy right out of the box, grippy, and approachable to newcomers—one of our testers said it felt like a regular running shoe, as opposed to a burly trail sneaker that some beginners might find excessive or intimidating. The Beyondfeel Trail wouldn’t look out of place if you wore it from the trail into town, but it’s technically capable too. Our testers were specifically impressed with its performance on grass, gravel, and rocks.
Who it’s for:
Trail running newcomers who are getting comfortable on light-to-moderate terrain.
How we tested:
On hour-long gravel runs and a three-hour birding walk on New York City park trails.
One tester said:
“They're extremely comfy upon first wear—very cushioned, bouncy, and lightweight—all while feeling really supportive! I felt like I could do so many different movements in these (walking, treading uphill, stepping up onto rocks) without any pain. Very impressed with the instant comfort!”

Amazon

Zappos
$140
Reebok
What it does:
We gave the previous iteration of this cross trainer (the Nano X3) a
Sneaker Award
last year, and—as our director of fitness and food noted in
her initial review of the X4
—this update is full of minor improvements that have a major impact. It fits snugly and securely, which makes the wearer’s movements smoother and more seamless; it provides stability during heavier lifts; and it feels flexible and light throughout your workout.
Who it’s for:
Gymgoers who want to do a little bit of everything during their workouts, from cardio to weightlifting and back again.
How we tested:
Our testers attended 45-minute HIIT classes, did full-body strength training sessions, and ran up to one mile in their Nano X4s.
One tester said:
“I LOVE these cross-training sneakers because they have a nice balance between cushioning and security—they’re comfy, but I feel grounded and stable when I do squats, deadlifts, etc. They’re not bouncy enough for more dynamic, high-impact moves (like dancing or boxing), but they’re my go-to for just about every other type of strength training workout.”
Best for HIIT Classes: Nobull Drive
Nobull
Nobull
Drive Knit
$139
NOBULL
What it does:
Springy enough for cardio but supportive enough for strength training, Nobull’s Drive is perfect for classes that incorporate dynamic moves like burpees and box jumps, as well as ones with free weights. It has a low heel-to-toe drop and high-traction outsole, so you can maintain your footing and move with confidence in all directions.
Who it’s for:
HIIT fanatics and anyone who prefers a springier gym shoe.
How we tested:
For gym commutes through the neighborhood, several 60-minute
Bolt Fitness
HIIT classes, and casual hangouts and errands runs.
One tester said:
“Once the shoe is on (you’ve really got to tug it by the heel loop to get your foot in), it is SO COMFORTABLE! There’s so much cushion under my feet, but it doesn’t feel bulky or like I’m walking on giant platforms. It’s super lightweight, and after multiple wears I had no blisters, random pains, or shin splints.”
Best Shoe for Heavy Lifting: Puma Fuse 3.0
Puma
Puma
Fuse 3.0
$120
Puma
What it does:
The Fuse 3.0 provides a flat, firm, stable base that allows you to feel the ground beneath you and push through your foot while training. It’s pretty stiff (you wouldn’t want to wear it to a HIIT class), but flexible enough that you can bend your foot when you’re doing lunges.
Who it’s for:
Weightlifters who want a dedicated shoe for major efforts at the gym.
How we tested:
For a variety of strength training sessions ranging from 30 minutes to one hour in length. Some of them were full-body, while others worked the upper- or lower-body specifically.
One tester said:
“I am surprised how much I liked these shoes. They’re the perfect fit, which means I don’t have to think about them when I’m lifting or worry about readjusting between sets. The flat bottom helps me stay stable and really push through the ground for my bigger lifts, especially deadlifts, where you definitely don’t want any wobble. They’re firm, but not so firm that they hurt or make your feet tired.”
Best Indoor Cycling Shoe: Tiem Slipstream
Tiem
Tiem
Slipstream
$135
Zappos
$135
REI
What it does:
This is not the first time Tiem’s Slipstream has won a
Sneaker Award
, and we’re hardly surprised that it brought home another one. It has a soft, stretchy upper, but a rigid sole that doesn’t bend or buckle as you cycle. It fits extremely well and holds your heel in place, which makes it easier to pull and stroke your feet without worrying about your shoes flying off. Just be aware that it doesn’t come with
SPD cleats
, and our testers found it a little tricky to get them to fit onto the sole of the shoe. It also comes in a variety of colors, but the cute burgundy shade we tested is currently sold out in most sizes.
Who it’s for:
Dedicated indoor cyclists; any cycling enthusiast who thinks most cycling shoes feel too clunky.
How we tested:
Several indoor studio cycling classes.
One tester said:
“This shoe is VERY comfortable. The upper is plush, which made me assume that it wouldn't be the most breathable. But I tested it out on a 90-degree day when the studio was STEAMY, and my feet never felt too hot. It truly did feel like an extension of my foot, and its heel cup was nice and narrow so my foot never slipped.”
Best Pickleball Shoe: K-Swiss Pickleball Supreme

Amazon
$125
DSW
$130
K-Swiss
What it does:
You certainly
can
wear most everyday sneakers for pickleball, but a specialized shoe, like K-Swiss’s Pickleball Supreme, which has a plush yet responsive feel and a grippy outsole, will level up your game. These features make it easier to move laterally and keep your footing on the court so you can keep your head in the game.
Who it’s for:
Pickleball players who are ready for a footwear upgrade.
How we tested:
During five one-to-two-hour games on a hard tennis court.
One tester said:
“This shoe has a perfect balance of cushion and support for someone playing pickleball. I felt like I had good grip and control over my footwork while playing and also did not suffer from sore or tired feet afterward. The shoes did not require any time to break in; I felt like I found a comfortable rhythm almost immediately.”
Best Shoe for Tennis: Asics Solution Speed FF 3

$135
Zappos
What it does:
This flexible tennis shoe is great for players who move all over the court and need to stay light on their feet. Its sole is made from durable rubber that provides plenty of traction, while its upper is lightweight and breathable—if you want to up your agility game, the Solution Speed FF 3 was built for you.
Who it’s for:
Tennis players who want an all-court shoe that won’t slow them down.
How we tested:
During tennis games and practices on hard indoor courts and clay outdoor courts, totalling about eight hours.
One tester said:
“The shoe feels cushioned and supported at all points. The sides were especially supportive, which is necessary with the constant lateral movement while playing. These shoes were so great that, when I first played in them, I hardly noticed I switched shoes from my normal tennis sneaks!”

Veja
What it does:
Finding a shoe that performs well and looks good is no easy feat, but the Veja Impala strikes that balance. It has a firmer feel that helped our testers feel grounded and nimble during their upbeat cardio classes, and comes in 11 cute, pastel-centric colorways that wouldn’t look out of place with your post-workout jeans or dresses.
Who it’s for:
Gymgoers who meet up with friends or go straight to work after class; anyone who prefers to live their life in sneakers.
How we tested:
Our testers tried out the Impala during 55-minute dance cardio classes, 45-minute HIIT classes that incorporated a Bosu ball, and long walks around Brooklyn.
One tester said:
“I felt like I was totally in touch with the ground and able to pivot easily (without having to lug the shoes along). The flexibility of these shoes was also nice: I could bend them and pop off the balls of my feet easily for dance sequences without having to break them in. I’d totally wear them after any dance cardio class, out to brunch, and shopping during the day.”

Famous Footwear
What it does:
When you’re upright for hours at a time, you’re probably pretty busy—and your feet are the last things you should have to think about. Enter this blissfully easy-to-wear sneaker from Dr. Scholl’s. We didn’t notice any chafing, blisters, or pressure points when we put it to the test for days at a time.
Who it’s for:
Anyone who needs to stand for extended periods of time, whether they’re working long shifts at work, attending a music festival, or sightseeing in a new city.
How we tested:
On days spent going to work, walking around New York City, and strolling through the park—logging up to 25,000 steps in the process.
One tester said:
“The shoe is lightweight and comfortable—I could easily be up on my feet all day with no pain or discomfort. I would recommend these to a health care worker or someone looking for something plain and not too showy to walk in. These are a comfortable choice and really do feel incredible, even after wearing them all day.”
Best Bopping Around Town All Day Shoe: Lululemon Cityverse
Lululemon
Lululemon
Cityverse
$138
Lululemon
What it does:
Comfy, casual, and classic, the Cityverse is a simple sneak you can wear every day without getting tired of it. It has a very comfortable, balanced feel that’s great for walking long distances and a streamlined look that pairs nicely with most outfits (“Anytime I wear these, I get compliments,” said one of our testers).
Who it’s for:
Athleisure enthusiasts; hot girl walkers keeping the trend alive; anyone with a big trip coming up.
How we tested:
We wore these everywhere and for all kinds of activities, including vacation strolls, dog walks, meetups with friends, and day-long outings.
One tester said:
“These are the most comfortable athleisure shoes I’ve ever worn, and I’ve purchased a lot of different models. Somehow Lululemon made cool sneakers that feel just like super-cushiony running shoes. My feet are just so happy when I wear them!”
Best Comfy High-Top: Converse Weapon
Converse
Converse
Weapon Leather
$120
Converse
What it does:
We love when a sneaker simultaneously nails form and function, so naturally we adore the Converse Weapon. It’s supportive through the foot and ankle, very comfortable, and, frankly, pretty darn cool. It has a retro look that still feels fresh, and, unlike other fashion-driven sneakers, is anything but flimsy (check out that thick sole!).
Who it’s for:
Anyone who’s equally interested in street style and staying comfy.
How we tested:
While strolling city sidewalks for hours at a time and playing games of racquetball and pickleball.
One tester said:
“These were super stylish and fit like a glove! They’re similar to Jordans, but much less expensive and more accessible. I wore them to an MLB game, and my date commented on how cool he thought my shoes were.”
Comfiest Athleisure Sneaker: Allbirds Wool Runner 2
Allbirds
Allbirds
Wool Runner 2
$110
$77
Allbirds
What it does:
This sleek, everyday sneaker shines thanks to its main material, merino wool, which is naturally sweat-wicking, temperature-regulating, and, of course, incredibly soft. Your feet should feel cozy yet cool in the Wool Runner 2, which is a major bonus if you stick with sneakers well into the colder months of the year. And if your pair starts to look a little dingy, it can go straight in the washing machine and emerge good as new.
Who it’s for:
Anyone who lives in sneakers and needs a comfy new staple that they can wear year-round.
How we tested:
On neighborhood walks, e-bike rides, and coffee shop hangouts.
One tester said:
“These are probably the most comfortable non-running shoes I’ve ever worn—I felt like I could walk for hours in them if I needed to, and they worked fine on the e-bike too (my feet didn’t slip off the pedals or anything). They’re so cushy and supportive and also didn’t interfere with my stride; my toes could bend in the right place and my feet could move naturally.”
Best Old-School Cool Athleisure Shoe: Puma Easy Rider

Puma
$90
$77
Amazon
What it does:
Looking for the next Samba, Cortez, or Gazelle? We’re putting our money on Puma’s Easy Rider, a vintage design that debuted in the late ’70s. It has a similarly old-school, sporty-chic look to those aforementioned shoes of the moment, plus a seriously grippy sole and a supportive, slightly bouncy feel. One thing to note is they run narrow, according to our tester, so consider sizing up if you have wider feet.
Who it’s for:
Sneaker fans who want to stay ahead of the trends; OG
Sporty & Rich
followers.
How we tested:
Running errands around New York City, morning dog walks, and doing light chores.
One tester said:
“They feel very supportive and give you a little push while you walk, and they have a nice rounded bottom on the front of the shoe. These shoes are definitely cute—I even got a few compliments on them while I was out. I wore them with denim shorts and a white tee, and they really elevated an otherwise plain outfit with a pop of color. They’d be great for wearing out to brunch or while out shopping.”
Best Velcroed Athleisure Shoe: Cole Haan GrandPro Topspin Triple Strap
Cole Haan
Cole Haan
GrandPrø Topspin Triple Strap Sneakers
$160
Zappos
$160
Nordstrom
What it does:
Let this model from Cole Haan remind us that basic needn’t mean boring. It stands out from the (incredibly vast) pool of everyday sneakers with its trio of Velcro straps, thick base, and superclean colorways. It skews firm rather than plush, but it’s perfect for days at the office, casual shopping trips, or summer get-togethers.
Who it’s for:
Anyone who doesn’t want to mess with dangly laces; people who want a stylish sneaker they can wear for casual pursuits.
How we tested:
For hours at time while doing office work, hanging out with friends, walking the dog, and running errands.
One tester said:
“They’re sleek, modern, and look great on my feet. I think they’re very classy and perfect for when you want to look more polished (say, for dinner, brunch, etc.). I love all of the color options and textures (canvas, terrycloth…the seasonal options are to die for!). If I saw someone wearing these I’d definitely ask them where they bought them!”
Best Everyday Walking Shoe: Ryka Devotion X Max

$90
DSW
What it does:
Let’s welcome the newest member of the maximalist pack: Ryka’s Devotion X Max has all the features we look for in a highly cushioned walking shoe (a thick sole, extra padding, and support in the heel), but it’s sturdy enough that it won’t feel squishy or unsupportive.
Who it’s for:
Anyone searching for that walking-on-clouds feeling in their sneakers—especially those with higher arches.
How we tested:
Shorter (5 to 15 minutes), longer (over an hour), and
very
long (all day!) walks in these sneakers.
One tester said:
“These sneakers are incredibly soft and cushioned—the foam midsole and outsole feel very bouncy, and the arch is perfectly positioned. I often have issues with achy arches due to a lack of support, but these sneakers were clearly made for the high-arched crew! They’re lightweight and didn’t cause any pain, blisters, or other discomfort. I love these so much that I had my mom try them on, and she instantly wanted to steal them!”
Best No-Tie Supportive Shoe: Under Armour SlipSpeed Mega
Under Armour
Under Armour
UA SlipSpeed Mega Running Shoes
$140
DICK’S Sporting Goods
$140
Under Armour
What it does:
This chunky-soled sneaker borrows some features from outdoor footwear (including BOA closure system, lightly lugged sole, and ripstop material), but you can confidently wear it everywhere. It absorbs impact when you walk on pavement and cobblestones, it’s light enough for all-day wear, and it supports your arch and ankle without feeling obtrusive.
Who it’s for:
Commuters; dog walkers; those who prefer a slip-on shoe; anyone who wants to dip a toe into gorpcore dressing.
How we tested:
On day-long jaunts around New York City; errand runs on Long Island; and everyday dog walks.
One tester said:
“These shoes are SO, SO comfortable and amazingly lightweight. My whole foot and ankle felt secure and supported, and there was a ton of cushion beneath my feet. No blisters or pressure points!”

What it does:
Podiatrists love (and frequently recommend) Vionic’s highly supportive shoes because they’re made to keep your feet happy in the long-term. With its durable design, water-repellent exterior, and lightweight cushioning, the brand’s new Walk Max sneaker has everything you possibly need from a walking shoe that’ll stand the test of time.
Who it’s for:
Dedicated walkers who put their shoes through the wringer; people who find most walking shoes lacking in support.
How we tested:
On morning walks and errands runs, while doing yard work and cleaning up around the house.
One tester said:
“The extra stability in the heel area felt really supportive, especially when I was walking downhill. Its sole is nice and thick, and there’s just enough arch support. These will be worn for many years!”

Merrell
Moab Speed 2 X Sweaty Betty
$140
Zappos
$140
Nordstrom
$140
$107
Amazon
What it does:
This limited-edition version of Merrell’s beloved Moab trail shoe has added protection around the heel and toe, four-millimeter lugs for good traction, and lots of padding through the insole and around the collar. With all of those performance-driven bona fides, it doesn’t need to be as cute as it is—and yet! Our tester loved their look as soon as she opened the box.
Who it’s for:
Day hikers taking on easy-to-moderate terrain; fans of outdoor style in general; anyone who thrills at the idea of
a women’s hiking shoe that isn’t teal
.
How we tested:
For four straight days on a birding trip in Cape May, hiking around state forests, local conservancy areas, beaches, and meadows.
One tester said:
“They were so comfortable and breathable in all environments. My feet felt cushioned and supported, but the shoes were still lightweight and easy to slip on. I didn’t think about them much at all, actually! And I didn’t get any blisters, pain, or discomfort.”
Best Hiking Boot: Forsake Wild Sky High
Forsake
Forsake
Wild Sky High
$145
REI
$145
$102
Zappos
What it does:
If you’re opting for a hiking boot over a trail shoe, ankle support is probably among your top priorities. And that’s what makes Forsake’s Wild Sky High model such a fantastic option for hikers of all levels: Our testers wore their pairs all over the US, and no matter the terrain their feet and ankles felt secure, protected, and comfortable (with no blisters to speak of!).
Who it’s for:
Hikers who regularly take on varied terrain, like a firm and durable boot, or want reliable ankle support.
How we tested:
Hiking in a variety of outdoor settings, including mountainous terrain in Colorado and Northern Arizona, rocky desert paths, and Northeastern woodland trails (including Devil’s Den in Fairfield County, Connecticut), for excursions lasting between 30 minutes and four hours.
One tester said:
“As a hiking boot, this shoe is made for a range of natural surfaces, including rock, dirt, grass, gravel, mulch, and wood chips. The sole is thick and sturdy enough that I never had an issue with traction or felt like I was losing my grip. I was always able to grasp the trail easily with my foot.”
Best Camping Shoe: Crocs Echo Storm
Crocs
Crocs
Echo Storm
$100
Crocs
What it does:
After a long day on the trail, no one wants to wear their heavy, muddy hiking boots around camp—they want something cushy yet capable to slip into, like Crocs’s cool Echo Storm. It’s easy to pull on (the upper is made from super-stretchy neoprene), well-ventilated, and laden with the brand’s signature foam throughout the sole.
Who it’s for:
Campers who want a comfy alternative to their technical outdoor footwear; Crocs collectors; anyone who needs an easy, comfy shoe to throw on at a moment’s notice.
How we tested:
On a long weekend camping trip with rocky dirt paths around the campsite.
One tester said:
“This is a perfect shoe for camping. I didn’t feel the rocks under my feet most of the time, and when I
did
stumble, my toes still felt secure. I’d wear them anywhere— they’re trendy without trying too hard and simply the perfect Croc.”

When you’re wearing lackluster footwear, everything else gets that much harder. Runs feel like a drag; walks become tedious; and workouts can get utterly pointless. On the other hand, a truly great pair of sneakers can take your everyday activities to the next level: They can help you feel lighter and springier, sync you up with your movement, and even inspire you to take up a new hobby altogether. And those are the types of shoes we set out to find for SELF’s annual Sneaker Awards.
Over the course of our monthlong testing period, SELF staffers slipped on nominated pairs for jogs, cardio dance classes, rugged hikes, races, dog walks, weightlifting sessions, and more of our favorite activities. We also tapped fellow movement lovers from outside our brand to really put the shoes through their paces. All in all, the testing pool included marathoners, city planners, new parents, National Park service rangers, med students, manufacturing workers, engineers, teachers, and outdoor influencers—just to name a few.
We tested shoes designed for running, walking, strength training, and hiking, as well as pairs with highly specialized features for sports like cycling and racing, and, for the very first time, tennis and pickleball. So however you like to exercise, experience nature, or just get from point A to point B on foot, there’s a shoe to suit your preferences. Below, learn more about how we selected the winners of the 2024 SELF Sneaker Awards, read our reviews, and pick your next pair.

How We Picked the Winners
This year, 50 brands submitted 167 styles—a record-setting number for our annual Sneaker Awards. We ultimately tested 157 models, including 14 pairs that SELF editors recommended from their own personal experience. Each shoe was rated on a scale from 1 to 10 and graded using a range of criteria including fit, shape, feel, and style. Trail shoes were also evaluated for traction, ankle support, and other key hiking-specific features. We chose winners that not only performed well for their intended activity, but also suited our testers’ feet, held up under multiple wears, and, as a nice little bonus, looked good too. (To read more about our testing process, see
Here’s How We Picked the Winners of SELF’s 2024 Sneaker Awards

At the end of our rigorous testing process,
30 winners
came out on top. Check them out below for all your running, walking, hiking, cycling, lifting, and bopping-around-town needs.
Running
Best Do-It-All Running Shoe: Nike Pegasus 41
Nike
Nike
Pegasus 41
$140
Nike
$140
DICK’S Sporting Goods
What it does:
The ever popular Pegasus is back with less weight and increased airflow through the upper (a bonus for those of us who were blessed with
sweaty feet
). It has a balanced amount of cushioning (not too stiff; not too firm) and additional padding around the opening of the shoe, so you can stay comfy on medium-length runs and shorter efforts.
Who it’s for:
All experience levels; runners who want a single shoe that feels just as good on easy miles as it does for intervals and harder workouts.
How we tested:
Our testers took their Pegasuses on road and treadmill runs that lasted between 3.5 and about 6 miles, at varying speeds and intensities, including some fast interval work.
One tester said:
“On the treadmill, these shoes felt nimble and supportive. I also used them for some sprints—this is where they felt PERFECT. They were responsive, snappy, grippy, and snug enough that I didn’t need to think about whether or not my foot was steady when I pushed my pace. Overall, I love these shoes and would wear them regularly for workouts, treadmill runs, and medium-length outdoor runs.”
Best Everyday Running Shoe: Adidas Supernova Rise
Adidas
Adidas
Supernova Rise Shoes
$140
$76
Amazon
$140
$98
Adidas
$140
Marathon Sports
What it does:
Whether you’re a newbie looking for an introductory shoe or a more experienced runner who needs a workhorse for their everyday miles, you’ll almost definitely find something to like about the Supernova Rise. It’s highly cushioned and made with firm foam rods in the outsole to provide additional support—one tester reported zero lower-leg soreness the day after her test runs.
Who it’s for:
Runners who prioritize comfort and stability during their go-to workouts.
How we tested:
Our director of fitness and food wore the
Supernova Rise
for several road runs ranging from 4 to 10 miles when it came out last winter.
One tester said:
“I really enjoyed these as a great everyday trainer, and I think they’d be a solid choice for a beginner runner looking for comfortable everyday miles—with the opportunity to pick up the pace a little if they so desire.”
Best for Recovery and Easy Runs: Brooks Glycerin 21
Brooks
Brooks
Glycerin 21
$160
Amazon
$160
Zappos
$160
Brooks Running
What it does:
Outfitted with pillow-soft cushioning and a wide, stable outsole, the Glycerin 21 may seem like a whole lot of shoe—but our testers agree that it doesn’t feel clunky once it’s on your foot. Instead, it allows you to keep a steady stride and enjoy your runs at a leisurely pace.
Who it’s for:
New and experienced runners who need a cushy, stable shoe for easier speeds. (And those looking for a ride with even more support, there’s the
Glycerin GTS 21
version, which is designed to prevent your feet from rolling inward as you run.)
How we tested:
On road and mixed-terrain runs lasting between 4.5 and 7 miles, as well as 30-minute beginner runs around the neighborhood.
One tester said:
“These sneakers are very cushioned and have a nice rocker feel that guides me through my stride. For as comfy as they are, they don’t feel too heavy—they’re definitely not as springy and responsive as racing shoes, but they don’t feel like they’re slowing me down. I will definitely keep these in the rotation for easy runs and recovery runs.”
Best Max Cushion Running Shoe: On Cloudmonster Hyper
On
On
On
Chevron
Chevron
On
Cloudmonster Hyper
$220
On
$220
Fit2run
$220
Fleet Feet
What it does:
This plush sneaker is made to buoy and propel every step with On’s maximum amount of foam and a forward-rolling sole. It defies the stereotype of a maximalist shoe with its surprisingly lightweight construction, but still has a chunky-soled, high-stack height design that fans will love.
Who it’s for:
Runners and walkers who enjoy the blunted impact of high cushioning, want to feel like they have marshmallows under their feet at all times, and hope to look good doing it. (Our testers noted this shoe was stylish enough to wear with everyday outfits!)
How we tested:
On road runs up to 5 miles in length; long walks on a visit to Korea; a 3.4-mile hike on Mackinac Island, Michigan.
One tester said:
“This shoe says it has max cushioning for an On, and it really felt like it. On’s sneakers are usually too firm for me, but this actually felt perfect. So much so that I wear these on my walks, to the office, pretty much everywhere I go. Even without insoles, my high arches felt supported and comfortable throughout hour-long runs. My feet didn’t hurt, they felt secure as I ran, and I didn’t twist my ankle (which happens with some higher platform sneakers).”
Best for Runs and Walks: Under Armour Infinite Elite
Under Armour
Under Armour
UA Infinite Elite Running Shoes
$160
Under Armour
What it does:
Shock absorption is the name of the game with Under Armour’s Infinite Elite sneaker: It has a springy foam midsole to help your feet rebound easily upon impact, and its thick platform looks trendy and helps your feet feel fresh over long distances (without making the shoe feel unwieldy).
Who it’s for:
Everyday runners, as well as anyone who logs a ton of time walking on pavement.
How we tested:
On 5K treadmill and road runs, and walks of about 20,000 steps around New York City.
One tester said:
“I love wearing these to work, to coffee, or with any casual streetwear or athleisure clothing. Even if I wasn’t a runner, I would probably want to own these just to walk around in. The impact absorption, thick soles, and the overall style of this shoe is unbeatable.”
Best for Long Runs: Hoka Skyward X
Hoka
Hoka
Skyward X
$225
Zappos
$225
Public Lands
$225
Hoka
What it does:
These seriously high shoes (their stack clocks in at 48 millimeters high) have foam for days, but don’t feel particularly smooshy or squishy. They have a surprisingly smooth, steady ride that our tester appreciated when her miles passed the double-digit mark. If you’re looking for speed, just be aware that these super-trainers are a bit too heavy for faster efforts.
Who it’s for:
Runners who want to log long miles at a steady pace, or anyone who just loves a high-stack, ultra-foam sneaker to make each step a little more comfy.
How we tested:
When the
Skyward X
launched, our lifestyle writer wore hers on a number of training runs leading up to a half marathon, including a 10-miler.
One tester said:
“Over time, I came to realize that the extra cushion wasn’t just for show: It blunted the impact of each step to make the experience pain- and ache-free (a real lifesaver when I’d be pounding the pavement for nearly two hours).”
Best for Racing: Asics MetaSpeed Sky Paris
Asics
Asics
Metaspeed Sky Paris
$250
Amazon
$250
Asics
$250
Fleet Feet
What it does:
The Metaspeed Sky Paris has one of Asics’ lightest builds (for greater speed), tons of springy cushioning (for impact absorption), and a carbon plate (for smooth propulsion). This combo amounts to an impressively nimble race shoe that helps you increase your speed without sacrificing comfort.
Who it’s for:
Anyone gearing up for a big race—and a PR.
How we tested:
On runs up to nine miles around the neighborhood; the Chicago Lakefront Trail, which consists of a combination of concrete, blacktop, and packed dirt; and on track workouts with short (and fast) intervals.
One tester said:
“These sneakers are super bouncy and fast! They feel light, comfortable, and definitely like they’re powering me forward—like an extension of my foot, but one that makes me springier and speedier. They were equally fun on the pavement and on the track.”
Best for Racing Shorter Distances: Puma Deviate Nitro Elite 3
Puma
Puma
Deviate Nitro Elite 3
$230
Puma
What it does:
Puma made the carbon-plated Deviate Nitro Elite even lighter this time around and added to the shoe’s foam stack, all in the name of faster speeds and lower wearer effort. Based on its fit and feel, one tester deemed it an excellent pick for races up to a half-marathon in length.
Who it’s for:
Experienced runners who want to avoid leg fatigue and sail over short racing distances.
How we tested:
For 45–60-minute training runs on pavement outdoors and indoors on the treadmill.
One tester said:
“The shoe is cushioned, but you feel a pop! It really helps your legs feel less tired if you are running fast or long. It provides great energy return and ultimately felt like I was doing less work with the same results. Even with its padding, I felt connected to the ground.”
Best Splurge for Racing: Nike Alphafly 3
Nike
Nike
Alphafly 3
$285
Nike
$285
Road Runner Sports
$285
DICK’S Sporting Goods
What it does:
Just one look and you’ll know Nike pulled out all the stops for this super-shoe: With a carbon plate, dual Air Zoom pods, and a foam-packed midsole, the latest iteration of the Alphafly line takes an
already fast shoe
and makes it even speedier. This extremely intentional design comes with the highest price tag of all our winners (clocking in at $285 per pair), but it’s worth it for serious, committed runners with specific time goals.
Who it’s for:
Big fans of super-shoes; serious runners who don’t mind spending a little more money on a racing pair.
How we tested:
When the
Alphafly 3 made its debut in January
, our director of fitness and food tested her pair on a 5.5-mile run with a fast 5K in the middle on a hilly neighborhood route. She also wore them for a handful of tempo (and faster) runs closer to this year’s Sneaker Awards.
One tester said:
“These shoes are super light, super cushioned, and super high (the stackheight and foam underfoot are legit). They’re also really, really fast. As soon as I picked up the pace from warm-up to speedwork, I immediately felt the bounce and push forward with each step. The shoes were so fast that it made hard workouts fun.”
Best Trail-Running Shoe: Altra Experience Wild
Altra
Altra
Experience Wild
$145
Zappos
$145
$101
REI
$145
Backcountry
What it does:
Our testers noticed right away how comfortable the Experience Wild felt—well-cushioned and like they arrived already broken in. At the same time, they felt in-tune with the ground: They could feel and grip the uneven terrain easily. This shoe has a roomy forefoot, so your toes can spread and splay naturally while you run, and a secure, fitted midsole. (One tester noted how little her foot shifted while wearing her Altras.)
Who it’s for:
Seasoned off-road runners who want a durable sneaker they can wear on all kinds of trails.
How we tested:
On a variety of terrains, including rocky hills, flat dirt paths, sand, and muddy trails. Our testers wore them for trail runs, two-hour-long hikes, and 12-hour days exploring Rocky Mountain National Park in Colorado.
One tester said:
“This shoe allowed me to feel in touch with the ground. I was able to trust my feet as I navigated rugged terrain. It also functioned well in mud and over rocks. The ankle support allowed me to feel comfortable going off trail. The grip was unbelievable. I really put these shoes through the wringer and am absolutely in love with them.”
Best for Beginner Trail Runners: Lululemon Beyondfeel Trail
Lululemon
Lululemon
Beyondfeel Trail Running Shoe
$168
Lululemon
What it does:
Lululemon’s road-to-trail shoe is comfy right out of the box, grippy, and approachable to newcomers—one of our testers said it felt like a regular running shoe, as opposed to a burly trail sneaker that some beginners might find excessive or intimidating. The Beyondfeel Trail wouldn’t look out of place if you wore it from the trail into town, but it’s technically capable too. Our testers were specifically impressed with its performance on grass, gravel, and rocks.
Who it’s for:
Trail running newcomers who are getting comfortable on light-to-moderate terrain.
How we tested:
On hour-long gravel runs and a three-hour birding walk on New York City park trails.
One tester said:
“They're extremely comfy upon first wear—very cushioned, bouncy, and lightweight—all while feeling really supportive! I felt like I could do so many different movements in these (walking, treading uphill, stepping up onto rocks) without any pain. Very impressed with the instant comfort!”
Training and Sports
Best General Gym Shoe: Reebok Nano X4
Reebok
Reebok
Nano X4 Training Shoes
$140
$88
Amazon
$150
$140
Zappos
$140
Reebok
What it does:
We gave the previous iteration of this cross trainer (the Nano X3) a
Sneaker Award
last year, and—as our director of fitness and food noted in
her initial review of the X4
—this update is full of minor improvements that have a major impact. It fits snugly and securely, which makes the wearer’s movements smoother and more seamless; it provides stability during heavier lifts; and it feels flexible and light throughout your workout.
Who it’s for:
Gymgoers who want to do a little bit of everything during their workouts, from cardio to weightlifting and back again.
How we tested:
Our testers attended 45-minute HIIT classes, did full-body strength training sessions, and ran up to one mile in their Nano X4s.
One tester said:
“I LOVE these cross-training sneakers because they have a nice balance between cushioning and security—they’re comfy, but I feel grounded and stable when I do squats, deadlifts, etc. They’re not bouncy enough for more dynamic, high-impact moves (like dancing or boxing), but they’re my go-to for just about every other type of strength training workout.”
Best for HIIT Classes: Nobull Drive
Nobull
Nobull
Drive Knit
$139
NOBULL
What it does:
Springy enough for cardio but supportive enough for strength training, Nobull’s Drive is perfect for classes that incorporate dynamic moves like burpees and box jumps, as well as ones with free weights. It has a low heel-to-toe drop and high-traction outsole, so you can maintain your footing and move with confidence in all directions.
Who it’s for:
HIIT fanatics and anyone who prefers a springier gym shoe.
How we tested:
For gym commutes through the neighborhood, several 60-minute
Bolt Fitness
HIIT classes, and casual hangouts and errands runs.
One tester said:
“Once the shoe is on (you’ve really got to tug it by the heel loop to get your foot in), it is SO COMFORTABLE! There’s so much cushion under my feet, but it doesn’t feel bulky or like I’m walking on giant platforms. It’s super lightweight, and after multiple wears I had no blisters, random pains, or shin splints.”
Best Shoe for Heavy Lifting: Puma Fuse 3.0
Puma
Puma
Fuse 3.0
$120
Puma
What it does:
The Fuse 3.0 provides a flat, firm, stable base that allows you to feel the ground beneath you and push through your foot while training. It’s pretty stiff (you wouldn’t want to wear it to a HIIT class), but flexible enough that you can bend your foot when you’re doing lunges.
Who it’s for:
Weightlifters who want a dedicated shoe for major efforts at the gym.
How we tested:
For a variety of strength training sessions ranging from 30 minutes to one hour in length. Some of them were full-body, while others worked the upper- or lower-body specifically.
One tester said:
“I am surprised how much I liked these shoes. They’re the perfect fit, which means I don’t have to think about them when I’m lifting or worry about readjusting between sets. The flat bottom helps me stay stable and really push through the ground for my bigger lifts, especially deadlifts, where you definitely don’t want any wobble. They’re firm, but not so firm that they hurt or make your feet tired.”
Best Indoor Cycling Shoe: Tiem Slipstream
Tiem
Tiem
Slipstream
$135
Zappos
$135
REI
What it does:
This is not the first time Tiem’s Slipstream has won a
Sneaker Award
, and we’re hardly surprised that it brought home another one. It has a soft, stretchy upper, but a rigid sole that doesn’t bend or buckle as you cycle. It fits extremely well and holds your heel in place, which makes it easier to pull and stroke your feet without worrying about your shoes flying off. Just be aware that it doesn’t come with
SPD cleats
, and our testers found it a little tricky to get them to fit onto the sole of the shoe. It also comes in a variety of colors, but the cute burgundy shade we tested is currently sold out in most sizes.
Who it’s for:
Dedicated indoor cyclists; any cycling enthusiast who thinks most cycling shoes feel too clunky.
How we tested:
Several indoor studio cycling classes.
One tester said:
“This shoe is VERY comfortable. The upper is plush, which made me assume that it wouldn't be the most breathable. But I tested it out on a 90-degree day when the studio was STEAMY, and my feet never felt too hot. It truly did feel like an extension of my foot, and its heel cup was nice and narrow so my foot never slipped.”
Best Pickleball Shoe: K-Swiss Pickleball Supreme
K-Swiss
K-Swiss
Pickleball Supreme
$130
$94
Amazon
$125
DSW
$130
K-Swiss
What it does:
You certainly
can
wear most everyday sneakers for pickleball, but a specialized shoe, like K-Swiss’s Pickleball Supreme, which has a plush yet responsive feel and a grippy outsole, will level up your game. These features make it easier to move laterally and keep your footing on the court so you can keep your head in the game.
Who it’s for:
Pickleball players who are ready for a footwear upgrade.
How we tested:
During five one-to-two-hour games on a hard tennis court.
One tester said:
“This shoe has a perfect balance of cushion and support for someone playing pickleball. I felt like I had good grip and control over my footwork while playing and also did not suffer from sore or tired feet afterward. The shoes did not require any time to break in; I felt like I found a comfortable rhythm almost immediately.”
Best Shoe for Tennis: Asics Solution Speed FF 3
Asics
Asics
Solution Speed FF 3
$135
Amazon
$140
$135
Zappos
What it does:
This flexible tennis shoe is great for players who move all over the court and need to stay light on their feet. Its sole is made from durable rubber that provides plenty of traction, while its upper is lightweight and breathable—if you want to up your agility game, the Solution Speed FF 3 was built for you.
Who it’s for:
Tennis players who want an all-court shoe that won’t slow them down.
How we tested:
During tennis games and practices on hard indoor courts and clay outdoor courts, totalling about eight hours.
One tester said:
“The shoe feels cushioned and supported at all points. The sides were especially supportive, which is necessary with the constant lateral movement while playing. These shoes were so great that, when I first played in them, I hardly noticed I switched shoes from my normal tennis sneaks!”

Veja
What it does:
Finding a shoe that performs well and looks good is no easy feat, but the Veja Impala strikes that balance. It has a firmer feel that helped our testers feel grounded and nimble during their upbeat cardio classes, and comes in 11 cute, pastel-centric colorways that wouldn’t look out of place with your post-workout jeans or dresses.
Who it’s for:
Gymgoers who meet up with friends or go straight to work after class; anyone who prefers to live their life in sneakers.
How we tested:
Our testers tried out the Impala during 55-minute dance cardio classes, 45-minute HIIT classes that incorporated a Bosu ball, and long walks around Brooklyn.
One tester said:
“I felt like I was totally in touch with the ground and able to pivot easily (without having to lug the shoes along). The flexibility of these shoes was also nice: I could bend them and pop off the balls of my feet easily for dance sequences without having to break them in. I’d totally wear them after any dance cardio class, out to brunch, and shopping during the day.”
Best Sneaker for People on Their Feet All Day: Dr. Scholl’s Feel Good
Dr. Scholl’s Shoes
Dr. Scholl’s Shoes
Feel Good Lace Up Sneakers
$125
Dr. Scholl’s Shoes
$125
Famous Footwear
What it does:
When you’re upright for hours at a time, you’re probably pretty busy—and your feet are the last things you should have to think about. Enter this blissfully easy-to-wear sneaker from Dr. Scholl’s. We didn’t notice any chafing, blisters, or pressure points when we put it to the test for days at a time.
Who it’s for:
Anyone who needs to stand for extended periods of time, whether they’re working long shifts at work, attending a music festival, or sightseeing in a new city.
How we tested:
On days spent going to work, walking around New York City, and strolling through the park—logging up to 25,000 steps in the process.
One tester said:
“The shoe is lightweight and comfortable—I could easily be up on my feet all day with no pain or discomfort. I would recommend these to a health care worker or someone looking for something plain and not too showy to walk in. These are a comfortable choice and really do feel incredible, even after wearing them all day.”
Best Bopping Around Town All Day Shoe: Lululemon Cityverse
Lululemon
Lululemon
Cityverse
$138
Lululemon
What it does:
Comfy, casual, and classic, the Cityverse is a simple sneak you can wear every day without getting tired of it. It has a very comfortable, balanced feel that’s great for walking long distances and a streamlined look that pairs nicely with most outfits (“Anytime I wear these, I get compliments,” said one of our testers).
Who it’s for:
Athleisure enthusiasts; hot girl walkers keeping the trend alive; anyone with a big trip coming up.
How we tested:
We wore these everywhere and for all kinds of activities, including vacation strolls, dog walks, meetups with friends, and day-long outings.
One tester said:
“These are the most comfortable athleisure shoes I’ve ever worn, and I’ve purchased a lot of different models. Somehow Lululemon made cool sneakers that feel just like super-cushiony running shoes. My feet are just so happy when I wear them!”
Best Comfy High-Top: Converse Weapon
Converse
Converse
Weapon Leather
$120
Converse
What it does:
We love when a sneaker simultaneously nails form and function, so naturally we adore the Converse Weapon. It’s supportive through the foot and ankle, very comfortable, and, frankly, pretty darn cool. It has a retro look that still feels fresh, and, unlike other fashion-driven sneakers, is anything but flimsy (check out that thick sole!).
Who it’s for:
Anyone who’s equally interested in street style and staying comfy.
How we tested:
While strolling city sidewalks for hours at a time and playing games of racquetball and pickleball.
One tester said:
“These were super stylish and fit like a glove! They’re similar to Jordans, but much less expensive and more accessible. I wore them to an MLB game, and my date commented on how cool he thought my shoes were.”
Comfiest Athleisure Sneaker: Allbirds Wool Runner 2
Allbirds
Allbirds
Wool Runner 2
$110
$77
Allbirds
What it does:
This sleek, everyday sneaker shines thanks to its main material, merino wool, which is naturally sweat-wicking, temperature-regulating, and, of course, incredibly soft. Your feet should feel cozy yet cool in the Wool Runner 2, which is a major bonus if you stick with sneakers well into the colder months of the year. And if your pair starts to look a little dingy, it can go straight in the washing machine and emerge good as new.
Who it’s for:
Anyone who lives in sneakers and needs a comfy new staple that they can wear year-round.
How we tested:
On neighborhood walks, e-bike rides, and coffee shop hangouts.
One tester said:
“These are probably the most comfortable non-running shoes I’ve ever worn—I felt like I could walk for hours in them if I needed to, and they worked fine on the e-bike too (my feet didn’t slip off the pedals or anything). They’re so cushy and supportive and also didn’t interfere with my stride; my toes could bend in the right place and my feet could move naturally.”
Best Old-School Cool Athleisure Shoe: Puma Easy Rider
Puma
Puma
Puma
Chevron

Puma
Easy Rider
$90
Puma
$90
$77
Amazon
What it does:
Looking for the next Samba, Cortez, or Gazelle? We’re putting our money on Puma’s Easy Rider, a vintage design that debuted in the late ’70s. It has a similarly old-school, sporty-chic look to those aforementioned shoes of the moment, plus a seriously grippy sole and a supportive, slightly bouncy feel. One thing to note is they run narrow, according to our tester, so consider sizing up if you have wider feet.
Who it’s for:
Sneaker fans who want to stay ahead of the trends; OG
Sporty & Rich
followers.
How we tested:
Running errands around New York City, morning dog walks, and doing light chores.
One tester said:
“They feel very supportive and give you a little push while you walk, and they have a nice rounded bottom on the front of the shoe. These shoes are definitely cute—I even got a few compliments on them while I was out. I wore them with denim shorts and a white tee, and they really elevated an otherwise plain outfit with a pop of color. They’d be great for wearing out to brunch or while out shopping.”
Best Velcroed Athleisure Shoe: Cole Haan GrandPro Topspin Triple Strap
Cole Haan
Cole Haan
GrandPrø Topspin Triple Strap Sneakers
$160
Zappos
$160
Nordstrom
What it does:
Let this model from Cole Haan remind us that basic needn’t mean boring. It stands out from the (incredibly vast) pool of everyday sneakers with its trio of Velcro straps, thick base, and superclean colorways. It skews firm rather than plush, but it’s perfect for days at the office, casual shopping trips, or summer get-togethers.
Who it’s for:
Anyone who doesn’t want to mess with dangly laces; people who want a stylish sneaker they can wear for casual pursuits.
How we tested:
For hours at time while doing office work, hanging out with friends, walking the dog, and running errands.
One tester said:
“They’re sleek, modern, and look great on my feet. I think they’re very classy and perfect for when you want to look more polished (say, for dinner, brunch, etc.). I love all of the color options and textures (canvas, terrycloth…the seasonal options are to die for!). If I saw someone wearing these I’d definitely ask them where they bought them!”
Best Everyday Walking Shoe: Ryka Devotion X Max
Ryka
Amazon
Amazon
Chevron
Chevron
Ryka
Devotion X Max
$90
Amazon
$120
$90
DSW
What it does:
Let’s welcome the newest member of the maximalist pack: Ryka’s Devotion X Max has all the features we look for in a highly cushioned walking shoe (a thick sole, extra padding, and support in the heel), but it’s sturdy enough that it won’t feel squishy or unsupportive.
Who it’s for:
Anyone searching for that walking-on-clouds feeling in their sneakers—especially those with higher arches.
How we tested:
Shorter (5 to 15 minutes), longer (over an hour), and
very
long (all day!) walks in these sneakers.
One tester said:
“These sneakers are incredibly soft and cushioned—the foam midsole and outsole feel very bouncy, and the arch is perfectly positioned. I often have issues with achy arches due to a lack of support, but these sneakers were clearly made for the high-arched crew! They’re lightweight and didn’t cause any pain, blisters, or other discomfort. I love these so much that I had my mom try them on, and she instantly wanted to steal them!”
Best No-Tie Supportive Shoe: Under Armour SlipSpeed Mega
Under Armour
Under Armour
UA SlipSpeed Mega Running Shoes
$140
DICK’S Sporting Goods
$140
Under Armour
What it does:
This chunky-soled sneaker borrows some features from outdoor footwear (including BOA closure system, lightly lugged sole, and ripstop material), but you can confidently wear it everywhere. It absorbs impact when you walk on pavement and cobblestones, it’s light enough for all-day wear, and it supports your arch and ankle without feeling obtrusive.
Who it’s for:
Commuters; dog walkers; those who prefer a slip-on shoe; anyone who wants to dip a toe into gorpcore dressing.
How we tested:
On day-long jaunts around New York City; errand runs on Long Island; and everyday dog walks.
One tester said:
“These shoes are SO, SO comfortable and amazingly lightweight. My whole foot and ankle felt secure and supported, and there was a ton of cushion beneath my feet. No blisters or pressure points!”
Best Heavy-Duty Walking Shoe: Vionic Walk Max
Vionic
Vionic
Walk Max Lace Up Sneakers
$140
Vionic
$140
$126
Amazon
$140
Zappos
$140
Nordstrom
What it does:
Podiatrists love (and frequently recommend) Vionic’s highly supportive shoes because they’re made to keep your feet happy in the long-term. With its durable design, water-repellent exterior, and lightweight cushioning, the brand’s new Walk Max sneaker has everything you possibly need from a walking shoe that’ll stand the test of time.
Who it’s for:
Dedicated walkers who put their shoes through the wringer; people who find most walking shoes lacking in support.
How we tested:
On morning walks and errands runs, while doing yard work and cleaning up around the house.
One tester said:
“The extra stability in the heel area felt really supportive, especially when I was walking downhill. Its sole is nice and thick, and there’s just enough arch support. These will be worn for many years!”

Best Hiking Sneaker: Merrell Moab Speed 2 X Sweaty Betty
Merrell
Merrell
Moab Speed 2 X Sweaty Betty
$140
Zappos
$140
Nordstrom
$140
$107
Amazon
What it does:
This limited-edition version of Merrell’s beloved Moab trail shoe has added protection around the heel and toe, four-millimeter lugs for good traction, and lots of padding through the insole and around the collar. With all of those performance-driven bona fides, it doesn’t need to be as cute as it is—and yet! Our tester loved their look as soon as she opened the box.
Who it’s for:
Day hikers taking on easy-to-moderate terrain; fans of outdoor style in general; anyone who thrills at the idea of
a women’s hiking shoe that isn’t teal
.
How we tested:
For four straight days on a birding trip in Cape May, hiking around state forests, local conservancy areas, beaches, and meadows.
One tester said:
“They were so comfortable and breathable in all environments. My feet felt cushioned and supported, but the shoes were still lightweight and easy to slip on. I didn’t think about them much at all, actually! And I didn’t get any blisters, pain, or discomfort.”
Best Hiking Boot: Forsake Wild Sky High
Forsake
Forsake
Wild Sky High
$145
REI
$145
$102
Zappos
What it does:
If you’re opting for a hiking boot over a trail shoe, ankle support is probably among your top priorities. And that’s what makes Forsake’s Wild Sky High model such a fantastic option for hikers of all levels: Our testers wore their pairs all over the US, and no matter the terrain their feet and ankles felt secure, protected, and comfortable (with no blisters to speak of!).
Who it’s for:
Hikers who regularly take on varied terrain, like a firm and durable boot, or want reliable ankle support.
How we tested:
Hiking in a variety of outdoor settings, including mountainous terrain in Colorado and Northern Arizona, rocky desert paths, and Northeastern woodland trails (including Devil’s Den in Fairfield County, Connecticut), for excursions lasting between 30 minutes and four hours.
One tester said:
“As a hiking boot, this shoe is made for a range of natural surfaces, including rock, dirt, grass, gravel, mulch, and wood chips. The sole is thick and sturdy enough that I never had an issue with traction or felt like I was losing my grip. I was always able to grasp the trail easily with my foot.”
Best Camping Shoe: Crocs Echo Storm
Crocs
Crocs
Echo Storm
$100
Crocs
What it does:
After a long day on the trail, no one wants to wear their heavy, muddy hiking boots around camp—they want something cushy yet capable to slip into, like Crocs’s cool Echo Storm. It’s easy to pull on (the upper is made from super-stretchy neoprene), well-ventilated, and laden with the brand’s signature foam throughout the sole.
Who it’s for:
Campers who want a comfy alternative to their technical outdoor footwear; Crocs collectors; anyone who needs an easy, comfy shoe to throw on at a moment’s notice.
How we tested:
On a long weekend camping trip with rocky dirt paths around the campsite.
One tester said:
“This is a perfect shoe for camping. I didn’t feel the rocks under my feet most of the time, and when I
did
stumble, my toes still felt secure. I’d wear them anywhere— they’re trendy without trying too hard and simply the perfect Croc.”

About SELF
We’re happy to share the editorial policies and standards behind our award-winning content.
Our Mission
SELF is wellness you can trust.
We help you take good care of yourself, your loved ones, and your community. No matter the platform, our work reflects this service-driven mission and the core values of
inclusivity
,
accuracy
,
autonomy
, and
empathy
. We recognize that wellness is as much about self-expression and self-compassion as it is about workout classes and healthy eating; that it’s not all-or-nothing; and that every person’s individual goals for wellness are different, and that’s great. We also recognize that personal health is intimately connected to community health, and that better health outcomes often require systemic change. We’re all in this together, and SELF is here for you.
SELF reaches over 20 million people each month across a wide range of platforms, including web, video, and social media. SELF is recognized as a global thought leader in health content and has won numerous awards, including a National Magazine Award, Webby’s People’s Voice award, MM&M Gold Award; plus appeared on Adweek’s Hot List and Ad Age’s Publisher’s A-List. SELF’s Editor in Chief has been honored as Digital Editor of the Year by the 2018 Folio: Digital Awards, as well as a 2018 Changemaker by Digiday.
Who We Are
The SELF editorial team is composed of a diverse group of individuals with a wide range of reporting and editing backgrounds. The varying viewpoints and unique opinions of each person on the team help drive SELF’s content to be among the best and most respected health content published today.
Here’s a look at our team’s leadership:
Rachel Wilkerson Miller
- Editor in Chief
Rachel Wilkerson Miller is the editor-in-chief of SELF, where she is responsible for developing and creating SELF’s content across all platforms including digital, video and social.
Miller was most recently senior editor at
Vox.com
, where she launched Vox’s first-ever dedicated service journalism hub. Before joining Vox in 2021, Miller spent two years as deputy editor of
VICE.com
, where she oversaw content production for the Life desk and managed digital tentpoles, in addition to writing service content for a diverse audience on a variety of interpersonal topics, including relationships, mental health, the pandemic, and the Black Lives Matter movement. Prior to that, Miller spent nearly five years at BuzzFeed in a variety of roles, most recently as Site Director of Goodful, BuzzFeed’s health and wellness brand, overseeing content production and building audience development.
Miller is the author of two books guiding personal success and a graduate of Michigan State University.
About Conde Nast

Editorial Standards and Practices
SELF strives to apply best practices for reporting our articles. We take care to interview credentialed experts, doctors, and researchers; and to cite information from nationally recognized agencies, organizations, research institutes, and peer-reviewed medical journals.
Health information can change over time, so our articles may be updated as needed.
Content Creation Process: Writers and Editors
SELF is mindful about who we select to write for us, including thought leaders, advocates, and or writers who have years of experience with a particular subject in order to provide insightful , service-driven content. Our editors also work closely with writers, revising and refining before an article is finalized.
Articles may go through several layers of editing prior to publication in order to help ensure the quality of the work. Multiple sources are consulted whenever possible or necessary.
If you're a writer interested in writing for SELF,
please read this pitching guide
. It includes information about what to pitch, what not to pitch, pay rates, and more.

Workplace Values
Our vision for our workplace is one that is centered on transparency and respect and with values that bring forward the best in all of us each and every day. We are committed to creating a culture wherediverse voices and perspectives are encouraged and respected, and where all employees are equally supported in developing their careers — where people can truly be themselves and feel they can achieve their best.
Our culture is one of our top priorities and we are focused on implementing people-first policies and programs equitably throughout our global organization. In the past year, we’ve already made significant progress––this includes improving and extending our family leave benefits; stopping the use of traditional NDA agreements in areas related to harassment and nondiscrimination; and making sure that many team members previously classified as contractors were given the opportunity to move into full-time employee positions.
As we continue to invest in systems, tools and processes to strengthen our company, what’s most important is the continued investment in our people.
Passion and Progress

Tracking Technologies
”) to collect data when you interact with our Products and Services, including our websites, mobile applications, and email communications. Some of these technologies store data in the browser or on your device. Other technologies may use network-related or other information to recognize your device (e.g., IP address).
Our Products and Services use Tracking Technologies, for example, when you first request a web page and data is then stored on your computer or other device so the website can access Personal Information when you make subsequent requests for pages from that Product or Service. These technologies may also be used to collect and store information about your usage of the Products and Services, such as pages you have visited, and Content you viewed or searched for. We may also use these technologies to save your preferences, consent, and choices; determine if you opened or interacted with our emails or newsletters; troubleshoot and resolve technical issues or outages; conduct research; deliver editorial Content and advertising; maintain subscription and registration information; and store information you may want to retrieve on a regular basis. Additionally, we may use these technologies to collect analytics and measure the use of our Products and Services.

We also allow specific, approved third-party business partners and/or service providers, including Google Analytics, to collect data from your browser or device for Targeted Advertising, analytics, and measurement purposes using their own similar tools. For more information about Google Analytics including how to opt out, visit
How Google Uses Information

Targeted Advertising
").
We may collaborate with our service providers and our third-party
Identity Resolution Partners
to deliver Targeted Advertising and identify the different devices and browsers you may use to access our Products and Services. We and these
Identity Resolution Partners
facilitate identity resolution by creating probabilistic and deterministic identifiers. These identifiers may use Personal Information, including your name, email address, phone number, and Activity and Device Information to generate an online identifier reasonably linkable to you and/or your device or browser.
For example, we may disclose hashed email address, phone number, or other information about your device to our Identity Resolution Partners, who may, in turn, return an online identifier that we may store in a first party cookie or similar technology and disclose to our advertising partners to provide you a more personalized advertising experience. These identifiers also help us with fraud detection and security, to enforce our User Agreement, verify user authentication for accessing Content behind a paywall, and to determine eligibility for offers available exclusively to new subscribers, among other things. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of our Identity Resolution Partners, which are separate from our own and which are not covered by this Privacy Policy. You can Opt-Out of Identity Resolution Partner LiveRamp’s use of your Personal Information for these purposes by visiting

8. Opting Out of Marketing Communications
If you do not wish to receive future marketing or other commercial messages from us, follow the unsubscribe instructions contained within the message you receive.

12. Publicly Posting Personal Information
Please be aware that Personal Information and Content that you disclose in publicly accessible portions of the Products and Services may be available to other users and may also be made available outside the Products and Services by third parties, so you should be mindful of all Personal Information, especially Sensitive Personal Information, that you may wish to post.

Your Personal Information may be processed, transferred to, and maintained on servers and databases located outside of the jurisdiction in which you are based and where the privacy laws may not be as protective as your jurisdiction.

For example, to ensure that we can effectively manage and communicate regarding our business, to perform investigations or compliance audits, to improve the Products and Services, to exercise or defend our rights, and for business administration purposes. You can contact us using the details in the Contact Us section below for information about how we assess whether we are permitted to use your Personal Information under this legal basis.

Tracking Techniques and Technologies
We and our third-party business partners use various tools and technologies such as cookies, pixels, localStorage, web beacons, software development kits, and similar technologies (collectively, “
Tracking Technologies
”) to collect data when you interact with our Products and Services, including our websites, mobile applications, and email communications. Some of these technologies store data in the browser or on your device. Other technologies may use network-related or other information to recognize your device (e.g., IP address).
Our Products and Services use Tracking Technologies, for example, when you first request a web page and data is then stored on your computer or other device so the website can access Personal Information when you make subsequent requests for pages from that Product or Service. These technologies may also be used to collect and store information about your usage of the Products and Services, such as pages you have visited, and Content you viewed or searched for. We may also use these technologies to save your preferences, consent, and choices; determine if you opened or interacted with our emails or newsletters; troubleshoot and resolve technical issues or outages; conduct research; deliver editorial Content and advertising; maintain subscription and registration information; and store information you may want to retrieve on a regular basis. Additionally, we may use these technologies to collect analytics and measure the use of our Products and Services.
The use of these Tracking Technologies helps us serve you better by understanding what you are interested in, track trends, measure the effectiveness of ads, conduct frequency capping, and tailor offers about our Products and Services to you. We also allow specific, approved third-party business partners and/or service providers, including Google Analytics, to collect data from your browser or device for Targeted Advertising, analytics, and measurement purposes using their own similar tools. For more information about Google Analytics including how to opt out, visit
How Google Uses Information

Targeted Advertising
").
We may collaborate with our service providers and our third-party
Identity Resolution Partners
to deliver Targeted Advertising and identify the different devices and browsers you may use to access our Products and Services. We and these
Identity Resolution Partners
facilitate identity resolution by creating probabilistic and deterministic identifiers. These identifiers may use Personal Information, including your name, email address, phone number, and Activity and Device Information to generate an online identifier reasonably linkable to you and/or your device or browser.
For example, we may disclose hashed email address, phone number, or other information about your device to our Identity Resolution Partners, who may, in turn, return an online identifier that we may store in a first party cookie or similar technology and disclose to our advertising partners to provide you a more personalized advertising experience. These identifiers also help us with fraud detection and security, to enforce our User Agreement, verify user authentication for accessing Content behind a paywall, and to determine eligibility for offers available exclusively to new subscribers, among other things. We are not responsible for the privacy practices of our Identity Resolution Partners, which are separate from our own and which are not covered by this Privacy Policy. You can Opt-Out of Identity Resolution Partner LiveRamp’s use of your Personal Information for these purposes by visiting
