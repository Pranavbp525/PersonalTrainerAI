Do I have to take the Personal Trainer exam again to renew my credential?
No, provided you stay current on your continuing education credits (CECs) and renew on time. That means completing 20 hours of ACE-Approved CECs (2.0 CECs) during your two-year certification renewal cycles, or about 10 hours (1.0 CECs) per year. However, if you don't complete your 2.0 CECs and your certification expires, you will have to retake the exam. To avoid that scenario, check out our
continuing education catalog

What does a Health Coach do?
A health coach recognizes that people have unique dietary, emotional and physical needs. They help people reach their goals and implement lifestyle changes that improve their overall health and wellness with exercise, nutrition and psychology. They work in a variety of settings from health clubs to corporations, virtual coaching to healthcare.
How do Health Coaches make an impact?
A health coach partners with people to help them discover their own unique skills, strengths, abilities and untapped potential. They help people create realistic goals through self-discovery while providing guidance for how to make healthy changes that work for them and their lifestyle.
What is the role of a Health Coach in the fitness industry?
While many fitness pros are focused on the physical aspects of fitness, health coaches focus on the client's overall lifestyle. A health coach provides relevant, applicable and skill-based strategies, beyond a workout program, that influence positive behavior change. Because of this health coaches are in high demand.
We offer
two pathways
toward achieving your health

FAQs
Are there any pre-requisites to becoming an ACE Certified Health Coach?
You can become an ACE Health Coach by passing the ACE Health Coach certification exam. In order to sit for the ACE Health Coach certification exam you must satisfy the following requirements:
Be at least 18 years old.
Have completed high school diploma (or the equivalent).
Hold a current
CPR and AED certification
with a live skills check*
Present a current government-issued photo ID with signature (driver's license, passport, military ID)
*CPR and AED certificates are both required in the U.S. and Canada. Candidates outside the U.S. and Canada are only required to hold a current CPR certificate due to differing international laws regarding AED use by non-medical professionals. Candidates taking an ACE exam must complete a CPR/AED course that includes a live skills check prior to registration.
What is the difference between the ACE Health Coach Certification and the NBHWC Certification?
The ACE Health Coach Certification is the only NCCA-accredited health coach certification available. When you become an ACE Certified Health Coach, you are widely respected as being the most qualified professional to coach clients. You hold the most recognized certification in the industry that can lead to the most sought-after opportunities. And with ongoing support and guidance from ACE throughout your career, you will have access to the exclusive tools and resources you need to thrive as a health and fitness pro. While both study programs prepare you to earn an NCCA-accredited certification, the ACE Health Coach Advanced Training Program is also an approved Health and Wellness Coach Training & Education Program by the National Board for Health and Wellness Coaching (NBHWC).
Which program is best if I would like to take the NBHWC exam?
The Health Coach Advanced Training Program is the best path to complete the education requirement to apply to sit for the NBHWC exam. Please check
www.NBHWC.org
for all requirements before applying to sit for the NBHWC exam.
What program will help me complete the practical skills assessment required to take the NBHWC exam?
Within the Health Coach Advanced Training Program, the course Health Coach Lab: Live Skills Assessment fulfills the practical skills assessment requirement. Once you have completed this course you will receive a certification of completion with the program name and date of completion to include with your exam application. Please check
www.NBHWC.org
for all requirements before applying to sit for the NBHWC exam.
For the Health Coach Advanced Training Program, is there a specific order I should take the courses in?
We've created a free guided tour that shows you how the program works. Learn more

.
How long will it take to complete the programs?
Everyone learns differently and the time it takes varies. For the ACE Health Coach certificates, most complete this in 3-6 months from the time they start studying to when they sit and pass their exam. For ACE Health Coach Advanced Training Program, it is recommended to take up to 1 year to complete the program from start to finish.

FAQs
How long will I have to study before I need to sit for the certification exam?
That's up to you! Most people study for around 3-6 months, though many study for longer. One thing to keep in mind is that your exam voucher has a redemption period of 6-months. While you can choose an exam date that's outside of the 6-month redemption period, you'll have to register for the exam before your voucher expires. Most exam sites and online proctoring may post available dates approximately 60 days in advance.
Are there any prerequisites before I purchase a study program?
While there are no prerequisites to purchasing a study program, keep in mind that before you can register for the ACE Group Fitness Instructor Exam, you must:
Be at least 18 years of age
Hold a current adult CPR and AED certificate with hands-on (in-person or virtual) skills check.* CPR/AED courses without skills check not accepted.
*AED only required in USA and Canada
Have completed high school or the equivalent
See our approved CPR/AED certification training
here
.
How does the Study Program work?
Depending on which Study Program you choose, based on how you like to learn, you'll have the option of learning through:
A digital textbook (Basic)
A hardcopy and digital textbook (Plus)
A hardcopy, digital and audiobook version of the textbook (Advantage)
With all Study Programs, you'll have access to ACE University (our core learning platform) and practice test(s).
With the Plus Study Program, you'll have access to three practice tests and to Live Q&A Webinars.
And with the Advantage Study Program you have access to four practice tests, Live Q&A Webinars, Section Quizzes and Exercise Science 101.
Learn More
What happens if I don't pass the exam on the first time?
While most people do pass the exam on their first time, it's perfectly okay if you don't! Here are some steps you can take if you need to retake your certification exam:
Determine if you have a retake voucher, which you can find in your MyACE Account. If you don't have one, you can purchase an additional exam at a discounted retake fee via MyACE or by contacting one of our ACE Advisors. This price is valid for one year after your initial test date.
When choosing a date to retake the exam, we recommend giving yourself about one week of review time for every ten points you are away from a passing score. So if your score is 480 out of a possible 800, for example, (meaning you're 20 points away from the minimum passing score of 500), allow about two weeks of review before your next exam.
Reflect on your performance and consider any exam topics you felt underprepared to tackle.
Review your exam score report and compare your domain performance to the Exam Content Outline. Review each domain and determine what areas need improvement.
Use all your study materials, including videos and exercises, to help build confidence for the exam. Because no two people learn alike, we've provided study material in many different formats, so be sure to use all the resources available to you!
Consider what went well during your initial studies and what you might do differently.
Create a game plan for everything you want to do before you retake the exam. Writing down your plan may help create accountability.
Join the ACE Study Coaches for a live Q&A Webinar to get your specific questions answered.
Can I teach any class format after becoming ACE Certified?
After becoming an ACE Certified Group Fitness Instructor, you'll have a strong foundational understanding of how to lead, instruct, and design classes across a wide range of modalities. Many ACE Certified Pros also choose to continue their education by taking additional courses that focus on just one modality, such as Indoor Cycling,
Yoga
, or
Pilates
, just to name a few.
What happens after I'm ACE Certified?
CELEBRATE! You've now joined the highly respected ranks of 90,000+ ACE Certified Pros and hold the most recognized certification in the industry. Plus, we'll be providing support and guidance throughout your career, so you'll have access to the exclusive tools and resources you need to thrive as a health and fitness pro. Learn more about why it's great to be ACE Certified
here
.
Do I have to take the exam again to renew my certification?
No, provided you stay current on your continuing education credits (CECs) and renew on time. That means completing 20 hours of ACE-Approved CECs (2.0 CECs) during your two-year certification renewal cycles, or about 10 hours (1.0 CECs) per year. However, if you don't complete your 2.0 CECs and your certification expires, you will have to retake the exam. To avoid that scenario, check out our
continuing education catalog
and consider signing up for the
CEC Power Pass

Ryan Vivar
ACE Certified Medical Exercise Specialist
In preparation for my ACE Certification Exam, I covered the whole gamut of emotions. From extreme excitement to fear of failure. However, in utilizing all of the great study materials from ACE, my nerves were calmed and I felt more than prepared and confident in passing my exam.

FAQs
How long will I have to study before I need to sit for the certification exam?
That's up to you! Most people study for around 3-6 months, though many study for longer. One thing to keep in mind is that your exam voucher has a redemption period of 6-months. While you can choose an exam date that's outside of the 6-month redemption period, you'll have to register for the exam before your voucher expires. Most exam sites and online proctoring may post available dates approximately 60 days in advance
Are there any prerequisites before I purchase a study program?
While there are no prerequisites to purchase the study program, to sit for the ACE Medical Exercise Specialist certification you must:
Be at least 18 years of age
Hold a current adult CPR and AED certificate with hands-on (in-person or virtual) skills check.* CPR/AED courses without skills check not accepted. See our approved CPR/AED certification training
here
.
*AED only required in USA and Canada
Present a current government-issued photo ID with signature (driver's license, passport, military ID)
Submit BOTH of the following documents:
Proof of a four-year (bachelor's) degree in exercise science or a related field.
Proof of 500 hours of work experience designing and implementing exercise programs for apparently healthy individuals and/or high-risk individuals, as documented by a qualified professional (upload pre-approval form, as completed by a supervisor, below).
What happens if I don’t pass the exam on the first time?
While most people do pass the exam on their first time, it's perfectly okay if you don't! Here are some steps you can take if you need to retake your certification exam:
Determine if you have a retake voucher, which you can find in your MyACE Account. If you don't have one, you can purchase an additional exam at a discounted retake fee via MyACE or by contacting one of our ACE Advisors. This price is valid for one year after your initial test date.
When choosing a date to retake the exam, we recommend giving yourself about one week of review time for every ten points you are away from a passing score. So if your score is 480 out of a possible 800, for example, (meaning you're 20 points away from the minimum passing score of 500), allow about two weeks of review before your next exam.
Reflect on your performance and consider any exam topics you felt underprepared to tackle.
Review your exam score report and compare your domain performance to the Exam Content Outline. Review each domain and determine what areas need improvement.
Use all your study materials, including videos and exercises, to help build confidence for the exam. Because no two people learn alike, we've provided study material in many different formats, so be sure to use all the resources available to you!
Consider what went well during your initial studies and what you might do differently.
Create a game plan for everything you want to do before you retake the exam. Writing down your plan may help create accountability.
Join the ACE Study Coaches for a live Q&A Webinar or Facilitated Study Group to get your specific questions answered.
What happens after I'm ACE Certified?
CELEBRATE! You've now joined the highly respected ranks of 90,000+ ACE Certified Pros and hold the most recognized certification in the industry. Plus, we'll be providing support and guidance throughout your career, so you'll have access to the exclusive tools and resources you need to thrive as a health and fitness pro. Learn more about why it's great to be ACE Certified
here
.
Do I have to take the exam again to renew my certification?
No, provided you stay current on your continuing education credits (CECs) and renew on time. That means completing 20 hours of ACE-Approved CECs (2.0 CECs) during your two-year certification renewal cycles, or about 10 hours (1.0 CECs) per year. However, if you don't complete your 2.0 CECs and your certification expires, you will have to retake the exam. To avoid that scenario, check out our
continuing education catalog
and consider signing up for the
CEC Power Pass

Deliver the
real results
clients
deserve in a
sustainable
way
Both research and experience has shown that exercise, while important, isn't enough on its own to get people the health and fitness results they deserve. The best place to start is on their nutrition. But where do you start? What recommendations do you make and when do you make them? How do you get your clients to actually follow a plan?
This comprehensive, self-guided nutrition course integrates the science of nutrition with the art of behavior change coaching, which is the key to helping people make sustainable changes in their lives. Based not only on theory, but data from coaching over 100,000 real clients in hundreds of real-world situations, you'll be given a practical system that shows you exactly what to do at every stage of the nutrition coaching process—from the very first time you meet with a client until they reach all their goals.
Completing Precision Nutrition Level 1 provided me with better tools and techniques to help my clients and athletes integrate realistic, workable nutrition strategies into their daily lives."
MICHAEL PIERCY,
MS, CSCS*D, Fitness Facility Owner

Certification 101
How to Become a Health Coach
With chronic disease on the rise across the globe, the need for health coaches is growing as well. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the health coaching profession is predicted to grow by 16% over the next 10 years. Health coaching is a dynamic partnership that centers on increasing awareness and capacity for change and empowering people to adopt healthier lifestyles. If you are interested in pursuing a career as an ACE Certified Health Coach, follow these steps.
Begin

5
Step 1
Choose your study program and start studying
The ACE Health Coach Certification is the only health coach certification accredited by the National Commission for Certifying Agencies (
NCCA
), considered the gold standard in health and fitness.
Once you've decided the ACE Health Coach Certification is right for you, it's time to choose a study program that best fits your study needs:  Basic or Plus. The new
ACE Health Coach Study Program
includes a combination of digital and print materials that are designed so that you can learn at your own pace. The innovative online learning experience will guide you through the program so you can benefit fully from the comprehensive information and training modules that will prepare you for both the certification exam and a career as a health coach. ACE offers several tools you can use, including
ACE Answers
, our self-serve resource center.
Curious what our study programs are like? See how you'll learn
here
.
Next
Step 2
Register for your exam
The cost of the ACE Health Coach Certification Exam is included in the price of each of the study program options. You are required to
register for your exam
within six months after purchasing your materials. Prior to registering, make sure you meet all of the exam
prerequisite requirements
, which include holding a current
CPR/AED certification with live skills check
. Please note that purchasing ACE study materials is not required in order to register for the exam.
Next
Step 3
Pass your exam and get started on your dream job
Once you pass your exam, you will become an official ACE Certified Health Coach and gain access to exclusive resources aimed at helping you launch your career, including professional discounts on exercise equipment, liability insurance and more. You'll also receive your certificate to display and a wallet ID card to verify your credentials to potential clients and employers.
Once you're ready to start helping clients get healthy, you'll first need to determine the right environment for your career. Consider the setting you'd like to work in—a health and fitness club, specialty studio, benefits association, wellness facility, medical fitness facility or your own private practice—and the type of population with whom you prefer to work. Choosing a path that suits your desires and personal and professional needs will ensure your career starts off on the right foot. Whichever career path you pursue, ACE has a variety of tools to help you get started. For more information, see our Programs & Benefits or log in to your My ACE Account once you earn your certification.
Next
Step 4
Define your specialty
No matter how great you are at your craft, you can't be everything to everyone. Focusing on a specialty within your health coaching practice will make it easier for you to connect with clients who will be a good fit for your services. ACE has created a series of
Specialist Programs
to help you focus your expertise in specific areas, including behavior change, fitness nutrition and weight management. Although anyone can pursue the education in a specialist program, only those who hold NCCA-accredited certifications will be recognized as ACE Specialists. To find out which area you should pursue, consider the needs in your community and what fuels your passion.
Next
Step 5
Maintain Your ACE Certification
In order to ensure your ongoing professional development and maintain high standards, ACE Certified Professionals (and others in the industry) are required to earn 20 hours of
continuing education
credits (2.0 CECs) every two years. Establishing and enforcing this standard helps us validate that professionals continue to enhance their competence to safely and effectively help empower people to change. To fulfill those
renewal requirements
, ACE offers a number of diverse opportunities to help you build your expertise.

Certification 101
How to become a Certified Medical Exercise Specialist
Today's clients oftentimes suffer from a variety of chronic medical conditions, requiring a health and fitness professional that holds specialized, comprehensive knowledge in medical fitness. The ACE Medical Exercise Specialist study program was created to help individuals gain valuable expertise in creating programs for clients with a range of medical conditions. If you're interested in pursuing a career as a Certified Medical Exercise Specialist, here are a few steps to make the process seamless.
Begin
Step 1
Do your Research
Once you've decided that becoming a Certified Medical Exercise Specialist is right for you, the first (and extremely important) step is choosing a certification program. Of all the similar certification programs available, only a few are accredited by the National Commission for Certifying Agencies (
NCCA
). Considered the gold standard in health and fitness, NCCA accreditation ensures programs for a wide range of industries meet defined standards of excellence for performing a specific job. It's also the standard recognized by leaders (and employers) in fitness and medical communities.
                        To learn more about the pre-requisites required to sit for the ACE Medical Exercise Specialist exam, download our
Certification and Recertification Handbook
or sign in to your My ACE account to review the
pre-approval process
.
Select an NCCA-Accredited Certification
Step 2
Choose a Study Program
Once you've decided which certification program is right for you, it's time to secure your study materials. Certification providers typically offer different plans for candidates that vary based on how much guidance they receive. Preparation for ACE exams is self-paced and done through a combination of online and physical materials. To prepare for the
ACE Certified Medical Exercise Specialist certification exam
candidates generally invest 80-100 hours of study time over a 3-4 month period depending on background, experience and available time. ACE offers several tools you can use as you prepare, including
ACE Answers
, our self-serve resource center, and
ACE Answers on Facebook
, our social study center and live video stream.

Step 3
Register for Your Exam
Costs associated with registering for a certification exam are included in each of the study program options. The only requirement is that you
register for your exam
within six months after purchasing your materials (even though you can select a date beyond that deadline). Prior to registering, make sure you meet all
pre-requisite requirements
for your exam, which includes holding a current
CPR/AED certification with live skills check
. Please note that purchasing ACE study materials is not required in order to register for the exam.

ACE Fitness | Career Quiz
What's the best health & fitness role for you?
Interested in working in fitness but not quite sure where you fit in? This quiz is for you!
Select the statements below that best describe you and find out which path you're most suited for:
I'm a highly empathetic person and like to take a holistic view of someone's life when evaluating their behaviors
My primary interest is creating individualized evidence-based exercise programs for each client
I'd love to create super fun and exciting movement experiences for groups of people large and small
I'd like to work from home, in a client's house, or in an office setting
I'd love to work with clients on the gym floor but would also like to coach people online
I perform best when surrounded by people, but could also do a pretty great job motivating clients online
I'd like to work with just one person or in a small group
I prefer working with one person at a time for the most part but am okay with small groups as well
I love to be in groups of people and enjoy taking the lead
I take a thoughtful and balanced approach to my health
I work out on my own or with a training partner
I attend group fitness classes all the time and get inspired by the energy in the room
My physical activity regimen often includes a mix of strength training, cardio, and mindfulness classes
I love writing my own workout, and am always updating it based on the latest research and tangible results
I push myself the hardest when working out in a group
I'm intensely interested in the latest research on creating lasting behavior changes
I'm obsessed with staying up to date with the latest scientific research on exercise
I'm constantly trying out new group exercise classes and fitness studios
Selected mostly A's
With your deep empathy, balanced approach to fitness, and ability to see the big picture when suggesting lifestyle changes, you'd make an exceptional Health Coach. Health coaching is not only a growing and respected field, it's a powerful conduit for positive and healthy lifestyle behavior-change.
You can transform lives as a Health Coach!
LEARN MORE >
Selected mostly B's
With your strong interest in exercise science, as well as your preference for working one-on-one with clients or in small groups, you'd make a great Personal Trainer. While there's no “perfect” generalization of personal trainers, overall, they tend to be more introverted than Group Fitness Instructors, and more focused on the nuts and bolts of exercise science than Health Coaches.
You can transform lives as a Personal Trainer
LEARN MORE >
Selected mostly C's
With your high level of energy, desire to be the leader of the pack, and knack for providing motivation, you'd make a great Group Fitness Instructor. Group fitness instruction provides an outlet for putting your vibrant and positively contagious personality in the spotlight. Group fitness instructors are often extroverts who feed off the energy and enthusiasm of the group. They are more than comfortable being the center of attention and utilizing that responsibility to inspire others.
You can transform lives as a Group Fitness Instructor

Do I have to take the Personal Trainer exam again to renew my credential?
No, provided you stay current on your continuing education credits (CECs) and renew on time. That means completing 20 hours of ACE-Approved CECs (2.0 CECs) during your two-year certification renewal cycles, or about 10 hours (1.0 CECs) per year.

continuing education catalog
and consider signing up for

Why You Need a
Health & Fitness
Certification
If you're interested in becoming a personal trainer, group fitness instructor, health coach,
                or medical exercise specialist, it's critical that you first get certified. Attempting to enter
                the field without a certification will significantly limit your career opportunities, income
                and clientele. Here are 6 reasons why you need a health & fitness certification:
6 reasons why certification is crucial
1
Competent & Qualified
Earning a professional certification confirms you are competent and ready for the job. It gives employers and clients confidence that you have the knowledge and skills to design and deliver individualized programs to meet each client's unique health and fitness needs. In an industry where many people use titles they have not earned, having an accredited certification will set you apart from the competition.
2
Confidence & Safety
With proven science-based knowledge to analyze movements, assess fitness, listen actively, and create unique exercise and health coaching programs, you'll have the confidence to ensure clients can safely achieve their goals. It's imperative that your clients and more importantly, you, feel confident in your abilities to guide them through safe and effective programs that achieve results.
3
Liability
When it comes to helping clients manage their weight, build strength and change habits, a certification shows you are professionally trained to know the DO's and DON'T's of what's safe for your clients, reducing the risks of injuries that can happen under your watch. Plus, whether you decide to work in healthcare, for a fitness company, or be self-employed, many insurance providers will charge a lower rate if you are certified.
4
Employment
Most, if not all, health and fitness employers require an accredited certification as proof that you are qualified to coach clients. Whether it's a role as a personal trainer, health coach, group fitness instructor, or medical exercise specialist, you'll need a certification if you seek employment in any type of facility including health clubs, gyms, healthcare centers, corporate settings, campuses, and more.
5
Respect & Credibility
Your clients, other health coaches and exercise professionals, and employers will have much respect for you because you had the discipline and commitment to invest in yourself by getting certified. By holding an accredited certification, you demonstrate that you are a competent and credible source for health and fitness information and services.
6
Standards & Professionalism
As exercise professionals and health coaches become poised to be more closely aligned with healthcare, they are continually being held to high standards, including holding a professional certifications that is of similar quality as those held by healthcare professionals. An accredited certification helps open doors for advanced opportunities, including those in healthcare, disease prevention and more.
What is Accreditation?
The health and fitness industry is largely unregulated and anyone can claim to be an exercise professional or health coach. Accreditation of certification programs is focused on the quality, validity and reliability of the program, its competency-based assessments, and its ability to differentiate individuals who are qualified to practice in a given profession from those who are not qualified.
Earning an accredited certification provides verification that you have met the criteria to work as a qualified professional.
All certifications are not created equal
BE WARY! There are more than 100 organizations, educators, and fly-by-night operators that offer certifications or certificates that are not accredited, do little to prepare you for a lasting career and may not be accepted by employers. Make sure to do your research!
Want to get certified and
pursue a health & fitness career?

the most respected and sought-after professionals in the industry.

ACE Certifications are
NCCA-accredited
The health and fitness industry is largely unregulated and unfortunately anyone can claim to be an exercise professional or health coach. To support the integrity of our industry and in keeping with standards of practice among other healthcare professionals, all our primary certification programs hold accreditation by the National Commission for Certifying Agencies (NCCA).
The nation's most respected thinkers in health and fitness agree that NCCA accreditation is the gold standard when it comes to accreditation of programs that certify professionals working in healthcare, fitness, wellness and other occupations.
All certifications are not created equal
BE WARY! There are more than 100 respectable organizations, fly-by-night operators and providers of "overnight credentials" that are not accredited at all, do little to prepare you for a lasting career and may not be accepted by employers. Make sure to do your research!

Hear how some of the 90,000 ACE Pros have
                turned their passion into their profession
Lisa Wilder | ACE Certified Group Fitness Instructor, Health Coach, and Fit4Mom franchisee
New mom takes control of her schedule and creates flexible job that she loves
Lisa, a mom of three, began her fitness journey with Stroller Strides. After joining several group fitness programs, her passion skyrocketed. She felt driven to share the success she had with others and got her Group Fitness Certification with ACE. Being able to take control of her schedule provided her with the flexibility she needed as a working mom. Over the past year, Lisa has expanded her services to offer online classes. She learned that it's how she teaches classes, not where, that truly matters most. Her advice for those starting out is,
"Go with the flow! Give your clients a great experience and they will keep coming back to you!"
Michael Phillip Katz | ACE Certified Personal Trainer, Corrective Exercise Specialist, and fitness expert
A sports injury led to a brand new career
Michael had been involved in athletics and fitness all his life, but he struggled picking a career path. Following a sports injury, he realized the impact that a healthy recovery made on his life. He decided then to get certified. Michael started training family and friends, but once he moved to a new town he used his ACE Certification to build his client list. He quickly became the busiest and most sought-after trainer at the gym. Michael loves to help people uncover strengths they have hidden inside, especially for the special populations he works with like senior citizens, rotary athletes and people recovering from injury. His advice for those starting out is,
"Work hard, and believe in yourself. Gain experience, observe veteran trainers, learn lessons and have the confidence to create something special."
Hirari Watanabe | ACE Certified Group Fitness Instructor, Hip Hop Dance Instructor
Dancer uses her specialty and her certification to create steady income
Newly certified, Hirari has combined her love for dance with her passion for exercise as a group fitness instructor. Working as a seasoned dance instructor, it was a challenge to make a full time living. With her ACE Certification she has found the perfect balance of having jobs that put her in control and in a place of being financially stable while doing what she loves. She has found it possible to set a competitive rate for her classes because of the niche that she serves.
While her first year as a fitness pro consisted of much adapting and evolving, it has been very rewarding. Her advice for those starting out is,
"Trust the knowledge you have gained, but always be open minded to feedback from your class participants and clients. They will help you make your class experience be outside the box, special and unique."
Nancy McCarthy | ACE Certified Health Coach, Group Fitness Instructor, and Personal Trainer
From training to writing to vacationing, build a lifelong career in fitness
With over 35 years in health & fitness, Nancy is as passionate and inspired as ever. From writing fitness columns in her local newspaper to leading running camps, owning boutique gyms to running fitness vacations, Nancy has impacted hundreds of lives in her role as a fitness professional. Thinking back to her career, she had no idea where her certification would take her. After the ACE Exam, she used her confidence in her newfound knowledge and skills to push beyond the doors of the gym to reach her community and beyond. The new clients that she received as referrals from existing clientele proved that that she was in the right place. Nancy often finds herself thinking how lucky she is to be doing what she loves for a living. Her advice for those starting out is,
"Be prepared for some long days in the beginning, but trust me, it will never feel like work as long as you keep your passion fitness alive!"

What score do I need to get on my exam to pass and become ACE Certified?
To pass your ACE Certification Exam and become ACE Certified, you must earn a score of at least 500 out of a possible score of 800.
Exam-Related
How is the ACE Exam scored?
All four ACE Certification Programs have competency-based assessments comprised of multiple-choice exams with 125 scored items (or questions) and 25 experimental items (or questions) that make up the entire certification exam. Candidates are given three hours to complete an ACE Exam for any of the four ACE Certification Programs.
What content will be tested on the exam?
Exam content outlines for ACE Certification Programs are updated each time ACE conducts a Role Delineation Study for the certification program, which occurs on a five-year rotating basis for the ACE Personal Trainer, Group Fitness Instructor, and Health Coach Certification Programs, and every five to seven years for the ACE Medical Exercise Specialist Certification Program. This is a critical step to ensure that professional certification programs stay relevant and current, with examinations that reflect the composition and focus as established and validated through the Role Delineation Study. Exam content outlines serve as blueprints for the development of each exam for a given certification program. ACE Certification Exam content outlines are typically divided into major areas of responsibility called Domains. Each Domain represents a logical grouping of Task Statements that detail the job-related functions under each domain. Each Task Statement has associated knowledge and skills deemed necessary to perform the task in a practical setting.
Detailed exam content outlines with complete knowledge and skill statements for each ACE Certification Program can be found below:
Personal Trainer
Group Fitness Instructor
ACE Health Coach
Medical Exercise Specialist
What is the ACE Exam like?
All four ACE Certification Exams consist of 150 multiple-choice questions. 125 of the 150 questions are scored while the other 25 are experimental questions are not scored and thus do not count towards your overall exam score. Candidates are given three hours to complete their ACE Exam. Exam results are available immediately upon submission of your exam. Additionally, you will see your exam results posted in your My ACE Account under the "My Scheduled Exams and Results" section.
COVID-related
Do I need to wear a mask at a live test site?
The COVID-19 situation continues to remain very fluid. At this time, mask-wearing policies will vary based on different state, city, and test venue policies. Candidates
must
bring a mask to the testing center in case the center requires a mask. Even if the testing center does not require a mask, you will be permitted to wear one if you prefer. Failure to follow the testing site policy may result in a dismissal and forfeiture of your exam fee.
I am scheduled for my ACE Exam. How do I know if it is still taking place?
If an exam site closes, you will receive a notification from our testing agency, Meazure Learning, informing you of the site closure. You will then be directed to the ACE website to choose a new exam date. For a list of site closures, click here:
https://assessments.meazurelearning.com/mainsite/ibtsites/site_closings.aspx
.
I am trying to schedule a new exam or reschedule my exam date, but I keep getting the following message: The site you selected has limited availability or is currently sold out for the months you are viewing. What exactly does this message mean?
You may find some sites are still closed due to COVID-19 and have removed testing opportunities from the scheduling calendar; however, there are currently over 1200 exam sites open worldwide. Exam sites are taking extra precautions to maintain a clean and safe environment for exam candidates. Regular cleanings are occurring, and proctors are spacing candidates according to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) social distancing recommendations. Candidates are permitted, or may be required, to wear a mask. The mask must remain in place throughout the exam and is subject to proctor inspection when testing at an exam site.

Live Remote Proctoring (LRP)
General Information
Does ACE offer LRP testing in countries other than the US/Canada?
Yes, ACE does currently offer live remote proctoring internationally to those candidates who wish to take English-language exams for the ACE Personal Trainer, Group Fitness Instructor, Health Coach, and Medical Exercise Specialist Certifications.
How long will live remote proctoring (LRP) be an option for ACE Certification Exams?
Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the National Commission for Certifying Agencies (NCCA) initially approved NCCA-accredited certification programs to offer testing using live remote proctoring (LRP) for a limited time with the potential that it may become a more permanent option for test-takers. As of November 16, 2020, the NCCA announced that NCCA-accredited certification programs may continue to offer LRP indefinitely.
How should I conduct myself during my LRP exam?
All ACE Candidates are expected to conduct themselves in a professional manner during their ACE Exam. This includes cooperating with, and being considerate of, the proctor.
Is ACE Exam content confidential?
The content, including each item (or question) on the ACE Exam, is the property of ACE and Meazure Learning. ACE Examinations are copyrighted, and all exam information is strictly confidential. You are prohibited from retaining, copying, distributing, disclosing, discussing, or receiving any examination content. This includes emailing, copying, or printing files and/or reconstructing content through memorization before, during, or after the exam. Doing so may result in disciplinary action. By proceeding with the exam, you are acknowledging and agreeing that you understand these restrictions and the consequences if you violate these restrictions.
Is there a chance that live remote proctoring (LRP) will become a regular option for ACE Certification Exams?
Yes, the NCCA has conducted a pilot study to determine the effectiveness, validity, and security of live remote proctoring. The results of this pilot study provided sufficient evidence that live remote proctoring is acceptable long-term for NCCA-accredited certification programs. Moving forward, ACE will continue offer LRP exams while maintaining NCCA-accreditation of ACE Certification Programs.
What is live remote proctoring (LRP) and why is ACE offering this testing option?
Live remote proctoring (LRP) is a method for administering certification exams to candidates on their own computer through a secure online delivery system. With LRP, a proctor actively watches and monitors the candidate during the exam administration to provide real time security to protect exam integrity. This allows ACE to offer exam candidates the option to sit for ACE Certification Exams from their home should candidates not want to test at a computer-based exam site.
What is expected for live remote proctored (LRP) exams?
During a live remote proctored exam, candidates are expected to display the same testing behaviors as they would during an exam offered at an exam site with an in-person proctor. Please report on time for your scheduled ACE Exam.
Be advised: Electronic devices (iPods, MP3 players, headphones, pagers, computers, PDAs, other electronic devices with memory, cameras, smart phones, cell phones, and optical readers) are prohibited. Food and beverages are not allowed during your exam, and smoking is not permitted at any time. Personal writing utensils including paper, pencils, and books are not permitted. Coats, large jackets, hats, hoods, or any other headgear are not permitted in the exam room unless required for religious purposes. Please contact
ExamRegistration@acefitness.org
prior to your exam if you require accommodations for religious purposes. All other items are subject to the proctor's inspection. Sweaters and jackets without pockets are acceptable. Medicine, including cough drops, are not permitted unless permission is provided in advance. If the temperature of the room you will be testing in could be unpredictable, then it is recommended you dress in layers for your exam.
Which exams are being offered through live remote proctoring (LRP)?
Currently, ACE is offering LRP exams in English only for the ACE Personal Trainer, Group Fitness Instructor, Health Coach, and Medical Exercise Specialist Certifications.
Information to ensure a successful LRP experience.

Registration for live remote proctored (LRP) exams
Can I use my voucher to register for a live remote proctored (LRP) exam?
Yes, exam vouchers may be redeemed for a live remote proctored ACE certification exam. Please note: Currently, this option only applies to candidates registering for English-language exams for the ACE Personal Trainer, Group Fitness Instructor, Health Coach, and Medical Exercise Specialist Certification Exams.
How do I know which time zone to select for my LRP exam?
If you are not confident which time zone you are in, please Google this information prior to selecting your exam time.
How much testing availability is there for LRP?
Meazure Learning offers live remote proctored testing (LRP) 24 hours per day, seven days a week. Exam times are based upon supply and demand and are first come first serve. LRP provides candidates with more flexibility to sit for their exam. Candidates should check their schedules for any potential conflicts prior to selecting an exam date and time.
I am registered, how do I schedule my date and time for my LRP exam?
To schedule your specific exam date and time for your LRP exam, please refer to the American Council on Exercise Notice to Schedule email that you receive within 24 hours of registering for your exam. The email is sent from
candidatesupport@meazurelearning.com
and in the email is a link, username, and password to use to schedule your LRP exam.
I've registered for my ACE Exam; how soon can I schedule my exam date and time?
For live remote proctoring, you must schedule your exam date and time at least 24 hours in advance of your requested exam time.
Is there any cost difference between taking my exam at a live site or via live remote proctoring (LRP)?
No, the exam fees are the same for either test delivery option.
My original exam was scheduled at a live site and has been cancelled due to COVID-19. Can I reschedule for a live remote proctored (LRP) exam?
Yes, we encourage exam candidates who are ready to sit for their exam to reschedule to a live remote proctored exam.
Once I have completed my registration, how long do I have to sit for my exam?
Upon submitting your exam registration with ACE, you will have 60 days to sit for your ACE Exam via live remote proctoring.
What does the registration process look like for live remote proctoring (LRP) exams?
Upon initiation of the exam registration process, the option for live remote proctoring (LRP) will appear as "Online (at-home)". LRP allows candidates to sit for their ACE Exam within 60-days of registration. Candidates will select the "Online (at-home)" as their testing option and proceed through the registration process accordingly. It is important to note that candidates do not schedule their date or time for their LRP exam in their My ACE Accounts. To select your desired exam date and time, please refer to the "ACE Notice to Schedule" email, which will be sent from
candidatesupport@meazurelearning.com
within 24 hours of completing your registration.
What exactly is an eligibility window?
All candidates who choose to test via live remote proctoring are assigned a 60-day eligibility window, which allows candidates to choose any exam date within 60-days of registration. Note: You may see the words, "eligibility window" and "eligibility period" used interchangeably.
What if I need to arrange for special accommodations for my live remote proctored exam?
Currently, extra time (time plus one half) is the only request that can be accommodated through live remote proctoring. Candidates with documented visual, physical, hearing, and/or learning disabilities that would prevent them from taking an examination under standard conditions, may request special testing accommodations and arrangements. Candidates with limited English proficiency, where English is not their primary language, may request extra testing time, which would allow for 4.5 hours of testing time rather than 3 hours. If you believe you are eligible for extra time on your ACE Exam, please submit your supporting documentation to
ExamRegistration@acefitness.org
prior to registration. An Exam Registration Representative will contact you to assist with placing your registration. Please note: ACE and Meazure Learning require at least 5 days notice for special accommodation requests for live remote proctoring.
What if I need to reschedule my LRP exam but have accommodations?
If your initial LRP exam was scheduled with accommodations and you are rescheduling within your original 60-day eligibility window, then your accommodations will automatically be carried over. If you are rescheduling for an exam date beyond your original 60-day eligibility window, please contact ACE Exam Registration via email (
ExamRegistration@acefitness.org
) or phone (888-825-3636) to ensure your accommodations are requested with your new registration.
What is the rescheduling policy for an LRP exam?
A candidate may reschedule their ACE Exam up to 24 hours prior to their scheduled exam time. The reschedule will be free of charge as long as a candidate is rescheduling within their original 60-day eligibility window. The candidate must reschedule their exam date and time by accessing Meazure Learning's online scheduling system here:
https://assessments.meazurelearning.com/registration
. Should a candidate want to reschedule their exam for a date beyond their given 60-day eligibility window, the $149 reschedule fee will apply.
Where do I go to reschedule or cancel my scheduled LRP exam?
Please refer to your Notice to Schedule email for the specific policies concerning rescheduling and cancelling. You may reschedule up to 24 hours in advance of your scheduled exam time. To reschedule your exam, click on this link (
https://assessments.meazurelearning.com/registration
) and log in with the username and password provided to you in your Notice to Schedule email from
candidatesupport@meazurelearning.com
.
Why do I see a different date in the Meazure Learning system than I do in My ACE Account?
The date shown in your ACE account is the date that your exam must be taken by which is 60-days from the time you registered. The date in the Meazure Learning platform will reflect the date and time you selected. If you choose a date beyond your 60-day eligibility window, you will receive messaging in red that states, "The date you have chosen is outside of your eligibility period. If needed, please return to Meazure Learning's scheduling system via your Notice to Schedule to review your eligibility period".
LRP Exam Day
Am I allowed any breaks during my LRP exam?
Due to the security of the exam there are
NO BREAKS
of any kind allowed during your ACE Exam. If you leave your exam room for any reason, then your exam session will be terminated immediately. If you know you need to take a break(s) for any reason during your exam, ACE encourages you to register for a computer-based exam as breaks are permitted at exam sites.
Am I allowed scratch paper and writing utensil during my LRP exam?
No. You are not permitted to use scratch paper, nor personal writing utensils, during your LRP exam. However, you will have access to a basic 4-function calculator and an Open Notes feature via the test delivery program.
Can I have any open windows and/or files on my computer during my LRP exam?
No. You may not have any open windows and/or files on your computer during your ACE Exam. Note, if you do have open windows and/or files open on your computer when first connecting via cloud-based video communications app, the proctor will be able to see those items. If you have not closed all window and files prior to check-in, then you will need to close all documents, programs, browser tabs, etc. prior to the start of your exam.
Can I use multiple monitors when sitting for my LRP exam?
You will not be permitted to use multiple monitors during your ACE Exam. You may only use one monitor when sitting for your exam. Please disconnect any additional monitors prior to the start of your exam.
Can I use wireless ear buds when taking the exam?
No. The wearing of earbuds of any kind during the exam is prohibited.
How early can I access my ACE Exam?
You may access your exam no more than 15 minutes prior to your scheduled exam time. Note: The proctor will log on at your scheduled start time.
How much time will I have to take my LRP exam?
Similiar to testing at a live exam site, you will have three hours to complete your LRP exam unless special testing accommodations have been requested and approved. Please note, your exam time begins after the check-in process and after the demo should you choose to view it.
What are the exam day instructions for live remote proctored (LRP) exams?
On your exam day, log in to your ProctorU account using the details above.
Please keep your cell phone with you until the proctor instructs you to store your phone and belongings away from the exam area.
ONCE YOU HAVE LOGGED IN ON EXAM DAY:
Click the "Start Session" button to begin connecting with your proctor.
Please note the start session button will not be live until 3 minutes prior to your scheduled exam start time.
Your proctor will complete the check in process and log you in to the exam.
You must have your exam password and government issued ID readily available upon logging into your exam session.
Please plan for the check-in process and procedures to take 15-20 minutes prior to beginning your exam.
If there are technical issues lasting longer than 15 minutes the proctor will transfer you to a technical support agent for further assistance.  If you are unable to begin your exam within 30 minutes of your appointment time, you may request to reschedule your appointment.
If you proceed to start the examination following technical troubleshooting, you are confirming that you are aware you are starting the exam past your appointment time and will not be eligible for a retake on the basis of the exam starting late.
The timer for your exam will not start until you are presented with the first question of your exam (the login process does not take away from your exam time).
PLEASE NOTE: You must stay online after submitting your exam. Do not disconnect from the exam until the proctor dismisses you. Your proctor will have two or three quick procedures for you to follow before disconnecting. If you disconnect from the exam before your proctor has dismissed you, ProctorU will send a report to Meazure Learning, who may inform your exam client.
What do I do if I experience a technical issue during my LRP exam?
If you experience a technical issue during your LRP exam, please notify the proctor immediately. The proctor will do all they can to assist you in troubleshooting your issue; however, if they are unable to resolve the issue, then they may prompt you to contact ACE to reschedule your exam. If you are prompted to do so, please contact ACE Exam Registration via email (
ExamRegistration@acefitness.org
) or phone (888-825-3636) within 48 hours of your scheduled exam.
What do I need to bring to my LRP exam?
Please have your Scheduling Confirmation Notice and your current government-issued photo ID available. Acceptable forms of ID include a current state ID, driver's license, passport, passport card, AADHAR card, green card, and military ID card. Temporary and expired photo IDs will not be acceptable. Your ID will need to be in English so that it can be verified by the proctor during the check in process. If the ID cannot be verified, you will be asked to reschedule your appointment to a local test site. Note: You will not be asked to show your CPR/AED card or certificate on the day of your exam.
What items are NOT allowed within my testing space during the scheduled exam?
Candidates are expressly prohibited from having the following items in the room in which they are testing:
Cameras, smart phones, cell phones, optical readers, or other electronic devices that include the ability to photograph, photocopy, or otherwise copy exam materials.
Notes, books, manuals, dictionaries, or language dictionaries.
Book bags or luggage, purses or handbags, iPods, mp3 players, headphones, or pagers.
Calculators (Note: an online calculator is built into the exam system for candidates to use), computers, PDAs, or other electronic devices with one or more memories, personal writing utensils (e.g., pencils, pens, highlighters), watches, food and beverage, and coats and jackets.
Hats, hoods, or other headwear are not permitted while testing unless required for religious purposes. If you require special accommodations due to religious purposes, please email ACE Exam Registration (
ExamRegistration@acefitness.org
) prior to registering for your exam to ensure your testing needs can be met.
Sweaters and sweatshirts without pockets or hoods are permitted.
All items are subject to inspection by the proctor if suspicious behavior is detected.
Will I have access to a calculator during my exam?
Exam candidates for all four ACE Certification programs will have access to a
basic four-function calculator with the following functions: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Candidates will have access to an online calculator that is part of Meazure Learning’s testing platform. Candidates are not allowed to bring their own calculators. This act would constitute cheating and be subject to“
ACE’s Professional Practices and Disciplinary Procedures
”.

Is my testing environment ideal for live remote proctored (LRP) testing?
When ACE Certification Exams are administered at live test sites, the environment is controlled by ACE's testing vendor, Meazure Learning. Live remote proctored (LRP) exams place the burden of establishing an ideal testing environment on the candidate. Considerations the candidate must think about prior to committing to a live remote proctored exam include:
Do I have a private room/space/area free from people, animals, etc.?
Do I have a workstation and environment (e.g., comfortable seating at a hard desk or table surface, ergonomically friendly workstation, proper lighting, comfortable room temperature) that will allow me to perform to the best of my ability?
Is my computer compatible with LRP requirements?
Do I have adequate high-speed Internet connection?
Will I be free of noise and other distractions during my ACE Exam?
Accreditation
How do I know if my certification is currently NCCA accredited?
The NCCA maintains a directory of current NCCA accredited certifications, which you can view at:
www.credentialingexcellence.org/nccadirectory
.
What does NCCA stand for?
NCCA stands for National Commission for Certifying Agencies and you can learn more about the NCCA at:
www.credentialingexcellence.org/ncca
.
What if I already have a certification that is not accredited by the NCCA?
In 2005, the International Health, Racquet and Sportsclub Association (IHRSA) recommended club owners only hire personal trainers with certifications from agencies accredited through the NCCA or an equivalent accrediting organization. You can read more about that recommendation
here
. We encourage you to pursue an ACE Certification.
What is the benefit of holding an NCCA-accredited ACE Certification?
Earning a certification accredited by the National Commission for Certifying Agencies (NCCA) means that you as a fitness professional have the knowledge and appropriate level of professional recognition to hold a legitimate place on the healthcare continuum. It makes you more attractive to potential employers and should positively impact your compensation. Accreditation of a credentialing organization by NCCA is the standard for a large majority of well-respected allied health care professionals, including those in nursing, nutrition, and athletic training, to name a few.
When did ACE earn its NCCA accreditation?
ACE earned NCCA accreditation for all four of our core certifications (Personal Trainer, Group Fitness Instructor, Health Coach, and Medical Exercise Specialist) in 2003. Our organization is one of the few select certifying organizations in the entire fitness industry whose core certifications have all been accredited.
Which ACE Certifications are accredited by the NCCA?
All four of our core certifications (Personal Trainer, Group Fitness Instructor, Health Coach, and Medical Exercise Specialist) are accredited by the NCCA.

How to renew your ACE Credentials
Renewal process for ACE Personal Trainers, Health Coaches,
Group Fitness Instructors and Medical Exercise Specialists
Your ACE Credential sets you apart and indicates the utmost credibility and commitment to your clients and employers.
To continue delivering on your mission to get people moving, you must maintain a current ACE Certification or Certificate by earning continuing education credits (CECs) and renewing your credential every two years.
The ACE Credential renewal process is simple and ensures you won't have to sit for the exam again in the future. Just complete the steps below.
4 Easy Steps to Renew
1. Earn 20 hours of ACE-Approved CECs
Complete 20 hours (2.0 CECs) of ACE-Approved continuing education within your two-year renewal cycle–only 10 hours (1.0 CECs) per year.
Complete your continuing education between the start and end dates of your renewal cycle, available in your My ACE profile.
Choose from thousands of ACE-Approved courses. Ensure you complete one hour (0.1 CEC) on Professional Conduct & Ethics every two years to renew your credential. View FAQs about this requirement.

2. Enter your CECs into My ACE
CECs from ACE courses are automatically entered into your My ACE Account. For other ACE-Approved providers, enter the course (CEP) number, CEC value, and completion date
using this easy tool
.
Courses that have not yet been ACE-Approved can be petitioned for CECs.
View FAQs about the petition process
.
You cannot repeat continuing education courses to fulfill your renewal requirements.
CECs can only be applied toward the renewal cycle in which they are completed. While additional continuing education is always encouraged, CECs in excess of the required 2.0 will not be rolled over and credited toward future credential renewals.
If you hold multiple ACE Credentials, CECs for one ACE Credential can be applied to another ACE Credential as long as they are completed within that credential's renewal cycle.
3. Update your CPR/AED information
As a health and exercise professional, it's vital that you're prepared if a client experiences a life-threatening event, which is why ACE requires you to maintain a current adult CPR/AED certificate. You can easily update your CPR (and AED if you are in the U.S. or Canada) certification details in your
My ACE Account
. Plus, earning this certification is worth up to 0.4 CECs!

ACE Professional Conduct & Ethics Continuing Education Requirement FAQs
Why is Professional Conduct & Ethics education a requirement?
ACE wants health and fitness clients to receive safe exercise instruction and health coaching from well-qualified professionals, while at the same time helping ACE Certified Professionals to limit their own professional liability. To achieve these goals, it is important that ACE Certified Professionals remain current on topics related to risk management, professional liability, ethical and legal business practices, scopes of practice and professional boundaries, client confidentiality and protected health information, and best practices for fostering equity, diversity, inclusion, and culture.
By requiring at least 0.1 CEC (1 hour) of education every two years be focused on topics in the Professional Conduct & Ethics category, ACE is helping ACE Certified Professionals to stay current on these topics.
What is Professional Conduct & Ethics continuing education?
The topics in the Professional Conduct & Ethics continuing education category are pulled directly from the "Professional Conduct and Risk Management" Domain in the exam content outlines for each ACE Certification.
Relevant topics include ethical and legal business practices, risk management and liability procedures, client confidentiality and protected health information, and best practices for fostering equity, diversity, inclusion, and culture.
How is Professional Conduct & Ethics continuing education related to renewing my ACE Certification(s)?
ACE requires all ACE Certified Professionals to complete one hour (0.1 CEC) out of the total 20 hours (2.0 CECs) of continuing education focused on Professional Conduct & Ethics during every two-year certification period to become eligible to renew their ACE Certification(s).
Complete renewal requirements include:
20 hours (2.0 CECs) of ACE-approved continuing education
1 hour (0.1 CEC) out of the total 20 hours (2.0 CECs) must be from the Professional Conduct & Ethics category
A current CPR/AED certificate
A renewal fee
ACE has never required me to be current on Professional Conduct and Ethics related topics in the past. Why now?
ACE reviews its certification and recertification requirements on a regular basis to ensure that they are current for the specific job role (e.g., personal trainer) and aligned with industry-wide best practices for professionals to remain competent. Questions specifically addressing scope of practice, ethical and legal business practices, risk management and liability procedures, client confidentiality, privacy and protected health information, and best practices for fostering equity, diversity, inclusion, and culture make up 15-19% of all ACE Certification exams. Knowing that competence in these areas is required to earn an ACE Certification, staying current in them is important to maintain an ACE Certification.
ACE implemented this certification renewal requirement to help ACE Certified Professionals stay current with these key professional conduct and risk management topics. The decision was made with input from ACE's certification committee members and feedback from employers that the change was both reasonable and appropriate for the professions for which ACE offers certifications.
How can I meet the Professional Conduct & Ethics continuing education requirement?
You may choose from any of the following options to meet the requirement:
Complete an ACE-approved course from the ACE Continuing Education catalog
here
. Eligible courses are denoted with an
Ethics Course
icon.

here
.
How much do eligible courses cost?
The cost of courses varies. View a list of eligible courses
here
.
If I have multiple ACE Certifications, do I have to take an eligible course to meet the Professional Conduct & Ethics continuing education requirement for each certification or does one eligible course count across all of my certifications?
If you complete one eligible course within the timeframe when all ACE Certifications are current, it will count toward all certifications.
I already took one of the courses in the Professional Conduct & Ethics continuing education category. Can I apply that towards this requirement?
Eligible courses taken within your current certification cycle will fulfill this requirement and be reflected in your My ACE Account. Any eligible courses taken during a prior certification cycle would not apply to your current certification renewal.
How will ACE know that I completed an ACE-approved Professional Conduct & Ethics course?
Eligible courses will be automatically recognized in your My ACE Account as fulfilling this requirement. You can track your status in the
Manage My CECs
section of your My ACE Account.
I have CEC Power Pass. Will eligible courses be included in my membership?
Yes! You can easily recognize eligible courses in the CEC Power Pass course catalog by looking for the
Ethics Course
icon next to the course.

Common Study Questions
Client Consultations
Do I have to know all of the assessments when studying for the Personal Training exam?
Technically, everything in the manual can appear on the exam, however, we recommend spending more time focusing on the main ideas versus memorizing each step of the protocol. Know the objective or purpose of each assessment, for whom it is appropriate and any contraindications, and what the outcome reveals about the client. We also recommend reviewing the following blog posts:
Physiological Assessments:
Cardiovascular Assessments
Posture and Movement Assessments
Communication and Behavior Change
What's the difference between pre-contemplation and contemplation?
Preparation
Most of the time, if someone has made the effort to meet with a fitness professional, he or she has at least reached the preparation stage. However, you may encounter someone who is still in the pre-contemplation or contemplation stage. When this happens, that person has usually been prompted to meet with you by his or her doctor or a loved one.
Pre-contemplation
If a person is in pre-contemplation, he or she typically does not want to be there and does not believe that exercise can have an impact on health. In this case, it's important for you to take the appropriate steps to get the potential exerciser thinking about inactivity as a relevant issue and to start thinking about becoming more physically active. Some of the interventions used during this stage include providing information about the risks of inactivity and the benefits of activity, acknowledging that there is a lack of readiness to change and reevaluating current behaviors. The reason why it's important to recognize individuals in this stage of change is because people in pre-contemplation aren't necessarily open to the idea of exercise. Therefore, you could potentially increase resistance to physical activity by pushing the idea that they must exercise. However, if you provide information on how exercise can benefit them and then offer your expertise as a resource, while encouraging questions or allowing them to voice their concerns, you can essentially "plant the seed" so that they may consider exercise (moving them to contemplation).
A practical tool the fitness professional can use to determine if someone is in contemplation or pre-contemplation is to ask the following question: "On a scale of 1 to 10 how ready do you believe you are to make this change or adopt this healthy behavior?" If the potential client provides a response below 4, he or she is most likely in the pre-contemplation stage.
Contemplation
A person in the contemplation stage, however, knows the value of exercise, but for whatever reason is not regularly engaging in it. A contemplator is starting to consider the importance of becoming more physically active and has begun to recognize the implications of being inactive. He or she might have an internal dialogue that sounds like this: "I know I should exercise, but I just don't have the time, energy, etc." At this point, the person is allowing the cons of engaging in exercise to outweigh the pros of becoming more physically active. This is the point where we want to encourage the potential client to introduce some type of activity into their day, even if it means starting small, like walking for 10 minutes twice a day. Successfully achieving small tasks related to exercise may get them to realize that regular physical activity can be a part of their life if they can take the appropriate steps to commit. During this stage it is important to help clients explore options (like preferences for physical activity), and provide cues to action, some basic structure and design (such as how often and how long to be active), and opportunities to ask questions.
Tools a fitness professional may use with someone in this stage include the evaluation of the pros and cons of making the change and removing barriers to becoming more active, such as offering a free gym trial.
How do I apply the Operant Conditioning Learning Process?
Operant conditioning is a learning theory that considers how personal actions are influenced by their consequences.
As an exercise and health professional, effectively applying this principle may help facilitate changes in clients’ lifestyle behaviors. The key is to identify factors (antecedents) that may trigger a client’s behavior versus addressing only the behavior.
Take, for example, a client who is prone to overeating (behavior), which contributes to the client having obesity (consequence). Through
motivational interviewing
, it is discovered that the client’s job is quite stressful, which leads him or her to seek food for emotional comfort. Consequentially, this results in the client consuming an excess of daily calories, which is a factor in the client having obesity.
So, here you learn the stimulus that triggers overeating is stress on the job. Therefore, to facilitate changes in behavior, an exercise and health professional may address the client’s job stress (antecedent).
Ideally, once the stress (stimuli) is
effectively managed
, we would hope that the client’s desire to overeat (behavior) would cease, thus resulting in a decrease in daily caloric intake, ultimately leading to weight loss (consequence).
As the client begins to lose weight and recognizes that managing his or her stress decreases the desire to overeat, the stress-management behavior is rewarded, thereby the behavior increases (positive reinforcement).
Exercise Science
How can I identify in which plane of motion an action takes place?
In this activity, we’re going to use a wall to represent the planes, and all motions you make must be parallel to that wall to occur in that plane:
Frontal Plane
Back yourself up to a wall so that your entire backside is against the wall. Pretend this wall is in your center, dividing you into anterior and posterior halves. This imaginary wall represents the frontal plane. To practice the motions that occur in this plane, you must keep your entire backside and limbs against the wall behind you. Motions in this plane would include movements like making snow angels (adduction/abduction) and elevating and depressing the shoulders. Notice, if you try to do a biceps curl, you would have to lift your forearm off of the wall, so this indicates that flexion and extension do not occur in the frontal plane.
Sagittal Plane:
Turn to one side and place your side against the wall (your arm might have to be slightly in front of the body to get hip against the wall). Pretend this wall is in your center, dividing you into right and left halves. This wall represents the sagittal plane. For this plane, you must keep your side against the wall. Movements in the sagittal plane would include biceps curls (that is, flexion and extension), deadlifts, and squats. Any movement where you can keep the side of your body parallel to the wall takes place in the sagittal plane. Notice, if you try to do the motions described for the frontal plane (abduction and adduction or elevation and depression) or any twisting motion, you would have to lift your side off of the wall or move through the wall.
Transverse Plane
This one is a little harder to imagine, but it can be represented by visualizing your body is divided into top and bottom halves and then placing your torso on top of a table and your lower extremities below the table. Movements that occur in this plane should keep the body or a specific joint parallel to the table. This would include movements like rotation of the trunk, pronation, and supination of the forearm, and circumduction of the thumb. Notice, performing any of the activities previously mentioned in the other planes would cause you to intersect with the “table.”

I'm confused about the different terminology used for VT1 and VT2. Please help.
Many texts use varied terminology related to the metabolic markers used to describe the physiological response to cardiorespiratory exercise. In the ACE manuals, VT1 and VT2 will be used, but it is important to recognize the other commonly used terms when reviewing the literature:
The first ventilatory threshold (VT1) is also referred to as the lactate threshold and the anaerobic threshold.
The second ventilatory threshold (VT2) is also referred to as the respiratory compensation threshold and the onset of blood lactate accumulation (OBLA).
Another potential source of confusion involves the term "anaerobic threshold," which has come to mean different things in various parts of the world based on the way it was used in early research on the topic. This is another reason ACE has chosen to utilize VT1 and VT2 throughout this manual.
What's the difference between autogenic and reciprocal inhibition?
Autogenic inhibition involves stimulation of the Golgi tendon  organ (GTO) during a muscular contraction. The GTO is a proprioceptor  responsible for sensing increases in tension during both concentric and  eccentric actions. Performing a muscular action activates the GTO causing that  muscle’s fibers  (specifically, the agonist’s fibers) to relax. Under GTO activation, the  agonist muscle is inhibited causing the fibers to lengthen.
A practical example of autogenic inhibition is observed during  static stretching. During a static stretch muscle tension temporarily increases  and after holding the stretch for 7 to 10 seconds the GTO is activated. When  the GTO is activated, the muscle spindle is inhibited. The muscle spindle  protects us from overstretching, so if this function is inhibited we can move into  a deeper stretch.
Reciprocal inhibition involves stimulation of the muscle spindle  during the stretching of muscle fibers. The muscle spindle wraps around the  muscle fibers in a parallel fashion and will stretch as muscle fibers stretch.  When a muscle group is stretched, the muscle spindle activates causing the  stretched muscle (agonist) to contract and the antagonist muscle group to  relax. Reciprocal inhibition is also known as the stretch reflex.
A practical example of reciprocal inhibition occurs during  proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation (PNF). During this stretching  technique, a low grade muscular contraction of the antagonist muscle (in this  case, the muscle group opposite of the muscle group targeted to receive the  stretch) is held for 6 to 15 seconds. This low grade muscle contraction  inhibits the muscle spindle activity in the agonist muscle (in this case, the  muscle targeted to be stretched) allowing that muscle to be stretched further.

The Three Energy Systems Explained
Phosphagen System (short-acting)
The most immediate source of energy at the onset of activity or upon increased intensity is the phosphagen system, which uses creatine phosphate (CP) to produce ATP. CP is a high-energy compound that is rapidly produced but is quickly depleted during muscular contraction; thus it is available for only a limited amount of time—usually 10-30 seconds—before it is exhausted. How quickly it is used depends on the intensity of the exercise. Activities such as plyometric exercise use the phosphagen system for ATP production.
Anaerobic Glycolysis (intermediate)
Anaerobic (without oxygen) glycolysis is a process that uses glycogen (stored glucose) for ATP production. Glycogen is available in greater quantities and for longer periods than CP—up to 3 minutes for activities such as moderate-intensity resistance training. During endurance activities, fuel needs are met by anaerobic glycolysis prior to approaching steady-state aerobic metabolism.
Aerobic System (long-acting)
The aerobic system takes over during endurance activities after the anaerobic systems become depleted, and fats and carbohydrates emerge as the primary sources for ATP production. During aerobic activity, there is an abundance of oxygen readily available to be used in the process of metabolizing carbohydrates and fat. This allows activities to be sustained for 30-60 minutes or more at moderate intensity. Cycling at a moderate intensity for 30 minutes, for example, primarily uses the aerobic system for ATP production.
During physical activity, these systems may be used at any time, working together to contribute to the total energy needs of the body. They do not work independently of each other; however, one system will dominate depending on the intensity of the activity and the demands placed on the body.
Activities performed for extended periods, which typically rely on the aerobic system, can also utilize the anaerobic system.
For example, in distance running, the aerobic system is the most dominant source of ATP production. However, during periods where the runner accelerates, and the intensity increases, one of the anaerobic systems will become more prevalent in ATP production.

The Three Primary Energy Pathways Explained
Note: Both the phosphagen and anaerobic glycolysis systems are considered anaerobic, as they both produce energy in the absence of oxygen.
Industry Updates for Exam Candidates and Certified Professionals
Where can I find the most updated industry guidelines (e.g., Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans, ACSM's preparticipation health screening guidelines, and blood pressure guidelines)?
The most updated industry guidelines can be found at
https://www.acefitness.org/industry-guidelines/
How do I find the most recent Physical Activity Readiness Questionnaire for Everyone (PAR-Q+) form?
This important screening document is regularly updated and revised and there are different versions depending on the clientele with whom you are working. The PAR-Q+ and ePARmed-X (for clients who have had a positive response to the PAR-Q+ or have been referred to use this more comprehensive form by a healthcare professional) were created to reduce barriers for all individuals to become more physically active. These forms are updated on a regular basis. The PAR-Q+ Collaboration makes these publicly available on their website. Visit the following website to find the most up-to-date version of each questionnaire before using it with clients:
eparmedx.com
Please note:
When guidelines are updated, ACE takes steps to ensure that candidates have a fair opportunity to pass an exam that is not negatively impacted by the updates. As a professional standard, all health coaches and exercise professionals should do their best to stay up-to-date on industry guidelines and standards of care.
Physical Assessments
How do you calculate the ratios for McGill's Torso Test?
Please refer to the
McGill's Torso Test
video.
The McGill's Torso Muscular Endurance Test Battery assesses the endurance of three torso muscle groups and is comprised of the following tests:
Trunk Flexor Endurance Test: assesses the muscular endurance of the deep core muscles.
Trunk Lateral Endurance Test: also called the side bridge test, assesses the muscular endurance of the lateral core muscles.
Trunk Extensor Endurance Test: assesses the muscular endurance of the torso extensor muscles.
Poor endurance of the torso muscles or an imbalance between the three muscle groups can contribute to low back pain and core instability
The tests are performed individually and involve a static, timed, isometric contraction of the core muscles stabilizing the spine until the individual exhibits fatigue. The results are evaluated collectively in the following ratios to indicate balanced endurance among the muscle groups:
Flexion: Extension
For the muscular balance between the front and back of the torso, the ratio should be less than 1.0 (ratio means dividing the two numbers).
In this case, the ratio refers to the number of seconds held in each position or flexion time/extension time.
Right-side bridge (RSB): Left-side bridge (LSB)
Right-side bridge time/left-side bridge time
For the muscular balance between the sides of the torso, the score should be no greater than 0.05 from a balanced score of 1.0 (that is, an acceptable range would be a score somewhere between 0.95 to 1.05).
Side bridge (SB) (either side): Extension
One-side bridge time/extension time
For muscular balance between one side and the back of the torso, the score should be less than 0.75.
Let's work through an example. A client completed the three tests with the following results:
Flexor Test: 120 seconds
RS Bridge: 88 seconds
Extension Test: 150 seconds
LS Bridge: 92 seconds
Scoring and Evaluation
Flexion: Extension
120 seconds:150 seconds = 120/150 = 0.8
The score of 0.8 fits within the criteria of <1.0 for muscular balance between the front and back of the torso.
RSB: LSB
88 seconds:92 seconds = 88/92 = 0.96 (0.956 rounded up)
This score fits within the 0.05 range from 1.0 (that is, it falls between 0.95 and 1.05), indicating muscular balance between the right and left sides of the torso.
Side bridge (choose one side at a time, but remember to perform the ratio calculation for both sides): Extension
RSB = 88 seconds:150 seconds = 88/150 = 0.59 (0.586 rounded up)
This score fits within the criteria of <0.75 for muscular balance between the right side and the back of the torso.
Side bridge: Extension
LSB = 92 seconds:150 seconds = 92/150 = 0.61 (0.613 rounded down)
This score fits within the criteria of <0.75 for muscular balance between the right side and the back of the torso.
The results show that this client has well-balanced torso muscles.
What is the difference between the Talk Test and the Submaximal Talk Test?
The talk test is a method for monitoring and controlling exercise intensity, using respiration effort, and the ability to speak.  An individual, being able to speak comfortably with more than a few words indicates that he or she is likely below the first ventilatory threshold, VT1.  When using the talk test, it is not required that the heart rate be measured, as the objective is to observe respiratory (breathing) effort and the ability to speak.
The individual is evaluated by having them recite a familiar passage or phrase like the pledge of allegiance, and then asking if they can speak.
In contrast to the simplicity of the Talk Test, the Submaximal Talk Test for VT1 is a formal assessment used to determine heart rate at VT1. This test requires preparation and equipment and continuous monitoring of heart rate to avoid missing VT1. The intensity is gradually increased until the ability to talk continuously is compromised, and like the talk test uses a familiar passage or phrase to evaluate effort and ability to speak.
In summary, the talk test method is used to measure exercise intensity but does not require the measurement of heart rate. While the submaximal talk test for VT1 is a formal assessment where heart rate is measured at VT1 and requires the use of equipment and preparation, to administer the test.
There are so many physiological assessments how do I approach them and is it necessary to know all the content in the tables?
For the physiological assessments section, there are numerous amounts of information, from the administration of assessments and accompanying charts, tables, and equations.  The key to approaching this section is to be strategic. Since there is no practical component to the exam, you are not expected to memorize the exact protocol of each assessment or all the information presented in the tables and charts.  However, understanding what information you are gathering from the assessment concerning the client is essential.
One helpful way to tackle the content is to categorize the information. Ask the questions:
What is the purpose/objective of this assessment?
For whom is the assessment most appropriate?
What are the outcomes that I am seeking to observe?
Are there any contraindications?
What do the results mean?
Gathering this information will allow you to remain organized as you complete this section of the course. While you are not expected to memorize the chart and table information, you also do not want to disregard them. For example, recognizing that for BMI, a score of ≥ 30 mg/m² places a client in the obesity category, is an essential factor to remember. On the other hand, memorizing all the data on the Rockport Fitness Walking test would not be the most effective use of your time.
How do I select the appropriate assessments for my client?
The process of selecting assessments is dependent on several factors and is not always a black-and-white or linear process. Different assessments may be administered throughout the course of the client-health and exercise professional relationship and factors like health history, current fitness level, lifestyle factors, and goals determine which assessments may be most appropriate for the client.
Prior to performing any physical assessments—in the initial investigation stage—information about the client is gathered via the pre-participation health screening, using forms like a health-history questionnaire and PAR-Q to identify risk factors. This allows the health and exercise professional to determine if a physician’s clearance is needed or if there are any specific programming recommendations to be considered (e.g., considerations related to injury or chronic conditions like diabetes and hypertension).
Example of selecting appropriate assessments for a client with a shoulder condition and weight-loss goal:
Client:
John
Age:
45
Pre-participation screen:
Generally healthy with no chronic conditions. He previously tore his rotator cuff and has had surgery to repair the injury. He completed physical therapy over the past 4 months. He is not experiencing any pain or discomfort.
Physician recommendations:
Cleared to exercise. Continue with exercises from physical therapy and improve shoulder mobility.
Goals:
He has struggled with weight loss and desires to lose 40 pounds and improve strength in his shoulder.
Assessments:
Prior to developing an exercise program, the following assessments were performed. To establish baseline measurements for his weight loss goal, anthropometric assessments are performed [i.e., body mass index (BMI) and girth measurements]. A skinfold assessment may not be appropriate since John is currently 40 lb. overweight. In addition, a postural assessment and shoulder mobility tests (i.e., internal and external shoulder rotation and Apley’s scratch test) are performed to determine John’s current joint function. The results of these assessments may be used to design a safe and effective,
individualized
exercise program for John.
Generally, health and exercise professionals may choose to perform postural and/or movement-based assessments to determine the client’s level of functionality and/or the presence of any muscular imbalances before designing and implementing an exercise program. Additional assessments such as body composition, cardiorespiratory fitness, and sports skills may also be administered, depending on the client’s goals. These assessments allow the health and exercise professional to establish a baseline to compare against for tracking progress in a client’s program.
While assessments may be beneficial initially to create a personalized program for a client, it is important that the appropriate assessment is selected at the appropriate time. Not all clients will need or be receptive to assessments, as they may cause some people to become discouraged and demotivated, particularly if they are severely deconditioned or have overweight or obesity. To minimize client distress, be empathetic when selecting assessments, and consider the needs and goals of the individual.
Professional Behaviors
Is giving nutrition advice within a fitness professional's scope of practice?
As a certified fitness professional, it is outside of your scope of practice to design and implement nutrition plans or diets. Your role as a fitness professional is to educate your clients on nutrition and share your knowledge of healthy choices to help them adopt more healthful behaviors. This can include showing them how to utilize tools available at
www.choosemyplate.gov
or educating them about USDA Dietary Guidelines recommendations. If your client needs specific advice or a diet plan, refer them to a registered dietitian.
Within Scope of Practice for Fitness Professionals

What is VT1 and VT2?
During submaximal exercise, ventilation (or breathing rate) parallels oxygen uptake, and there is a linear increase between intensity and ventilation. This linear increase continues until exercise approaches the lactate threshold. At this point, ventilation begins to increase in a non-linear fashion, and ventilation is no longer directly linked with oxygen demand. This first disproportionate increase in oxygen consumption represents VT1 and occurs in response to an initial accumulation of metabolic by-products in the blood.
As exercise intensity continues to increase, there is a second disproportionate increase in ventilation that is associated with increased lactate production, which coincides with acidosis. Exercise immediately below VT2 represents the highest sustainable exercise intensity. Exercise above VT2 represents an intensity that cannot be sustained for long periods, and speech is not possible other than single words.

How much math will be on the exam? Which formulas will I have to memorize?
The test contains math-based questions to determine if you can use basic mathematics (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) to apply what you are learning to real-life scenarios. These questions will require calculations and memorization of some fitness formulas. However, you only need to know a few formulas for the exam, and they can all be found on this
Helpful Fitness Formulas sheet
. While all of these formulas are useful to know as a fitness professional, they may not all be specific to your test. It is recommended you cross-reference the equations on the handout with what is covered in your text. The exam program itself will have a calculator function, and you will also have access to scratch paper and a pencil.
I'm at the end of my studies. What else can I do to prepare?
Ask yourself the following questions:
Have I thoroughly used all of the materials I have available?
Have I reviewed the appropriate exam preparation blogs?
Have I practiced the assessments or teaching strategies on a friend or family member?
Have I tried to explain the topics out loud to see if I actually understand them?
Have I reached out to a study coach with my specific questions?
Have I reviewed the Exam Content Outline?
I'm looking for a study timeline for my Personal Training program. What do you suggest?
We generally advise spending 3 to 4 months studying and preparing yourself to not only pass the exam but also to prepare yourself to become a health and fitness professional. We suggest spending 12 to 15 hours on every lesson, which generally equates to taking 5 to 7 days to cover the videos, reading, study companion, and quiz.
What do I really need to focus on?
We highly recommend reviewing your Exam Content Outline, as this is essentially the "blueprint" for the exam. This will divide the information into multiple domains, and each domain has a set list of tasks that you will be expected to understand. Use the "knowledge of" and "skills in" sections to guide you and make sure you feel very comfortable with those sections. An excellent way to tell if you're comfortable with a topic is to try to explain it to someone else. If you feel confident that you could explain it to a client or class participant, then you're probably proficient with that topic; if you're not quite sure, then you'll probably want to review that topic.
How do I create an exam retake game plan?
Determine if you have a retake voucher.
If you have a retake voucher, it is important to know when it expires to understand how much time you have available to review before your next exam.
If you don’t have a retake voucher, you can purchase an additional exam at a discounted retake fee. This price is valid for one year after your initial test date.
Determine a date for your retake exam.
When choosing a date, we recommend giving yourself about one week of review time for every ten points you are away from a passing score. For example, if your score is 480 out of a possible 800 and you are 20 points away from the minimum passing score of 500, allow about two weeks of review before your next exam.
Analyze your performance and consider any topics on the exam for which you felt underprepared.
Review your exam score report and compare your domain performance to the Exam Content Outline. Review each domain and determine what areas need improvement.
Focus on improving the domains in which you scored the lowest, but also continue to briefly review the other domains to ensure that you keep all the content fresh in your mind.
Use all your study materials.
Be sure to use all the resources that are available to you. These could be in the form of books, online content, live and recorded webinars, facilitated study groups, peer-to-peer interaction on the
ACE Fitness Certification Study Center Facebook page
, and the
ACE Answers Landing Page
.
Consider what went well during your initial studies and what you might do differently.
Create a game plan for everything you want to do before you retake the exam. Writing down your plan may help create accountability.
Join the ACE Study Coaches for a webinar (available with specific study packages) or a
tutoring session
to get your specific questions answered.
How many times can I take my practice tests?
While the practice tests can be completed as many times as you would like, we do not recommend taking them repeatedly, as this may lead to memorization of correct answers, rather than a deeper understanding of the content.  Instead, try the tips and strategies shared below to get the most out of your certification exam practice tests.
Review your answers.
Look at the questions that were incorrect and go back to review the material. The goal is to understand the “why” behind the question and the correct answer. Try to explain why the correct answers are correct and why the other options are incorrect. A helpful way to use this strategy is to imagine you are teaching someone else why an answer is correct.
Look at the questions that were correct but were only guessed correctly. Review the corresponding content.
This is a great time for self-reflection. These practice tests are meant to serve as a diagnostic tool to identify what your strengths are and what areas need the most improvement. Be honest with yourself when reviewing the questions— determine whether you guessed the correct answer or if you really know why the correct answer is correct.
Review your overall practice test score report and compare your results to each domain of the Exam Content Outline.
After reviewing the practice test and studying your answers, clear out your answers from the practice test and go through it again. Look for changes in your score related to increased knowledge and understanding as opposed to memorization.  If questions are missed on the second attempt, it is important to again ask yourself why you might have marked them incorrectly.  Now move on to your next practice test and follow the same steps as above.

On your final due date, all other amounts owing under this Agreement shall also be due. All payments shall be made to the American Council on Exercise (ACE). No bills or invoices will be issued for any payments, except that a bill or invoice may be issued for past due amounts. Any past due amounts shall remain due and owning even if a bill or invoice is not issued. You may prepay your entire outstanding balance at any time with no penalty.

For all past-due amounts, interest shall accrue at the rate of 10% per annum or the highest rated allowed by applicable law, whichever is lower.

Should any term of this Agreement be deemed invalid or unenforceable, the remaining terms shall remain in full force and effect.

How to renew your ACE Credentials
Renewal process for ACE Personal Trainers, Health Coaches,
Group Fitness Instructors and Medical Exercise Specialists
Your ACE Credential sets you apart and indicates the utmost credibility and commitment to your clients and employers.
To continue delivering on your mission to get people moving, you must maintain a current ACE Certification or Certificate by earning continuing education credits (CECs) and renewing your credential every two years.
The ACE Credential renewal process is simple and ensures you won't have to sit for the exam again in the future. Just complete the steps below.
4 Easy Steps to Renew
1. Earn 20 hours of ACE-Approved CECs
Complete 20 hours (2.0 CECs) of ACE-Approved continuing education within your two-year renewal cycle–only 10 hours (1.0 CECs) per year.
Complete your continuing education between the start and end dates of your renewal cycle, available in your My ACE profile.
Choose from thousands of ACE-Approved courses. Ensure you complete one hour (0.1 CEC) on Professional Conduct & Ethics every two years to renew your credential. View FAQs about this requirement.
Explore alternative ways to earn CECs.

12 Creative Ways to Earn CECs
.
2. Enter your CECs into My ACE
CECs from ACE courses are automatically entered into your My ACE Account. For other ACE-Approved providers, enter the course (CEP) number, CEC value, and completion date
using this easy tool
.
Courses that have not yet been ACE-Approved can be petitioned for CECs.
View FAQs about the petition process
.
You cannot repeat continuing education courses to fulfill your renewal requirements.
CECs can only be applied toward the renewal cycle in which they are completed. While additional continuing education is always encouraged, CECs in excess of the required 2.0 will not be rolled over and credited toward future credential renewals.
If you hold multiple ACE Credentials, CECs for one ACE Credential can be applied to another ACE Credential as long as they are completed within that credential's renewal cycle.
3. Update your CPR/AED information
As a health and exercise professional, it's vital that you're prepared if a client experiences a life-threatening event, which is why ACE requires you to maintain a current adult CPR/AED certificate. You can easily update your CPR (and AED if you are in the U.S. or Canada) certification details in your
My ACE Account
. Plus, earning this certification is worth up to 0.4 CECs!
View CPR/AED course options
.
4. Renew your ACE Credentials
Once everything has been completed, simply click the "Complete Renewal" button in your My ACE Account, select the credential(s) you are renewing, agree to the affirmation statement and submit your application. Then go to your shopping cart and pay the renewal fee.
Done! You're renewed for two years and have gained new skills to advance your career and help more people reach their goals. And don't forget, your digital credentials are always available in your
My ACE profile page

ACE Credential Renewal Fees
The ACE Credential renewal process is straightforward and guarantees that, as long as you complete your renewal on time, you won't need to retake the exam in the future. Renewal rates are reduced for each additional ACE Credential. If your ACE Credential has expired, it may be eligible for reinstatement and renewal rates will increase depending on the length of expiration.

ACE Professional Conduct & Ethics Continuing Education Requirement FAQs
Why is Professional Conduct & Ethics education a requirement?
ACE wants health and fitness clients to receive safe exercise instruction and health coaching from well-qualified professionals, while at the same time helping ACE Certified Professionals to limit their own professional liability. To achieve these goals, it is important that ACE Certified Professionals remain current on topics related to risk management, professional liability, ethical and legal business practices, scopes of practice and professional boundaries, client confidentiality and protected health information, and best practices for fostering equity, diversity, inclusion, and culture.
By requiring at least 0.1 CEC (1 hour) of education every two years be focused on topics in the Professional Conduct & Ethics category, ACE is helping ACE Certified Professionals to stay current on these topics.
What is Professional Conduct & Ethics continuing education?
The topics in the Professional Conduct & Ethics continuing education category are pulled directly from the "Professional Conduct and Risk Management" Domain in the exam content outlines for each ACE Certification.
Relevant topics include ethical and legal business practices, risk management and liability procedures, client confidentiality and protected health information, and best practices for fostering equity, diversity, inclusion, and culture.
How is Professional Conduct & Ethics continuing education related to renewing my ACE Certification(s)?
ACE requires all ACE Certified Professionals to complete one hour (0.1 CEC) out of the total 20 hours (2.0 CECs) of continuing education focused on Professional Conduct & Ethics during every two-year certification period to become eligible to renew their ACE Certification(s).
Complete renewal requirements include:
20 hours (2.0 CECs) of ACE-approved continuing education
1 hour (0.1 CEC) out of the total 20 hours (2.0 CECs) must be from the Professional Conduct & Ethics category
A current CPR/AED certificate
A renewal fee
ACE has never required me to be current on Professional Conduct and Ethics related topics in the past. Why now?
ACE reviews its certification and recertification requirements on a regular basis to ensure that they are current for the specific job role (e.g., personal trainer) and aligned with industry-wide best practices for professionals to remain competent. Questions specifically addressing scope of practice, ethical and legal business practices, risk management and liability procedures, client confidentiality, privacy and protected health information, and best practices for fostering equity, diversity, inclusion, and culture make up 15-19% of all ACE Certification exams. Knowing that competence in these areas is required to earn an ACE Certification, staying current in them is important to maintain an ACE Certification.
ACE implemented this certification renewal requirement to help ACE Certified Professionals stay current with these key professional conduct and risk management topics. The decision was made with input from ACE's certification committee members and feedback from employers that the change was both reasonable and appropriate for the professions for which ACE offers certifications.
How can I meet the Professional Conduct & Ethics continuing education requirement?
You may choose from any of the following options to meet the requirement:
Complete an ACE-approved course from the ACE Continuing Education catalog
here
. Eligible courses are denoted with an
Ethics Course
icon.
Complete an ACE-approved course from a trusted provider listed
here
. Eligible courses are denoted with an
Ethics Course
icon.
Petition a non-ACE approved course that you believe meets the requirement for education on Professional Conduct & Ethics. Learn about the petition process
here
.

additional ACE Certification
.
I took (or will be taking) a course that I believe fits in this Professional Conduct & Ethics continuing education category. How can I get credit for this course?
ACE Certified Professionals are able to petition education they completed on topics in the Professional Conduct & Ethics continuing education category. Learn about the petition process
here
.
How much do eligible courses cost?
The cost of courses varies. View a list of eligible courses
here
.
If I have multiple ACE Certifications, do I have to take an eligible course to meet the Professional Conduct & Ethics continuing education requirement for each certification or does one eligible course count across all of my certifications?
If you complete one eligible course within the timeframe when all ACE Certifications are current, it will count toward all certifications.
I already took one of the courses in the Professional Conduct & Ethics continuing education category. Can I apply that towards this requirement?
Eligible courses taken within your current certification cycle will fulfill this requirement and be reflected in your My ACE Account. Any eligible courses taken during a prior certification cycle would not apply to your current certification renewal.
How will ACE know that I completed an ACE-approved Professional Conduct & Ethics course?
Eligible courses will be automatically recognized in your My ACE Account as fulfilling this requirement. You can track your status in the
Manage My CECs
section of your My ACE Account.
I have CEC Power Pass. Will eligible courses be included in my membership?
Yes! You can easily recognize eligible courses in the CEC Power Pass course catalog by looking for the
Ethics Course
icon next to the course.
I have more questions that aren't addressed here. Who can I contact?
Give us a call at 888-519-9845 or email us at

Support@acefitness.org
with updated legal identification as evidence for your request.
What happens to my digital credential if I let my certification lapse or expire?
Once a certification expires, the digital credential will display the status of “expired” on the Accredible platform. If your credential is eligible for late renewal, you may renew and the status will update to current with the new expiration date.
What can digital credentials verify?
When employers, clients and industry peers click on your digital badge or link, they will be taken to a verification page, which can securely verify:
What the certification is called
The name of the organization that issued the certification
What the certification represents
What an individual had to do to earn the certification
The name of the person who earned the certification
When the certification was issued and if/when it expires

ACE works directly with fitness facilities, health clubs, and recreation centers to ensure customer-facing staffs can support members' and nonmembers' individual pursuits for improved health and enhanced quality of life.
Improve member retention and drive new revenue
A true benefit of placing ACE Certified Professionals on your club floor, as opposed to those certified by others, is their orientation toward facilitating sustainable behavior change. When your staff is trained in the science of behavior change, they are equipped to help your members achieve sustainable results. That means increased member retention and all-powerful word-of-mouth marketing.
Employing ACE Certified Professionals lets you reach deeper into your membership and even beyond—well beyond the small percentage who pay for personal training today—with new program offerings to help more people reach their health and fitness goals. ACE Pros enable your facilities to diversify revenue streams.
Then there's the basic matter of good customer service. Behavior change coaching—the science of deeply listening to the customer, discerning their true needs and being able to then present an ideal program, product, or service—is the “soft skill” that smart health clubs require in order to establish deep, longstanding member relationships.
Cultivate employee loyalty and staying power
Forward-thinking health clubs know that investing in employees' careers, specifically by helping them earn and retain an NCCA-accredited certification like those offered by ACE, is the best way to build loyalty and reduce turnover.
Show your employees that they are number one by supporting their career goals as they support your business goals. Work with ACE to establish a program that encourages and makes it easy to stay equipped with the latest and greatest science and information to benefit your members. They'll reward you by making your customer number one.
Partner with us
Let ACE work with you on a program to keep your customer-facing staff ACE Certified and up to date on the skills necessary to generate meaningful results for your business.

Watch
In 2013, ACE joined other certification providers from across the industry in formation of the
Coalition for the Registration of Exercise Professionals

ACE works with clinics, healthcare systems, accountable care organizations and more to equip patient-facing clinicians and frontline staff with the fundamentals of fitness and the latest science in behavior-change coaching. It's an innovative way to help patients discover how to play a more active role in preventing or managing the kinds of chronic conditions that result from physical inactivity and unhealthy lifestyle choices.
With behavior change coaching training provided by ACE—such as through an ACE Health Coach Certification, or individual courses in behavior change—your clinical practitioners and customer service staff become better equipped to help patients convert care plans into concrete, self-determined plans of action. The idea is to leverage the talents and enthusiasm of more of your human resources to encourage clients to pursue, and to help them establish and maintain, healthier lifestyles.
Talk to ACE about a program to upskill your patient-facing teams in fitness and behavior change coaching.

ACE works with corporate wellness programs to equip their staffs to support members in the pursuit of healthier lifestyles.
Corporate wellness professionals become more effective agents for reduced sick days and enhanced productivity when they hold and maintain a trusted credential in physical activity leadership or behavior-change facilitation.
What sets accredited ACE Certification programs apart is a focus on behavior change coaching.  Corporate wellness professionals certified in the science of behavior change coaching are optimally equipped to structure and lead programming that engages employees and helps them establish their own journey toward a more physically active way of life. The benefits can reach all the way into employee recruitment and retention.
Talk with ACE about a program to keep your corporate wellness staff ACE Certified and up to date on the skills necessary to generate meaningful results for your business.

Why Hire an ACE Pro?
Why is it important for my health and fitness professional to hold an ACE Credential?
ACE serves as America's Authority on Fitness
®
, equipping health and fitness professionals with the knowledge and skills they need to guide their clients safely and effectively. Whether your pro holds an NCCA-accredited ACE Certification or an ACE Certificate, they bring a high level of expertise and commitment to your health and fitness journey.
NCCA-Accredited Certification:
To earn an ACE Certification, professionals must pass a rigorous exam that tests their knowledge in exercise science, nutrition, exercise programming, instructional techniques, and more.  Each of our four primary certifications is accredited by the National Commission for Certifying Agencies (NCCA), the gold standard when it comes to accreditation of programs that certify professionals working in healthcare, fitness, wellness and other occupations.
ACE Personal Training Certificate:
Professionals with an ACE Personal Training Certificate have also demonstrated their expertise through focused education and assessment in specific areas of fitness. While not NCCA-accredited, these certificates reflect a deep understanding of personal training principles and a commitment to professional development.
Both types of ACE Pros are dedicated to providing safe, effective, and personalized guidance. By hiring an ACE Pro, you're choosing someone who is equipped with credible information, resources, and the latest research to help you achieve your health and fitness goals.
Dr. Sears Wellness Institute Health Coach Certification
Professionals with a Dr. Sears Wellness Institute (DSWI) Health Coach or Master Health Coach Certification have the expertise and credentials to provide the highest standard of health coaching. The Master Health Coach Certification is accredited by the National Board for Health & Wellness Coaching (NBHWC).
As of 2022, ACE has integrated with DSWI. All DSWI certifications remain valid for life, and DSWI Health Coaches are also recognized as ACE Professionals. Learn more about the acquisition

It starts with movement
We believe movement is at the core of what it means to feel healthy, to feel alive, to engage in the human experience. We believe every step, jump, or lap puts people on the path toward a more active, and fulfilling life. Whether that means an afternoon walk, an invigorating dance class, or a heart-pounding set of squats, movement is vitally important. In fact, it's so important that we've made it our mission to Get People Moving.

Why ACE
As the leading nonprofit organization certifying health coaches and exercise professionals, the American Council on Exercise (ACE) seeks to get people moving worldwide. In addition to setting the highest industry standards and elevating the careers of health coaches and exercise professionals, our commitment to the ACE mission inspires us to collaborate with like-minded organizations, top research institutions, policymakers on the federal and state level, fitness industry leaders and diverse community organizations to increase physical activity for improved public health. By offering NCCA-accredited certification programs, continuing education, and access to easy to understand evidence-based health and fitness information, we invest in our mission to get people moving–so people from all backgrounds are equipped to lead active, healthy lives.

Our Impact
Moving the Profession
ACE leads the movement towards a healthier population by ensuring everyone has access to certified exercise professionals and health coaches who provide leadership, expertise and programs to help people achieve their goals. As a founding member of the Coalition for the Registration of Exercise Professionals, we work to secure recognition of registered exercise professionals for their distinct roles in medical, health, fitness and sports performance fields.
Moving Behaviors
Extensive scientific, evidence-based research has proven that instilling healthy behavior patterns, good nutrition and consistent physical activity are the keys to achieving healthy sustainable life changes that help ward off inactivity-related diseases. ACE is leading a movement to help more people gain access to healthy behavior programs through our NCCA-accredited Health Coach Certification, Behavior Change and Weight Management Specialist Programs, which are grounded in the
ACE Mover Method
philosophy. We also establish partnerships with organizations that bring behavioral health programs to the places people live, study, work and play.
Moving the Public
ACE is moving public perceptions about health and fitness by making unbiased, science-based and easy to understand health information readily available and accessible to the public online, investing in underserved communities and facilitating partnerships with business, non-profit, educational, healthcare and community organizations. This information—anchored in expertise from physicians, psychologists, dieticians and healthcare providers—empowers people from all walks of life to make movement their mission, instilling positive, sustainable life changes that lead to happy, healthy and fulfilling lives.

The ACE Mover Method
Facilitating behavior change to
empower people
to make healthier lifestyle choices.
For decades, ACE has been driven by the fundamental certainty that people are resourceful and capable of change. By meeting them where they are and employing evidence-based strategies, exercise professionals and health coaches can facilitate the development of healthy lifestyle behaviors for the long term.
This has been ACE's guidepost for years—and it now has a name: the
ACE Mover Method
. By naming our core philosophy, we clearly articulate this vital concept to the world: educating and inspiring other exercise professionals and health coaches to responsibly lead behavior change in their communities and beyond.
What is the ACE Mover Method?
The ACE Mover Method is a philosophy that facilitating healthy lifestyle behaviors begins with empowering clients to take a personalized journey during which they achieve self-efficacy because the exercise professional or health coach practices empathy and trust, communication and collaboration.
Through actionable steps, the ACE Mover Method offers a way for exercise professionals and health coaches to get people moving toward a better quality of life. It is evidence-based and thus is what sets us apart in a space often crowded with promises of immediate results and short-term successes.
And it represents and underscores ACE's respected role as a leader in making evidence-based behavior-change facilitation the center point of programs, interventions, and other work to get people moving.
ACE Mover Method
in Practice:
The ABC Approach
Applying the ACE Mover Method starts with recognizing that a client-centered approach means believing individuals are the foremost experts on themselves. Application of the method means upholding the idea that powerful, open-ended questions and active listening should be the anchor of every conversation.
Empowering people to achieve that change is made possible through application of the ACE ABC Approach:
A
sking open-ended questions
Step 1 is to ask powerful starter questions to identify what the client hopes to accomplish by working with an exercise professional or health coach.
B
reaking down barriers
Step 2 is to ask probing questions to discover what potential obstacles may get in the way of the client reaching his or her specific goals.
C
ollaborating
Step 3 is to collaborate to set
SMART goals
and establish specific action steps toward those goals.
By applying the scientific evidence for what works in behavior-change coaching, the ABC Approach helps exercise professionals and health coaches guide clients to be active participants on their paths to lifestyle change.
Why the ACE Mover Method
Works
Motivational interviewing, active listening, and other behavior-change-coaching strategies constitute the ACE Mover Method and the ACE ABC Approach. These efficacious skills have been repeatedly endorsed by researchers throughout the fitness and allied health communities as a way to achieve lasting lifestyle change (Wolever et al., 2013; Dehongje et al., 2017).
Indeed, the tools in the ACE Mover Method empower clients to improve their self-efficacy so they can increase their confidence to successfully achieve their goals. A
2018 study
examined the relationship between having a physical barrier to exercise and self-efficacy and found that, “when facing the greatest barrier challenge, individuals highest in self-regulatory efficacy still view exercise as possible” (Sessford et al., 2018). A review of the literature found that healthy behavior change is effectively supported by adopting a client-centered approach along with goal-setting and self-monitoring techniques, which are also important in maintaining healthy behaviors over time (
Samdal et al., 2017
).
The philosophy of the ACE Mover Method has also directly empowered ACE Certified Professionals to help over 35 million people worldwide each year to move more intentionally in all aspects of their lives.
And ACE is committed to relentlessly pursuing the latest research and standards in exercise and health, introducing new teaching techniques to our network of professionals, and continuously adding to the already powerful framework they can use in a variety of settings. The work that we do in these realms serves as inspiration for all exercise professionals and health coaches to apply behavior-change science in their everyday interaction with clients.
A
relationship
with ACE is so important
for practitioners in a number of different fields
We are a
gateway
through which new research is introduced in our space
We are the
informer
of new standards for certified professional
We are the
champion
for our profession
ACE is the organization that has and will continue to test hypotheses and techniques that breathe new life into how professionals interact with clients in health clubs, hospitals and clinics, workplaces, and homes.

Standards & Professionalism
Connection between
standards
and
professionalism
As exercise professionals and health coaches become poised to more closely align with healthcare, ACE is working to ensure the high standards for practitioners in those roles. Our aim is to ensure that properly credentialed exercise professionals and health coaches are trusted and inspire confidence from all stakeholders, including those in and around clinical care, disease prevention and more.
Help us ensure
consistent
professionalism
If you are an exercise professional or health coach
ACE encourages you to earn and maintain a certification from a program that is accredited by a trusted third-party like the National Commission for Certifying Agencies (NCCA) or the International Organization for Standardization (ISO).
If you are another certifying organization
ACE encourages you to earn and maintain, if you don't already, voluntary accreditation of your certification programs by a trusted third party like the NCCA or ISO.
If you are an employer of exercise professionals and/or health coaches
ACE encourages you to require that those individuals earn and maintain a certification from a program that is accredited by a trusted third party like the NCCA or ISO.
If you refer clients or patients to community resources for the delivery of physical-activity programming, or are considering doing so
ACE encourages you to trust ACE Certified Professionals in your community or others with current certification from similar certification programs accredited by a trusted third part like the NCCA or ISO.
If you work in healthcare, human resources, and other people-centric lines of work who seek to learn the latest science in behavior-change coaching
ACE encourages you to pursue that education from an organization that also offers a well-established health-coaching certification program that is accredited by a trusted third-party like the NCCA or ISO.

Potential for population-health
impact
ACE believes that well-qualified exercise professionals and health coaches who hold accredited certifications, and others who've been similarly equipped with behavior-change coaching skills, are an untapped force in communities across the country. It's time for them and the programs they develop and deliver to be embraced as a logical, more integral extension of clinical care. Such programming holds the potential to help vastly more people adopt and sustain healthy, active lifestyles.
Think
in-community
"extension" of clinical care
In 2016-2018, the Prescription for Activity (PfA) Task Force, convened and funded by ACE, underscored the crucial role that appropriately qualified individuals in the community must serve in the future, working as an extension of clinical care, to help individuals increase their levels of physical activity. That recommendation was central to a systems-change map developed by the PfA Task Force, which charts the course for how healthcare, working in concert with the communities it serves, can be mobilized to its full potential to help more Americans reach recommended physical-activity levels.
The Prescription for Activity initiative is an example of ACE investing heavily to help create a future in which ACE Certified Professionals and others with equivalent credentials can be more integral to the pursuit of improved health outcomes and reduced healthcare costs.

The ACE Mover Method, our philosophy for facilitating behavior change to empower people to make healthier lifestyle choices, represents and underscores ACE's respected role as a leader in making evidence-based behavior-change facilitation the center point of programs, interventions, and other work to get people moving.

Equity, Diversity & Inclusion
ACE is committed to do our part to help end structural racism and address diversity and inclusion in the fitness and physical activity industry. This commitment looks different for every organization, and at ACE we have been striving to keep equity, diversity and inclusion (EDI) top of mind. This year, ACE developed educational resources, increased professional standards, and secured media placements to elevate the EDI discussion. We also partnered with like-minded organizations to create a more diverse, inclusive, and equitable industry which is of paramount importance to the future.
Education
To combat inactivity in various populations, ACE developed and partnered with like-minded organizations to provide EDI-related courses that inform and encourage increased movement among communities across the nation.
Fitness for Healing: Trauma-Informed Approaches
ACE hosted a panel of experts in the areas of trauma and trauma-informed fitness techniques to address the impact of death, accidents, and other traumatic life events and how that may show up in client relationships. In addition, panelists shared how health and fitness professionals can create positive interactions and help mitigate difficult scenarios while remaining within their scope of practice and maintaining a supportive relationship with their clients.
Effective Pre/Postnatal Client Assessment Strategies (ACE partner course)
There can be multiple challenges in prenatal fitness routines, including time and energy constraints, concerns about exercise safety and, for the postpartum client, the need for programs that address conditions like diastasis recti and incontinence. Through this course, participants gain knowledge surrounding the challenges the prenatal and postpartum demographic face and develop the skills to conduct appropriate assessments.
Science of Programming for Older Adults
In October 2023, an ACE discussion explored the importance of health and exercise for aging populations, providing a new perspective on older adults and their unique needs and to learn how to create appropriate programming. By understanding their physical changes, motivations and how they differ from their younger counterparts, health and fitness professionals will be equipped to create effective, fulfilling exercise experiences for older adults.
Equal Pay Pledge
In August 2023, ACE proudly announced its commitment to the
California Equal Pay Pledge
. This decision reflects an ongoing organizational dedication to promoting equity, diversity and inclusion and advancing gender equity within the health and fitness sector. By signing this pledge, ACE joins the efforts to close the gender pay gap and support women in their careers by ensuring opportunities to thrive in their professional lives.
Partnerships and Collaborations
In February 2024, ACE supported the
Live to the Beat
campaign, led by the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention Foundation and the Million Hearts® Initiative. ACE provided physical activity and wellness resources and recommendations to the campaign and promoted it to health coaches and exercise professionals through blogs and social media.
The 2024 campaign, titled "Heart2Heart," centered on promoting heart health of Black women, highlighting the significance of February as both Black History Month and Heart Health Month. The primary message of the campaign urged Black women to prioritize self-care and personal health, whether at home or in the workplace, to make a significant difference in their overall well-being.
The IDEA World Convention Scholarship Program, funded by Kathie and Peter Davis, founders of IDEA Health & Fitness Association (IDEA) and the IDEA Foundation (now the American Council on Exercise, or ACE), announced five 2023 award recipients who attended IDEA World Convention in Los Angeles, California between July 12-16, 2023.
The 2023 IDEA World Convention Scholarship recipients include:
Caroline Morin
, a health coach and teacher, works with Lifting spirits, Improving bodies, Feeding souls, Transforming lives (LIFT) Fitness Foundation. Based in Virginia, LIFT is a nonprofit organization that offers fitness and nutrition programs to homeless individuals, people in substance abuse recovery, veterans, and children in underserved communities. LIFT addresses gaps for local shelters by providing 30-, 60- and 90-day programs focusing on fitness and nutrition education, goal setting, motivational coaching and community support.
Frank G. McKenna
, a former special needs teacher, retired from teaching when he was diagnosed with Stage 4 Lung Cancer in 2016. Determined to stay healthy and overcome the challenges of his diagnosis, he grew stronger and became a certified cancer exercise specialist to support and serve other cancer survivors in his community, a mission he continues today. In addition to running his own studio, Frank co-coordinates the Wellness Beyond Cancer program through his local healthcare system.
Frann Ravid
, an ACE Certified Group Fitness Instructor, initiated the Adult Fitness Program in her town, a low-cost, community fitness program serving men and women of various abilities ages 36-78. Inspired by ACE's community engagement efforts and motivated by the closure of a local gym, Frann partnered with her Parks and Recreation Department to volunteer and teach fitness classes. Three years after its inception, the Adult Fitness Program earns approximately $1,000 each month from its $2.75 fee per class, with the revenue supporting recreational programs for children and teens.
Tiffany Copeland
is the director of the Fitness Warriors program, which trains community leaders to become group fitness instructors, aiming to increase physical activity opportunities in communities around Richmond, Virginia. Her nonprofit organization focuses on addressing health disparities in underserved communities and partners with local churches, libraries, and community centers to build trust and engage individuals lacking access to fitness and physical activity options. Copeland and her team currently reach 6,000+ new people through their 34 weekly classes held both on Zoom and in person.
Ana Almeida-DoRosario
, an ACE Group Fitness Instructor and ACE Health Coach, is highlighted below under "ACE Health Coach Spotlight."

At ACE
ACE has provided its employees, executive team, and board of directors with educational resources and other opportunities to practice and celebrate EDI within the organization.
One key resource is the ACE EDI Council, an employee-led group that offers recommendations to ACE leaders and contributes to the planning and evaluation of organizational activities related to EDI. The Council helps reinforce EDI values and fosters an equitable environment where diverse voices are heard and included. With a more diverse team shaping and reviewing EDI efforts, ACE aims to create a stronger and more effective EDI impact in promoting equity, diversity, and inclusion.
Population Health Improvement
In the past fiscal year, ACE continued to build partnerships across various sectors to support and motivate individuals to achieve recommended physical-activity levels, aiding in the prevention and management of chronic diseases.

RRAMP, an acronym for respect, recognition, alignment, mistakes, and participant, provides a practical approach for group fitness instructors, facility owners, and managers to create a caring and task-involved environment. This approach builds intrinsic motivation and inspires participants to return to classes again and again.
Health and Wellness Coaching
According to a recent study published by the
Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA)
, approximately 80% of US adults and adolescents are insufficiently active. Physical inactivity ranks as the fourth leading risk factor for mortality, according to the
World Health Organization
.
Since 2012, ACE has educated health coaches and fitness professionals to help people reach their goals and implement lifestyle changes that improve their overall health and wellness through exercise, nutrition, and psychology.
The
ACE Health Coach Certification Program
is accredited by the NCCA, and in 2021, ACE was recognized by the National Board of Health and Wellness Coaching as an approved education provider. In 2023, the ACE Health Coach Certification Program was selected as one of the best health coach certification programs of the year. ACE also offers
online courses
and
free articles
about health coaching and behavior change in addition to certification services.
What is a health coach?
A health coach is trained to partner with individuals or groups to help them discover their unique skills, strengths, abilities, and untapped potential. They assist clients in creating realistic health and lifestyle goals through self-discovery, providing guidance on making changes that suit their personal circumstances. Health coaches work in various settings, from health clubs to corporations, virtual coaching, and healthcare environments.
While many exercise professionals focus on the physical aspects of fitness, health coaches emphasize the client's overall lifestyle. They provide relevant, applicable, and skill-based strategies beyond a workout program to support comprehensive well-being.

Community Physical Activity Leader (Coming Soon!)
The Community Physical Activity Leader (CPAL) course is at the heart of our ACE IMPACT work.
ACE partners with community-based organizations that provide volunteer-led programs and interventions aimed at getting people moving who might not otherwise have access to traditional facilities, outdoor spaces, qualified fitness trainers and exercise programs. As such, ACE is working to create a Community Physical Activity Leader (CPAL) Course to provide education and training to individuals and volunteers through partner organizations in and from the communities they serve. Our goal is to equip more individuals with the knowledge and skills needed to help get people in their communities moving.
The CPAL aims to provide the volunteers with accessible and easy-to-apply knowledge and tools to promote physical activity, healthy eating and lifestyles, and community engagement to help facilitate and encourage healthy living and covers topics such as:
Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans
Basics of Community Health
Basic principles of exercise/exercise leadership
Participant and program safety (setting/environmental)
Community organizing

Getting people moving:
Our work and impact in fiscal year
2023-2024
An overwhelming body of evidence indicates that even a moderate amount of physical activity performed every week enhances health, prevents costly inactivity-related diseases, and contributes to a more joyful life. For nearly 40 years, ACE has been committed to translating that evidence into tangible action to get people moving. The following report highlights achievements and impact made in the past fiscal year from July 2023 to June 2024.
Certification
A foundational component of our approach to getting people moving is the certification of well-qualified exercise professionals and health coaches. With every professional we certify, the impact of evidence-based exercise programming and health coaching provided by ACE Certified Professionals becomes more widespread.
The respect and recognition of ACE certification programs is truly global. Since 2003, our four primary certification programs have been accredited by the National Commission for Certifying Agencies (NCCA). The ACE Personal Trainer and ACE Group Fitness Instructor Certification Programs are also recognized by the International Confederation of Registers for Exercise Professionals (ICREPs).
ACE is an enthusiastic supporter and leader of exercise professionals and health coaches who inspire communities around the world in getting and staying physically active.

Equity, Diversity & Inclusion
ACE is committed to do our part to help end structural racism and address diversity and inclusion in the fitness and physical activity industry. This commitment looks different for every organization, and at ACE we have been striving to keep equity, diversity and inclusion (EDI) top of mind. This year, ACE developed educational resources, increased professional standards, and secured media placements to elevate the EDI discussion. We also partnered with like-minded organizations to create a more diverse, inclusive, and equitable industry which is of paramount importance to the future.
Education
To combat inactivity in various populations, ACE developed and partnered with like-minded organizations to provide EDI-related courses that inform and encourage increased movement among communities across the nation.
Fitness for Healing: Trauma-Informed Approaches
ACE hosted a panel of experts in the areas of trauma and trauma-informed fitness techniques to address the impact of death, accidents, and other traumatic life events and how that may show up in client relationships. In addition, panelists shared how health and fitness professionals can create positive interactions and help mitigate difficult scenarios while remaining within their scope of practice and maintaining a supportive relationship with their clients.
Effective Pre/Postnatal Client Assessment Strategies (ACE partner course)
There can be multiple challenges in prenatal fitness routines, including time and energy constraints, concerns about exercise safety and, for the postpartum client, the need for programs that address conditions like diastasis recti and incontinence. Through this course, participants gain knowledge surrounding the challenges the prenatal and postpartum demographic face and develop the skills to conduct appropriate assessments.
Science of Programming for Older Adults
In October 2023, an ACE discussion explored the importance of health and exercise for aging populations, providing a new perspective on older adults and their unique needs and to learn how to create appropriate programming. By understanding their physical changes, motivations and how they differ from their younger counterparts, health and fitness professionals will be equipped to create effective, fulfilling exercise experiences for older adults.
Equal Pay Pledge
In August 2023, ACE proudly announced its commitment to the
California Equal Pay Pledge
. This decision reflects an ongoing organizational dedication to promoting equity, diversity and inclusion and advancing gender equity within the health and fitness sector. By signing this pledge, ACE joins the efforts to close the gender pay gap and support women in their careers by ensuring opportunities to thrive in their professional lives.
Partnerships and Collaborations
In February 2024, ACE supported the
Live to the Beat
campaign, led by the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention Foundation and the Million Hearts® Initiative. ACE provided physical activity and wellness resources and recommendations to the campaign and promoted it to health coaches and exercise professionals through blogs and social media.
The 2024 campaign, titled "Heart2Heart," centered on promoting heart health of Black women, highlighting the significance of February as both Black History Month and Heart Health Month. The primary message of the campaign urged Black women to prioritize self-care and personal health, whether at home or in the workplace, to make a significant difference in their overall well-being.
The IDEA World Convention Scholarship Program, funded by Kathie and Peter Davis, founders of IDEA Health & Fitness Association (IDEA) and the IDEA Foundation (now the American Council on Exercise, or ACE), announced five 2023 award recipients who attended IDEA World Convention in Los Angeles, California between July 12-16, 2023.
The 2023 IDEA World Convention Scholarship recipients include:

LIFT addresses gaps for local shelters by providing 30-, 60- and 90-day programs focusing on fitness and nutrition education, goal setting, motivational coaching and community support.
Frank G. McKenna
, a former special needs teacher, retired from teaching when he was diagnosed with Stage 4 Lung Cancer in 2016.

Frann Ravid
, an ACE Certified Group Fitness Instructor, initiated the Adult Fitness Program in her town, a low-cost, community fitness program serving men and women of various abilities ages 36-78.

Three years after its inception, the Adult Fitness Program earns approximately $1,000 each month from its $2.75 fee per class, with the revenue supporting recreational programs for children and teens.
Tiffany Copeland
is the director of the Fitness Warriors program, which trains community leaders to become group fitness instructors, aiming to increase physical activity opportunities in communities around Richmond, Virginia. Her nonprofit organization focuses on addressing health disparities in underserved communities and partners with local churches, libraries, and community centers to build trust and engage individuals lacking access to fitness and physical activity options. Copeland and her team currently reach 6,000+ new people through their 34 weekly classes held both on Zoom and in person.
Ana Almeida-DoRosario

ACE has provided its employees, executive team, and board of directors with educational resources and other opportunities to practice and celebrate EDI within the organization.
One key resource is the ACE EDI Council, an employee-led group that offers recommendations to ACE leaders and contributes to the planning and evaluation of organizational activities related to EDI. The Council helps reinforce EDI values and fosters an equitable environment where diverse voices are heard and included. With a more diverse team shaping and reviewing EDI efforts, ACE aims to create a stronger and more effective EDI impact in promoting equity, diversity, and inclusion.
Population Health Improvement
In the past fiscal year, ACE continued to build partnerships across various sectors to support and motivate individuals to achieve recommended physical-activity levels, aiding in the prevention and management of chronic diseases.
Key Partnerships

This approach builds intrinsic motivation and inspires participants to return to classes again and again.
Health and Wellness Coaching
According to a recent study published by the
Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA)
, approximately 80% of US adults and adolescents are insufficiently active. Physical inactivity ranks as the fourth leading risk factor for mortality, according to the
World Health Organization
.
Since 2012, ACE has educated health coaches and fitness professionals to help people reach their goals and implement lifestyle changes that improve their overall health and wellness through exercise, nutrition, and psychology.
The
ACE Health Coach Certification Program
is accredited by the NCCA, and in 2021, ACE was recognized by the National Board of Health and Wellness Coaching as an approved education provider. In 2023, the ACE Health Coach Certification Program was selected as one of the best health coach certification programs of the year. ACE also offers
online courses
and
free articles
about health coaching and behavior change in addition to certification services.
What is a health coach?
A health coach is trained to partner with individuals or groups to help them discover their unique skills, strengths, abilities, and untapped potential. They assist clients in creating realistic health and lifestyle goals through self-discovery, providing guidance on making changes that suit their personal circumstances. Health coaches work in various settings, from health clubs to corporations, virtual coaching, and healthcare environments.
While many exercise professionals focus on the physical aspects of fitness, health coaches emphasize the client's overall lifestyle. They provide relevant, applicable, and skill-based strategies beyond a workout program to support comprehensive well-being.

Butt & Hip Exercises
Agility Ladder: Lateral Shuffle
Target
Body Part:
Butt/Hips, Full Body/Integrated, Legs - Calves and Shins, Legs - Thighs
Equipment:
Ladder
Difficulty:
Advanced
View All Exercises
Step 1
Starting Position: Stand directly in a square at one end of the ladder with your feet approximately hip-width apart.
Step 2
Bend your hips and drop into an athletic ready position so that your knees are slightly bent and your chest is directly over your toes.  Your arms should be bent with the elbows fixed at approximately ninety degrees (during the drill ensure that the swinging is coming from the shoulder joint and not from the elbows).
Step 3
Shift your bodyweight so that your weight is in your left leg.  Pick up the right foot and place it in the square next to the starting square while pushing the left foot in to the ground to move your body to your right and in to the next square of the ladder.
Step 4
Your right foot should hit the ground at the ball of the foot and roll all the way down to the heel, as the entire right foot hits the ground shift your body weight off of the left leg and place your weight on the right leg.  Once your bodyweight is on your right leg pick up your left foot to bring it into the same square as the right foot.  Keep your hips flexed and knees bent so that you maintain an athletic ready position throughout the length of the entire ladder.
Step 5
Continue to move down the ladder to your right; keep the bodyweight in the left leg while picking up the right foot to move it to the next square to the right; as the right foot hits the square, push off with the left foot and keep the bodyweight centered on top of the right leg.  Be sure to move both ways through the ladder; once you've done a certain number of repetitions to the right, be sure to switch directions and do the same number of repetitions moving to your left (pushing off of the right foot).
Exercise Variation: As you improve your movement skills, dynamic balance and ability to move rapidly through the ladder, try not to look at your feet and keep your eyes on the horizon (where your opponents will be during an athletic competition).

Back Exercises
90 Lat Stretch
Target
Body Part:
Back
Equipment:
No Equipment
Difficulty:
Beginner
View All Exercises
Step 1
Starting Position:  Stand with your feet hip-width apart with arms by your sides. Stiffen your abdominal muscles (“brace”) to stabilize your spine, then depress and retract your scapulae (pull shoulders down and back) without arching your low back. Hold your chest up and out, tilt your head slightly up.
Step 2
With a slight bend in the knee, shift your weight over your heels and slowly begin bending forward at the hips, maintaining the abdominal bracing and flat back.  Place your hands on the table while keeping the arms straight with the elbows extended and position the arms so there is a straight line from the shoulders, through the elbows to the wrists.
Step 3
With your hands on the table, keep your legs directly under your hips while leaning back into your hips, straightening the legs and drawing your torso closer to the ground while keeping a flat back.  Keep your chin tucked into your neck to stabilize your cervical spine and to keep your head from dropping towards the floor.
Step 4
Hold the stretch position for 15-30 seconds for a total of 2-4 repetitions. To increase the stretch of the latissimus dorsi (back) muscles, rotate your thumbs to point toward the ceiling.
Step 5
Exercise Variation:  To increase the stretch, supinate the palms (turn the palms up to face the ceiling) while leaning back into your hips.
Exhale as you lean back into your hips.  Be sure not to fully “lock” the knees while holding this position.

Stand with the feet hip-width apart and keep the hips straight with the knees slightly bent. Put the cable pulley at about chest-height, and stand with it directly to the left of the body. Grip a handle in both hands with fingers laced together, straighten the arms out in front, keep back straight and tall, while simultaneously stepping backwards into a lunge with the left foot so the left knee is close to the ground. Push off the right foot and bring the left leg forward to return to standing.

Arm Exercises
Chin-ups
Target
Body Part:
Arms, Back
Equipment:
Pull up bar
Difficulty:
Intermediate
View All Exercises
Step 1
Starting Position: Stand under the chin-up bar and reach your arms overhead with your palms facing you.  Reach, jump or lift your body off the floor to grasp the handles firmly with a full grip position (thumbs wrapped around the handles).  Gently cross one leg over the other to stabilize your lower extremity and then stiffen ("brace") your abdominal muscles to stabilize your spine.  Align your head vertically with your trunk under your hands and assume a neutral wrist position (i.e., wrist aligned in a straight line with your forearms).  Depress and retract your scapulae (pull shoulders back and down) and attempt to hold this position throughout the exercise.
Step 2
Slowly exhale and slowly pull your body upwards by flexing (bending) your elbows and pulling your arms down to your sides  Attempt to pull in a motion that drives your elbows directly down towards the floor, keeping your elbows in front of your body.  Attempt to keep your body aligned vertically to the floor and avoid swinging your body during your upward pull
Step 3
Continue pulling upward until your chin is level with the bar or your hands.  Pause momentarily then slowly return to your starting position by allowing your arms to extend back overhead until your arms are fully extended.  Continue to maintain your shoulder and wrist position, and the vertical alignment of your trunk.  Repeat the movement.
Exercise Variation: The intensity of this exercise can be increased with resistance that can be added by wearing a weight belt to which weights are connected.
This exercise targets the back and biceps muscles effectively, but should be performed without compromise to the shoulder. Follow the instructions provided to reduce the stress placed upon your shoulder

Ab Exercises
Bodyweight Squat
Target
Body Part:
Abs, Butt/Hips, Legs - Calves and Shins, Legs - Thighs
Equipment:
No Equipment
Difficulty:
Beginner
View All Exercises
Step 1
Starting Position: Begin standing with your feet
slightly wider than hip-width, with the toes turned slightly outwards with your hands by your sides so the palms facing inwards. Depress and retract your scapulae (pull the shoulders down and back).
Step 2
Stiffen your core and abdominal muscles (“bracing”) to stabilize your spine. Hold your chest up and out, tilt your head slightly up, shift your weight back into your heels while pushing your hips towards the wall behind you.
Step 3
Downward Phase: Start the downward phase by first shifting your hips backwards then downwards to create a hinge-like movement at your hips and knees simultaneously. As you lower your hips the knees will then start to shift forward slowly, but try to control the amount of forward translation (movement) of the tibia (shinbone). Maintain tension in the core muscles (continue bracing) and attempt to keep your back flat.
Step 4
Continue to lower yourself until your thighs are parallel or almost parallel with the floor, until your heels begin to lift off the floor, or until your torso begins to round or flex forward. Monitor your feet, ankles and knees, ensuring that the feet don't move, the ankles do not collapse in or out and the knees remain aligned over the second toe.
Step 5
From the Lowered Position: the knees should continue to remain aligned over the second toe and body weight should be evenly distributed between the balls and heels of the feet. From the side, the position of the tibia (shinbone) and torso should be parallel with each other and the low back should appear flat or showing the beginning of some rounding.
Step 6
Upward Phase: While maintaining your back, chest and head-up position, exhale and extend the hips and knees by pushing your feet into the floor through your heels. The hips and torso need to rise together while keeping the heels flat on the floor and knees aligned over the second toe. Continue extending until you reach your starting position.
Think about inhaling on the way down and exhaling while exerting on the way back to the initial standing position.

Ab Exercises
Bird-dog
Target
Body Part:
Abs, Back, Butt/Hips
Equipment:
No Equipment
Difficulty:
Intermediate
View All Exercises
Step 1
Starting Position: Kneel on an exercise mat or floor, positioning your knees and feet hip-width apart, with your feet dorsi-flexed (toes pointing towards your body).
Step 2
Slowly lean forward to place your hands on the mat, positioning them directly under your shoulders at shoulder-width with your fingers facing forward. Reposition your hands and knees as necessary so that your knees are directly under your hips and hands are directly under your shoulders.
Step 3
Stiffen your core and abdominal muscles to position your spine in a neutral position, avoid any excessive sagging or arching.
Step 4
Upward Phase: This exercise involves simultaneous movement of your leg and contralateral (opposite) arm. This exercise is best performed facing a mirror. Hip Extension: Slowly extend your left hip (raise and straighten the knee) attempting to extend it until it is at, or near parallel, to the floor without any rotation in the hip. Your goal is to keep both hips parallel to the floor. The use of a light bar placed across the hips, parallel to the waistline of your pants, provides visual feedback to hip rotation and what corrections are needed.
Step 5
Shoulder flexion: Slowly flex your right arm (raise and straighten the arm) attempting to raise it until it is at, or near parallel, to the floor without any tilting at the shoulders. Your goal is to keep the both shoulders parallel to the floor. The use of a light bar placed across the shoulders provides visual feedback to shoulder rotation and what corrections are needed. Your head should remain aligned with the spine throughout the movement.
Step 6
The degree of hip extension and shoulder flexion is determined by the ability to control against movement in the low back. As the leg is raised, individuals may witness an increase in lumbar lordosis (low back sagging). Only raise the limbs to heights where the low back position can be maintained through the combined actions of the core and abdominal muscles.
Step 7
Downward Phase: Gently lower yourself back to your starting position and repeat with the opposite limbs.
The bird-dog is an excellent exercise to train the body how to stabilize the lumbar spine (low back) during upper and lower extremity movement. Never exceed your body's capacity to control movement in the low back.

Securely attach a heavy rope to an anchor point, grab one end of the rope in each hand with the palms down. Stand with the feet about shoulder-width apart with both the hips and knees slightly bent, and hold both lines of rope directly in front. Hold one end of the rope in each hand and keep the elbows close to the body. Lift the right arm up quickly before snapping it down to create a wave down the rope. As the right arm comes down quickly, lift the left arm at the same time to start moving the left side of the rope. Alternate arms to explosively snap the rope up and down for the duration of the exercise.

Cobra Exercise
Target
Body Part:
Abs, Back
Equipment:
No Equipment
Difficulty:
Beginner
View All Exercises
Step 1
Starting Position: Lie prone (on your stomach) on an exercise mat or floor with your hands by your sides, positioned directly under your shoulders and hands facing forward. Extend your legs and plantar flex your ankles (toes point away from body).
Step 2
Upward Phase: Gently exhale and press your hips into the mat or floor and pull your chest away from the ground while keeping your hips stable. This will arch your low back and stretch the muscles in your chest and abdominal region. Hold this position for 15 - 30 seconds
Step 3
Downward Phase: Gently relax and lower your upper body to rest back upon the mat or floor.
Step 4
If you experience any pain in the low back with this movement, stop the exercise immediately and consult with your doctor.
As the length of arms differ, individuals may often lift their hips off the mat or floor as they fully extend their arms. In this case, limit the extension in your arms to keep the hips on the mat.

Target
Body Part:
Abs, Butt/Hips, Legs - Thighs
Equipment:
No Equipment
Difficulty:
Intermediate
View All Exercises
Step 1
Starting Position: Stand with your feet together. Depress and retract your scapulae (pull your shoulders down and back) without arching your low back, and "brace" (engage your abdominal/core muscles) to stiffen your spine.
Step 2
In preparation to step forward, slowly lift one foot off the floor, stabilizing your body on the stance (supporting) leg. Avoid any sideways tilting or swaying in your upper body and try not to move the stance (supporting) foot. Hold this position momentarily before stepping forward. The raised (swing) leg should initiate contact with a heel strike first, slowly transferring your body weight into the leading (forward) foot placed firmly on the floor. As you load into this leg, avoid any sideways tilting or swaying in your upper body and try not to move the stance (supporting) foot.
Step 3
As you lunge forward, focus more on dropping your hips towards the floor rather than driving your hips forward. This will help control the amount of forward movement of your shinbone (forward tibial translation) over your foot. Continue lowering your body to a comfortable position or until your front thigh becomes parallel with the floor and your tibia (shinbone) is in a slight forward lean. While lunging, simultaneously, bend forward at your hips, maintaining a flat back.
Step 4
Firmly push off with your front leg, activating both your quads and glutes (thighs and butt muscles) to return to your upright, starting position.
We suggest you first learn how to perform single leg-stands on the ground before performing this forward lunge. Once you master the forward lunge, you can progress to doing a lunge using arm drivers and mult-directional glute activation lunges.

Last Updated October 27, 2023 (originally published September 17, 2015)
Desk jobs, driving,
swimming
and carrying boxes all have one thing in common: the use of the arms and chest to perform the task.
A large percentage
of what we do in life is in front of us, making it common for the muscles in the front of our body to become hypertonic
(i.e.,
shortened
)
and limiting chest,
shoulder
and arm flexibility.?
The p
ectoralis major and minor, anterior deltoid and biceps are all muscles
located
on the front of the body
(in the chest,
shoulders
and arms, respectively)
. Tight pectoral muscles contribute to a postural deviation known as
forward
-
rounded shoulders and limit range of motion in the shoulder joint
.
Opening up
the front of the body through a variety of chest stretches can increase flexibility of the chest muscles and connective tissue
and allow for greater range of motion in the shoulders
to improve upper
-
body posture and allow for pain
-
free movement patterns.
5 Variations of Chest Stretches
The following chest stretches
provide
various ways
to
enhance upper-body flexibility
and can be performed any time—not just after a workout. Executed regularly,
these stretches will cause
you to see and feel continual improvements in chest and shoulder flexibility and range of motion.
Hold each stretch for 1
0
to
30 seconds or
t
wo
to five
breath cycles. One inhale + one exhale = 1 breath cycle.
Avoid bouncing. With each exhale, move into the stretch a little further, but only to the point of
feeling
tightness or slight discomfort
—
never pain.
Perform
each
stretch
two to four
times.
Bring focus to pulling the shoulder blades down and back, while also
lifting and pointing
your chest
forward to create length within the pectoral muscles.
Behind-the-back Elbow-to-elbow Grip
Because this
stretch
is easy
to perform
anywhere and no equipment is needed
,
it’s
a great way
to stretch anytime of the day.
Seated or standing, begin with arms hanging by your sides and shoulders pressed down away from your ears.
Gently squeeze your shoulder blades together and broaden the chest. Bring the arms behind the back and grip elbow to elbow.
Above-the-head Chest Stretch
This is another stretch that can be performed either seated or standing. Play around with the positioning of the hands to emphasize
the
shoulders and/or chest.
Seated or standing,
bend your elbows and
interlock your fingers
behind your head.
Gently squeeze your shoulder blades together and move your elbows backward.
Vary the height of your hands to emphasize
the
shoulders and/or chest (hands behind
the
head, hands on top of
the
head, hand
s
a few inches above
the
head).
Bent-arm Wall Stretch
This exercise allows you to stretch each side of your chest separately.?
Assume a split stance,
r
ight leg in the front and left leg in the back, at the end of a wall or in a doorway.
Bring the left arm up to shoulder height and position the palm and inside of the arm on the wall surface or doorway. Your
elbow
should
be bent to 90 degrees
.
Gently press the chest through the open space to feel the stretch.
Moving the arm higher or lower will allow you to stretch various sections of the chest.
Repeat on the other side.
Extended Child’s Pose on Fingertips
In yoga,
child’s
pose is considered a resting exercise, but when the arms are extended, this exercise
stretches
the upper body while still
providing
stress relief to the
low
back.
Kneel on the floor. Touch your big toes together and sit
back
on
to
your heels
. N
ext, separate your knees about as wide as your hips.
Bend forward from the hips and walk your hands out as far in front of you as possible. With the arms extended and palms facing down, come up onto the fingertips as if you
have a ball
underneath your palms and melt the chest toward the floor.
Side
-l
ying Parallel Arm Chest Stretch
This exercise allows you to target each side of the chest separately and give special attention to the shoulders.
Lying prone on your stomach, bring both arms out to the sides, palms facing down, to create the letter T.
Start to roll onto your right side by pushing yourself with your left hand. Lift the left leg, bend the
knee
and place the left foot behind you on the floor for stability. Rest your right temple on the floor.
Keep the left hand on the floor for balance. For an extra stretch, lift the left hand up toward the ceiling.
Repeat on the other side.
Let's Go

Congratulations and welcome to the ACE family! Now that
you’re
certified, you can start applying for jobs
in the health and fitness industry
and making a difference by helping people become more physically active.
You’ve
passed your exam
,
but the
hard work
doesn’t
stop there. Now is the time to create a plan for the next steps of your journey. Much like
coaching, training or class design
, there is no one-size-fits-all approach to creating a career, so this is your opportunity to choose
what’s
best for you.
If
you’re
not yet certified and are contemplating
entering the fitness industry
, now is the perfect time to explore the many opportunities the industry has to offer and
to
decide on your next step.
It’s
also good to know what resources ACE has available to support your career,
from getting that first job to pivoting to new opportunities later in your career.
Either way, h
ere are
eight
ways
to enhance your job search
, including some resources that are exclusive to ACE Certified Pros
:
Check out the
ACE
®
Job Board
.
This resource brings together employers and ACE Certified Health Coaches and Exercise Professionals
to make finding that perfect opportunity a bit
simpler
. You can easily search
and apply
for jobs that are unique to your wants, needs and
expertise
. You can also post your resume
and include links to your social media accounts,
videos
and photos.
Explore
ACE Pro Compass
.
This ACE-exclusive career support tool will help you embark on lifelong learning and chart a personalized career path.
Full of carefully curated content and resources that will help you define your “why” and reach your full potential at every stage of your career, ACE Pro Compass
is a valuable resource that every ACE Certified Pro should be
using.
Use the
ACE Pro Connect
app
to connect with other ACE Certified Pros.
This ACE-exclusive app
features a community of like-minded professionals
. Chat, share resources, join groups that spark your interest and build the career you want.
In addition, the app offers a constantly growing library of videos
on topics such as inspiration and advice, sales and marketing, virtual coaching, and self-care and stress management. And
don’t
forget to check out the ACE Talks podcast!
Use the
ACE+Wix
Website Builder
to enhance your professionalism.
A custom website where you can send prospective employers can help set you apart from the competition.
This easy-to-use tool features templates
and
a built-in suite of digi
t
al tools that mak
e
building
that perfect website
easier than ever.
Review your materials, continue to
learn
and prepare yourself for your career.
It’s
never too early to start earning
continuing education
credits (CECs) and exploring different
topics
that appeal to you. For example, if you want to work with
a specific population
, such as seniors or youth, or want to focus on weight management,
corrective
exercise
or any of a host of
available specialty areas, check out the
ACE
S
pecialist
P
rograms
.
Adding this to your resume and focusing on a specific niche can help you
identify
the right job and set yourself up for success.
Tailor your resume and cover letter to fit the position
for which you are applying
.
This is your opportunity to explain what you can do for the company and what skill sets you
possess
.
Be sure to highlight any certifications
and specialist programs
you’ve
completed, as well as
any relevant w
ork experi
ence. Finally, be sure to proofread
(and
maybe hire
someone to edit your resume), as professionalism is vital when applying for a job.
You
don’t
want to get eliminated from consideration because of a resume that
doesn’t
represent
you well.
Get experience!
Shadow, volunteer, start at the front desk of a club, and develop professional relationships with experienced trainers and other exercise professionals. For many people, starting in a health-club setting is
a great way
to gain experience and have other professionals around to help; it can also make it easier to attract clients and gain practical hands-on experience.
Seek out mentors, build your network and make real connections.
Remember, we are all working toward a
greater goal of helping others.
Demonstrating to potential employers that you have already developed a
professional network signals
that you are well prepared to make waves in the health and fitness industry.
Now,
it’s
time to
identify
your purpose for becoming a certified health and exercise professional. What do you want to do, who do you want to work with and
why
Finding your why will help you stay motivated and, in turn, enable you to
really
help others with their health and fitness goals.
Where do you want to work Do you prefer a commercial, clinical, community or corporate environment Do you want to work in
a private setting
, own your own company
or
train
or coach clients
in
their
homes or online
Do you want to work full- or part-time
There are
countless options, so be sure to
use the resources above and
explore every opportunity

by

on
November 03, 2023
There’s
a
paradigm
that
states
, “The way you do one thing is the way you do everything.” If you tend to
use
all-or-nothing
thinking
or other irrational thought patterns
, this
probably
shows
up in every area of your life
and is often a part of a
perfectionist personality
.
Here are a few examples:
Exercise
:
If you
don’t
have time for your full workout, you
don’t
do any exercise.
Relationships
:
In relationships, you might be ready to marry the person after one date
—or decide after one date that you never want
to see
that person again
. For friendships, you might have one close friend at a time
with
whom you do everything.
Housework
:
If you
can’t
clean the entire house all at once, it
doesn’t
get done at all.
School
:
If you
don’t
have time to sit down and
write
the paper in one sitting, it
doesn’t
get done until you have no choice and then
find yourself
pulling an all-nighter
.
Nutrition
:
You already broke from your dietary goals by having
one cookie
,
so you might as well eat the entire package and abandon your
nutrition
goals for the rest of the day
.
A
n a
ll-or-nothing
mindset also
affects
people
on a
deeper
level
.
As
a type of
cognitive distortion
, p
eople with all-or-nothing mindsets tend to see the world with no gray areas. Things are either right or
they’re
wrong
, and a
nything less than 100% equals failure.
That’s
a lot of pressure!
With all-or-nothing thinking
and other cognitive distortions
,
people
use absolutes and extremes, like:
I’m
a
complete
failure
...
or
...
My way is
always
the best way
I can
never
do
anything
right.
..
or...
If
it’s
going to get done right,
I’m
the
only one
who can do it.
Everyone
hates me
;
no one
likes me.
..
or...
I
don’t
have any enemies—
everyone
loves me.
A
2018 study published in
Clinical Psychological Science
suggests that using absolutist words
is a marker specific to anxiety,
depression
and suicidal ideation.
In this study, researchers state, “Absolutist thinking
underlies many of the cognitive distortions and irrational beliefs that are purported to mediate the core
affective disorders...
.
Absolutist thinking has strong empirical links to three distinct mental health groups:
suicidal ideation, borderline personality disorder, and eating disorder.”
This
doesn’t
mean that this type of self-talk is
always linked to these conditions.
After all, we all
use this language at times.
It’s
when it becomes a person’s
primary
or only w
ay of thinking
that things become problematic.
Stopping the Spiral of All-or-Nothing Thinking
In one of her
Therapy in a Nutshell
tutorials, Emma McAdam, MS,
makes
the following
suggestions
for getting out of all-or-nothing thinking:
Notice
.
Now that you know what
absolutist
thinking is, start noticing
if and when
you’re
falling into it. Listen for those absolute words
:
everyone, always, never, complete, etc.
Practice
c
ognitive
d
efusion
.
Cognitive
defusion
involves looking at your thoughts
objectively
,
which
allows you to
consider
them
from
an
outside perspective
.
Realize that j
ust because you think something
,
that
doesn’t
make it true or helpful.
Byron Katie’s Four Questions
can be helpful
in reframing
negative thoughts and squash
ing
the
brain’s
automatic negative thought patterns
. Ask yourself:
Is this thought true?
Can I absolutely, 100% know that this thought is true?
How do I react to this thought?
Who would I be without this thought?
Try to name
the
emotion instead of creating a distorted reality.
An example McAdam gives is, instead of saying, “No one likes me,” say, “I feel lonely.”
Identifying
the emotion allows you to do something about it
—so
when you feel lonely
, you could reach out to
a friend
.
Reframe the problem.
Try to see
both sides of
a situation.
Let’s
say
, for example, that
your family
didn’t
like what you made for dinner tonight. Distorted thinking might say
,
“
I’m
a horrible cook. They never like what I make.” A reframe might be, “They
didn’t
like that
dish
, but they liked what
I made last night.
It’s
fun trying new recipes and I
can’t
expect
everyone in my family to like every new recipe I make.”
Another example is when someone says, “Last year was a horrible year.”
Chances are, there were both good and not-so-good things that happened over the
p
ast
365 days
, so a reframe might be, “Last year was a tough year in many respects, but there were also some good things that happened.”
Acknowledge both your strengths and your weaknesses
.
A rigid, absolutist mindset says
,
“I can’t do anything right” or
,
on the
flip side
,
“I’m perfect and do nothing wrong
.
”
Acknowledging your strengths and weaknesses
allows
for
a growth mindset.
For example, if a relationship
you’re
in dissolves,
not acknowledging your role
and
responsibility
in the relationship not working
doesn’t
allow for your own personal growth
, nor does it
highlight
where you could improve yourself.
Ask yourself w
hat function
your
absolutist
thinking
serves.
Even though all-or-nothing thinking
and other cognitive distortions
can be
an unhealthy mindset, there is a reason we do it. Many experts, including
McAdam, feel that this way of thinking
“protects” us from taking risks.
It’s
the
brain
’s
way of keeping
you
safe.
It’s
doing its job—
you’re
still alive. But it can also keep you stuck in your comfort zone.
T
his is fine if
that’s
where you want to stay
, b
ut if you want to venture out of your comfort zone, you must take risks.
While a
bsolutist
thinking can seem
benign, it can have some
pretty significant
effects on your life
—like depression
and other mental health issues
.
It can also stunt success in perfectionists. For e
xample, your new website will never be perfect, so you procrastinate showing it to the world and
ultimately never
start that new business.
Take an honest look at
the words you use and the thoughts you have.
Start breaking down your rigid mindset and cultivate a growth mindset
with tools like reframing and challenging the negative and absolute thoughts.
A
nd be ready
to see the world in a whole new light.

ACE Certifications are
NCCA-accredited
The health and fitness industry is largely unregulated and unfortunately anyone can claim to be an exercise professional or health coach. To support the integrity of our industry and in keeping with standards of practice among other healthcare professionals, all our primary certification programs hold accreditation by the National Commission for Certifying Agencies (NCCA).
The nation's most respected thinkers in health and fitness agree that NCCA accreditation is the gold standard when it comes to accreditation of programs that certify professionals working in healthcare, fitness, wellness and other occupations.
All certifications are not created equal
BE WARY! There are more than 100 respectable organizations, fly-by-night operators and providers of "overnight credentials" that are not accredited at all, do little to prepare you for a lasting career and may not be accepted by employers. Make sure to do your research!

.
Do I have to take the Personal Trainer exam again to renew my credential?
No, provided you stay current on your continuing education credits (CECs) and renew on time. That means completing 20 hours of ACE-Approved CECs (2.0 CECs) during your two-year certification renewal cycles, or about 10 hours (1.0 CECs) per year. However, if you don't complete your 2.0 CECs and your certification expires, you will have to retake the exam. To avoid that scenario, check out our
continuing education catalog
and consider signing up for
CEC Power Pass

What does a Health Coach do?
A health coach recognizes that people have unique dietary, emotional and physical needs. They help people reach their goals and implement lifestyle changes that improve their overall health and wellness with exercise, nutrition and psychology. They work in a variety of settings from health clubs to corporations, virtual coaching to healthcare.
How do Health Coaches make an impact?
A health coach partners with people to help them discover their own unique skills, strengths, abilities and untapped potential. They help people create realistic goals through self-discovery while providing guidance for how to make healthy changes that work for them and their lifestyle.
What is the role of a Health Coach in the fitness industry?
While many fitness pros are focused on the physical aspects of fitness, health coaches focus on the client's overall lifestyle. A health coach provides relevant, applicable and skill-based strategies, beyond a workout program, that influence positive behavior change. Because of this health coaches are in high demand.
We offer
two pathways
toward achieving your health
coach certification:

FAQs
Are there any pre-requisites to becoming an ACE Certified Health Coach?
You can become an ACE Health Coach by passing the ACE Health Coach certification exam. In order to sit for the ACE Health Coach certification exam you must satisfy the following requirements:
Be at least 18 years old.
Have completed high school diploma (or the equivalent).
Hold a current
CPR and AED certification
with a live skills check*
Present a current government-issued photo ID with signature (driver's license, passport, military ID)
*CPR and AED certificates are both required in the U.S. and Canada. Candidates outside the U.S. and Canada are only required to hold a current CPR certificate due to differing international laws regarding AED use by non-medical professionals. Candidates taking an ACE exam must complete a CPR/AED course that includes a live skills check prior to registration.
What is the difference between the ACE Health Coach Certification and the NBHWC Certification?
The ACE Health Coach Certification is the only NCCA-accredited health coach certification available. When you become an ACE Certified Health Coach, you are widely respected as being the most qualified professional to coach clients. You hold the most recognized certification in the industry that can lead to the most sought-after opportunities. And with ongoing support and guidance from ACE throughout your career, you will have access to the exclusive tools and resources you need to thrive as a health and fitness pro. While both study programs prepare you to earn an NCCA-accredited certification, the ACE Health Coach Advanced Training Program is also an approved Health and Wellness Coach Training & Education Program by the National Board for Health and Wellness Coaching (NBHWC).
Which program is best if I would like to take the NBHWC exam?
The Health Coach Advanced Training Program is the best path to complete the education requirement to apply to sit for the NBHWC exam. Please check
www.NBHWC.org
for all requirements before applying to sit for the NBHWC exam.
What program will help me complete the practical skills assessment required to take the NBHWC exam?
Within the Health Coach Advanced Training Program, the course Health Coach Lab: Live Skills Assessment fulfills the practical skills assessment requirement. Once you have completed this course you will receive a certification of completion with the program name and date of completion to include with your exam application. Please check
www.NBHWC.org
for all requirements before applying to sit for the NBHWC exam.
For the Health Coach Advanced Training Program, is there a specific order I should take the courses in?
We've created a free guided tour that shows you how the program works. Learn more
here
.
How long will it take to complete the programs?
Everyone learns differently and the time it takes varies. For the ACE Health Coach certificates, most complete this in 3-6 months from the time they start studying to when they sit and pass their exam. For ACE Health Coach Advanced Training Program, it is recommended to take up to 1 year to complete the program from start to finish.
What if I'm already an ACE Health Coach and want to complete the ACE Health Coach Advanced Training Program?

FAQs
How long will I have to study before I need to sit for the certification exam?
That's up to you! Most people study for around 3-6 months, though many study for longer. One thing to keep in mind is that your exam voucher has a redemption period of 6-months. While you can choose an exam date that's outside of the 6-month redemption period, you'll have to register for the exam before your voucher expires. Most exam sites and online proctoring may post available dates approximately 60 days in advance.
Are there any prerequisites before I purchase a study program?
While there are no prerequisites to purchasing a study program, keep in mind that before you can register for the ACE Group Fitness Instructor Exam, you must:
Be at least 18 years of age
Hold a current adult CPR and AED certificate with hands-on (in-person or virtual) skills check.* CPR/AED courses without skills check not accepted.
*AED only required in USA and Canada
Have completed high school or the equivalent
See our approved CPR/AED certification training
here
.
How does the Study Program work?
Depending on which Study Program you choose, based on how you like to learn, you'll have the option of learning through:
A digital textbook (Basic)
A hardcopy and digital textbook (Plus)
A hardcopy, digital and audiobook version of the textbook (Advantage)
With all Study Programs, you'll have access to ACE University (our core learning platform) and practice test(s).
With the Plus Study Program, you'll have access to three practice tests and to Live Q&A Webinars.
And with the Advantage Study Program you have access to four practice tests, Live Q&A Webinars, Section Quizzes and Exercise Science 101.

What happens if I don't pass the exam on the first time?
While most people do pass the exam on their first time, it's perfectly okay if you don't! Here are some steps you can take if you need to retake your certification exam:
Determine if you have a retake voucher, which you can find in your MyACE Account. If you don't have one, you can purchase an additional exam at a discounted retake fee via MyACE or by contacting one of our ACE Advisors. This price is valid for one year after your initial test date.
When choosing a date to retake the exam, we recommend giving yourself about one week of review time for every ten points you are away from a passing score. So if your score is 480 out of a possible 800, for example, (meaning you're 20 points away from the minimum passing score of 500), allow about two weeks of review before your next exam.
Reflect on your performance and consider any exam topics you felt underprepared to tackle.
Review your exam score report and compare your domain performance to the Exam Content Outline. Review each domain and determine what areas need improvement.
Use all your study materials, including videos and exercises, to help build confidence for the exam. Because no two people learn alike, we've provided study material in many different formats, so be sure to use all the resources available to you!
Consider what went well during your initial studies and what you might do differently.
Create a game plan for everything you want to do before you retake the exam. Writing down your plan may help create accountability.
Join the ACE Study Coaches for a live Q&A Webinar to get your specific questions answered.
Can I teach any class format after becoming ACE Certified?
After becoming an ACE Certified Group Fitness Instructor, you'll have a strong foundational understanding of how to lead, instruct, and design classes across a wide range of modalities. Many ACE Certified Pros also choose to continue their education by taking additional courses that focus on just one modality, such as Indoor Cycling,
Yoga
, or
Pilates
, just to name a few.
What happens after I'm ACE Certified?
CELEBRATE! You've now joined the highly respected ranks of 90,000+ ACE Certified Pros and hold the most recognized certification in the industry. Plus, we'll be providing support and guidance throughout your career, so you'll have access to the exclusive tools and resources you need to thrive as a health and fitness pro. Learn more about why it's great to be ACE Certified
here
.
Do I have to take the exam again to renew my certification?
No, provided you stay current on your continuing education credits (CECs) and renew on time. That means completing 20 hours of ACE-Approved CECs (2.0 CECs) during your two-year certification renewal cycles, or about 10 hours (1.0 CECs) per year. However, if you don't complete your 2.0 CECs and your certification expires, you will have to retake the exam. To avoid that scenario, check out our
continuing education catalog
and consider signing up for the
CEC Power Pass

here
.
*AED only required in USA and Canada
Present a current government-issued photo ID with signature (driver's license, passport, military ID)
Submit BOTH of the following documents:
Proof of a four-year (bachelor's) degree in exercise science or a related field.
Proof of 500 hours of work experience designing and implementing exercise programs for apparently healthy individuals and/or high-risk individuals, as documented by a qualified professional (upload pre-approval form, as completed by a supervisor, below).
What happens if I don’t pass the exam on the first time?
While most people do pass the exam on their first time, it's perfectly okay if you don't! Here are some steps you can take if you need to retake your certification exam:
Determine if you have a retake voucher, which you can find in your MyACE Account. If you don't have one, you can purchase an additional exam at a discounted retake fee via MyACE or by contacting one of our ACE Advisors. This price is valid for one year after your initial test date.
When choosing a date to retake the exam, we recommend giving yourself about one week of review time for every ten points you are away from a passing score. So if your score is 480 out of a possible 800, for example, (meaning you're 20 points away from the minimum passing score of 500), allow about two weeks of review before your next exam.
Reflect on your performance and consider any exam topics you felt underprepared to tackle.
Review your exam score report and compare your domain performance to the Exam Content Outline. Review each domain and determine what areas need improvement.
Use all your study materials, including videos and exercises, to help build confidence for the exam. Because no two people learn alike, we've provided study material in many different formats, so be sure to use all the resources available to you!
Consider what went well during your initial studies and what you might do differently.
Create a game plan for everything you want to do before you retake the exam. Writing down your plan may help create accountability.
Join the ACE Study Coaches for a live Q&A Webinar or Facilitated Study Group to get your specific questions answered.
What happens after I'm ACE Certified?
CELEBRATE! You've now joined the highly respected ranks of 90,000+ ACE Certified Pros and hold the most recognized certification in the industry. Plus, we'll be providing support and guidance throughout your career, so you'll have access to the exclusive tools and resources you need to thrive as a health and fitness pro. Learn more about why it's great to be ACE Certified
here
.
Do I have to take the exam again to renew my certification?
No, provided you stay current on your continuing education credits (CECs) and renew on time. That means completing 20 hours of ACE-Approved CECs (2.0 CECs) during your two-year certification renewal cycles, or about 10 hours (1.0 CECs) per year. However, if you don't complete your 2.0 CECs and your certification expires, you will have to retake the exam. To avoid that scenario, check out our
continuing education catalog
and consider signing up for the
CEC Power Pass

How to renew your ACE Credentials
Renewal process for ACE Personal Trainers, Health Coaches,
Group Fitness Instructors and Medical Exercise Specialists
Your ACE Credential sets you apart and indicates the utmost credibility and commitment to your clients and employers.
To continue delivering on your mission to get people moving, you must maintain a current ACE Certification or Certificate by earning continuing education credits (CECs) and renewing your credential every two years.
The ACE Credential renewal process is simple and ensures you won't have to sit for the exam again in the future. Just complete the steps below.
4 Easy Steps to Renew
1. Earn 20 hours of ACE-Approved CECs
Complete 20 hours (2.0 CECs) of ACE-Approved continuing education within your two-year renewal cycle–only 10 hours (1.0 CECs) per year.
Complete your continuing education between the start and end dates of your renewal cycle, available in your My ACE profile.
Choose from thousands of ACE-Approved courses. Ensure you complete one hour (0.1 CEC) on Professional Conduct & Ethics every two years to renew your credential. View FAQs about this requirement.

12 Creative Ways to Earn CECs
.
2. Enter your CECs into My ACE
CECs from ACE courses are automatically entered into your My ACE Account. For other ACE-Approved providers, enter the course (CEP) number, CEC value, and completion date
using this easy tool
.
Courses that have not yet been ACE-Approved can be petitioned for CECs.
View FAQs about the petition process
.
You cannot repeat continuing education courses to fulfill your renewal requirements.
CECs can only be applied toward the renewal cycle in which they are completed. While additional continuing education is always encouraged, CECs in excess of the required 2.0 will not be rolled over and credited toward future credential renewals.
If you hold multiple ACE Credentials, CECs for one ACE Credential can be applied to another ACE Credential as long as they are completed within that credential's renewal cycle.
3. Update your CPR/AED information
As a health and exercise professional, it's vital that you're prepared if a client experiences a life-threatening event, which is why ACE requires you to maintain a current adult CPR/AED certificate. You can easily update your CPR (and AED if you are in the U.S. or Canada) certification details in your
My ACE Account
. Plus, earning this certification is worth up to 0.4 CECs!
View CPR/AED course options
.
4. Renew your ACE Credentials
Once everything has been completed, simply click the "Complete Renewal" button in your My ACE Account, select the credential(s) you are renewing, agree to the affirmation statement and submit your application. Then go to your shopping cart and pay the renewal fee.
Done! You're renewed for two years and have gained new skills to advance your career and help more people reach their goals. And don't forget, your digital credentials are always available in your
My ACE profile page

ACE Credential Renewal Fees
The ACE Credential renewal process is straightforward and guarantees that, as long as you complete your renewal on time, you won't need to retake the exam in the future. Renewal rates are reduced for each additional ACE Credential. If your ACE Credential has expired, it may be eligible for reinstatement and renewal rates will increase depending on the length of expiration.

ACE Professional Conduct & Ethics Continuing Education Requirement FAQs
Why is Professional Conduct & Ethics education a requirement?
ACE wants health and fitness clients to receive safe exercise instruction and health coaching from well-qualified professionals, while at the same time helping ACE Certified Professionals to limit their own professional liability. To achieve these goals, it is important that ACE Certified Professionals remain current on topics related to risk management, professional liability, ethical and legal business practices, scopes of practice and professional boundaries, client confidentiality and protected health information, and best practices for fostering equity, diversity, inclusion, and culture.
By requiring at least 0.1 CEC (1 hour) of education every two years be focused on topics in the Professional Conduct & Ethics category, ACE is helping ACE Certified Professionals to stay current on these topics.
What is Professional Conduct & Ethics continuing education?
The topics in the Professional Conduct & Ethics continuing education category are pulled directly from the "Professional Conduct and Risk Management" Domain in the exam content outlines for each ACE Certification.
Relevant topics include ethical and legal business practices, risk management and liability procedures, client confidentiality and protected health information, and best practices for fostering equity, diversity, inclusion, and culture.
How is Professional Conduct & Ethics continuing education related to renewing my ACE Certification(s)?
ACE requires all ACE Certified Professionals to complete one hour (0.1 CEC) out of the total 20 hours (2.0 CECs) of continuing education focused on Professional Conduct & Ethics during every two-year certification period to become eligible to renew their ACE Certification(s).
Complete renewal requirements include:
20 hours (2.0 CECs) of ACE-approved continuing education
1 hour (0.1 CEC) out of the total 20 hours (2.0 CECs) must be from the Professional Conduct & Ethics category
A current CPR/AED certificate
A renewal fee
ACE has never required me to be current on Professional Conduct and Ethics related topics in the past. Why now?
ACE reviews its certification and recertification requirements on a regular basis to ensure that they are current for the specific job role (e.g., personal trainer) and aligned with industry-wide best practices for professionals to remain competent. Questions specifically addressing scope of practice, ethical and legal business practices, risk management and liability procedures, client confidentiality, privacy and protected health information, and best practices for fostering equity, diversity, inclusion, and culture make up 15-19% of all ACE Certification exams. Knowing that competence in these areas is required to earn an ACE Certification, staying current in them is important to maintain an ACE Certification.
ACE implemented this certification renewal requirement to help ACE Certified Professionals stay current with these key professional conduct and risk management topics. The decision was made with input from ACE's certification committee members and feedback from employers that the change was both reasonable and appropriate for the professions for which ACE offers certifications.
How can I meet the Professional Conduct & Ethics continuing education requirement?
You may choose from any of the following options to meet the requirement:
Complete an ACE-approved course from the ACE Continuing Education catalog
here
. Eligible courses are denoted with an
Ethics Course
icon.
Complete an ACE-approved course from a trusted provider listed
here
. Eligible courses are denoted with an
Ethics Course
icon.
Petition a non-ACE approved course that you believe meets the requirement for education on Professional Conduct & Ethics. Learn about the petition process
here
.

additional ACE Certification
.
I took (or will be taking) a course that I believe fits in this Professional Conduct & Ethics continuing education category. How can I get credit for this course?
ACE Certified Professionals are able to petition education they completed on topics in the Professional Conduct & Ethics continuing education category. Learn about the petition process
here
.
How much do eligible courses cost?
The cost of courses varies. View a list of eligible courses
here
.
If I have multiple ACE Certifications, do I have to take an eligible course to meet the Professional Conduct & Ethics continuing education requirement for each certification or does one eligible course count across all of my certifications?
If you complete one eligible course within the timeframe when all ACE Certifications are current, it will count toward all certifications.
I already took one of the courses in the Professional Conduct & Ethics continuing education category. Can I apply that towards this requirement?
Eligible courses taken within your current certification cycle will fulfill this requirement and be reflected in your My ACE Account. Any eligible courses taken during a prior certification cycle would not apply to your current certification renewal.
How will ACE know that I completed an ACE-approved Professional Conduct & Ethics course?
Eligible courses will be automatically recognized in your My ACE Account as fulfilling this requirement. You can track your status in the
Manage My CECs
section of your My ACE Account.
I have CEC Power Pass. Will eligible courses be included in my membership?
Yes! You can easily recognize eligible courses in the CEC Power Pass course catalog by looking for the
Ethics Course
icon next to the course.
I have more questions that aren't addressed here. Who can I contact?

Why Hire an ACE Pro?
Why is it important for my health and fitness professional to hold an ACE Credential?
ACE serves as America's Authority on Fitness
®
, equipping health and fitness professionals with the knowledge and skills they need to guide their clients safely and effectively. Whether your pro holds an NCCA-accredited ACE Certification or an ACE Certificate, they bring a high level of expertise and commitment to your health and fitness journey.
NCCA-Accredited Certification:
To earn an ACE Certification, professionals must pass a rigorous exam that tests their knowledge in exercise science, nutrition, exercise programming, instructional techniques, and more.  Each of our four primary certifications is accredited by the National Commission for Certifying Agencies (NCCA), the gold standard when it comes to accreditation of programs that certify professionals working in healthcare, fitness, wellness and other occupations.
ACE Personal Training Certificate:
Professionals with an ACE Personal Training Certificate have also demonstrated their expertise through focused education and assessment in specific areas of fitness. While not NCCA-accredited, these certificates reflect a deep understanding of personal training principles and a commitment to professional development.
Both types of ACE Pros are dedicated to providing safe, effective, and personalized guidance. By hiring an ACE Pro, you're choosing someone who is equipped with credible information, resources, and the latest research to help you achieve your health and fitness goals.
Dr. Sears Wellness Institute Health Coach Certification
Professionals with a Dr. Sears Wellness Institute (DSWI) Health Coach or Master Health Coach Certification have the expertise and credentials to provide the highest standard of health coaching. The Master Health Coach Certification is accredited by the National Board for Health & Wellness Coaching (NBHWC).
As of 2022, ACE has integrated with DSWI. All DSWI certifications remain valid for life, and DSWI Health Coaches are also recognized as ACE Professionals. Learn more about the acquisition

Getting people moving:
Our work and impact in fiscal year
2023-2024
An overwhelming body of evidence indicates that even a moderate amount of physical activity performed every week enhances health, prevents costly inactivity-related diseases, and contributes to a more joyful life. For nearly 40 years, ACE has been committed to translating that evidence into tangible action to get people moving. The following report highlights achievements and impact made in the past fiscal year from July 2023 to June 2024.
Certification
A foundational component of our approach to getting people moving is the certification of well-qualified exercise professionals and health coaches. With every professional we certify, the impact of evidence-based exercise programming and health coaching provided by ACE Certified Professionals becomes more widespread.
The respect and recognition of ACE certification programs is truly global. Since 2003, our four primary certification programs have been accredited by the National Commission for Certifying Agencies (NCCA). The ACE Personal Trainer and ACE Group Fitness Instructor Certification Programs are also recognized by the International Confederation of Registers for Exercise Professionals (ICREPs).
ACE is an enthusiastic supporter and leader of exercise professionals and health coaches who inspire communities around the world in getting and staying physically active.

Personal Trainer
ACE Pro Spotlight
Yomi Karade, an ACE Certified Personal Trainer since 2017, provides inclusive fitness programs for neurodivergent individuals and atypical adults and children over 13 years old.
As a mom to a child with autism, Yomi noticed the lack of fitness and physical activity opportunities for this community and knew she had to step in to help. As an ACE Pro she has led inclusive gym programs which have helped boost the confidence in this underserved population. Yomi also launched the Special Needs Fitness Magazine, designed to bring fitness and physical activity information and programs to those outside her gym.
Yomi stands out due to her deep connection with her clients. They're not just part of her fitness journey; they are the journey. Her commitment to creating personalized and creative training programs is all about adapting to their needs while learning from them. When asked what she loves most about her work, the answer is immediate:
"My clients. They make me a better trainer, a better listener, a better instructor. They help me to adapt to suit their needs while I learn about them. My clients are my growth. They teach me while I provide safe, challenging and creative training programs for them."
Yomi is living the ACE mission to get people moving and her story is a reminder that dedication, empathy, and inclusivity can transform lives. Share your ACE story

Equity, Diversity & Inclusion
ACE is committed to do our part to help end structural racism and address diversity and inclusion in the fitness and physical activity industry. This commitment looks different for every organization, and at ACE we have been striving to keep equity, diversity and inclusion (EDI) top of mind. This year, ACE developed educational resources, increased professional standards, and secured media placements to elevate the EDI discussion. We also partnered with like-minded organizations to create a more diverse, inclusive, and equitable industry which is of paramount importance to the future.
Education
To combat inactivity in various populations, ACE developed and partnered with like-minded organizations to provide EDI-related courses that inform and encourage increased movement among communities across the nation.
Fitness for Healing: Trauma-Informed Approaches
ACE hosted a panel of experts in the areas of trauma and trauma-informed fitness techniques to address the impact of death, accidents, and other traumatic life events and how that may show up in client relationships. In addition, panelists shared how health and fitness professionals can create positive interactions and help mitigate difficult scenarios while remaining within their scope of practice and maintaining a supportive relationship with their clients.
Effective Pre/Postnatal Client Assessment Strategies (ACE partner course)
There can be multiple challenges in prenatal fitness routines, including time and energy constraints, concerns about exercise safety and, for the postpartum client, the need for programs that address conditions like diastasis recti and incontinence. Through this course, participants gain knowledge surrounding the challenges the prenatal and postpartum demographic face and develop the skills to conduct appropriate assessments.
Science of Programming for Older Adults
In October 2023, an ACE discussion explored the importance of health and exercise for aging populations, providing a new perspective on older adults and their unique needs and to learn how to create appropriate programming. By understanding their physical changes, motivations and how they differ from their younger counterparts, health and fitness professionals will be equipped to create effective, fulfilling exercise experiences for older adults.
Equal Pay Pledge
In August 2023, ACE proudly announced its commitment to the
California Equal Pay Pledge
. This decision reflects an ongoing organizational dedication to promoting equity, diversity and inclusion and advancing gender equity within the health and fitness sector. By signing this pledge, ACE joins the efforts to close the gender pay gap and support women in their careers by ensuring opportunities to thrive in their professional lives.
Partnerships and Collaborations
In February 2024, ACE supported the
Live to the Beat
campaign, led by the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention Foundation and the Million Hearts® Initiative. ACE provided physical activity and wellness resources and recommendations to the campaign and promoted it to health coaches and exercise professionals through blogs and social media.
The 2024 campaign, titled "Heart2Heart," centered on promoting heart health of Black women, highlighting the significance of February as both Black History Month and Heart Health Month. The primary message of the campaign urged Black women to prioritize self-care and personal health, whether at home or in the workplace, to make a significant difference in their overall well-being.
The IDEA World Convention Scholarship Program, funded by Kathie and Peter Davis, founders of IDEA Health & Fitness Association (IDEA) and the IDEA Foundation (now the American Council on Exercise, or ACE), announced five 2023 award recipients who attended IDEA World Convention in Los Angeles, California between July 12-16, 2023.
The 2023 IDEA World Convention Scholarship recipients include:
Caroline Morin
, a health coach and teacher, works with Lifting spirits, Improving bodies, Feeding souls, Transforming lives (LIFT) Fitness Foundation. Based in Virginia, LIFT is a nonprofit organization that offers fitness and nutrition programs to homeless individuals, people in substance abuse recovery, veterans, and children in underserved communities. LIFT addresses gaps for local shelters by providing 30-, 60- and 90-day programs focusing on fitness and nutrition education, goal setting, motivational coaching and community support.
Frank G. McKenna
, a former special needs teacher, retired from teaching when he was diagnosed with Stage 4 Lung Cancer in 2016. Determined to stay healthy and overcome the challenges of his diagnosis, he grew stronger and became a certified cancer exercise specialist to support and serve other cancer survivors in his community, a mission he continues today. In addition to running his own studio, Frank co-coordinates the Wellness Beyond Cancer program through his local healthcare system.
Frann Ravid
, an ACE Certified Group Fitness Instructor, initiated the Adult Fitness Program in her town, a low-cost, community fitness program serving men and women of various abilities ages 36-78. Inspired by ACE's community engagement efforts and motivated by the closure of a local gym, Frann partnered with her Parks and Recreation Department to volunteer and teach fitness classes. Three years after its inception, the Adult Fitness Program earns approximately $1,000 each month from its $2.75 fee per class, with the revenue supporting recreational programs for children and teens.
Tiffany Copeland
is the director of the Fitness Warriors program, which trains community leaders to become group fitness instructors, aiming to increase physical activity opportunities in communities around Richmond, Virginia. Her nonprofit organization focuses on addressing health disparities in underserved communities and partners with local churches, libraries, and community centers to build trust and engage individuals lacking access to fitness and physical activity options. Copeland and her team currently reach 6,000+ new people through their 34 weekly classes held both on Zoom and in person.
Ana Almeida-DoRosario
, an ACE Group Fitness Instructor and ACE Health Coach, is highlighted below under "ACE Health Coach Spotlight."
The IDEA World Convention Scholarship Program, established by Kathie and Peter Davis in 2018 and managed by ACE, honors the outstanding contributions of exercise professionals and health coaches who positively impact their communities. The scholarship covers event registration, travel, accommodations, and meals during the Convention.
In the media
Beyond offering educational resources and partnerships, ACE collaborated with national and local publications to promote the importance of equity, diversity, and inclusion in the fitness industry. Select placements include:

At ACE
ACE has provided its employees, executive team, and board of directors with educational resources and other opportunities to practice and celebrate EDI within the organization.
One key resource is the ACE EDI Council, an employee-led group that offers recommendations to ACE leaders and contributes to the planning and evaluation of organizational activities related to EDI. The Council helps reinforce EDI values and fosters an equitable environment where diverse voices are heard and included. With a more diverse team shaping and reviewing EDI efforts, ACE aims to create a stronger and more effective EDI impact in promoting equity, diversity, and inclusion.
Population Health Improvement
In the past fiscal year, ACE continued to build partnerships across various sectors to support and motivate individuals to achieve recommended physical-activity levels, aiding in the prevention and management of chronic diseases.
Key Partnerships
ACE leaders served on numerous advisory panels and established collaborative relationships with key organizations in the field of population-health improvement, including:

Special Olympics International
ACE was one of six recipients of the 2023-2024 Special Olympics, Inc. “Systems Change in Inclusive Health Subgrants.” This grant program supports organizations seeking solutions to systemic issues affecting the health and well-being of people with intellectual and developmental disabilities (IDD).
ACE developed curriculum to train physical activity leaders, both with and without IDD, to enhance fitness access and education in underserved communities nationwide.

equips instructors with the skills to engage participants and foster relationships that extend beyond the classroom. RRAMP, an acronym for respect, recognition, alignment, mistakes, and participant, provides a practical approach for group fitness instructors, facility owners, and managers to create a caring and task-involved environment. This approach builds intrinsic motivation and inspires participants to return to classes again and again.
Health and Wellness Coaching
According to a recent study published by the
Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA)
, approximately 80% of US adults and adolescents are insufficiently active. Physical inactivity ranks as the fourth leading risk factor for mortality, according to the
World Health Organization
.
Since 2012, ACE has educated health coaches and fitness professionals to help people reach their goals and implement lifestyle changes that improve their overall health and wellness through exercise, nutrition, and psychology.
The
ACE Health Coach Certification Program
is accredited by the NCCA, and in 2021, ACE was recognized by the National Board of Health and Wellness Coaching as an approved education provider. In 2023, the ACE Health Coach Certification Program was selected as one of the best health coach certification programs of the year. ACE also offers
online courses
and
free articles
about health coaching and behavior change in addition to certification services.
What is a health coach?
A health coach is trained to partner with individuals or groups to help them discover their unique skills, strengths, abilities, and untapped potential. They assist clients in creating realistic health and lifestyle goals through self-discovery, providing guidance on making changes that suit their personal circumstances. Health coaches work in various settings, from health clubs to corporations, virtual coaching, and healthcare environments.
While many exercise professionals focus on the physical aspects of fitness, health coaches emphasize the client's overall lifestyle. They provide relevant, applicable, and skill-based strategies beyond a workout program to support comprehensive well-being.

Like-minded collaborators
It's Time to Move
"It's Time To Move"
is a multi-year project that will empower health care providers to seamlessly integrate physical activity clinical measures into patient care plans and help make physical activity prescription a standard of care. ACE was a regular advisor and participant in this initiative led by the Physical Activity Alliance (PAA) and the American Heart Association.
Physical Activity Alliance
ACE is an active partner and supporter of the
Physical Activity Alliance (PAA)
, an organization dedicated to making active choices easy. PAA collaborates with other leading health advocacy organizations in the United States to lead efforts in creating, supporting, and advocating for policy and system changes that enable all Americans to enjoy physically active lives.
In fiscal year 2023-2024, ACE worked directly with the PAA to amplify their advocacy efforts for increasing physical activity and improved health for Americans. Key initiatives included:
PAA preparing to introduce a signature omnibus bill with Congressman Panetta (D-CA) to promote physical activity.
A PAA Symposium panel discussion in Washington, D.C. on improving equity, diversity, and inclusion in physical activity.
Participated in the Europe Active Technical Expert Group for the health coach job role in Europe.
A PAA webinar on Physical Activity Guidelines Mid-Course Update, specifically addressing physical activity for older adults.
A presentation on Health Level Seven International (HL7) efforts at the Medical Fitness Association (MFA) Conference.

HL7 Physical Activity Implementation Guide
, which aims to standardize interoperability expectations for systems involved in measuring, reporting, and intervening to improve patient physical activity levels in the U.S.
Advancing standards for the profession
ACE advocates for consistent standards of professionalism within the fitness industry. In fiscal year 2023-2024, ACE served on boards and committees that improve the quality of education, credentialing, and workplaces for the exercise professional, including:

Education Advisory Committee
ACE is a founding member of the Coalition for the Registration of Exercise Professionals (CREP), a nonprofit organization dedicated to providing resources and leadership to help people lead more active, healthy lifestyles through movement, physical activity and exercise. In the past year, ACE spearheaded and supported episodes of CREP's new webinar series, sharing valuable knowledge and facilitating important discussions, including "Addressing Military Readiness: The Role of Exercise Professionals." In addition, through its partnership with ACE, CREP advanced the U.S. National Exercise Referral Framework (NERF), which aims to integrate exercise prescription into healthcare.
CREP/USREPS was named the Medical Fitness Association's (MFA)
Strategic Partner of the Year
for collaboration on HL7 efforts on physical activity assessment, prescription and referral as a standard of care.
In addition to its leadership within CREP, ACE led conference presentations and sessions at multiple industry events. These include:

We also may collect browser type, device type (such as desktop, laptop, table, phone, etc.), operating system and local time zone. Please check your web browser if you want to learn what information your browser sends or how to change your settings.
How We Use Personal Data:
We will only process your Personal Data, including sharing it with third parties, where:
you have provided your consent which can be withdrawn at any time,
the processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which you are a party,
we are required by law,
processing is required to protect your vital interests or those of another person, or
processing is necessary for the purposes of our legitimate commercial interests, except where such interests are overridden by your rights and interests.
We may use Personal Data you give us for the following purposes:
We use the information you provide about yourself or someone else when placing an order or making a request only to the extent necessary to complete that order or request;
To carry out our obligations arising from your certification;
To provide our Certified eNewsletter, provided you have given your consent;
To respond to your questions and provide related certification services such as renewal notices; and
To ensure that ACE content is presented most effectively for you and the device you are viewing it on.
We may use Personal Data we collect about you for the following purposes:
To administer ACE Services and for internal operations, including troubleshooting, data analysis, testing, research, statistical and survey purposes;
To improve ACE Services to ensure that content is presented most effectively for you and the device you are viewing it on;
As part of our efforts to keep ACE Services safe and secure;
To measure or understand the effectiveness of advertising we serve to you and others, and to deliver relevant advertising to you, and;
To make suggestions and recommendations to you and other users of ACE Services about goods or services that may interest you or them.
When we share and who can access your Personal Data
We may share your Personal Data for the purposes described in this Privacy Policy with:
employees of ACE,
partners, suppliers and sub-contractors,
analytics and search engine providers that assist us in the improvement and optimization of ACE Services,
credit processing and credit reference agencies, and,
in the event that we sell or buy any business or assets, in which case we may disclose your Personal Data to the prospective seller or buyer of such business or assets solely for the purposes of the transaction.
We will not sell your Personal Data to third parties without your consent. From time to time with your consent, we may send information about our services to the email or mailing address provided by you. To be removed from receiving any mailings, you may contact our customer service department at
support@ACEfitness.org
or +1-858-576-6500. Unless we think that such action is necessary to comply with the law or legal process or to protect the interests of ACE or others, we will not release your Personal Data without your consent.
We are headquartered in the United States. Your Personal Data may be accessed by us or transferred to us in the United States to our affiliates, partners, merchants or service providers who are located worldwide. If you are visiting our Site from outside the United Sates, be aware that your information may be transferred to, stored and processed in the United States where our servers are located and our central database is operated. By using our Service, you consent to any transfer of this information.
We will store your Personal Data, in a form which permits us to identify you, for no longer than is necessary for the purpose for which the Personal Data is processed. We may retain and use your Personal Data as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes and enforce our agreements and rights, or if it is not technically reasonably feasible to remove it. Consistent with these requirements, we will try to delete your Personal Data quickly upon request.
Your European Rights
You have the right to ask us not to process your Personal Data for marketing purposes. We will usually inform you (before collecting your Personal Data) if we intend to use your Personal Data for such purposes or if we intend to disclose your information to any third party for such purposes. You can exercise your right to prevent such processing by not checking certain boxes on the forms we use to collect your Personal Data. You can also contact us as listed in this Privacy Policy.
Under European data protection law, in certain circumstances, you have the right to:
Request access to your Personal Data
Request correction of your Personal Data
Request erasure of your Personal Data
Object to processing of your Personal Data
Request restriction of processing your Personal Data
Request transfer of your Personal Data
In addition, where you believe that ACE has not complied with its obligations under this Privacy Policy or European law, you have the right to make a complaint to an EU Data Protection Authority.
Cookies
Like many websites, our Site uses cookies to distinguish you from other users of the Site. This helps us to analyze the use of the Site to customize and improve the content and the layout of the Site.
You do not have to accept our cookies and can block them by activating the setting on your browser that allows you to refuse some or all cookies. You may also delete them after they have been placed on your hard drive. If you do not accept our cookies, or delete them, some areas of the Site that you access may take more time to work or may not work at all.
We use the following cookies:
Strictly necessary cookies
Analytical/performance cookies
Functionality cookies
Targeting cookies
Third party cookies
“Do not track” signals
We do not respond to web browser “do not track” signals. As such, your navigation of our Site may be tracked as part of gathering of quantitative user information described above. If you arrive to our Site from a link from a third party site that does respond to “do not track” requests, that will end once you reach our site.
Rules for Submissions and Messages
Responsibility for what is posted in the discussion groups or other public forums lies with each user--you alone are responsible for the content of your messages, and the consequences of any such messages. We cannot and do not review every submission a user may make. We neither endorse nor guarantee the accuracy or propriety of any submission. We do, however, reserve the right but do not assume the obligation to delete submissions and restrict or prohibit your use of our sites for legal or other reasons.
Our Commitment To Data Security
To prevent unauthorized access, maintain data accuracy, and ensure the correct use of information, we have put in place appropriate physical, electronic, and managerial procedures to safeguard and secure the information we collect. However, we cannot guarantee the security of information transmitted to us over the internet. You are responsible for keeping your password secret. Never give your password to anyone, even someone claiming to be an ACE employee.
Web Linking
ACE may link to other web sites. These sites may collect user information or solicit personal information. Since we do not control these sites we are not responsible or liable for the privacy practices or content of such sites.
Our Commitment To Children's Privacy:
Protecting the privacy of the very young is especially important. For that reason, we never collect or maintain information at our website from those we actually know are under 13, and no part of our Site is structured to attract anyone under 13. If we learn that Personal Data of persons less than 13 years old has been collected through our Site, we will take the appropriate steps to delete this information.
How To Access Or Correct Your Information
You may access or correct your Personal Data that we maintain by contacting our customer service department at
support@ACEfitness.org
or by visiting the ACE store and clicking on My Account. To better protect your privacy and security, your email address must match the email address used to establish your account. We use this procedure to better safeguard your information. If you have any questions you may contact our customer service by phone at +1-858-576-6500.
How To Contact Us

ACE Return Policy
Requesting a Refund
Please review the refund policy below to determine eligibility.
All refunds require return authorization codes. To request a refund, contact
support@acefitness.org
. See below for bulk order refunds.
Study Program and Physical Materials Return Policy
Individuals
who purchase materials/products are subject to the following policies. For
Bulk Orders / Bookstores (Materials Return)
see section below:
Materials/products returned within
30 days of purchase
are eligible for a return.
Exchanges of materials/products are
not

If materials are returned in good condition within 30 days, no restocking fee will apply.
If the study program includes a voucher or live education product that has been used, the study program is not refundable (see voucher and live education policies below).
If materials are returned in good condition within 30 days, no restocking fee will apply.
Good condition is defined as being undamaged, unused and able to be re-sold without issue. The determination of any returned items' condition will be ultimately determined by ACE.
If the item(s) are not returned in good condition, a 20% restocking fee will apply, which is applied to the total full cost of the program or materials (excluding sales tax and shipping costs), regardless if paid in full or through a full or partial payment plan.
Shipping charges related to returns are non-refundable. ACE is not responsible for shipping charges related to returns or refunds. The costs associated with shipping a product back to ACE from refusing a delivery shall be deducted from any refund.
Online Courseware Return Policy
Unused online courseware and subscriptions to courseware are eligible for a refund within 30 days, unless explicitly ineligible per the product page. Electronic versions of books (eBooks, audiobooks, etc.) are non-refundable unless included in a complete ACE Study Program (see

Voucher Return Policy
above. Live Education & Support components may not be refunded separately from the program in which they were included. Programs may only be refunded in full.
Customers who purchase and schedule a live education program that is delivered on specific dates (live class, etc.) are eligible for a refund either until 24 hours (Pacific Standard Time) prior to the start date or 30 days after purchase, whichever date/time occurs first.
Customers who purchase access to study support products such as Facilitated Study Group, Live Q&A Study Session, etc. are eligible for refund 30 days after purchase if sessions were not attended.
ACE will make the Facilitated Study Group & Live Q&A products available for a period of 6 months from the date of purchase. In the event ACE terminates those products prior to that date, the customer would be eligible for a refund.
Bulk Orders / Bookstores (Materials Return)

Accreditation
What is Accreditation?
To understand the importance of accreditation, you have to understand the different types of accreditations and the purposes they serve. Health and fitness professionals typically pursue programs that fall into one of two categories of accreditation.
Education Program
Accreditation
Ensures your educational program meets defined standards of excellence for best practice in education.
Certification Program Accreditation
Ensures your certification program meets defined standards of excellence for best practice in determining if you meet requirements to perform a specific job.
Accreditation standards for education programs are different than those used for accreditation of certification programs. Accreditation of education programs is focused on quality instruction, institutional structure, and whether students completing the program or degree have learned a defined body of knowledge. Accreditation of certification programs is focused on the quality, validity and reliability of the program, its competency-based assessments, and its ability to differentiate individuals who are qualified to practice in a given profession.
Why are they both important? Earning a degree from an accredited education program provides verification that you learned something from a quality institution. Earning an accredited certification provides verification that you have met the criteria to work as a professional.
In keeping with standards of practice among other healthcare professionals, ACE has received accreditation for all four of its primary certification programs. The ACE Personal Trainer, Group Fitness Instructor, Health Coach, and Medical Exercise Specialist Certification programs all hold accreditation by the National Commission for Certifying Agencies (NCCA).
All Certifications are not created equal
Be wary! There are more than 100 providers offering certification programs that are not accredited at all. It's a list that contains respectable organizations, fly-by-night operators, and providers of overnight “credentials” that do little to prepare you for a career.
Accreditation Facts
1. More opportunity
ACE and several other leading health and fitness certification organizations stand behind accreditation by the NCCA, an independent accrediting body that also evaluates programs for other health professionals like registered dietitians, nurse practitioners, medical assistants and occupational therapists. Meeting standards of excellence already recognized in the medical community is the straightest path toward recognition by healthcare providers as part of the healthcare continuum, and ultimately, more opportunities to serve people who need our help.
2. New expectations
For the doors to really open for health and fitness professionals to help significantly more people in close proximity to the healthcare system, the credentials of exercise professionals will be subject to exponentially more scrutiny than they are today. The lack of trust in fitness credentials from non-accredited programs has even prompted some state governments to take action on their own. NCCA accreditation represents the best opportunity for our profession to show we have credentials that are ironclad verifiable, and representative of a standard of excellence already recognized by healthcare providers and state agencies that license and regulate those healthcare professions.
3. New places
The world in which fitness professionals, and health and wellness experts work is rapidly changing. Personal trainers, group fitness instructors and other credentialed exercise professionals can still be found in fitness clubs. But opportunities are also emerging in all sorts of other places—workplaces, wellness centers and health clinics, schools, churches, community centers and more. In those places, credentials are falling under significantly increased scrutiny. Holding a certification that has earned NCCA accreditation can ensure the professionals who work in all of those settings have the knowledge, skills and competence to lead people safely and effectively.
4. New ways of thinking
The healthcare system has really begun to search for ways to make prevention a fundamental part of healthcare. Experts increasingly agree a key to successful prevention is high-quality physical activity programming delivered in communities as part of the healthcare system and an extension of the doctor's office. Exercise professionals are the most qualified practitioners to deliver those services. In order to be recognized as deliverers of those programs, exercise professionals must meet the standard of other healthcare professionals. In healthcare and other professions, that standard is NCCA accreditation.
NCCA Accreditation
This is the accreditation you should care about
The nation's most respected thinkers in health and fitness agree that NCCA accreditation is the gold standard when it comes to accreditation of programs that certify professionals working in healthcare, fitness, wellness and other occupations. When you're searching for certification programs, make sure you always look for the NCCA-accredited program seal.
U.S. Registry of Exercise Professionals
See your name on a list that counts
The U.S. Registry of Exercise Professionals is an online registry at USreps.org where consumers and employers can identify professionals in the United States who hold current, NCCA-accredited exercise certifications. People can also use the registry to identify highly qualified exercise professionals in their area who can provide the leadership and expertise they need to reach their health, fitness or performance goals.
The six organizations behind Coalition for the Registration of Exercise Professionals (CREP) and USREPS—ACE and five competing certification providers that also offer NCCA-accredited certifications—are putting serious resources into advocating on behalf of the exercise professional and ensuring that employers and consumers in the United States verify credentials on the registry before making a hire.
If you opt for a certification that's not NCCA accredited, you will not benefit from CREP's advocacy efforts or inclusion on USREPS. That could mean fewer opportunities to do amazing, lucrative work in a field that you love.
