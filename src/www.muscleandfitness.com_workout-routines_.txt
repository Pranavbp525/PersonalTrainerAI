Cheese is rich and creamy, and that is the reason most of us love the stuff. So much so, that
the average American guy consumes nearly 42 pounds of the dairy product each year
, an amount that has been inching upwards in recent years. Sliced, shredded, melted, crumbled, or baked, we can’t get enough of it.
Cheese is a staple in cultures all over the world, as before industrialization and refrigerators, fermented dairy products (cheese, kefir, yogurt) were common ways to keep dairy around for longer. These days, there are thousands of varieties ranging from rather pedestrian to truly funky.
As much as we adore this dairy product, though, most of us are a little weary of that block of cheddar or oozy mozzarella. “Cheese is my weakness” might be the way you think of it as if you are committing a dietary sin by digging into game-day nachos. It’s considered more of an indulgence than a health food. It’s easy to see why people might feel conflicted about this food group. Yes, the various types can be dense in calories, fat, and salt. But it’s also a source of protein, calcium, B vitamins, and other nutrients you want more of. That makes it a challenge to pigeonhole it into the healthy or unhealthy category.
Luckily, it appears as if cheese is something you can feel good about eating for health and muscle, as long as you play by the rules. Read on for the cheese facts you need to know before you make another call to Domino’s.
How To Eat Cheese Without The Guilt
If you always want more Parm on your pasta and can’t imagine your turkey sandwich minus the slice of Swiss, know this: Modern day research suggests that even full-fat cheese won’t necessarily harm your ticker or make your midriff more soft than solid.
Firstly, it appears that cheese doesn’t raise (or necessarily reduce) your risk for some of today’s biggest killers, such as heart disease.
This review of research even suggests
that there could be an inverse relationship between cheese consumption and heart disease death. A large meta-analysis of 15 studies published in the
European Journal of Nutrition
that looked at cheese’s impact on heart disease found that people eating the most (1.5 ounces per day) had a surprisingly 10% lower risk than those who didn’t eat any. One reason might be the impact it has on our cholesterol.
In a six-week randomized clinical trial it was discovered
that when people consumed full-fat cheddar cheese they did not experience the same rise in smaller LDL-cholesterol particles as they did when eating the same amount of fat from butter. Small, dense LDL particles are believed to be more strongly related to cardiovascular disease risk than larger particles.
Experts have varying theories about why cheese might be more benign than perhaps butter or a slab of fatty steak. One thought that makes sense is that it has a lot more than its saturated fat content – an ounce of cheddar has about 5 grams of saturated fat. For cheese, a nutrition matrix effect exists, where different nutrients and compounds such as sphingolipids within the food work in concert to produce a net positive (or, at the least more of a neutral) health impact and essentially cancelling out the potentially deleterious effects of saturated fat.
When milk is transformed into cheese, the process alters the way the nutrients and other components in it are chemically arranged. This may affect how cheese is digested and processed by the body, which can lead to varying health effects that are different from the effects of eating dairy in altered forms, such as butter. All of us should be putting more emphasis on entire foods and how their nutrients, antioxidants, and other components interact with each other.
Many of the studies on cheese and health use it in a non-melted form, which is different than eating cheese on pizza or in cooked dishes like lasagne. Though there is
some initial research
to suggest that it might be more advantageous to eat un-melted cheese for heart health, it is not yet fully known how melting impacts the overall cheese matrix structure, and if this can alter the nutrition and health impact. This would be good to know since so much of the cheese in America is consumed in melted form as is the case with pizza.
Let’s not overlook that when its made it can gain some beneficial compounds, too. For instance, Vitamin K2 can form during the fermentation process and this harder to find form of the nutrient can be important for cardiovascular health. Just don’t expect much in the way of vitamin K from Velveeta.
Different cheeses are made with different types of bacteria, which, in large part, are responsible for the unique flavors. These same micro-critters may have beneficial effects on our microbiome, which, in turn, could lead to improved health outcomes including some relief from digestive concerns like irritable bowel disease. With this said the impact of eating cheese on the microbiome is yet to be properly studied. It’s not known if you get anywhere near the concentration of beneficial microorganisms from a slice of Gouda or blue cheese as you would from a cup of yogurt.
Despite being a concentrated source of calories, some studies suggest you don’t need to skip cheese to keep your six-pack well stocked. In one research paper, published in
The
New England Journal of Medicine,
researchers set out to determine which foods were linked to weight gain
by following 120,877 men and women in the U.S. for two decades, examining their weight every four years. While they found that consuming more of certain foods such as refined grains (hello, white bread) and sugary drinks was associated with weight gain, eating more of others, like nuts and fruits, helped with weight loss.
Cheese wasn’t associated with either gain or loss, even for people who increased the amount of it they ate during the study. One reason cheese may help with weight control is that its protein and fat content may help moderate appetite. Still, there is a dearth of quality research examining the impact that it has on body composition and whether its source matters. It’s likely only problematic if it contributes to an excess of calories and is part of ultra-processed food at which point you should be questioning how wise it was to order a second helping.
And here is some awesome news for cheese lovers! It can help you get more buff.
In a recent
Journal of Nutrition
study
, 20 healthy males took in 30 grams of protein provided as cheese or milk protein concentrate following a bout of weight training to determine if there would be any differences in the rate of post-training muscle protein synthesis. Despite there being higher peak concentrations of blood amino acids with the milk protein concentrate there was no difference in the rate of muscle-building between the cheese and milk protein powder.
This has been supported by other research showing that cheese protein can help with muscle-making efforts when combined with resistance training. A single ounce serving of cheese has about 6 to 8 grams of high-quality protein (most cheeses is higher in protein than saturated fat) that can certainly help you pack on more lean mass. However, you may not want to get 30 grams of protein solely from cheese after pumping iron. But it certainly can be a significant part of your post-training protein intake, maybe just not all.
As you might be all too aware of, lactose, a naturally present sugar in milk, can be difficult for some people to digest, leading to digestive woes like gas and bloating. However, the bacteria used to make cheese digests most of the lactose in the milk. Much of the remaining lactose is present in the whey, which is separated from the curds toward the end of the cheese-making process and drained off. This means many types of cheese have very little to no lactose and are safe to consume for sensitive tummies. In general, the higher in moisture a cheese is, the higher in lactose it is. That means harder cheese like provolone or cheddar will have less than cottage or ricotta cheese.
Pixel-Shot
Which Cheeses To Avoid
Where cheese can fall off the rails is when it is part of a diet too rich in ultra-processed foods and contributes to an excess of calories, saturated fat, and sodium. Fast-food pizza, cheeseburgers, mac and cheese, and pizza pockets are not the way that we should be getting our daily nutrients. Sadly, this is exactly the way too many people are eating the stuff. So when its a fixture of a 500-calorie slice of pizza or triple-decker burger it’s no wonder it is often considered a dietary villain.
It’s also problematic when we consume more processed products than the real stuff. American cheese slices fall well short of actual cheddar, and Velveeta is not the way you should be dressing your broccoli. There is a good chance that these products don’t give you the same nutritional benefits of better quality cheese.
As for those cheese flavored products on supermarket shelves such as crackers and chips, these rarely contain any cheese and instead rely on mystery cheese flavoring. Again, not cheese.
For those watching their sodium intake, certain types can be pretty salty. Some versions like feta, halloumi, Parmesan, and cotija are especially salty. If your diet contains a lot of other salty foods, then adding a couple of servings of cheese can push you over the top. If you’re eating about an ounce or two a day and eat mostly lower salt whole foods, however, it’s not a big concern. But there are some individuals like those with hypertension that may need to scale back their intake of higher salt foods.

How To Choose The Right Cheese For Your Diet
Overall, there’s no need to steer clear of cheese—unless you are getting largely hails from ultra-processed foods at which point you need to revaluate how much you are eating and where you are getting it from. If all this (mostly) positive news has you ready to dig into a wheel of Brie with a spoon, here are some cheesy tidbits worth knowing.
Watch Your Portions
To keep saturated fat and calories in check, most guys should limit their daily portion of cheese to no more than 2 ounces, which is about 200 calories and 10-12 grams of saturated fat. Yes, that is some tough love. But most of us have no idea what this amount looks like, which can lead to portion distortion. A smart move is to weigh your portions for a few days so you can get a sense of how much you are serving yourself. Much of the research suggesting a neutral or beneficial effect to eating cheese involved subjects consuming roughly an average of 1.5 ounces a day. Not the mega-amount you’ll get from a slice of deep-dish.
There is No One Best Choice
The internet is rife with articles about the healthiest cheese you can buy. But, truth be told, any and all real cheese is fine in moderation and the nutrition content does not vary greatly among the varieties. There are a few exceptions, like cottage cheese which is much higher in protein than other varieties, but then again many of us don’t consider this to be the same as Camembert or Swiss are.
Be a Softy
Softer styles of cheeses such as fresh mozzarella, goat, and brie typically have fewer calories per ounce than harder types like cheddar and Parmesan. That’s because with more moisture comes less calorie density. So if you want to enjoy a daily cheese habit but also keep calorie intake more on the down low then you can gravitate toward those you can cut through with almost zero effort. After all, I’ve never met a salad that wasn’t made way better with a scattering of soft goat cheese.
Swap it Out
There’s a big difference between grating some Parmesan over a salad and feasting on a greasy pepperoni pizza. In some studies, the health benefits of cheese were found to be the greatest when it replaced other less beneficial foods like processed meats or refined grains. So you could swap out some of the bacon for a chunk of cheese and come out ahead. Not so by blanketing a bowl of white pasta with a bag of shredded three-cheese mix.
Add it to Healthier Foods
The best way to eat your cheese is to use it as a flavor enhancer for nutritious foods. Add a few chunks of feta to a veggie-rich salad, grate some aged cheddar over homemade chili, drape a slice of fresh mozzarella over a lean turkey burger, or blend ricotta into a smoothie for added protein and to make it taste extra decadent. Using cheese to make these foods more exciting to eat increases the chances you’ll eat higher amounts of healthy meals and snacks. That’s a win-win.
Don’t Sack the Fat
When it comes to choosing between low-fat and full-fat cheese, you need not settle for the former. Undeniably, full-fat cheese will be more satisfying, both from a taste and texture perspective, and most of the research suggesting cheese ain’t so bad for us has involved subjects eating regular cheese. Sometimes fillers are added to accommodate the lack of fat in lower fat cheese at which point you start venturing further away from what cheese should be. There is also
evidence that people tend to eat larger portions
when choosing lower-fat (light) cheese, which could cancel out any calorie advantage.
As long as you aren’t going overboard on saturated fat intake elsewhere in your diet you will have room for the saturated fat you’ll get from a generous grating for Pecorino Romano. With this said, there is nothing wrong with opting for part-skim ricotta or mozzarella if you want to scale back your calorie and saturated fat intake. These also have a beneficial nutrition profile including protein and micronutrients like calcium.
Imitation Is Not Flattery
Short-cut cheese is not the way to go. On the whole, you want to focus on eating higher quality cheeses made the way it should be. You can read ingredient labels of packageg and look for products that contain questionable items like emulsifiers, cellulose, coloring, and modified corn starch, and then choose to give these a pass. Seeing “cheese product” on the food label should make you cut the cheese. Note that some American cheeses — the super melty, yellow-sliced processed variety you loved on toasted bread as a kit — is made from mostly water, so it has fewer nutrients than other cheeses. Processed cheese food slices are only required to have a minimum of 51% cheese. Why settle for less?

Cheese is rich and creamy, and that is the reason most of us love the stuff. So much so, that
the average American guy consumes nearly 42 pounds of the dairy product each year
, an amount that has been inching upwards in recent years. Sliced, shredded, melted, crumbled, or baked, we can’t get enough of it.
Cheese is a staple in cultures all over the world, as before industrialization and refrigerators, fermented dairy products (cheese, kefir, yogurt) were common ways to keep dairy around for longer. These days, there are thousands of varieties ranging from rather pedestrian to truly funky.
As much as we adore this dairy product, though, most of us are a little weary of that block of cheddar or oozy mozzarella. “Cheese is my weakness” might be the way you think of it as if you are committing a dietary sin by digging into game-day nachos. It’s considered more of an indulgence than a health food. It’s easy to see why people might feel conflicted about this food group. Yes, the various types can be dense in calories, fat, and salt. But it’s also a source of protein, calcium, B vitamins, and other nutrients you want more of. That makes it a challenge to pigeonhole it into the healthy or unhealthy category.
Luckily, it appears as if cheese is something you can feel good about eating for health and muscle, as long as you play by the rules. Read on for the cheese facts you need to know before you make another call to Domino’s.
How To Eat Cheese Without The Guilt
If you always want more Parm on your pasta and can’t imagine your turkey sandwich minus the slice of Swiss, know this: Modern day research suggests that even full-fat cheese won’t necessarily harm your ticker or make your midriff more soft than solid.
Firstly, it appears that cheese doesn’t raise (or necessarily reduce) your risk for some of today’s biggest killers, such as heart disease.
This review of research even suggests
that there could be an inverse relationship between cheese consumption and heart disease death. A large meta-analysis of 15 studies published in the
European Journal of Nutrition
that looked at cheese’s impact on heart disease found that people eating the most (1.5 ounces per day) had a surprisingly 10% lower risk than those who didn’t eat any. One reason might be the impact it has on our cholesterol.
In a six-week randomized clinical trial it was discovered
that when people consumed full-fat cheddar cheese they did not experience the same rise in smaller LDL-cholesterol particles as they did when eating the same amount of fat from butter. Small, dense LDL particles are believed to be more strongly related to cardiovascular disease risk than larger particles.
Experts have varying theories about why cheese might be more benign than perhaps butter or a slab of fatty steak. One thought that makes sense is that it has a lot more than its saturated fat content – an ounce of cheddar has about 5 grams of saturated fat. For cheese, a nutrition matrix effect exists, where different nutrients and compounds such as sphingolipids within the food work in concert to produce a net positive (or, at the least more of a neutral) health impact and essentially cancelling out the potentially deleterious effects of saturated fat.
When milk is transformed into cheese, the process alters the way the nutrients and other components in it are chemically arranged. This may affect how cheese is digested and processed by the body, which can lead to varying health effects that are different from the effects of eating dairy in altered forms, such as butter. All of us should be putting more emphasis on entire foods and how their nutrients, antioxidants, and other components interact with each other.
Many of the studies on cheese and health use it in a non-melted form, which is different than eating cheese on pizza or in cooked dishes like lasagne. Though there is
some initial research
to suggest that it might be more advantageous to eat un-melted cheese for heart health, it is not yet fully known how melting impacts the overall cheese matrix structure, and if this can alter the nutrition and health impact. This would be good to know since so much of the cheese in America is consumed in melted form as is the case with pizza.
Let’s not overlook that when its made it can gain some beneficial compounds, too. For instance, Vitamin K2 can form during the fermentation process and this harder to find form of the nutrient can be important for cardiovascular health. Just don’t expect much in the way of vitamin K from Velveeta.
Different cheeses are made with different types of bacteria, which, in large part, are responsible for the unique flavors. These same micro-critters may have beneficial effects on our microbiome, which, in turn, could lead to improved health outcomes including some relief from digestive concerns like irritable bowel disease. With this said the impact of eating cheese on the microbiome is yet to be properly studied. It’s not known if you get anywhere near the concentration of beneficial microorganisms from a slice of Gouda or blue cheese as you would from a cup of yogurt.
Despite being a concentrated source of calories, some studies suggest you don’t need to skip cheese to keep your six-pack well stocked. In one research paper, published in
The
New England Journal of Medicine,
researchers set out to determine which foods were linked to weight gain
by following 120,877 men and women in the U.S. for two decades, examining their weight every four years. While they found that consuming more of certain foods such as refined grains (hello, white bread) and sugary drinks was associated with weight gain, eating more of others, like nuts and fruits, helped with weight loss.
Cheese wasn’t associated with either gain or loss, even for people who increased the amount of it they ate during the study. One reason cheese may help with weight control is that its protein and fat content may help moderate appetite. Still, there is a dearth of quality research examining the impact that it has on body composition and whether its source matters. It’s likely only problematic if it contributes to an excess of calories and is part of ultra-processed food at which point you should be questioning how wise it was to order a second helping.
And here is some awesome news for cheese lovers! It can help you get more buff.
In a recent
Journal of Nutrition
study
, 20 healthy males took in 30 grams of protein provided as cheese or milk protein concentrate following a bout of weight training to determine if there would be any differences in the rate of post-training muscle protein synthesis. Despite there being higher peak concentrations of blood amino acids with the milk protein concentrate there was no difference in the rate of muscle-building between the cheese and milk protein powder.
This has been supported by other research showing that cheese protein can help with muscle-making efforts when combined with resistance training. A single ounce serving of cheese has about 6 to 8 grams of high-quality protein (most cheeses is higher in protein than saturated fat) that can certainly help you pack on more lean mass. However, you may not want to get 30 grams of protein solely from cheese after pumping iron. But it certainly can be a significant part of your post-training protein intake, maybe just not all.
As you might be all too aware of, lactose, a naturally present sugar in milk, can be difficult for some people to digest, leading to digestive woes like gas and bloating. However, the bacteria used to make cheese digests most of the lactose in the milk. Much of the remaining lactose is present in the whey, which is separated from the curds toward the end of the cheese-making process and drained off. This means many types of cheese have very little to no lactose and are safe to consume for sensitive tummies. In general, the higher in moisture a cheese is, the higher in lactose it is. That means harder cheese like provolone or cheddar will have less than cottage or ricotta cheese.

Which Cheeses To Avoid
Where cheese can fall off the rails is when it is part of a diet too rich in ultra-processed foods and contributes to an excess of calories, saturated fat, and sodium. Fast-food pizza, cheeseburgers, mac and cheese, and pizza pockets are not the way that we should be getting our daily nutrients. Sadly, this is exactly the way too many people are eating the stuff. So when its a fixture of a 500-calorie slice of pizza or triple-decker burger it’s no wonder it is often considered a dietary villain.
It’s also problematic when we consume more processed products than the real stuff. American cheese slices fall well short of actual cheddar, and Velveeta is not the way you should be dressing your broccoli. There is a good chance that these products don’t give you the same nutritional benefits of better quality cheese.
As for those cheese flavored products on supermarket shelves such as crackers and chips, these rarely contain any cheese and instead rely on mystery cheese flavoring. Again, not cheese.
For those watching their sodium intake, certain types can be pretty salty. Some versions like feta, halloumi, Parmesan, and cotija are especially salty. If your diet contains a lot of other salty foods, then adding a couple of servings of cheese can push you over the top. If you’re eating about an ounce or two a day and eat mostly lower salt whole foods, however, it’s not a big concern. But there are some individuals like those with hypertension that may need to scale back their intake of higher salt foods.

How To Choose The Right Cheese For Your Diet
Overall, there’s no need to steer clear of cheese—unless you are getting largely hails from ultra-processed foods at which point you need to revaluate how much you are eating and where you are getting it from. If all this (mostly) positive news has you ready to dig into a wheel of Brie with a spoon, here are some cheesy tidbits worth knowing.
Watch Your Portions
To keep saturated fat and calories in check, most guys should limit their daily portion of cheese to no more than 2 ounces, which is about 200 calories and 10-12 grams of saturated fat. Yes, that is some tough love. But most of us have no idea what this amount looks like, which can lead to portion distortion. A smart move is to weigh your portions for a few days so you can get a sense of how much you are serving yourself. Much of the research suggesting a neutral or beneficial effect to eating cheese involved subjects consuming roughly an average of 1.5 ounces a day. Not the mega-amount you’ll get from a slice of deep-dish.
There is No One Best Choice
The internet is rife with articles about the healthiest cheese you can buy. But, truth be told, any and all real cheese is fine in moderation and the nutrition content does not vary greatly among the varieties. There are a few exceptions, like cottage cheese which is much higher in protein than other varieties, but then again many of us don’t consider this to be the same as Camembert or Swiss are.
Be a Softy
Softer styles of cheeses such as fresh mozzarella, goat, and brie typically have fewer calories per ounce than harder types like cheddar and Parmesan. That’s because with more moisture comes less calorie density. So if you want to enjoy a daily cheese habit but also keep calorie intake more on the down low then you can gravitate toward those you can cut through with almost zero effort. After all, I’ve never met a salad that wasn’t made way better with a scattering of soft goat cheese.
Swap it Out
There’s a big difference between grating some Parmesan over a salad and feasting on a greasy pepperoni pizza. In some studies, the health benefits of cheese were found to be the greatest when it replaced other less beneficial foods like processed meats or refined grains. So you could swap out some of the bacon for a chunk of cheese and come out ahead. Not so by blanketing a bowl of white pasta with a bag of shredded three-cheese mix.
Add it to Healthier Foods
The best way to eat your cheese is to use it as a flavor enhancer for nutritious foods. Add a few chunks of feta to a veggie-rich salad, grate some aged cheddar over homemade chili, drape a slice of fresh mozzarella over a lean turkey burger, or blend ricotta into a smoothie for added protein and to make it taste extra decadent. Using cheese to make these foods more exciting to eat increases the chances you’ll eat higher amounts of healthy meals and snacks. That’s a win-win.
Don’t Sack the Fat
When it comes to choosing between low-fat and full-fat cheese, you need not settle for the former. Undeniably, full-fat cheese will be more satisfying, both from a taste and texture perspective, and most of the research suggesting cheese ain’t so bad for us has involved subjects eating regular cheese. Sometimes fillers are added to accommodate the lack of fat in lower fat cheese at which point you start venturing further away from what cheese should be. There is also
evidence that people tend to eat larger portions
when choosing lower-fat (light) cheese, which could cancel out any calorie advantage.
As long as you aren’t going overboard on saturated fat intake elsewhere in your diet you will have room for the saturated fat you’ll get from a generous grating for Pecorino Romano. With this said, there is nothing wrong with opting for part-skim ricotta or mozzarella if you want to scale back your calorie and saturated fat intake. These also have a beneficial nutrition profile including protein and micronutrients like calcium.
Imitation Is Not Flattery
Short-cut cheese is not the way to go. On the whole, you want to focus on eating higher quality cheeses made the way it should be. You can read ingredient labels of packageg and look for products that contain questionable items like emulsifiers, cellulose, coloring, and modified corn starch, and then choose to give these a pass. Seeing “cheese product” on the food label should make you cut the cheese. Note that some American cheeses — the super melty, yellow-sliced processed variety you loved on toasted bread as a kit — is made from mostly water, so it has fewer nutrients than other cheeses. Processed cheese food slices are only required to have a minimum of 51% cheese. Why settle for less?

Making sure that you
don’t overdo your caloric intake is simple math,
but sticking to the plan is a real challenge. Feelings of hunger are not easy to ignore, but what is the difference between genuine hunger and cravings? Nutritionist Alan Aragon has the answer and shares three ways to win your long-term weight management goals.
If you’ve tracked your caloric intake all day and know that you are on a deficit or hitting your maintenance number, then a pang in your stomach for a slice of pizza at 9.30 p.m. is the last thing you need, but what about your muscle gains? If your body is telling you to consume food then ignoring that feeling will lead to muscle loss, right?
Wrong, says Aragon, who has a Master’s degree in Human Nutrition and is one of the most trusted evidence based fitness experts on the internet.
Aragon took to Instagram recently
to differentiate hunger versus cravings and explains that cravings are rarely about feeding the muscle but much more often about appeasing the mind.

A post shared by Nutritional Coaching Institute (@nutritionalcoachinginstitute)
The Difference Between Food Hunger and Cravings
“Food hunger and cravings are not the same thing,” he shares. “Hunger can influence the intensity of food craving, but food craving is very food specific. So, hunger can be satisfied by eating pretty much any food just filling the stomach. Craving, on the other hand, can typically only be satisfied with certain food or a certain type of food. Whether it’s a sweet type of dessert food or some sort of savory, greasy, crunchy snack.” The take home message here is that hunger can be satisfied with any food including healthy ingredients, while cravings typically involve trying to tempt you to the dark side and eat those stodgy, salty, and energy dense foods.
“So, contrary to popular belief, cravings rarely happen because of some sort of nutritional deficiency,” says Aragon, and this means that giving in to cravings will rarely help your fitness or weight loss goals. But if cravings threaten to derail our health, why do we get them?
“Food cravings are the result of conditioned responses to environment what reinforce the positive emotions and positive psychological state that you associate with a given food,” explains Aragon. “Like watching your favorite television show and what you happen to be mindlessly eating.” Aragon says that cravings likely won’t stop due to self-deprivation however, and that totally abstaining from the snacks that make you feel good could have a rebound effect later down the line. “So that kind of goes against the narrative that we should avoid foods,” he suggests. “Because that will only increase (your) cravings.”
Aragon says that the reason people often regain weight after a period of being lighter is due to losing their ongoing battle with cravings. Okay, so if food cravings are a fact of life, how can we build a better relationship with them?
How To Manage Your Food Cravings
“Instead of thinking how to completely overcome of stamp out cravings, I would rather think of it in terms of how to best manage the reality of food cravings,” concludes Nutritionist Alan Aragon. Here are three sensible steps to manage your cravings for a healthier diet.
Design a diet that satisfies your appetite
“First of all, design your diet so that it is a high satiety diet,” advises Aragon. Aim for meals containing high protein and fiber content as these will make you feel fuller for longer. Aragon says you should be aiming for whole-foods or minimally refined meals as these will have a greater tendency to satisfy your appetite.
Make swaps for success
Aragon encourages you to take a hard look at the foods that you typically crave, and see what you can swap them out with, for example dates are sweet and make for a great substitution for sugary treats. Or perhaps you could stick with the same foods that you crave but search the aisle for lower calorie options instead.
Reduce the snacks, reduce the rebound
As Aragon explains, eliminating your favorite snacks in the short-term could cause you to rebel and rack up the weight in the longer-term. Fortunately, you don’t have to completely avoid the foods that you crave. “It’s not a big deal, just don’t over do it,” says Aragon. “Just don’t have it with a high frequency throughout the week or through the month.”

Making sure that you
don’t overdo your caloric intake is simple math,
but sticking to the plan is a real challenge. Feelings of hunger are not easy to ignore, but what is the difference between genuine hunger and cravings? Nutritionist Alan Aragon has the answer and shares three ways to win your long-term weight management goals.
If you’ve tracked your caloric intake all day and know that you are on a deficit or hitting your maintenance number, then a pang in your stomach for a slice of pizza at 9.30 p.m. is the last thing you need, but what about your muscle gains? If your body is telling you to consume food then ignoring that feeling will lead to muscle loss, right?
Wrong, says Aragon, who has a Master’s degree in Human Nutrition and is one of the most trusted evidence based fitness experts on the internet.
Aragon took to Instagram recently
to differentiate hunger versus cravings and explains that cravings are rarely about feeding the muscle but much more often about appeasing the mind.

A post shared by Nutritional Coaching Institute (@nutritionalcoachinginstitute)
The Difference Between Food Hunger and Cravings
“Food hunger and cravings are not the same thing,” he shares. “Hunger can influence the intensity of food craving, but food craving is very food specific. So, hunger can be satisfied by eating pretty much any food just filling the stomach. Craving, on the other hand, can typically only be satisfied with certain food or a certain type of food. Whether it’s a sweet type of dessert food or some sort of savory, greasy, crunchy snack.” The take home message here is that hunger can be satisfied with any food including healthy ingredients, while cravings typically involve trying to tempt you to the dark side and eat those stodgy, salty, and energy dense foods.
“So, contrary to popular belief, cravings rarely happen because of some sort of nutritional deficiency,” says Aragon, and this means that giving in to cravings will rarely help your fitness or weight loss goals. But if cravings threaten to derail our health, why do we get them?
“Food cravings are the result of conditioned responses to environment what reinforce the positive emotions and positive psychological state that you associate with a given food,” explains Aragon. “Like watching your favorite television show and what you happen to be mindlessly eating.” Aragon says that cravings likely won’t stop due to self-deprivation however, and that totally abstaining from the snacks that make you feel good could have a rebound effect later down the line. “So that kind of goes against the narrative that we should avoid foods,” he suggests. “Because that will only increase (your) cravings.”
Aragon says that the reason people often regain weight after a period of being lighter is due to losing their ongoing battle with cravings. Okay, so if food cravings are a fact of life, how can we build a better relationship with them?
How To Manage Your Food Cravings
“Instead of thinking how to completely overcome of stamp out cravings, I would rather think of it in terms of how to best manage the reality of food cravings,” concludes Nutritionist Alan Aragon. Here are three sensible steps to manage your cravings for a healthier diet.
Design a diet that satisfies your appetite
“First of all, design your diet so that it is a high satiety diet,” advises Aragon. Aim for meals containing high protein and fiber content as these will make you feel fuller for longer. Aragon says you should be aiming for whole-foods or minimally refined meals as these will have a greater tendency to satisfy your appetite.
Make swaps for success
Aragon encourages you to take a hard look at the foods that you typically crave, and see what you can swap them out with, for example dates are sweet and make for a great substitution for sugary treats. Or perhaps you could stick with the same foods that you crave but search the aisle for lower calorie options instead.
Reduce the snacks, reduce the rebound
As Aragon explains, eliminating your favorite snacks in the short-term could cause you to rebel and rack up the weight in the longer-term. Fortunately, you don’t have to completely avoid the foods that you crave. “It’s not a big deal, just don’t over do it,” says Aragon. “Just don’t have it with a high frequency throughout the week or through the month.”

Intermittent fasting has been the subject of numerous studies in recent years prompting scientists to try and determine a safe fasting protocol that can work as an effective strategy for weight loss. The latest evidence, based on a large sample, may have the answer to one of the most asked questions about fasting: What is the best fasting window for intermittent fasting.
Led by the University of Granada in Spain and published by
Nature.com
, experts were keen to address the global issue of obesity. In the United States, almost
one in three adults are overweight
but the problem is not limited to North America. With many European counties displaying similar trends, health services around the world are stretched as ailments such as heart disease and type 2 diabetes become ever more prevalent. Since traditional diets generate such low scores of sustained success, doctors have long looked to intermittent fasting, otherwise known as time restricted eating, as a means of minimalizing meals.
The Optimum Eating Window for Intermittent Fasting
By working with 197 participants, one of the largest samples to date, scientists found that eating for 8 hours and fasting for 16 hours worked best, especially when paired with an early eating window of 9am to 5pm rather than a later period between noon to 8 p.m.. During the 12-week study, all of the participants who fasted for 16 hours lost an average of 3-4kg when compared to the group who had a 12-hour eating window, but
the early fasting group was deemed best
as they reduced subcutaneous fat to a greater extent. “The results show that the early fasting group significantly improved fasting glucose levels and overnight glucose compared to the other groups,”
concluded the report
.
Improving glucose regulation is important because this will in turn help to prevent diabetes and benefit out metabolic health. Dr Labayen, who is the principal investigator of
the study explains
that not eating during the evenings will allow the body greater time to digest and process nutrients, leading to this better regulation of blood glucose while reducing the risk of developing sugar related problems or other disorders.
In terms of safety, the scientists also noted that no serious adverse events were recorded during the trials. “Intermittent fasting is therefore presented as a safe and promising strategy for managing body weight and improving cardiovascular health in people who are overweight or obese,”
concluded a write-up of the report by the University of Granada.

Science Has Discovered The Best Time Window for Intermittent Fasting

Intermittent fasting has been the subject of numerous studies in recent years prompting scientists to try and determine a safe fasting protocol that can work as an effective strategy for weight loss. The latest evidence, based on a large sample, may have the answer to one of the most asked questions about fasting: What is the best fasting window for intermittent fasting.
Led by the University of Granada in Spain and published by
Nature.com
, experts were keen to address the global issue of obesity. In the United States, almost
one in three adults are overweight
but the problem is not limited to North America. With many European counties displaying similar trends, health services around the world are stretched as ailments such as heart disease and type 2 diabetes become ever more prevalent. Since traditional diets generate such low scores of sustained success, doctors have long looked to intermittent fasting, otherwise known as time restricted eating, as a means of minimalizing meals.
The Optimum Eating Window for Intermittent Fasting
By working with 197 participants, one of the largest samples to date, scientists found that eating for 8 hours and fasting for 16 hours worked best, especially when paired with an early eating window of 9am to 5pm rather than a later period between noon to 8 p.m.. During the 12-week study, all of the participants who fasted for 16 hours lost an average of 3-4kg when compared to the group who had a 12-hour eating window, but
the early fasting group was deemed best
as they reduced subcutaneous fat to a greater extent. “The results show that the early fasting group significantly improved fasting glucose levels and overnight glucose compared to the other groups,”
concluded the report
.
Improving glucose regulation is important because this will in turn help to prevent diabetes and benefit out metabolic health. Dr Labayen, who is the principal investigator of
the study explains
that not eating during the evenings will allow the body greater time to digest and process nutrients, leading to this better regulation of blood glucose while reducing the risk of developing sugar related problems or other disorders.
In terms of safety, the scientists also noted that no serious adverse events were recorded during the trials. “Intermittent fasting is therefore presented as a safe and promising strategy for managing body weight and improving cardiovascular health in people who are overweight or obese,”
concluded a write-up of the report by the University of Granada.

An underrated berry has become the subject of high interest to scientists as a new study showed its potential game-changing weight loss benefits after just one week. Here’s what you need to know.
A clinal trial recently published in the Journal of Nutrients discovered
that the humble elderberry appears to offer benefits for gut and metabolic health, while delivering more efficient sugar processing and fat burning qualities. The good news is these elderberries, a small, dark purple berry, are grown all over the world and its juice is widely available. Elderberry’s prowess is owed to its high concentrations of plant compounds that are known as anthocyanins believe the experts.
“Elderberry is an underappreciated berry, commercially and nutritionally,”
says the study’s corresponding author, Patrick Solverson
, who is an assistant professor at the Washington State University Elson S. Floyd College of Medicine. “We’re now starting to recognize its value for human health, and the results are very exciting.”
How was the study carried out?
Eighteen overweight adults aged between 22 and 75 yrs were given either a daily 12-ounce (355ml) elderberry juice, or a similar looking placebo drink and later tested on a range of health indicators such as blood glucose and plasma and insulin levels, gut microbiota and weight changes.
What were the results?
After just one week, those who drank the elderberry juice benefitted from positive microbiota changes in addition to an average of 24% lower blood glucose levels and a 9% decrease in insulin levels. The elderberry drinkers also received significantly increased fat oxidation, breaking down fatty acids more readily.
“Food is medicine, and science is catching up to that popular wisdom,” comments Solverson. “This study contributes to a growing body of evidence that elderberry, which has been used as a folk remedy for centuries, has numerous benefits for metabolic as well as prebiotic health.”
While other more popular berries contain anthocyanins, the levels are often in less abundance. In fact, a
person would need to consume more than three times the amount of blackberries
to get the same anthocyanin content as elderberries.
With more than 70% of adults in the United States now overweight and
42% suffering with obesity,
natural remedies are in high demand, so experts are now hoping to take their elderberry enlightenment to the next level and widen their studies with a view to providing an alternative to prescription weight loss medicines.

Study Shows the Benefits of Elderberry for Weight Loss
Scientists say this underrated berry improves gut health and oxidizes fat.

An underrated berry has become the subject of high interest to scientists as a new study showed its potential game-changing weight loss benefits after just one week. Here’s what you need to know.
A clinal trial recently published in the Journal of Nutrients discovered
that the humble elderberry appears to offer benefits for gut and metabolic health, while delivering more efficient sugar processing and fat burning qualities. The good news is these elderberries, a small, dark purple berry, are grown all over the world and its juice is widely available. Elderberry’s prowess is owed to its high concentrations of plant compounds that are known as anthocyanins believe the experts.
“Elderberry is an underappreciated berry, commercially and nutritionally,”
says the study’s corresponding author, Patrick Solverson
, who is an assistant professor at the Washington State University Elson S. Floyd College of Medicine. “We’re now starting to recognize its value for human health, and the results are very exciting.”
How was the study carried out?
Eighteen overweight adults aged between 22 and 75 yrs were given either a daily 12-ounce (355ml) elderberry juice, or a similar looking placebo drink and later tested on a range of health indicators such as blood glucose and plasma and insulin levels, gut microbiota and weight changes.
What were the results?
After just one week, those who drank the elderberry juice benefitted from positive microbiota changes in addition to an average of 24% lower blood glucose levels and a 9% decrease in insulin levels. The elderberry drinkers also received significantly increased fat oxidation, breaking down fatty acids more readily.
“Food is medicine, and science is catching up to that popular wisdom,” comments Solverson. “This study contributes to a growing body of evidence that elderberry, which has been used as a folk remedy for centuries, has numerous benefits for metabolic as well as prebiotic health.”
While other more popular berries contain anthocyanins, the levels are often in less abundance. In fact, a
person would need to consume more than three times the amount of blackberries
to get the same anthocyanin content as elderberries.
With more than 70% of adults in the United States now overweight and
42% suffering with obesity,
natural remedies are in high demand, so experts are now hoping to take their elderberry enlightenment to the next level and widen their studies with a view to providing an alternative to prescription weight loss medicines.

‘Stone Cold’ Steve Austin Gives Post Knee-Surgery Update

“Stone Cold” Steve Austin is in the history books as one of pro wrestling’s most popular performers, but this type of epic success has
required great physical sacrifice
. Last week, however, Austin provided a positive update following his latest stint under the knife.
“I am 7 weeks post op on a total knee replacement,” revealed the WWE Hall of Famer on Jan 21, 2025, via Instagram. “My left knee was on its last leg, and I have been putting surgery off for years.” This means Austin would likely have been working through immense pain during his last match to date with WWE. (That bout took place in 2022 at WrestleMania in Dallas.) Fortunately, “The Rattlesnake” went on to explain that his post op X-rays have showed “everything is healing nicely.”
‘Stone Cold’ Steve Austin Always Comes Back Stronger
Austin is no stranger to going under the knife. His most significant injury occurred in the ring back at SummerSlam 1997, when the late Owen Hart dropped him on his head and caused spinal damage while executing an inverted piledriver. While the former six-time WWE champ wrestled for years following reconstructive neck surgery, he had to reduce his move set in order to prolong his career. Incredibly, “
Stone Cold” was 57 when he made a return and beat Kevin Owens at WrestleMania 38
. Following the widespread critical acclaim for that match, Austin said he couldn’t rule out putting on his boots one more time. Still, wrestling has taken a back seat to off-road racing in recent years, and “Stone Cold” (now 60) has joined forces with the GFI Nevada Racing team, riding Kawasaki.

A post shared by Steve Austin (@steveaustinbsr)
Will ‘Stone Cold’ Steve Austin Ever Return to a WWE Ring?
These days, Austin in busy with his highly successful “Broken Skull” beer brand but revealed that he is “back in the gym and training” after trying to rush his recovery and suffering an initial set back. “I came out of the gate aggressively and started walking way too soon.” Austin explained, adding that recovery will likely take him a year. This means the chances of him dishing out one of his trademark stunners at this year’s WrestleMania seems pretty unlikely. Still, they do say that anything can happen in WWE.
One thing is for sure, the pro wrestling legend has been looking ripped as of late and fully intends to get back to racing. “I have my sights set to race in The Mint 400 outside of Las Vegas,” he said. “I am thankful to have found the challenge of desert off road racing. I love the competition and the hard conditions that come with it. So, here goes…” God speed, Stone Cold!

“Stone Cold” Steve Austin is in the history books as one of pro wrestling’s most popular performers, but this type of epic success has
required great physical sacrifice
. Last week, however, Austin provided a positive update following his latest stint under the knife.
“I am 7 weeks post op on a total knee replacement,” revealed the WWE Hall of Famer on Jan 21, 2025, via Instagram. “My left knee was on its last leg, and I have been putting surgery off for years.” This means Austin would likely have been working through immense pain during his last match to date with WWE. (That bout took place in 2022 at WrestleMania in Dallas.) Fortunately, “The Rattlesnake” went on to explain that his post op X-rays have showed “everything is healing nicely.”
‘Stone Cold’ Steve Austin Always Comes Back Stronger
Austin is no stranger to going under the knife. His most significant injury occurred in the ring back at SummerSlam 1997, when the late Owen Hart dropped him on his head and caused spinal damage while executing an inverted piledriver. While the former six-time WWE champ wrestled for years following reconstructive neck surgery, he had to reduce his move set in order to prolong his career. Incredibly, “
Stone Cold” was 57 when he made a return and beat Kevin Owens at WrestleMania 38
. Following the widespread critical acclaim for that match, Austin said he couldn’t rule out putting on his boots one more time. Still, wrestling has taken a back seat to off-road racing in recent years, and “Stone Cold” (now 60) has joined forces with the GFI Nevada Racing team, riding Kawasaki.

Will ‘Stone Cold’ Steve Austin Ever Return to a WWE Ring?
These days, Austin in busy with his highly successful “Broken Skull” beer brand but revealed that he is “back in the gym and training” after trying to rush his recovery and suffering an initial set back. “I came out of the gate aggressively and started walking way too soon.” Austin explained, adding that recovery will likely take him a year. This means the chances of him dishing out one of his trademark stunners at this year’s WrestleMania seems pretty unlikely. Still, they do say that anything can happen in WWE.
One thing is for sure, the pro wrestling legend has been looking ripped as of late and fully intends to get back to racing. “I have my sights set to race in The Mint 400 outside of Las Vegas,” he said. “I am thankful to have found the challenge of desert off road racing. I love the competition and the hard conditions that come with it. So, here goes…” God speed, Stone Cold!

Cat Deeley Balances Reality TV Chaos as a Working Mom
Here's how this star juggles projects like "The Joe Schmo Show" and "This Morning."

Cat Deeley is always a picture of composure as she meets the challenges of presenting unpredictable televisions shows for our viewing pleasure. As her latest gig,
The Joe Schmo Show
illustrates, just one slip-up on set could cause the cast and crew to revolt. So how does this star find her calm before the storm of each day? It’s all about
early morning yoga sessions
, Deeley tells M&F.
It’s hard to believe that Cat Deeley has been on television for more than 25 years, first appearing on the children’s show
SMTV Live
in 1998 and later moving into primetime television. While Deeley is fondly known to fellow Brits for her early on-screen partnership with Ant and Dec, U.S. fans on the other side of the pond will recall her hosting
So You Think You Can Dance
and presenting Fox’s New Year’s Eve Special from Times Square.
While this presenter’s resume includes being a children’s author, an actor, and a patron of London’s Great Ormand Street Hospital, she is also a loving mother to two sons and has now entered what is perhaps the busiest era of her career to date. In the UK, Deeley has taken up the duties as co-presenter on T
his Morning,
and is now promoting her recently wrapped project
The Joe Schmo Show
in the U.S.
My first question is simple: How on earth does she fit it all in? “With Grandma and Grandad, and an amazing nanny,” explains the star while making a juggling gesture with her arms!
Cat Deeley
Cat Deeley Stays Composed in the Chaotic World of Television
For
The Joe Schmo Show,
Deeley’s brief is to present what seems like a standard reality-show based competition, until you learn that everyone is an actor except for the one contestant who has been given the role of Joe. In this case, Ben Frisone, an electrician from Baltimore, puts himself through all manner of insane challenges to win $100,000. What he doesn’t realize is that he’s the only one who thinks the show is real. All of the other contestants are in on the joke, and they are only there to increase the tension and hilarity in equal measure.
I ask Deeley how she stays composed while explaining the various tasks to Frisone, such as the requirement for him to wade through excrement in order to be the first to find a golden nugget. “I actually don’t know,” she confides with all honesty. Of course, her skillset is honed and her chops as an experienced television personality were in full force here, as she helped to raise the comedy stakes. But the host almost turned down the job through fear of being involved with anything that might turn out to be cruel to the contestant.
“I said I don’t know, if the idea is that I’m going to have to be really mean,” she says of some early conversations. “This guy, he’s the only one who doesn’t know that this show has been [scripted] and I’m like, I’m not your girl.” But because Deeley had collaborated with the show’s producer going back to her days working for MTV, there was a level of trust that finally persuaded her to sign-on. The star says the beauty of
The Joe Schmo Show
in 2025 is that it is able to find a balance between being “an improv and funny,” while “not pushing Ben too far the other way.”
Still, had Deeley made just one verbal mistake or laughed in the wrong place and given up the game, the crew would have needed to scramble to salvage the whole season. It’s the type of pressure that Deeley also faces each day on
This Morning,
the live magazine style show where anything can and often does go wrong. Deeley says she is no “gym bunny,” but has found her own path to serenity outside of the unpredictable world of TV with yoga.

Cat Deeley Says Yoga Helps Her Meet Her Daily Demands
“I’m not really very flexible,” says the star. “So, actually, the yoga really works for me … It makes me breathe and calms down my mind at the same time. I can do it wherever I want to do it.” Deeley says that while she started out her yoga path with various in-person teachers, she is now able to hop online and be guided through a pre-recorded session. “I do it that way instead, so I can fit in whenever I need to do,” she says. “Around two small boys and working.” The presenter tells M&F that she aims for 30-minute daily sessions.
Her busy weekday routine begins when the alarm clock goes off at 5am and the star makes a drink containing celery, ginger, and lemon: a revitalizing shot of antioxidants that also aids with digestion. Deeley then finds some early morning peace with her 30 minutes of yoga before sipping a coffee and hitting the shower. By the time Deeley leaves the house at 6.20am precisely, she is raring to get to the
This Morning
studio in London.
Yoga is, of course, a great way for busy people to balance their health and fitness with mindfulness.
One major scientific review
has concluded that “almost all of the participants described that doing yoga has positive benefits on the mind and body.” Those benefits include working on Deeley’s flexibility while helping her to alleviate any aches and pains and even promoting better sleep quality. All these points are paramount for an in-demand television presenter.
Cat Deeley Schedules Intermittent Fasting Around Work
The star says that she didn’t take up intermittent fasting as a means of calorie restriction or losing weight, but her busy family life and career made her take a look at exactly when her own optimum eating times might be. These days, Deeley likes to sit down at the table with the fam (she is married to comedian Patrick Kielty) and finishes dinner by around 7pm. She next eats a meal at 11.30am the next day, while in the studio at
This Morning,
tasting the food of the celebrity guest chef of the day. “It just seems to work for me,” she explains. When the star does have some time off, Deeley loves the great outdoors and engaging in activities like surfing or horse riding. No doubt, her next vacation will be well-earned but for now, at least she is able to navigate each crazy day with a sensible approach to health and fitness.
The Joe Schmo Show
Season 4 airs on TBS and is now available to stream on the TBS app.

Cat Deeley Balances Reality TV Chaos as a Working Mom
Here's how this star juggles projects like "The Joe Schmo Show" and "This Morning."

Cat Deeley is always a picture of composure as she meets the challenges of presenting unpredictable televisions shows for our viewing pleasure. As her latest gig,
The Joe Schmo Show
illustrates, just one slip-up on set could cause the cast and crew to revolt. So how does this star find her calm before the storm of each day? It’s all about
early morning yoga sessions
, Deeley tells M&F.
It’s hard to believe that Cat Deeley has been on television for more than 25 years, first appearing on the children’s show
SMTV Live
in 1998 and later moving into primetime television. While Deeley is fondly known to fellow Brits for her early on-screen partnership with Ant and Dec, U.S. fans on the other side of the pond will recall her hosting
So You Think You Can Dance
and presenting Fox’s New Year’s Eve Special from Times Square.
While this presenter’s resume includes being a children’s author, an actor, and a patron of London’s Great Ormand Street Hospital, she is also a loving mother to two sons and has now entered what is perhaps the busiest era of her career to date. In the UK, Deeley has taken up the duties as co-presenter on T
his Morning,
and is now promoting her recently wrapped project
The Joe Schmo Show
in the U.S.
My first question is simple: How on earth does she fit it all in? “With Grandma and Grandad, and an amazing nanny,” explains the star while making a juggling gesture with her arms!
Cat Deeley
Cat Deeley Stays Composed in the Chaotic World of Television
For
The Joe Schmo Show,
Deeley’s brief is to present what seems like a standard reality-show based competition, until you learn that everyone is an actor except for the one contestant who has been given the role of Joe. In this case, Ben Frisone, an electrician from Baltimore, puts himself through all manner of insane challenges to win $100,000. What he doesn’t realize is that he’s the only one who thinks the show is real. All of the other contestants are in on the joke, and they are only there to increase the tension and hilarity in equal measure.
I ask Deeley how she stays composed while explaining the various tasks to Frisone, such as the requirement for him to wade through excrement in order to be the first to find a golden nugget. “I actually don’t know,” she confides with all honesty. Of course, her skillset is honed and her chops as an experienced television personality were in full force here, as she helped to raise the comedy stakes. But the host almost turned down the job through fear of being involved with anything that might turn out to be cruel to the contestant.
“I said I don’t know, if the idea is that I’m going to have to be really mean,” she says of some early conversations. “This guy, he’s the only one who doesn’t know that this show has been [scripted] and I’m like, I’m not your girl.” But because Deeley had collaborated with the show’s producer going back to her days working for MTV, there was a level of trust that finally persuaded her to sign-on. The star says the beauty of
The Joe Schmo Show
in 2025 is that it is able to find a balance between being “an improv and funny,” while “not pushing Ben too far the other way.”
Still, had Deeley made just one verbal mistake or laughed in the wrong place and given up the game, the crew would have needed to scramble to salvage the whole season. It’s the type of pressure that Deeley also faces each day on
This Morning,
the live magazine style show where anything can and often does go wrong. Deeley says she is no “gym bunny,” but has found her own path to serenity outside of the unpredictable world of TV with yoga.

Cat Deeley Says Yoga Helps Her Meet Her Daily Demands
“I’m not really very flexible,” says the star. “So, actually, the yoga really works for me … It makes me breathe and calms down my mind at the same time. I can do it wherever I want to do it.” Deeley says that while she started out her yoga path with various in-person teachers, she is now able to hop online and be guided through a pre-recorded session. “I do it that way instead, so I can fit in whenever I need to do,” she says. “Around two small boys and working.” The presenter tells M&F that she aims for 30-minute daily sessions.
Her busy weekday routine begins when the alarm clock goes off at 5am and the star makes a drink containing celery, ginger, and lemon: a revitalizing shot of antioxidants that also aids with digestion. Deeley then finds some early morning peace with her 30 minutes of yoga before sipping a coffee and hitting the shower. By the time Deeley leaves the house at 6.20am precisely, she is raring to get to the
This Morning
studio in London.
Yoga is, of course, a great way for busy people to balance their health and fitness with mindfulness.
One major scientific review
has concluded that “almost all of the participants described that doing yoga has positive benefits on the mind and body.” Those benefits include working on Deeley’s flexibility while helping her to alleviate any aches and pains and even promoting better sleep quality. All these points are paramount for an in-demand television presenter.
Cat Deeley Schedules Intermittent Fasting Around Work
The star says that she didn’t take up intermittent fasting as a means of calorie restriction or losing weight, but her busy family life and career made her take a look at exactly when her own optimum eating times might be. These days, Deeley likes to sit down at the table with the fam (she is married to comedian Patrick Kielty) and finishes dinner by around 7pm. She next eats a meal at 11.30am the next day, while in the studio at
This Morning,
tasting the food of the celebrity guest chef of the day. “It just seems to work for me,” she explains. When the star does have some time off, Deeley loves the great outdoors and engaging in activities like surfing or horse riding. No doubt, her next vacation will be well-earned but for now, at least she is able to navigate each crazy day with a sensible approach to health and fitness.
The Joe Schmo Show
Season 4 airs on TBS and is now available to stream on the TBS app.

LTC Sean Donohue’s Commitment To H2F Will Help Many Be Fit To Serve
Donohue’s career impacts the present and future of America’s military.

United States Army Lieutenant Colonel Sean Donohue was familiar with military service long before his own career began in 2002. Both of his grandfathers served their country, and Donohue grew up in Tacoma, WA near Joint Base Lewis-McChord. It may come as a surprise that one of his parents were not on board with the prospect of him putting on the nation’s cloth.
“I always thought the military was an intriguing opportunity,” Donohue said. “But it was nothing my mother ever wanted me associated with, nor did she ever articulate why she felt that way.”
What Donohue did take part in was sports. He played baseball and football at different points of his childhood, but he acknowledged that fitness was not his best quality growing up.
Donohue recalled, “I was an active kid, but weight was always problem for me.” He did find success in the pool and even swam competitively in college. However, he opted to focus more on music and got his degree in Music Business.
“I thought I was going to be working with rock bands,” he shared.
LTC Sean Donohue
He Answered His Country’s Call
Like many current members of the
Armed Forces
, Donohue opted to consider service after the terrorist attacks on the United States on September 11, 2001. By 2002, Donohue officially shifted his focus from music to the Army. In spite of his athletic background, he was concerned about how he would hold up in basic training. Things turned out okay for him, though.
“It worked well enough and I remember being the oldest guy in my basic training company at 23 and one of only two of us who passed the old APFT on the first test.”
In the 23 years since, he worked in several capacities while traveling the world, including as a combat medic, legislative liaison, TRADOC-IMT Surgeon, and is currently a PA while living in Virginia. He is thankful for the leaders that have challenged and supported him throughout his two decades in service.
“I’ve been very fortunate to be surrounded by great leaders throughout my career and I’m grateful that some of them have encouraged me to do things that I wasn’t entirely convinced of at the time.”
He may be the one performing on a day-to-day basis, but the husband and father of three emphasizes that he did not make this commitment alone.
“I’m most proud of my family though, Lexey and I joined the Army- meaning we made the choice together to become an Army family.”
They have found fitness to be another common bond that holds them together and a great way to stay connected while continuing to be at their best for themselves and each other. Donohue got into cycling during the lockdowns, and his family joined him in pursuing the new passion.
Donohue explained, “For our family, it was a great way to connect and share nature and the outdoors together.”
LTC Sean Donohue
He took it a step further and went on to coach the largest team in Virginia, and he proudly shared that his youngest son continued cycling and raced nationally for a few years. His son eventually shifted his focus back to academics, but he himself went on to start taking part in cyclocross, a hybrid of road and mountain biking.
“Lots of mud, sand, hills and running. Legend says it started as a way for French soldiers to train in winter. It’s a blast and I love the community.”
That is only one aspect of his personal commitment to being his best self. He has also been dedicated to the weights and running, which made his travels across the globe a little more enjoyable.
“My travels would never have been so rich if it wasn’t for making time to squeeze in a run.”
Donohue is currently involved with the
Army’s Holistic Health and Fitness (H2F)
readiness system, which is designed to help soldiers improve in five different pillars (physical, mental, spiritual, nutrition, sleep). As a Clinical Integration lead, Donohue is helping lay the groundwork of this program and sees its potential for success now and later as they develop over 100 teams across the Army over the next few years.
“Not only will H2F serve soldiers now, but it will help make life easier for them after they become veterans.”
Donohue will be sharing his passion and knowledge with many attendees at an upcoming United States Air Force Honor Guard Symposium in Washington, D.C. on Feb. 13, 2025. Donohue will be bringing his knowledge and experience with H2F with him as he joins other well-respected members of the military community such as LTC Charjo Grant, USAF SSgt Chase Griffin, and others. Donohue is excited to be in a position to help many others learn how to be their best so they can continue giving their best to the nation. He sees the opportunity for what it is, a way to reach Americans that they normally may not.
“We’re really fortunate to have a national platform. Militarily speaking, we may only be one percent of the nation, yet we can have an outweighing effect on the greater environment. This is a great opportunity to have more of a national discourse.”
Donohue’s impact has been and will continue to be felt for the rest of his career and even after by many that he may never meet in person. He looks back at his career fondly and sees his future as bright with many more opportunities to come. He also hopes that the next generation of Americans that enter service will be aware of their own potential and invest into that with the same energy and commitment that he had into his own career.
“Take a chance on being truly great yourself.”

LTC Sean Donohue’s Commitment To H2F Will Help Many Be Fit To Serve
Donohue’s career impacts the present and future of America’s military.

United States Army Lieutenant Colonel Sean Donohue was familiar with military service long before his own career began in 2002. Both of his grandfathers served their country, and Donohue grew up in Tacoma, WA near Joint Base Lewis-McChord. It may come as a surprise that one of his parents were not on board with the prospect of him putting on the nation’s cloth.
“I always thought the military was an intriguing opportunity,” Donohue said. “But it was nothing my mother ever wanted me associated with, nor did she ever articulate why she felt that way.”
What Donohue did take part in was sports. He played baseball and football at different points of his childhood, but he acknowledged that fitness was not his best quality growing up.
Donohue recalled, “I was an active kid, but weight was always problem for me.” He did find success in the pool and even swam competitively in college. However, he opted to focus more on music and got his degree in Music Business.
“I thought I was going to be working with rock bands,” he shared.
LTC Sean Donohue
He Answered His Country’s Call
Like many current members of the
Armed Forces
, Donohue opted to consider service after the terrorist attacks on the United States on September 11, 2001. By 2002, Donohue officially shifted his focus from music to the Army. In spite of his athletic background, he was concerned about how he would hold up in basic training. Things turned out okay for him, though.
“It worked well enough and I remember being the oldest guy in my basic training company at 23 and one of only two of us who passed the old APFT on the first test.”
In the 23 years since, he worked in several capacities while traveling the world, including as a combat medic, legislative liaison, TRADOC-IMT Surgeon, and is currently a PA while living in Virginia. He is thankful for the leaders that have challenged and supported him throughout his two decades in service.
“I’ve been very fortunate to be surrounded by great leaders throughout my career and I’m grateful that some of them have encouraged me to do things that I wasn’t entirely convinced of at the time.”
He may be the one performing on a day-to-day basis, but the husband and father of three emphasizes that he did not make this commitment alone.
“I’m most proud of my family though, Lexey and I joined the Army- meaning we made the choice together to become an Army family.”
They have found fitness to be another common bond that holds them together and a great way to stay connected while continuing to be at their best for themselves and each other. Donohue got into cycling during the lockdowns, and his family joined him in pursuing the new passion.
Donohue explained, “For our family, it was a great way to connect and share nature and the outdoors together.”
LTC Sean Donohue
He took it a step further and went on to coach the largest team in Virginia, and he proudly shared that his youngest son continued cycling and raced nationally for a few years. His son eventually shifted his focus back to academics, but he himself went on to start taking part in cyclocross, a hybrid of road and mountain biking.
“Lots of mud, sand, hills and running. Legend says it started as a way for French soldiers to train in winter. It’s a blast and I love the community.”
That is only one aspect of his personal commitment to being his best self. He has also been dedicated to the weights and running, which made his travels across the globe a little more enjoyable.
“My travels would never have been so rich if it wasn’t for making time to squeeze in a run.”
Donohue is currently involved with the
Army’s Holistic Health and Fitness (H2F)
readiness system, which is designed to help soldiers improve in five different pillars (physical, mental, spiritual, nutrition, sleep). As a Clinical Integration lead, Donohue is helping lay the groundwork of this program and sees its potential for success now and later as they develop over 100 teams across the Army over the next few years.
“Not only will H2F serve soldiers now, but it will help make life easier for them after they become veterans.”
Donohue will be sharing his passion and knowledge with many attendees at an upcoming United States Air Force Honor Guard Symposium in Washington, D.C. on Feb. 13, 2025. Donohue will be bringing his knowledge and experience with H2F with him as he joins other well-respected members of the military community such as LTC Charjo Grant, USAF SSgt Chase Griffin, and others. Donohue is excited to be in a position to help many others learn how to be their best so they can continue giving their best to the nation. He sees the opportunity for what it is, a way to reach Americans that they normally may not.
“We’re really fortunate to have a national platform. Militarily speaking, we may only be one percent of the nation, yet we can have an outweighing effect on the greater environment. This is a great opportunity to have more of a national discourse.”
Donohue’s impact has been and will continue to be felt for the rest of his career and even after by many that he may never meet in person. He looks back at his career fondly and sees his future as bright with many more opportunities to come. He also hopes that the next generation of Americans that enter service will be aware of their own potential and invest into that with the same energy and commitment that he had into his own career.
“Take a chance on being truly great yourself.”

Manchester City Women’s Football Club, more affectionately known as “Manchester City Women” are working hard in the Women’s Super League this season after a period of resurgence that saw them come a very close second to Chelsea last year. Helping to spearhead that surge in soccer progress after the team suffered setbacks and injuries in previous years is Emma Deakin, the Director of Performance Services at MCWFC.
For Deakin, who comes to soccer with a wealth of experience gained by training Olympic gold winning athletes such as triathlon’s Brownlee brothers, building a winning team is about forging strong relationships. The Manchester City Women’s performance coach must also navigate personal player circumstances as she carefully considers factors such as training load, injury prevention, and recovery.
M&F
sat down to find out more from Deakin, who has been an important contributor to some of City’s most recent soccer PRs.
You have worked extensively with Olympic athletes in the past, were you able to travel to any of the Games?
I’ve been lucky enough to go to four Olympic Games and have special memories from each one. Beijing 2008 was my first Games and my first time in that major multi-sporting environment. As a massive sports fan there’s something really unique about everyone being in the same place at the same time with the same goal, and very surreal sat having dinner with Usain Bolt on one side of you and the Williams sisters on the other!
You originally joined Manchester Women’s Football Club in January 2023 as their new Injury Management lead. What are some of the most common injuries in soccer?
Muscle injuries are obviously common in any running-based sport and in women’s football, quad and hamstring injuries are more common. Our aim is to condition our players as well as possible to cope with the growing demands of the game and reduce the risk and severity of these types of injuries.
Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries
are commonly discussed in the media but aren’t isolated to women’s football. I’d say that most injuries we see are sports-specific, rather than gender specific. For example, ankle inversions or issues related to tackles and concussions. For me, especially coming from a physiotherapy background, it’s vital that we take a multi-discipline approach to all our injuries, with clear exit criteria and ‘return to play’ guidelines. At City we involve the football coaches in the recovery journey as early as possible – we want to
minimize risk and optimize player performance on return
.
Manchester City W.F.C
What are some of the best ways for a soccer player to rest and recover?
We spend a lot of time monitoring and reviewing wellness data and trends – both across the squad and in individual players. Recovery is specific to each player, and we develop bespoke plans which incorporate a range of modalities including cryotherapy, massage or nutrition. Properly incorporating rest and recovery based on wellness data is a key strategy for preventing injury and something we really focus on.
How would you describe your current role as the Director of Performance Services?
My role as Director of Performance Services for MCWFC is to align and drive all the performance service departments to deliver our performance strategy. Across our multi-disciplinary team, we deliver a range of services – from strength and conditioning, to nutrition, rehab and recovery. One area of the role that’s relatively new to me is player recruitment, which includes assessing the physical condition of incoming players and how they’ll adapt to our training style and load.
You mentioned training load. How is this designed?
Our overall philosophy is to keep training load high to support performance and protect against injuries. Generally, squad training load is designed around fixtures and the team schedule so a week with two games looks different to a one game week. But within that there’s a lot of bespoke programming, and individual load will change based on the position they play, what we want them to achieve during a game, their history, any risk factors, injuries or return to play modifications etc.
Do you encourage players to get in the gym on their own time?
Generally, we don’t encourage working out away from the Club because gym programming is built into each individual player’s schedule and based around results from profiling and individual athlete plans. We design programs so that the rest days are to be true days off, and our players are world-class professional athletes who understand their program of activity.
What types of exercise sessions would you recommend to a soccer player?
Every player is different, but football is a running-based sport with lots of high intensity actions and maximum acceleration and deceleration, so any gym program needs to support an athlete’s ability to perform these actions again and again. Ultimately there’s no escaping the basics of strength training and in particular lower limb strength-based training is key.
Our players come from a wide variety of countries and cultures and ultimately, they are individuals with their own training histories and experiences. If they have an interest in different training methods, whether that’s yoga, swimming or boxing, we’ll always try to look at how to incorporate that in a way that works with their player program and doesn’t detract from their ability to perform at training or in a game.
How much of a role does nutrition play in performance services and are players provided with plans or meals, or education around the subject?
Nutrition is huge for both performance and recovery. We have a full-time nutritionist that works on an individual, squad and educational basis. The nutritionist ensures players have access to the right food at the right time and that regularly means working closely with our chefs at Manchester City Football Academy, and hotels and catering when we’re on the road. They work with individual players to develop nutrition plans to support their goals, for example if they’re recovering from an injury or if they are looking to put on extra lean muscle.
The nutritionist delivers education to players based on the most up-to-date research and literature, so our players understand why they’re eating certain foods at certain times, so that they can make empowered decisions that help them be the best athlete.
What does the training schedule of a professional female soccer player at Manchester City look like?
A typical day starts with a wellness check-in during the morning. We’ll talk about how they’re feeling, how they slept and ultimately if they’re good to train. Then they have breakfast as a team on-site. After breakfast they go to analysis where the team runs through what the training objectives are for the day, and they might review a specific game or some individual player clips.
Then we move onto preparation for on-field training by working the gym with programs tailored to an individual player based on their data, any injuries and the performance required of them at training. After training on the pitch as a team, they’ll come back in and we’ll do a shorter additional one-on-one or smaller group-based training session, depending on what a player needs that day or anything specific they’re working on. The squad then all have lunch together before an afternoon gym session. Then it might be on to commercial or media obligations, or educational activity before finishing for the day.
I understand that there’s a great relationship between the staff in both the men’s and women’s teams!
There’s a great relationship and learning environment across Manchester City Football Academy and that’s important for the development of football generally, not just the women’s game. We recruit the best individuals in their fields and to have that level of knowledge and experience under one roof is incredible.
The MCWFC performance team has seen real benefits from recruiting staff from both inside and outside of football. Together, we’ve got broad experience and expertise, and it’s allowed us to merge and take best practice from across world sport.

A post shared by Manchester City Women (@mancitywomen)
The past couple of years have been a period of resurgence for the team. How much has fitness and conditioning played a role in these results?
The demands of the women’s game are changing all the time and our approach to fitness and conditioning reflects that. For us, it’s not just about ensuring our players can perform at their best right now but also that we prepare them for the future demands of the game too. We want them to have long, healthy, high-performance careers. So, strength and conditioning, rehab, recovery and nutrition all play a vital role.
In your time at Manchester City, how have the female athletes evolved in terms of their physical skills and acumen for fitness?
The demands of the game are changing—both in terms of the physical intensity and frequency of games. We’re not just focused on ensuring players have the right level of fitness now, but we want to keep pushing on and raising the level too. Over the last few years, our benchmarks have been getting higher and higher, and our athletes have risen to meet them.
What have been some of your personal highlights since joining Manchester City Women?
Off the pitch; the development of the performance team. As individuals and as a department we’ve really progressed and grown. We’ve created a safe environment in which we can challenge each other and are encouraged to be curious about best practice and that’s really enabled us to develop the best possible programmes for our athletes. On the pitch; qualifying for the Champions League was definitely a personal highlight – it was a just reward after a season of world-class performances and hard work!

Manchester City Women’s Football Club, more affectionately known as “Manchester City Women” are working hard in the Women’s Super League this season after a period of resurgence that saw them come a very close second to Chelsea last year. Helping to spearhead that surge in soccer progress after the team suffered setbacks and injuries in previous years is Emma Deakin, the Director of Performance Services at MCWFC.
For Deakin, who comes to soccer with a wealth of experience gained by training Olympic gold winning athletes such as triathlon’s Brownlee brothers, building a winning team is about forging strong relationships. The Manchester City Women’s performance coach must also navigate personal player circumstances as she carefully considers factors such as training load, injury prevention, and recovery.
M&F
sat down to find out more from Deakin, who has been an important contributor to some of City’s most recent soccer PRs.
You have worked extensively with Olympic athletes in the past, were you able to travel to any of the Games?
I’ve been lucky enough to go to four Olympic Games and have special memories from each one. Beijing 2008 was my first Games and my first time in that major multi-sporting environment. As a massive sports fan there’s something really unique about everyone being in the same place at the same time with the same goal, and very surreal sat having dinner with Usain Bolt on one side of you and the Williams sisters on the other!
You originally joined Manchester Women’s Football Club in January 2023 as their new Injury Management lead. What are some of the most common injuries in soccer?
Muscle injuries are obviously common in any running-based sport and in women’s football, quad and hamstring injuries are more common. Our aim is to condition our players as well as possible to cope with the growing demands of the game and reduce the risk and severity of these types of injuries.
Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries
are commonly discussed in the media but aren’t isolated to women’s football. I’d say that most injuries we see are sports-specific, rather than gender specific. For example, ankle inversions or issues related to tackles and concussions. For me, especially coming from a physiotherapy background, it’s vital that we take a multi-discipline approach to all our injuries, with clear exit criteria and ‘return to play’ guidelines. At City we involve the football coaches in the recovery journey as early as possible – we want to
minimize risk and optimize player performance on return
.
Manchester City W.F.C
What are some of the best ways for a soccer player to rest and recover?
We spend a lot of time monitoring and reviewing wellness data and trends – both across the squad and in individual players. Recovery is specific to each player, and we develop bespoke plans which incorporate a range of modalities including cryotherapy, massage or nutrition. Properly incorporating rest and recovery based on wellness data is a key strategy for preventing injury and something we really focus on.
How would you describe your current role as the Director of Performance Services?
My role as Director of Performance Services for MCWFC is to align and drive all the performance service departments to deliver our performance strategy. Across our multi-disciplinary team, we deliver a range of services – from strength and conditioning, to nutrition, rehab and recovery. One area of the role that’s relatively new to me is player recruitment, which includes assessing the physical condition of incoming players and how they’ll adapt to our training style and load.
You mentioned training load. How is this designed?
Our overall philosophy is to keep training load high to support performance and protect against injuries. Generally, squad training load is designed around fixtures and the team schedule so a week with two games looks different to a one game week. But within that there’s a lot of bespoke programming, and individual load will change based on the position they play, what we want them to achieve during a game, their history, any risk factors, injuries or return to play modifications etc.
Do you encourage players to get in the gym on their own time?
Generally, we don’t encourage working out away from the Club because gym programming is built into each individual player’s schedule and based around results from profiling and individual athlete plans. We design programs so that the rest days are to be true days off, and our players are world-class professional athletes who understand their program of activity.
What types of exercise sessions would you recommend to a soccer player?
Every player is different, but football is a running-based sport with lots of high intensity actions and maximum acceleration and deceleration, so any gym program needs to support an athlete’s ability to perform these actions again and again. Ultimately there’s no escaping the basics of strength training and in particular lower limb strength-based training is key.
Our players come from a wide variety of countries and cultures and ultimately, they are individuals with their own training histories and experiences. If they have an interest in different training methods, whether that’s yoga, swimming or boxing, we’ll always try to look at how to incorporate that in a way that works with their player program and doesn’t detract from their ability to perform at training or in a game.
How much of a role does nutrition play in performance services and are players provided with plans or meals, or education around the subject?
Nutrition is huge for both performance and recovery. We have a full-time nutritionist that works on an individual, squad and educational basis. The nutritionist ensures players have access to the right food at the right time and that regularly means working closely with our chefs at Manchester City Football Academy, and hotels and catering when we’re on the road. They work with individual players to develop nutrition plans to support their goals, for example if they’re recovering from an injury or if they are looking to put on extra lean muscle.
The nutritionist delivers education to players based on the most up-to-date research and literature, so our players understand why they’re eating certain foods at certain times, so that they can make empowered decisions that help them be the best athlete.
What does the training schedule of a professional female soccer player at Manchester City look like?
A typical day starts with a wellness check-in during the morning. We’ll talk about how they’re feeling, how they slept and ultimately if they’re good to train. Then they have breakfast as a team on-site. After breakfast they go to analysis where the team runs through what the training objectives are for the day, and they might review a specific game or some individual player clips.
Then we move onto preparation for on-field training by working the gym with programs tailored to an individual player based on their data, any injuries and the performance required of them at training. After training on the pitch as a team, they’ll come back in and we’ll do a shorter additional one-on-one or smaller group-based training session, depending on what a player needs that day or anything specific they’re working on. The squad then all have lunch together before an afternoon gym session. Then it might be on to commercial or media obligations, or educational activity before finishing for the day.
I understand that there’s a great relationship between the staff in both the men’s and women’s teams!
There’s a great relationship and learning environment across Manchester City Football Academy and that’s important for the development of football generally, not just the women’s game. We recruit the best individuals in their fields and to have that level of knowledge and experience under one roof is incredible.
The MCWFC performance team has seen real benefits from recruiting staff from both inside and outside of football. Together, we’ve got broad experience and expertise, and it’s allowed us to merge and take best practice from across world sport.

A post shared by Manchester City Women (@mancitywomen)
The past couple of years have been a period of resurgence for the team. How much has fitness and conditioning played a role in these results?
The demands of the women’s game are changing all the time and our approach to fitness and conditioning reflects that. For us, it’s not just about ensuring our players can perform at their best right now but also that we prepare them for the future demands of the game too. We want them to have long, healthy, high-performance careers. So, strength and conditioning, rehab, recovery and nutrition all play a vital role.
In your time at Manchester City, how have the female athletes evolved in terms of their physical skills and acumen for fitness?
The demands of the game are changing—both in terms of the physical intensity and frequency of games. We’re not just focused on ensuring players have the right level of fitness now, but we want to keep pushing on and raising the level too. Over the last few years, our benchmarks have been getting higher and higher, and our athletes have risen to meet them.
What have been some of your personal highlights since joining Manchester City Women?
Off the pitch; the development of the performance team. As individuals and as a department we’ve really progressed and grown. We’ve created a safe environment in which we can challenge each other and are encouraged to be curious about best practice and that’s really enabled us to develop the best possible programmes for our athletes. On the pitch; qualifying for the Champions League was definitely a personal highlight – it was a just reward after a season of world-class performances and hard work!

New year, new detox, right? Whether it’s green juices,
fasting protocols
, or teas that claim to flush you clean, January is when we collectively try to undo the indulgences of the past year. It feels equal parts hopeful and desperate—and frankly, if we’re honest, doesn’t last long.
We’ve heard these buzzwords before: activated charcoal to “bind toxins,”
infrared saunas to “sweat it out,”
and dry brushing to “stimulate the lymphatic system.” They each help the body’s natural detox pathways—your liver, kidneys, and lymphatic system. But what if there was a way to take detoxing a step further? What if you could directly cleanse almost all the blood flowing through your body?
EBO2 or EBOO—short for Extracorporeal Blood Oxygenation and Ozonation—offers a novel way to detox—filtering out toxins, heavy metals, built-up lipids, and cellular junk directly from your bloodstream. Physicians say it helps target some of the root causes of inflammation and chronic disease.
When I sat down with
Dr. Christopher Davis
, an interventional cardiologist with a passion for health optimization, his words set the stage for our conversation: “We get old and get sick because of the toxins around us.”
Davis didn’t sugarcoat the reality of modern life. While exercise, nutrition, and stress management are non-negotiables in the staying healthy hierarchy, oftentimes our environment often works against us.
“We’re talking about heavy metals—mercury, cadmium, lead, arsenic,” he explained. “Add to that insecticides and pesticides like atrazine and DDT. Then there’s plastics—BPA, phthalates, flame retardants, and the nonstick coatings on our cookware. Even the stain-resistant carpets and furniture in our homes contribute to the toxic load we carry.”
It’s quite scary to think how much toxic chemicals we eat, breathe, and drink every day. These substances don’t just float harmlessly through our bodies, nor do they simply come and go. They accumulate, creating oxidative stress, which over time triggers chronic inflammation. Davis points to
chronic inflammation as the root cause of many diseases
, including heart disease, autoimmune disorders, Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s diseases, and even certain cancers. “Inflammation is at the heart of it all,” he said. “And much of it is driven by these toxins.”
Dr. Davis has seen the impact of EBO2, observing significant improvements in patients with autoimmune conditions, high toxic loads, and even cancer. Plus, this cutting-edge treatment is gaining traction among high performers, athletes, and biohackers. Why? For them, optimizing recovery, slowing down aging, boosting energy, and counteracting the effects of modern environmental toxins are top priority.
Despite the buzz, EBO2 is not without its skeptics. While it’s safe when administered correctly in a clinical setting, the majority of the reported benefits are anecdotal, with limited large-scale clinical studies to back up its efficacy. As with any new modality, there’s a need for more robust, peer-reviewed research to determine its long-term effects and potential risks.
What is EBO2?
Get cozy because this treatment requires you to be hooked to an IV in both arms for 45 minutes while approximately 2 to 4 liters of your blood—between 40-80% of your body’s supply—is drawn, filtered, treated with ozone and specific wavelengths of light, and reintroduced into your body.
Plus, there’s a container on the side where all the junk gets filtered into. It looks murky and yellowish, making it hard to miss how much toxins we carry throughout our lives.
Dr. Joseph Purita, a pioneer in regenerative medicine and one of the physicians behind EBO2’s growing popularity in the U.S., describes the process in vivid terms. “When blood comes out of the body, it’s darkish. Looks like what we call venous blood. But when it’s filtered and treated with ozone and light, it returns bright red, looking like arterial blood. It’s almost as if we had a heart-lung machine oxygenating the blood. But it’s not that we’re just giving oxygen back, because your lungs can do that. There’s a number of interesting things that are happening, and that’s why I like it.”
EBO2 is a relatively new modality you might find in a longevity, upscale IV, or functional medicine clinic with a hefty price tag ranging from $875 to $1,800. And, unfortunately for many or us, it’s likely an out-of-pocket expense.

The Science Behind EBO2
Davis and Purita explained that EBO2 leverages the body’s own mechanisms to heal and create positive adaptation by triggering hormesis—a so-called “good stress” in which small amounts of oxidative stress stimulates the body to adapt. As the blood flows through the dialysis machine it’s exposed to ozone, a process that removes toxins, heavy metals, and cellular debris and creates beneficial oxidative compounds that stimulate your body’s natural antioxidant defenses, such as glutathione and superoxide dismutase. As an additional step, exposure to specific wavelengths of light—aka photobiomodulation—further reduces inflammation, boosts oxygen delivery, and kills harmful pathogens.
The process is entirely external, and as Purita emphasized, “ozone is toxic when inhaled, so no ozone enters the body. When ozone starts mixing with plasma, it’s converted right away to hydrogen peroxide, oxygen, and a few other things.”
In addition to cleansing your blood, this process evokes several interesting cellular mechanisms. Purita added that “EBO2 stimulates pathways like AMPk, which improves energy efficiency at the cellular level.”
AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPk) is an enzyme that plays a role in energy regulation. It acts like a metabolic thermostat, detecting energy deficits in your cells and triggering mechanisms to restore balance. AMPk activation boosts cellular energy production and encourages your body to burn fat for energy. Plus, studies link AMPk activation to improved cellular repair and reduced aging markers.
EBO2 upregulates another key pathway known as your body’s antioxidant powerhouse—the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2, (NRF2). NRF2 is a transcription factor that regulates the body’s antioxidant response. Think of it as the master regulator of detoxification and inflammation control. When activated, NRF2 turns on genes that produce antioxidant and anti-inflammatory compounds. These may help the body eliminate harmful substances, reduce oxidative stress, and protect cells from damage caused by environmental toxins and free radicals.
Dr. Davis noted that this treatment also stimulates mitochondrial biogenesis, creating more of the energy-producing powerhouses within your cells.
Benefits of EBO2
For athletes, high performers, and longevity enthusiasts, the benefits of EBO2 can mean a number of things. Improved oxygen delivery and mitochondrial health translate to better endurance, faster recovery, and a sharper mind. Reduced inflammation and oxidative stress may help improve mitochondrial function (think more energy at the cellular level). It also helps boost your immune system, and enhance recovery from workouts or illness.
Davis explained that more efficient red blood cell behavior also leads to increased oxygen delivery. “EBO2 improves how red blood cells flow through the microvascular system, reducing viscosity and enabling them to move more efficiently,” he said. “The therapy also enhances the release of oxygen from red blood cells, making oxygen delivery to tissues more effective.”
Additionally, ozone also helps stimulate nitric oxide production, which relaxes blood vessels and increases blood flow, Dr. Davis added. By addressing the mechanics of red blood cells and their oxygen-releasing capabilities, EBO2 ensures that tissues and organs receive the oxygen they need to perform optimally.
“People will typically have more energy, less brain fog, and just a sense of well-being and vitality,” Davis says, sharing how his patients often describe feeling after a session.
Subjective outcomes are not the only ones that may shift. Dr. Davis mentioned that there are a number of biomarkers and objective data he looks at to track EBO2’s efficacy. “We
can look at measures of inflammation like CRP, and other markers of oxidative stress,” he added.
Is EBO2 right for you?
EBO2 isn’t a cure-all. However, it’s a powerful tool for those looking to level up their detox protocol or address a chronic issue. It is also not something you would do every week. Dr. Purita explained that unless you have mold toxicity, Lyme disease or other autoimmune condition, he’d recommend EBO2 once a quarter or once every six months.
You could consider EBO2 if:
You are exposed to high levels of environmental toxins.
You are an athlete seeking faster recovery and better performance.
You are focused on aging gracefully and maintaining vitality.
However, EBO2 may not not suitable for everyone. Davis and Purita did highlight that people with certain conditions, like G6PD deficiency, or those on blood thinners should consult their healthcare provider before trying EBO2.
One important consideration both doctors pointed out is that since ozone activates the AMPk pathway, it mobilizes and pushes glucose into cells. While this is a positive metabolic effect, it can lead to a temporary drop in blood sugar during the session.
“Because blood sugar can drop during the procedure, we recommend having a high-carbohydrate meal beforehand,” Purita says. “If blood sugar levels fall too low during the treatment, we’re prepared to address it with intravenous glucose to keep patients comfortable and safe.”
Davis adds that EBO2 is also not a standalone solution. Pairing EBO2 with tools like hyperbaric oxygen therapy, molecular hydrogen, red light therapy, and cryotherapy may create a synergistic effect that can take recovery and performance to the next level. However, there’s no one-size-fits-all protocol, and we don’t yet know what’s the most effective way to combine them.
“Everyone’s experimenting,” Dr. Davis noted, “so I’m trying to figure out the right timing to stack all the modalities.”

New year, new detox, right? Whether it’s green juices,
fasting protocols
, or teas that claim to flush you clean, January is when we collectively try to undo the indulgences of the past year. It feels equal parts hopeful and desperate—and frankly, if we’re honest, doesn’t last long.
We’ve heard these buzzwords before: activated charcoal to “bind toxins,”
infrared saunas to “sweat it out,”
and dry brushing to “stimulate the lymphatic system.” They each help the body’s natural detox pathways—your liver, kidneys, and lymphatic system. But what if there was a way to take detoxing a step further? What if you could directly cleanse almost all the blood flowing through your body?
EBO2 or EBOO—short for Extracorporeal Blood Oxygenation and Ozonation—offers a novel way to detox—filtering out toxins, heavy metals, built-up lipids, and cellular junk directly from your bloodstream. Physicians say it helps target some of the root causes of inflammation and chronic disease.
When I sat down with
Dr. Christopher Davis
, an interventional cardiologist with a passion for health optimization, his words set the stage for our conversation: “We get old and get sick because of the toxins around us.”
Davis didn’t sugarcoat the reality of modern life. While exercise, nutrition, and stress management are non-negotiables in the staying healthy hierarchy, oftentimes our environment often works against us.
“We’re talking about heavy metals—mercury, cadmium, lead, arsenic,” he explained. “Add to that insecticides and pesticides like atrazine and DDT. Then there’s plastics—BPA, phthalates, flame retardants, and the nonstick coatings on our cookware. Even the stain-resistant carpets and furniture in our homes contribute to the toxic load we carry.”
It’s quite scary to think how much toxic chemicals we eat, breathe, and drink every day. These substances don’t just float harmlessly through our bodies, nor do they simply come and go. They accumulate, creating oxidative stress, which over time triggers chronic inflammation. Davis points to
chronic inflammation as the root cause of many diseases
, including heart disease, autoimmune disorders, Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s diseases, and even certain cancers. “Inflammation is at the heart of it all,” he said. “And much of it is driven by these toxins.”
Dr. Davis has seen the impact of EBO2, observing significant improvements in patients with autoimmune conditions, high toxic loads, and even cancer. Plus, this cutting-edge treatment is gaining traction among high performers, athletes, and biohackers. Why? For them, optimizing recovery, slowing down aging, boosting energy, and counteracting the effects of modern environmental toxins are top priority.
Despite the buzz, EBO2 is not without its skeptics. While it’s safe when administered correctly in a clinical setting, the majority of the reported benefits are anecdotal, with limited large-scale clinical studies to back up its efficacy. As with any new modality, there’s a need for more robust, peer-reviewed research to determine its long-term effects and potential risks.
What is EBO2?
Get cozy because this treatment requires you to be hooked to an IV in both arms for 45 minutes while approximately 2 to 4 liters of your blood—between 40-80% of your body’s supply—is drawn, filtered, treated with ozone and specific wavelengths of light, and reintroduced into your body.
Plus, there’s a container on the side where all the junk gets filtered into. It looks murky and yellowish, making it hard to miss how much toxins we carry throughout our lives.
Dr. Joseph Purita, a pioneer in regenerative medicine and one of the physicians behind EBO2’s growing popularity in the U.S., describes the process in vivid terms. “When blood comes out of the body, it’s darkish. Looks like what we call venous blood. But when it’s filtered and treated with ozone and light, it returns bright red, looking like arterial blood. It’s almost as if we had a heart-lung machine oxygenating the blood. But it’s not that we’re just giving oxygen back, because your lungs can do that. There’s a number of interesting things that are happening, and that’s why I like it.”
EBO2 is a relatively new modality you might find in a longevity, upscale IV, or functional medicine clinic with a hefty price tag ranging from $875 to $1,800. And, unfortunately for many or us, it’s likely an out-of-pocket expense.

The Science Behind EBO2
Davis and Purita explained that EBO2 leverages the body’s own mechanisms to heal and create positive adaptation by triggering hormesis—a so-called “good stress” in which small amounts of oxidative stress stimulates the body to adapt. As the blood flows through the dialysis machine it’s exposed to ozone, a process that removes toxins, heavy metals, and cellular debris and creates beneficial oxidative compounds that stimulate your body’s natural antioxidant defenses, such as glutathione and superoxide dismutase. As an additional step, exposure to specific wavelengths of light—aka photobiomodulation—further reduces inflammation, boosts oxygen delivery, and kills harmful pathogens.
The process is entirely external, and as Purita emphasized, “ozone is toxic when inhaled, so no ozone enters the body. When ozone starts mixing with plasma, it’s converted right away to hydrogen peroxide, oxygen, and a few other things.”
In addition to cleansing your blood, this process evokes several interesting cellular mechanisms. Purita added that “EBO2 stimulates pathways like AMPk, which improves energy efficiency at the cellular level.”
AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPk) is an enzyme that plays a role in energy regulation. It acts like a metabolic thermostat, detecting energy deficits in your cells and triggering mechanisms to restore balance. AMPk activation boosts cellular energy production and encourages your body to burn fat for energy. Plus, studies link AMPk activation to improved cellular repair and reduced aging markers.
EBO2 upregulates another key pathway known as your body’s antioxidant powerhouse—the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2, (NRF2). NRF2 is a transcription factor that regulates the body’s antioxidant response. Think of it as the master regulator of detoxification and inflammation control. When activated, NRF2 turns on genes that produce antioxidant and anti-inflammatory compounds. These may help the body eliminate harmful substances, reduce oxidative stress, and protect cells from damage caused by environmental toxins and free radicals.
Dr. Davis noted that this treatment also stimulates mitochondrial biogenesis, creating more of the energy-producing powerhouses within your cells.
Benefits of EBO2
For athletes, high performers, and longevity enthusiasts, the benefits of EBO2 can mean a number of things. Improved oxygen delivery and mitochondrial health translate to better endurance, faster recovery, and a sharper mind. Reduced inflammation and oxidative stress may help improve mitochondrial function (think more energy at the cellular level). It also helps boost your immune system, and enhance recovery from workouts or illness.
Davis explained that more efficient red blood cell behavior also leads to increased oxygen delivery. “EBO2 improves how red blood cells flow through the microvascular system, reducing viscosity and enabling them to move more efficiently,” he said. “The therapy also enhances the release of oxygen from red blood cells, making oxygen delivery to tissues more effective.”
Additionally, ozone also helps stimulate nitric oxide production, which relaxes blood vessels and increases blood flow, Dr. Davis added. By addressing the mechanics of red blood cells and their oxygen-releasing capabilities, EBO2 ensures that tissues and organs receive the oxygen they need to perform optimally.
“People will typically have more energy, less brain fog, and just a sense of well-being and vitality,” Davis says, sharing how his patients often describe feeling after a session.
Subjective outcomes are not the only ones that may shift. Dr. Davis mentioned that there are a number of biomarkers and objective data he looks at to track EBO2’s efficacy. “We
can look at measures of inflammation like CRP, and other markers of oxidative stress,” he added.
Is EBO2 right for you?
EBO2 isn’t a cure-all. However, it’s a powerful tool for those looking to level up their detox protocol or address a chronic issue. It is also not something you would do every week. Dr. Purita explained that unless you have mold toxicity, Lyme disease or other autoimmune condition, he’d recommend EBO2 once a quarter or once every six months.
You could consider EBO2 if:
You are exposed to high levels of environmental toxins.
You are an athlete seeking faster recovery and better performance.
You are focused on aging gracefully and maintaining vitality.
However, EBO2 may not not suitable for everyone. Davis and Purita did highlight that people with certain conditions, like G6PD deficiency, or those on blood thinners should consult their healthcare provider before trying EBO2.
One important consideration both doctors pointed out is that since ozone activates the AMPk pathway, it mobilizes and pushes glucose into cells. While this is a positive metabolic effect, it can lead to a temporary drop in blood sugar during the session.
“Because blood sugar can drop during the procedure, we recommend having a high-carbohydrate meal beforehand,” Purita says. “If blood sugar levels fall too low during the treatment, we’re prepared to address it with intravenous glucose to keep patients comfortable and safe.”
Davis adds that EBO2 is also not a standalone solution. Pairing EBO2 with tools like hyperbaric oxygen therapy, molecular hydrogen, red light therapy, and cryotherapy may create a synergistic effect that can take recovery and performance to the next level. However, there’s no one-size-fits-all protocol, and we don’t yet know what’s the most effective way to combine them.
“Everyone’s experimenting,” Dr. Davis noted, “so I’m trying to figure out the right timing to stack all the modalities.”

Alzheimer’s disease is a cruel ailment that gradually takes our memory, language, and sense of self, but new research is showing how regular exercise can serve as a preventative tool, minimizing many of its markers.
Alzheimer’s main biological features are the presence of amyloid protein plaques, tau tangles (abnormal accumulations of the tau protein in the brain) and myelin degeneration (myelin helps to transmit electrical impulses in the brain).
A new study, recently published in
Science Direct: Brain Research
has successfully built on a growing body of evidence that points to physical exercise as a means of reducing these biological features. Experts from the University of Bristol (UK), and the Federal University of São Paulo (Brazil) put aged rodents through structured programs of aerobic activity and
found that physical exercise had the following positive effects
:
Reduced amyloid protein plaques by approximately 76%
Reduced tau tangles by around 63%
Reduced inflammation by up to 68%
Improved communication between brain cells
Increased the number of brain protective cells
Exercise is Essential To Fighting Alzheimer’s Disease
While a firm number is yet to be placed on how often you should exercise in order to help alleviate AD, the take home message is simple:
Swapping a sedentary lifestyle for one that includes regular aerobic activity is essential for longevity
. “Alzheimer’s is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder with no known cure, impacting millions worldwide,” says Dr Augusto Coppi, who is one of the study’s authors. “While physical exercise is known to reduce cognitive decline, the cellular mechanisms behind its neuroprotective effects have remained elusive—until now. This research highlights the potential for aerobic exercise to serve as a cornerstone in preventive strategies for Alzheimer’s.”
The authors of the study also suggest that public health initiatives should prioritise the promotion of exercise programs that are tailored to aging populations.
For the elderly, exercises such as cycling or swimming could be a safe option
where avoiding injury is paramount. But you don’t have to be getting on in years to begin the fight against AD. The onset of Alzheimer’s disease can begin 20 years before symptoms appear, so there’s no better time to get your body moving than today.

Study Finds Aerobic Exercise Improves Alzheimer’s Disease Cognitive Function

Alzheimer’s disease is a cruel ailment that gradually takes our memory, language, and sense of self, but new research is showing how regular exercise can serve as a preventative tool, minimizing many of its markers.
Alzheimer’s main biological features are the presence of amyloid protein plaques, tau tangles (abnormal accumulations of the tau protein in the brain) and myelin degeneration (myelin helps to transmit electrical impulses in the brain).
A new study, recently published in
Science Direct: Brain Research
has successfully built on a growing body of evidence that points to physical exercise as a means of reducing these biological features. Experts from the University of Bristol (UK), and the Federal University of São Paulo (Brazil) put aged rodents through structured programs of aerobic activity and
found that physical exercise had the following positive effects
:
Reduced amyloid protein plaques by approximately 76%
Reduced tau tangles by around 63%
Reduced inflammation by up to 68%
Improved communication between brain cells
Increased the number of brain protective cells
Exercise is Essential To Fighting Alzheimer’s Disease
While a firm number is yet to be placed on how often you should exercise in order to help alleviate AD, the take home message is simple:
Swapping a sedentary lifestyle for one that includes regular aerobic activity is essential for longevity
. “Alzheimer’s is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder with no known cure, impacting millions worldwide,” says Dr Augusto Coppi, who is one of the study’s authors. “While physical exercise is known to reduce cognitive decline, the cellular mechanisms behind its neuroprotective effects have remained elusive—until now. This research highlights the potential for aerobic exercise to serve as a cornerstone in preventive strategies for Alzheimer’s.”
The authors of the study also suggest that public health initiatives should prioritise the promotion of exercise programs that are tailored to aging populations.
For the elderly, exercises such as cycling or swimming could be a safe option
where avoiding injury is paramount. But you don’t have to be getting on in years to begin the fight against AD. The onset of Alzheimer’s disease can begin 20 years before symptoms appear, so there’s no better time to get your body moving than today.

What Is HYROX: The Ultimate Endurance and Strength Challenge
Watch out CrossFit, there’s a new fitness kid on the block.

If you’ve ever wondered how to combine endurance racing with strength training in one epic fitness challenge, HYROX is the answer. This global fitness race is gaining momentum as the
ultimate test of stamina and strength
, blending running with
functional exercises
like sled pushes, rowing, and burpees. Whether you’re a seasoned athlete or someone looking for a new goal to chase, HYROX workouts are designed to push you to your limits while building total-body resilience. With more people searching for HYROX vs. CrossFit comparisons and wondering what it takes to complete a HYROX race, it’s clear that this competition is making waves in the fitness world.
But what exactly is HYROX, and why should you train for one? In this guide, I’ll dish out everything you need to know, including how the event works, how it differs from CrossFit, what the workouts entail, and why it’s worth adding to your training calendar. Whether you’re in it to challenge yourself or simply to switch up your training, HYROX is an experience you won’t want to miss.
What Is HYROX?
HYROX is a global fitness race designed to test both
endurance and strength
. Unlike obstacle course races like Spartan or Tough Mudder, HYROX is a standardized indoor competition, meaning every race follows the same format—no surprises, just pure performance.
Each HYROX competition consists of eight 1km runs, each followed by a functional workout station. The total distance covered is 8K, but it’s not just about running—you’ll also battle through exercises like sled pushes, sled pulls, rowing, burpee broad jumps, and sandbag lunges. It’s a brutal mix of aerobic capacity, muscular endurance, and mental grit, making it one of the most complete fitness challenges available today.

HYROX vs. CrossFit: What’s the Difference?
At first glance, HYROX and CrossFit seem similar—both incorporate high-intensity functional movements, require a blend of strength and endurance, and attract competitive fitness enthusiasts. But when you break it down, the two are fundamentally different:
Competition Structure
HYROX follows a standardized race format across all events, so every competitor faces the exact same challenge. In contrast, CrossFit competitions vary widely, with workouts programmed differently at each event.
Workout Style
HYROX is predictable and endurance-based, featuring running and functional workout stations in every race. Conversely, CrossFit is constantly varied, incorporating Olympic lifts, gymnastics, and technical barbell movements that require skill mastery.
No Barbells, No Gymnastics
HYROX workouts focus on functional strength and endurance without requiring complex lifts like snatches, cleans, or overhead squats. You also won’t find muscle-ups, handstand walks, or ring dips—just raw fitness, tested through sleds, lunges, and running.
Scalability
HYROX offers multiple divisions (Open, Pro, Doubles, and Relay), making it accessible for different fitness levels. While CrossFit also provides scaling options, some workouts can be highly technical and skill-dependent, which can be a barrier for beginners.
In the words of the great Dr. Dre: “What’s the difference between me and you?”—HYROX would answer: “…that’s the difference.”

HYROX Workout Breakdown: What to Expect in the Race
A HYROX race consists of eight 1K runs, each followed by a functional workout station. Here’s the exact breakdown:
1K Run → Ski Erg (1,000m)
1K Run → Sled Push (weighed sled, distance-based)
1K Run → Sled Pull (pull a weighted sled backward)
1K Run → Burpee Broad Jumps (crawling your way forward, one jump at a time)
1K Run → Rowing (1,000m on a Concept2 Rower)
1K Run → Farmers Carry (weighted kettlebell carry)
1K Run → Sandbag Lunges (weighted walking lunges)
1K Run → Wall Balls (reps based on category)
It’s a brutal test of endurance, grit, and power. The combination of running and high-rep strength exercises forces athletes to balance pacing and efficiency—go too hard on the strength stations, and your running pace suffers. Go too fast on the runs, and you’ll burn out before the wall balls.
Why You Should Train for a HYROX Competition
Training for HYROX is more than just prepping for race day—it builds a well-rounded athlete. Here’s why it’s worth adding to your fitness goals:
Improves Endurance & Strength:
Unlike traditional endurance races, HYROX forces you to sustain strength output while running, making it a complete test of fitness.
Enhances Functional Fitness:
The exercises mimic real-life movement patterns, such as carrying, pushing, and lunging, which actually improves overall strength.
Provides a Competitive Edge:
If you love setting goals and pushing your limits, HYROX gives you a clear benchmark to train for and improve upon.
Accessible to All Fitness Levels:
HYROX races offer a low barrier to entry, thanks to the simplicity of its movements—yet they still pose a serious challenge. HYROX has multiple divisions to accommodate a wide range of fitness levels and is designed so that anyone can step up to the starting line and push themselves.
Plus, it’s a huge mental challenge. You have no option but to finish strong, which requires discipline, pacing, and mental toughness, making it one of the most rewarding fitness experiences you can take on.
HYROX Competition Levels: Can Anyone Compete?
The beauty of HYROX is that it’s for everyone. You don’t have to be an elite athlete to join—there are multiple divisions to choose from:
Open
– The standard category, ideal for first-timers and fitness enthusiasts.
Pro
– A step up from the open category, featuring heavier weights and increased difficulty.
Doubles
– A two-person team format where partners split the workout stations.
Relay
– A four-person team format where each teammate completes two workout stations.
No matter your fitness level, HYROX is designed to be accessible while pushing you to your limits. Whether you train alone or compete with a friend, the challenge remains: finish strong, push your boundaries, and embrace the grind.
Final Thoughts
HYROX is redefining fitness racing by blending running, functional strength, and endurance into one intense competition. Whether you’re looking to level up your training, challenge yourself in a new way, or see how you stack up against others, training for HYROX is a great way to build total-body athleticism. Could HYROX be the next “CrossFit?”, signs are pointing towards, “yes!”

What Is HYROX: The Ultimate Endurance and Strength Challenge

If you’ve ever wondered how to combine endurance racing with strength training in one epic fitness challenge, HYROX is the answer. This global fitness race is gaining momentum as the
ultimate test of stamina and strength
, blending running with
functional exercises
like sled pushes, rowing, and burpees. Whether you’re a seasoned athlete or someone looking for a new goal to chase, HYROX workouts are designed to push you to your limits while building total-body resilience. With more people searching for HYROX vs. CrossFit comparisons and wondering what it takes to complete a HYROX race, it’s clear that this competition is making waves in the fitness world.
But what exactly is HYROX, and why should you train for one? In this guide, I’ll dish out everything you need to know, including how the event works, how it differs from CrossFit, what the workouts entail, and why it’s worth adding to your training calendar. Whether you’re in it to challenge yourself or simply to switch up your training, HYROX is an experience you won’t want to miss.
What Is HYROX?
HYROX is a global fitness race designed to test both
endurance and strength
. Unlike obstacle course races like Spartan or Tough Mudder, HYROX is a standardized indoor competition, meaning every race follows the same format—no surprises, just pure performance.
Each HYROX competition consists of eight 1km runs, each followed by a functional workout station. The total distance covered is 8K, but it’s not just about running—you’ll also battle through exercises like sled pushes, sled pulls, rowing, burpee broad jumps, and sandbag lunges. It’s a brutal mix of aerobic capacity, muscular endurance, and mental grit, making it one of the most complete fitness challenges available today.

HYROX vs. CrossFit: What’s the Difference?
At first glance, HYROX and CrossFit seem similar—both incorporate high-intensity functional movements, require a blend of strength and endurance, and attract competitive fitness enthusiasts. But when you break it down, the two are fundamentally different:
Competition Structure
HYROX follows a standardized race format across all events, so every competitor faces the exact same challenge. In contrast, CrossFit competitions vary widely, with workouts programmed differently at each event.
Workout Style
HYROX is predictable and endurance-based, featuring running and functional workout stations in every race. Conversely, CrossFit is constantly varied, incorporating Olympic lifts, gymnastics, and technical barbell movements that require skill mastery.
No Barbells, No Gymnastics
HYROX workouts focus on functional strength and endurance without requiring complex lifts like snatches, cleans, or overhead squats. You also won’t find muscle-ups, handstand walks, or ring dips—just raw fitness, tested through sleds, lunges, and running.
Scalability
HYROX offers multiple divisions (Open, Pro, Doubles, and Relay), making it accessible for different fitness levels. While CrossFit also provides scaling options, some workouts can be highly technical and skill-dependent, which can be a barrier for beginners.
In the words of the great Dr. Dre: “What’s the difference between me and you?”—HYROX would answer: “…that’s the difference.”

HYROX Workout Breakdown: What to Expect in the Race
A HYROX race consists of eight 1K runs, each followed by a functional workout station. Here’s the exact breakdown:
1K Run → Ski Erg (1,000m)
1K Run → Sled Push (weighed sled, distance-based)
1K Run → Sled Pull (pull a weighted sled backward)
1K Run → Burpee Broad Jumps (crawling your way forward, one jump at a time)
1K Run → Rowing (1,000m on a Concept2 Rower)
1K Run → Farmers Carry (weighted kettlebell carry)
1K Run → Sandbag Lunges (weighted walking lunges)
1K Run → Wall Balls (reps based on category)
It’s a brutal test of endurance, grit, and power. The combination of running and high-rep strength exercises forces athletes to balance pacing and efficiency—go too hard on the strength stations, and your running pace suffers. Go too fast on the runs, and you’ll burn out before the wall balls.
Why You Should Train for a HYROX Competition
Training for HYROX is more than just prepping for race day—it builds a well-rounded athlete. Here’s why it’s worth adding to your fitness goals:
Improves Endurance & Strength:
Unlike traditional endurance races, HYROX forces you to sustain strength output while running, making it a complete test of fitness.
Enhances Functional Fitness:
The exercises mimic real-life movement patterns, such as carrying, pushing, and lunging, which actually improves overall strength.
Provides a Competitive Edge:
If you love setting goals and pushing your limits, HYROX gives you a clear benchmark to train for and improve upon.
Accessible to All Fitness Levels:
HYROX races offer a low barrier to entry, thanks to the simplicity of its movements—yet they still pose a serious challenge. HYROX has multiple divisions to accommodate a wide range of fitness levels and is designed so that anyone can step up to the starting line and push themselves.
Plus, it’s a huge mental challenge. You have no option but to finish strong, which requires discipline, pacing, and mental toughness, making it one of the most rewarding fitness experiences you can take on.
HYROX Competition Levels: Can Anyone Compete?
The beauty of HYROX is that it’s for everyone. You don’t have to be an elite athlete to join—there are multiple divisions to choose from:
Open
– The standard category, ideal for first-timers and fitness enthusiasts.
Pro
– A step up from the open category, featuring heavier weights and increased difficulty.
Doubles
– A two-person team format where partners split the workout stations.
Relay
– A four-person team format where each teammate completes two workout stations.
No matter your fitness level, HYROX is designed to be accessible while pushing you to your limits. Whether you train alone or compete with a friend, the challenge remains: finish strong, push your boundaries, and embrace the grind.
Final Thoughts
HYROX is redefining fitness racing by blending running, functional strength, and endurance into one intense competition. Whether you’re looking to level up your training, challenge yourself in a new way, or see how you stack up against others, training for HYROX is a great way to build total-body athleticism. Could HYROX be the next “CrossFit?”, signs are pointing towards, “yes!”

Trying to lose weight can feel like a constant battle. The yo-yo effects of dieting can take its toll on the body, mind, and soul. Finding a sustainable and balanced approach to weight loss is something that most people struggle with, but Qi Gong Master Lee Holden has the answers to take all the stress out of the process—quite literally—by calming the nervous system.
Holden’s new book,
Ready, Set, Slow: How to Improve Your Energy, Health, and Relationships Through the Power of Slow
, to be published in January 2025, shares the power of slowing down in life and the ripple effect this has on your physical and mental health. “The best moments in life happen when we slow down,” he says.
“If you have a sunset or a delicious dinner, you don’t want to speed through it because you’ll miss it altogether. Qi Gong is about slowing down and replacing busy with bliss. Slowing down can improve your health, your sleeping patterns, and digestion so it really benefits all aspects of your life.”
Holden is all about changing the ‘how’ of daily activities rather than the ‘what’. Concerning eating, this involves taking the time to appreciate and absorb the experience of eating a meal, rather than rushing it down in front of the TV, a common comfort practice known as ‘zombie eating.’
In his book, Holden shares studies that prove people feel fuller for longer when they slow down and eat with a mindful purpose. Something as simple as taking a deep breath before you start and taking a moment to smell your food can prime the body to digest more efficiently.
He points out that it takes 20 minutes for the brain to recognize that the stomach is full so if we eat too fast, we can frequently eat beyond the point of comfort or need because we’re not giving those satiety signals a chance to show themselves. As Holden writes in his book, “Fast eating and low chewing rates have been linked to a 35 percent increase in a person’s risk for metabolic syndrome.”
Eating slowly can boost your metabolism and make you eat less in a natural way instead of using deprivation as a tool. Qi Gong is a five-thousand-year-old art from ancient China, known as the ‘art of effortless power’, so harnessing its principles for eating can lead to effortless weight loss.
Holden brought these principles into practical use for his bespoke ‘Qi Flow’ program in the ‘Beyond the Scale’ section for Weight Watchers. Holden writes in his book, “Although the name of the organization implies that it’s all about weight loss, it’s actually more about forging a healthy, happy lifestyle.”
Lee Holden
“During my time there, I’m delighted to report that 92 percent of the Weight Watchers members reported feeling better, more motivated, and able to make healthier choices. The program I ran using the Slow Principles turned out to be the highest-rated program that the company had ever piloted.”
“Our findings were that achieving food freedom and health was about much more than just counting calories. It had to do with a variety of principles like stress management, when and how we consume food, sleep, body movement, and the emotional state of the person while chewing their meals.”
Here are two simple exercises that Holden recommends to slow down eating habits. The following exercises have been adapted from Ready, Set, Slow: How to Improve Your Energy, Health, and Relationships Through the Power of Slow by Lee Holden (January 2025). Reprinted with permission from the publisher, Sounds True.
Mealtime Mindfulness
1. Sit down at the table with your meal (yes, a table, not in front of the TV!).
2. Take a second to gaze lovingly at your food.
3. Take a sniff . . . what aromas can you smell?
4. Take a deep breath before taking your first bite.
5. Notice the flavors, textures, and temperature of your food, chewing thoroughly but
enjoying the experience. Is it delicious? Allow yourself to let out an “Mmmmm.”
6. Put down your knife and fork (or spoon or chopsticks, whatever you’re using), and don’t
be tempted to prepare your next mouthful while eating. Always put down your cutlery
between bites.
7. Swallow.
8. Take another deep breath.
9. Pick up your cutlery again and repeat until you feel full.
Ear Acupressure to Cut Cravings
1. Place your thumbs on the very top part of the front of the ears with your other four
fingers behind the ear.
2. Massage the top of the ear in slow, small circles with medium pressure.
3. Take deep breaths as you do so.
4. Keep massaging all the way down the ear to the lobe, the tragus (the bump in front of
your ear canal), and the ear canal, continuing the small circles.
5. Massage your way back up to the top of the ears.
6. Repeat this process for 30 seconds to 1 minute to feel the calming effects.
Binge eating and comfort eating are common coping mechanisms for people to manage or avoid stress. Using Slow Principles from Lee Holden’s decades-long research into the art of Qi Gong can help break that cycle and introduce healthy eating habits that last a lifetime.

Trying to lose weight can feel like a constant battle. The yo-yo effects of dieting can take its toll on the body, mind, and soul. Finding a sustainable and balanced approach to weight loss is something that most people struggle with, but Qi Gong Master Lee Holden has the answers to take all the stress out of the process—quite literally—by calming the nervous system.
Holden’s new book,
Ready, Set, Slow: How to Improve Your Energy, Health, and Relationships Through the Power of Slow
, to be published in January 2025, shares the power of slowing down in life and the ripple effect this has on your physical and mental health. “The best moments in life happen when we slow down,” he says.
“If you have a sunset or a delicious dinner, you don’t want to speed through it because you’ll miss it altogether. Qi Gong is about slowing down and replacing busy with bliss. Slowing down can improve your health, your sleeping patterns, and digestion so it really benefits all aspects of your life.”
Holden is all about changing the ‘how’ of daily activities rather than the ‘what’. Concerning eating, this involves taking the time to appreciate and absorb the experience of eating a meal, rather than rushing it down in front of the TV, a common comfort practice known as ‘zombie eating.’
In his book, Holden shares studies that prove people feel fuller for longer when they slow down and eat with a mindful purpose. Something as simple as taking a deep breath before you start and taking a moment to smell your food can prime the body to digest more efficiently.
He points out that it takes 20 minutes for the brain to recognize that the stomach is full so if we eat too fast, we can frequently eat beyond the point of comfort or need because we’re not giving those satiety signals a chance to show themselves. As Holden writes in his book, “Fast eating and low chewing rates have been linked to a 35 percent increase in a person’s risk for metabolic syndrome.”
Eating slowly can boost your metabolism and make you eat less in a natural way instead of using deprivation as a tool. Qi Gong is a five-thousand-year-old art from ancient China, known as the ‘art of effortless power’, so harnessing its principles for eating can lead to effortless weight loss.
Holden brought these principles into practical use for his bespoke ‘Qi Flow’ program in the ‘Beyond the Scale’ section for Weight Watchers. Holden writes in his book, “Although the name of the organization implies that it’s all about weight loss, it’s actually more about forging a healthy, happy lifestyle.”

Aging doesn’t have to be a daunting experience. For many, the thought of growing older comes with fears of health decline, loss of physical abilities, and emotional changes. But what if I told you that embracing travel and outdoor adventures could be your secret
weapon against the fears of aging
? As a coach with over 20 years of experience, I’ve seen firsthand how setting ambitious goals and pushing past perceived limits can keep you physically, mentally, and emotionally vibrant well into your later years.
Recently, I embarked on a 10-day trekking adventure that took me and a group of extraordinary individuals through Switzerland, Italy, and France. At 40, I found myself among the youngest in the group, which was primarily made up of men and women in their 40s, 50s, and 60s. Despite their age, these people were some of the fittest, most determined individuals I’ve ever met. They tackled the discomfort of a 100-mile trek through rugged terrain with remarkable resilience, proving that age is just a number.
Some of these adventurers were retired, approaching their 70s, yet they showed no signs of struggle, frustration, or physical limitations. They walked, trekked, and hiked through three countries, savoring delicious food along the way and engaging in lively conversations about past adventures. They spoke of how travel, adventure, and good company have been essential in enhancing their aging process, keeping them strong, healthy, and happy.
A 100-mile trek is no small feat. Setting and achieving goals like this at any age is challenging, but it’s especially rewarding as you get older. These adventures can be the key to a healthier, happier, and stronger aging process. The benefits extend far beyond the physical. They
rejuvenate the mind and spirit
, filling you with a sense of accomplishment and vitality that transcends the years.
Make no mistake, rigorous preparation and training are essential for a 100-mile hike. However, regardless of age, setting goals (both small and ambitious), traveling with like-minded individuals, trying new foods, and embracing conversations and challenges can have a profound impact. These experiences can foster deeper connections with others, energize your spirit, and fill your life with positive energy and a youthful enthusiasm

How To Use Travel and Outdoors Adventures To Your Benefit
Set Physical Goals
Whether it’s a 5K, a marathon, a strength feat, or a 100-mile trek, having a physical goal keeps you motivated and active. It gives you a reason to train, to push your limits, and to stay fit.
Plan Adventures
Adventures give you something to look forward to. They keep life exciting and provide motivation to stay in shape. Whether it’s a hike, a bike ride, or a journey across multiple countries, planning adventures will keep you young at heart.
Surround Yourself with Good People
The company you keep can greatly influence your attitude toward aging. Surround yourself with like-minded individuals who are also eager to explore, travel, and push their limits.
Break Down Big Goals
A large goal, like a 100-mile trek, can seem overwhelming. Break it down into smaller, more manageable goals. This not only makes it achievable but also gives you a series of wins to celebrate along the way.
Believe in Yourself
No age is too old to start. If you’ve ever dreamed of doing something adventurous, now is the time. You’re not too old for this stuff; you just need to put in the time, effort, and energy.

Aging doesn’t have to be a daunting experience. For many, the thought of growing older comes with fears of health decline, loss of physical abilities, and emotional changes. But what if I told you that embracing travel and outdoor adventures could be your secret
weapon against the fears of aging
? As a coach with over 20 years of experience, I’ve seen firsthand how setting ambitious goals and pushing past perceived limits can keep you physically, mentally, and emotionally vibrant well into your later years.
Recently, I embarked on a 10-day trekking adventure that took me and a group of extraordinary individuals through Switzerland, Italy, and France. At 40, I found myself among the youngest in the group, which was primarily made up of men and women in their 40s, 50s, and 60s. Despite their age, these people were some of the fittest, most determined individuals I’ve ever met. They tackled the discomfort of a 100-mile trek through rugged terrain with remarkable resilience, proving that age is just a number.
Some of these adventurers were retired, approaching their 70s, yet they showed no signs of struggle, frustration, or physical limitations. They walked, trekked, and hiked through three countries, savoring delicious food along the way and engaging in lively conversations about past adventures. They spoke of how travel, adventure, and good company have been essential in enhancing their aging process, keeping them strong, healthy, and happy.
A 100-mile trek is no small feat. Setting and achieving goals like this at any age is challenging, but it’s especially rewarding as you get older. These adventures can be the key to a healthier, happier, and stronger aging process. The benefits extend far beyond the physical. They
rejuvenate the mind and spirit
, filling you with a sense of accomplishment and vitality that transcends the years.
Make no mistake, rigorous preparation and training are essential for a 100-mile hike. However, regardless of age, setting goals (both small and ambitious), traveling with like-minded individuals, trying new foods, and embracing conversations and challenges can have a profound impact. These experiences can foster deeper connections with others, energize your spirit, and fill your life with positive energy and a youthful enthusiasm

How To Use Travel and Outdoors Adventures To Your Benefit
Set Physical Goals
Whether it’s a 5K, a marathon, a strength feat, or a 100-mile trek, having a physical goal keeps you motivated and active. It gives you a reason to train, to push your limits, and to stay fit.
Plan Adventures
Adventures give you something to look forward to. They keep life exciting and provide motivation to stay in shape. Whether it’s a hike, a bike ride, or a journey across multiple countries, planning adventures will keep you young at heart.
Surround Yourself with Good People
The company you keep can greatly influence your attitude toward aging. Surround yourself with like-minded individuals who are also eager to explore, travel, and push their limits.
Break Down Big Goals
A large goal, like a 100-mile trek, can seem overwhelming. Break it down into smaller, more manageable goals. This not only makes it achievable but also gives you a series of wins to celebrate along the way.
Believe in Yourself
No age is too old to start. If you’ve ever dreamed of doing something adventurous, now is the time. You’re not too old for this stuff; you just need to put in the time, effort, and energy.

Medical Experts Explain What May Be Causing Your ‘Popping’ Joints

Sometimes, our bodies produce sounds that catch us off guard, leaving us wondering if we should be concerned or simply shrug it off. Knees and elbows, in particular, seem to have a knack for making themselves heard, leading many of us to question whether these popping joints are a sign of trouble.
To get to the bottom of it, we spoke with
Dr. Lauren Lynass
, a physical therapist, and sport medicine specialist
Dr. Christopher J. Visco
to understand what might be causing these noises, whether they’re worth worrying about, and what we can do to manage them.
Dr. Lynass mentions two theories for what might cause clicking or popping in our joints. “The first,
based on research done in 2015
, suggests that the audible popping in joints is the result of the release of gas from the joint fluid, something we term tribonucleation,” she explains. This theory suggests that when you hear that familiar ‘pop,’ it might simply be a gas bubble forming and collapsing within the joint, which is generally harmless.
The other theory is the tissue sliding theory. “Friction is created as tissues move around a joint, which can result in audible popping, clicking, or even a grinding sound,” Dr. Lynass describes, adding that this friction could occur as tendons, ligaments, or other soft tissues shift over bones or other structures within the joint.
Dr. Visco adds an additional angle noting that sometimes these sounds could be linked to more specific tendon or ligament issues. Tendons can develop calcifications, which might produce clicking, grinding, or snapping sounds. “Interestingly, about
20-30% of people have a pain-free calcified tendon
somewhere in their body, which often doesn’t require treatment unless it becomes painful or interferes with function,” Dr. Visco explains.

Should You Get Your Joints Checked Out?
According to Dr. Lynass, if there’s no pain, the answer is generally, no. Certain activities, such as bending the knee, rotating the shoulder, or extending the elbow involve complex interactions between bones, muscles, and connective tissues, which is when we usually hear those sounds, but it’s OK. “It’s normal for our bodies to make noises, and as long as these noises are not associated with consistent pain, feelings of instability or any notable catching, you are good to go,” she reassures. In other words, a little snap, crackle, or pop now and then is often just part of being human.
However, if those symptoms progress, and you begin to experience pain, instability, or catching, it’s a different story. “Symptoms could possibly worsen, and if they do, it’s important to consult with a trusted medical provider,” Lynass says.
Visco adds that if there’s pain, the clicking may be doing additional damage. Also, it’s worth getting it checked out if there’s swelling, redness, or warmth, or you notice any limitation in range of motion or function.
He underscores that some sounds could indicate more serious underlying issues. “Inflammatory joint diseases, like psoriatic arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and synovitis, can also be a root cause. “Osteoarthritis, which many think of as inflammation but is a much more complicated joint degeneration process, where the normal smooth cartilage surface develops fissures and the thickness of the hyaline cartilage wears down, that can often cause a grinding sensation,” he explains, adding “I would say ‘arthritis,’ aka osteoarthritis, is the most common thing people think is going on when they have some grinding.”
As we age the chance of getting some arthritis affecting a joint, particularly the knee goes up, according to Visco. “If someone has ever had an injury, such as an ACL tear in the knee, the change of getting arthritis goes up quite a bit,” he notes.

How to Manage Popping Joints
“Continue to move your body,” advises Dr. Lynass. With extended sitting now being considered a health risk, lack of movement can take a toll on many bodily systems, and joints are no exception. “We experience increased pressure and friction in a joint when we are static for too long,” Dr. Lynass explains, adding that regular physical activity can help alleviate these symptoms.
Incorporate a variety of movements throughout your day—whether it’s stretching, walking, or gentle exercise. These can help lubricate the joints, reduce friction, and keep the muscles around them strong.
Dr. Visco echoes this advice, stressing the importance of maintaining range of motion and strength in the muscles around the joint to manage tendon or joint-related pain. “If there’s any acute inflammation, like warmth or swelling, then rest and ice are great starting points,” he says. While he tends to avoid recommending NSAIDs for most patients, he suggests that persistent pain requiring frequent use of ibuprofen or naproxen should be checked by a healthcare provider.
In addition to movement, Dr. Visco suggests exploring other modalities for managing those clicks, grinds, and pops. “Heat and red light therapy could be helpful for soft tissue tightness around superficial tendons, which might be causing clicking,” he says. Addressing any underlying issues, such as muscle imbalances or tightness in the kinetic chain—like weak hips or tight quads or hamstrings—is also crucial. “It’s difficult to treat the knee, for example, without addressing those related factors,” Dr. Visco notes.
Remember, most joint sounds are just another quirk of our bodies—usually nothing to worry about. But keep an eye on any changes, especially if they come with other symptoms, like chronic inflammation or pain.
For more stubborn cases, where clicking or grinding is caused by osteoarthritis, Dr. Visco mentions that treatments like hyaluronic acid or platelet-rich plasma injections might be considered after consulting with a sports medicine specialist. However, he also emphasizes that “pain-free clicking or grinding rarely needs any intervention with a needle.”

Medical Experts Explain What May Be Causing Your ‘Popping’ Joints
Here's how to tell when it's OK to walk it off or when you should be concerned.

Sometimes, our bodies produce sounds that catch us off guard, leaving us wondering if we should be concerned or simply shrug it off. Knees and elbows, in particular, seem to have a knack for making themselves heard, leading many of us to question whether these popping joints are a sign of trouble.
To get to the bottom of it, we spoke with
Dr. Lauren Lynass
, a physical therapist, and sport medicine specialist
Dr. Christopher J. Visco
to understand what might be causing these noises, whether they’re worth worrying about, and what we can do to manage them.
Dr. Lynass mentions two theories for what might cause clicking or popping in our joints. “The first,
based on research done in 2015
, suggests that the audible popping in joints is the result of the release of gas from the joint fluid, something we term tribonucleation,” she explains. This theory suggests that when you hear that familiar ‘pop,’ it might simply be a gas bubble forming and collapsing within the joint, which is generally harmless.
The other theory is the tissue sliding theory. “Friction is created as tissues move around a joint, which can result in audible popping, clicking, or even a grinding sound,” Dr. Lynass describes, adding that this friction could occur as tendons, ligaments, or other soft tissues shift over bones or other structures within the joint.
Dr. Visco adds an additional angle noting that sometimes these sounds could be linked to more specific tendon or ligament issues. Tendons can develop calcifications, which might produce clicking, grinding, or snapping sounds. “Interestingly, about
20-30% of people have a pain-free calcified tendon
somewhere in their body, which often doesn’t require treatment unless it becomes painful or interferes with function,” Dr. Visco explains.

Should You Get Your Joints Checked Out?
According to Dr. Lynass, if there’s no pain, the answer is generally, no. Certain activities, such as bending the knee, rotating the shoulder, or extending the elbow involve complex interactions between bones, muscles, and connective tissues, which is when we usually hear those sounds, but it’s OK. “It’s normal for our bodies to make noises, and as long as these noises are not associated with consistent pain, feelings of instability or any notable catching, you are good to go,” she reassures. In other words, a little snap, crackle, or pop now and then is often just part of being human.
However, if those symptoms progress, and you begin to experience pain, instability, or catching, it’s a different story. “Symptoms could possibly worsen, and if they do, it’s important to consult with a trusted medical provider,” Lynass says.
Visco adds that if there’s pain, the clicking may be doing additional damage. Also, it’s worth getting it checked out if there’s swelling, redness, or warmth, or you notice any limitation in range of motion or function.
He underscores that some sounds could indicate more serious underlying issues. “Inflammatory joint diseases, like psoriatic arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, and synovitis, can also be a root cause. “Osteoarthritis, which many think of as inflammation but is a much more complicated joint degeneration process, where the normal smooth cartilage surface develops fissures and the thickness of the hyaline cartilage wears down, that can often cause a grinding sensation,” he explains, adding “I would say ‘arthritis,’ aka osteoarthritis, is the most common thing people think is going on when they have some grinding.”
As we age the chance of getting some arthritis affecting a joint, particularly the knee goes up, according to Visco. “If someone has ever had an injury, such as an ACL tear in the knee, the change of getting arthritis goes up quite a bit,” he notes.

How to Manage Popping Joints
“Continue to move your body,” advises Dr. Lynass. With extended sitting now being considered a health risk, lack of movement can take a toll on many bodily systems, and joints are no exception. “We experience increased pressure and friction in a joint when we are static for too long,” Dr. Lynass explains, adding that regular physical activity can help alleviate these symptoms.
Incorporate a variety of movements throughout your day—whether it’s stretching, walking, or gentle exercise. These can help lubricate the joints, reduce friction, and keep the muscles around them strong.
Dr. Visco echoes this advice, stressing the importance of maintaining range of motion and strength in the muscles around the joint to manage tendon or joint-related pain. “If there’s any acute inflammation, like warmth or swelling, then rest and ice are great starting points,” he says. While he tends to avoid recommending NSAIDs for most patients, he suggests that persistent pain requiring frequent use of ibuprofen or naproxen should be checked by a healthcare provider.
In addition to movement, Dr. Visco suggests exploring other modalities for managing those clicks, grinds, and pops. “Heat and red light therapy could be helpful for soft tissue tightness around superficial tendons, which might be causing clicking,” he says. Addressing any underlying issues, such as muscle imbalances or tightness in the kinetic chain—like weak hips or tight quads or hamstrings—is also crucial. “It’s difficult to treat the knee, for example, without addressing those related factors,” Dr. Visco notes.
Remember, most joint sounds are just another quirk of our bodies—usually nothing to worry about. But keep an eye on any changes, especially if they come with other symptoms, like chronic inflammation or pain.
For more stubborn cases, where clicking or grinding is caused by osteoarthritis, Dr. Visco mentions that treatments like hyaluronic acid or platelet-rich plasma injections might be considered after consulting with a sports medicine specialist. However, he also emphasizes that “pain-free clicking or grinding rarely needs any intervention with a needle.”

Here’s Why Foot Strength Shouldn’t Be Neglected from Your Training
Working on foot strength and stability can help maintain total-body health.

In the midst of America’s wellness revolution, with boutique gyms popping up on every corner and smart wearables tracking our every move, there’s a fitness foundation being neglected: foot health. As we lift more weight and clock more miles onto our bodies, it’s time to zoom in on the underrated elements of our health.
Picture this: 26 bones, 33 joints, and a network of over 100 muscles, tendons, and ligaments, all working in unison to support, move, and propel your body forward. Sounds like a major muscle group that deserves its own training day split. Except, it’s not your back, biceps, or quads—it’s your foot!
When’s the last time you prepared a
foot day workout
? Probably never. And that may be a problem, maybe not today but over the long term of your training. Your foot is  not just the foundation of your physical frame; it’s the unsung hero of your fitness journey, taking the brunt of every step, jump, and sprint.
But here’s the kicker (get it?): While we’re all in on
getting that six-pack
or shaving seconds off our run time, foot health is often left in the dust.
Let’s get real: Ignoring foot health can throw a wrench in your fitness goals, leading to a cascade of issues like plantar fasciitis, bunions, stress fractures, and the dreaded chronic pain. And it’s not just about the pain; it’s about performance. Ever tried hitting a new PR with a foot that feels like it’s being stabbed? Trust me, you don’t want to. However, no one HAS to train feeling that way.

Common Causes of  Poor Foot Health and Ankle Issues?
Common ways people develop foot and ankle issues include overuse and repetitive stress, wearing improper footwear, and experiencing accidents or injuries. Being overweight, aging, and underlying medical conditions like diabetes or arthritis also contribute to these problems. Lack of exercise, poor posture and biomechanics, and standing for extended periods, especially on hard surfaces, can also lead to foot and ankle discomfort and injury. Addressing these factors with appropriate footwear, weight management, and proper training can help in preventing such issues.
It could simply be your shoes causing the problems. Let’s be honest: When was the last time you actually went to a shoe store to try on a pair of this season’s latest and greatest name-brand cross training shoe? Chances are you ordered online—and perhaps ordered the wrong size. Or perhaps you ordered a shoe that’s overly cushioned and restrictive ,which may alter your form and lead to damaging impact forces that your body is not prepared to handle.
And let’s face it, some kicks are more about looks than function. Add to that the high-impact demands of modern workouts combined with a mostly sedentary lifestyle, and you’ve got a recipe for foot disaster.
But, here’s the good news: It’s never too late to begin prioritizing foot health. Adding some foot love to your routine can catapult your fitness game to new heights. Imagine running faster, lifting heavier, and moving better—without the aches and pains when you step out of bed in the morning—all because your feet are finally getting the attention they deserve. It’s about going back to basics with footwear that lets your feet do their thing, sprinkling in some foot-centric exercises, and, yes, actually listening to the pros like podiatrists, foot specialists, even
barefoot coaches
and functional foot doctors who know what’s up.
It’s All In the Shoes—or at Least Some of It
These foot wizards can guide you through the maze of proper shoe selection, analyze your gait, and tailor a plan to keep those foot woes at bay. Regular foot checkups? They’re like oil changes for your car but for your body’s ultimate performance machine: your feet.
The
sensory receptors in our feet play a crucial role
in connecting our physical movements to our brain, acting as critical conduits for information between our body and mind. These receptors are responsible for detecting changes in pressure, texture, and temperature, providing real-time feedback to our brain to adjust our balance, posture, and gait accordingly. This sensory feedback loop enhances our spatial awareness, coordination, and overall cognitive function.
When we pay attention to foot health and engage in activities that stimulate these receptors, such as walking barefoot on different textures or practicing balance exercises, we’re not just benefiting our physical form. We’re also sharpening our mental acuity. The foot-brain connection underscores the profound interplay between our sensory experiences and cognitive processes, highlighting the importance of foot health not only for our physical wellness but for maintaining and improving neural pathways and mental function.
So, what does this all mean for your performance? Prioritizing foot health boosts overall performance by improving balance and stability, reducing injury risk, ensuring better body alignment and posture, and enhancing endurance and strength. Healthy feet provide a strong foundation for efficient movement and physical activity, leading to improved athletic and daily performance with fewer interruptions from foot-related issues.
And to take things a step further, the benefits of a strong, pain-free foundation improves posture and body alignment, which in turn, can boost confidence and mental clarity. The psychological lift from overcoming foot-related issues and achieving fitness goals cannot be overstated. In essence, by nurturing our foot health, we’re not only setting the stage for a more active, pain-free life but also paving the way for sharper mental function and a more positive outlook on life. This holistic approach underscores the intricate link between physical wellness and mental agility, spotlighting foot health as a key player in the quest for a balanced and fulfilling lifestyle.
So, as we ride the wave of America’s fitness boom, let’s not forget the foundation of it all. Our feet aren’t just along for the ride; they’re leading the charge. By elevating foot health from an afterthought to a key player in our fitness regimen, we’re not just sidestepping injuries; we’re stepping into a realm of unmatched physical potential. Let’s give our feet the standing ovation they deserve and unlock the door to peak performance and a life in motion. Your fitness journey starts with a single step – make sure it’s a healthy one.

In the midst of America’s wellness revolution, with boutique gyms popping up on every corner and smart wearables tracking our every move, there’s a fitness foundation being neglected: foot health. As we lift more weight and clock more miles onto our bodies, it’s time to zoom in on the underrated elements of our health.
Picture this: 26 bones, 33 joints, and a network of over 100 muscles, tendons, and ligaments, all working in unison to support, move, and propel your body forward. Sounds like a major muscle group that deserves its own training day split. Except, it’s not your back, biceps, or quads—it’s your foot!
When’s the last time you prepared a
foot day workout
? Probably never. And that may be a problem, maybe not today but over the long term of your training. Your foot is  not just the foundation of your physical frame; it’s the unsung hero of your fitness journey, taking the brunt of every step, jump, and sprint.
But here’s the kicker (get it?): While we’re all in on
getting that six-pack
or shaving seconds off our run time, foot health is often left in the dust.
Let’s get real: Ignoring foot health can throw a wrench in your fitness goals, leading to a cascade of issues like plantar fasciitis, bunions, stress fractures, and the dreaded chronic pain. And it’s not just about the pain; it’s about performance. Ever tried hitting a new PR with a foot that feels like it’s being stabbed? Trust me, you don’t want to. However, no one HAS to train feeling that way.
PeopleImages.com – Yuri A
Common Causes of  Poor Foot Health and Ankle Issues?
Common ways people develop foot and ankle issues include overuse and repetitive stress, wearing improper footwear, and experiencing accidents or injuries. Being overweight, aging, and underlying medical conditions like diabetes or arthritis also contribute to these problems. Lack of exercise, poor posture and biomechanics, and standing for extended periods, especially on hard surfaces, can also lead to foot and ankle discomfort and injury. Addressing these factors with appropriate footwear, weight management, and proper training can help in preventing such issues.
It could simply be your shoes causing the problems. Let’s be honest: When was the last time you actually went to a shoe store to try on a pair of this season’s latest and greatest name-brand cross training shoe? Chances are you ordered online—and perhaps ordered the wrong size. Or perhaps you ordered a shoe that’s overly cushioned and restrictive ,which may alter your form and lead to damaging impact forces that your body is not prepared to handle.
And let’s face it, some kicks are more about looks than function. Add to that the high-impact demands of modern workouts combined with a mostly sedentary lifestyle, and you’ve got a recipe for foot disaster.
But, here’s the good news: It’s never too late to begin prioritizing foot health. Adding some foot love to your routine can catapult your fitness game to new heights. Imagine running faster, lifting heavier, and moving better—without the aches and pains when you step out of bed in the morning—all because your feet are finally getting the attention they deserve. It’s about going back to basics with footwear that lets your feet do their thing, sprinkling in some foot-centric exercises, and, yes, actually listening to the pros like podiatrists, foot specialists, even
barefoot coaches
and functional foot doctors who know what’s up.
It’s All In the Shoes—or at Least Some of It
These foot wizards can guide you through the maze of proper shoe selection, analyze your gait, and tailor a plan to keep those foot woes at bay. Regular foot checkups? They’re like oil changes for your car but for your body’s ultimate performance machine: your feet.
The
sensory receptors in our feet play a crucial role
in connecting our physical movements to our brain, acting as critical conduits for information between our body and mind. These receptors are responsible for detecting changes in pressure, texture, and temperature, providing real-time feedback to our brain to adjust our balance, posture, and gait accordingly. This sensory feedback loop enhances our spatial awareness, coordination, and overall cognitive function.
When we pay attention to foot health and engage in activities that stimulate these receptors, such as walking barefoot on different textures or practicing balance exercises, we’re not just benefiting our physical form. We’re also sharpening our mental acuity. The foot-brain connection underscores the profound interplay between our sensory experiences and cognitive processes, highlighting the importance of foot health not only for our physical wellness but for maintaining and improving neural pathways and mental function.
So, what does this all mean for your performance? Prioritizing foot health boosts overall performance by improving balance and stability, reducing injury risk, ensuring better body alignment and posture, and enhancing endurance and strength. Healthy feet provide a strong foundation for efficient movement and physical activity, leading to improved athletic and daily performance with fewer interruptions from foot-related issues.
And to take things a step further, the benefits of a strong, pain-free foundation improves posture and body alignment, which in turn, can boost confidence and mental clarity. The psychological lift from overcoming foot-related issues and achieving fitness goals cannot be overstated. In essence, by nurturing our foot health, we’re not only setting the stage for a more active, pain-free life but also paving the way for sharper mental function and a more positive outlook on life. This holistic approach underscores the intricate link between physical wellness and mental agility, spotlighting foot health as a key player in the quest for a balanced and fulfilling lifestyle.
So, as we ride the wave of America’s fitness boom, let’s not forget the foundation of it all. Our feet aren’t just along for the ride; they’re leading the charge. By elevating foot health from an afterthought to a key player in our fitness regimen, we’re not just sidestepping injuries; we’re stepping into a realm of unmatched physical potential. Let’s give our feet the standing ovation they deserve and unlock the door to peak performance and a life in motion. Your fitness journey starts with a single step – make sure it’s a healthy one.

What are ‘Super Agers’ and How Can You Become One?
According to science, aging better is all about staying motivated.

You’ve probably already noticed that age really is just a number, but while it’s simply not possible to permanently hold back the hands of time, we can all observe that some
people age better than others
. According to recent research, sticking it to Father Time is all about motivation when it comes to feeling mentally and physically younger.
M&F
takes a closer look at the science behind super agers.
Super Agers are people over 80 that have either the physical or memory ability of a person that is 20 to 30 years younger. It is, of course, “normal” for us to suffer mental and physical decline as we age. For one thing, both our muscle and brain mass tends to decrease as we get older, but
a study carried out more than a decade ago
established that Super Agers are a genuine phenomenon, and that people who were found to be in the better mental bracket had a thicker cerebral cortex than their same age peers.
Then, there are physical signs of Super Aging too. In 2015, athletes in the
Norwegian Senior National Games
had an average age of 68, but their collective estimated biological age came in at just 43. Among other signs such as increased muscle mass, physical Super Agers display better VO2 max scores, displaying greater fitness levels. It seems then, if you want to become a Super Ager, now is always the best time to start.

A post shared by Joan MacDonald (@trainwithjoan)
How to Become a Well-rounded Super Ager
Motivating yourself by constantly being challenged is the key to being a well-rounded Super Ager. On the mental side of things, always seek to train your brain. “We found that SuperAgers not only perform similarly to young adults on memory testing, they also do not show the typical patterns of brain atrophy in certain regions,” explains
a 2016 study
, leading many people to suggest that keeping the brain active is a great way to hold off its decline. While influential factors such as genetics and other biological markers are still being studied in terms of predicting Super Agers, it is thought that it’s very much a case of “use or lose it” as relates to maximizing our health as we age.
The difficulty though, is that challenging ourselves as we age is often more difficult than we might think. One theory is that as we get older, we develop a “positivity effect” that tends grow as we mature. Being young is about taking risks and experimenting, whereas getting older is often though of as a time for winding down and doing less risky things, keeping us in an effortlessly positive state.
This is why pushing yourself out of your comfort zone, at any age, is so important, unless you just want to sit in a chair and lose all of your powers. Find a mental pastime that works for you. If you don’t like word games, try numbers, or test your memory, just make sure you stay mentally active. Remember; If you don’t use it, you may lose it.
Super Agers Can Be Better in Pairs
Want to improve you mental capacity but don’t like playing games alone? No worries! Find a partner to play chess or cards with.
Social networks have been shown
to help us age better too!  The need to push yourself is just as essential for becoming a physical Super Ager, and the good news is that you don’t have to bungee off the side of a cliff to get your heart rate up. Try walking or jogging instead, and continue to challenge your limits in a way that suits you. Hate running? Try lifting weights! But always stay motivated to improve your mortality. You can’t control your genetics, but you can find longevity through staying sharp.

What are ‘Super Agers’ and How Can You Become One?
According to science, aging better is all about staying motivated.

You’ve probably already noticed that age really is just a number, but while it’s simply not possible to permanently hold back the hands of time, we can all observe that some
people age better than others
. According to recent research, sticking it to Father Time is all about motivation when it comes to feeling mentally and physically younger.
M&F
takes a closer look at the science behind super agers.
Super Agers are people over 80 that have either the physical or memory ability of a person that is 20 to 30 years younger. It is, of course, “normal” for us to suffer mental and physical decline as we age. For one thing, both our muscle and brain mass tends to decrease as we get older, but
a study carried out more than a decade ago
established that Super Agers are a genuine phenomenon, and that people who were found to be in the better mental bracket had a thicker cerebral cortex than their same age peers.
Then, there are physical signs of Super Aging too. In 2015, athletes in the
Norwegian Senior National Games
had an average age of 68, but their collective estimated biological age came in at just 43. Among other signs such as increased muscle mass, physical Super Agers display better VO2 max scores, displaying greater fitness levels. It seems then, if you want to become a Super Ager, now is always the best time to start.

A post shared by Joan MacDonald (@trainwithjoan)
How to Become a Well-rounded Super Ager
Motivating yourself by constantly being challenged is the key to being a well-rounded Super Ager. On the mental side of things, always seek to train your brain. “We found that SuperAgers not only perform similarly to young adults on memory testing, they also do not show the typical patterns of brain atrophy in certain regions,” explains
a 2016 study
, leading many people to suggest that keeping the brain active is a great way to hold off its decline. While influential factors such as genetics and other biological markers are still being studied in terms of predicting Super Agers, it is thought that it’s very much a case of “use or lose it” as relates to maximizing our health as we age.
The difficulty though, is that challenging ourselves as we age is often more difficult than we might think. One theory is that as we get older, we develop a “positivity effect” that tends grow as we mature. Being young is about taking risks and experimenting, whereas getting older is often though of as a time for winding down and doing less risky things, keeping us in an effortlessly positive state.
This is why pushing yourself out of your comfort zone, at any age, is so important, unless you just want to sit in a chair and lose all of your powers. Find a mental pastime that works for you. If you don’t like word games, try numbers, or test your memory, just make sure you stay mentally active. Remember; If you don’t use it, you may lose it.
Super Agers Can Be Better in Pairs
Want to improve you mental capacity but don’t like playing games alone? No worries! Find a partner to play chess or cards with.
Social networks have been shown
to help us age better too!  The need to push yourself is just as essential for becoming a physical Super Ager, and the good news is that you don’t have to bungee off the side of a cliff to get your heart rate up. Try walking or jogging instead, and continue to challenge your limits in a way that suits you. Hate running? Try lifting weights! But always stay motivated to improve your mortality. You can’t control your genetics, but you can find longevity through staying sharp.

With a seemingly ever-increasing inventory of new equipment entering our gyms, it’s important to note that some of the more traditional exercises are still epic when it comes to making gains. A perfect example is the humble calf raise machine, and there’s no bigger fan than Samson Dauda.
Taking to Instagram
, Dauda recently demonstrated the tired and tested move as he readies himself for the 2025 Arnold Classic. Having won $600,000 for taking the Olympia title home last year, “The Nigerian Lion,” now has his sights firmly set on the $500,000 prize money that goes to the victor in Columbus, Ohio. “No muscle group left behind,” wrote Dauda in a post for his almost 1.5 million IG followers.

A post shared by Samson Dauda (@samson__dauda)
Samson Dauda Executes Standing Calf Raises Ahead of the 2025 Arnold Classic
Dauda took his first Olympia trophy in 2024
after presenting the full package of muscle, definition, and symmetry, and by the looks of his calves, no stone is being left unturned in the pursuit of perfection.
By performing the standing calf raise, you will activate two muscles at the rear of the lower leg (the gastrocnemious and the soleus muscles). Calf raises are also great because they are low impact and will improve strength and flexibility in each calf while helping to build muscle mass at the same time. “Every body part get its own full attention,” said Dauda of his detailed approach. “That’s how you grow symmetrically.”
To try it for yourself, replicate Dauda’s technique and hold the position for around a second at the top of the lift for increased time under tension. For hypotrophy, aim for 3 sets of 12 reps, working with a weight that will bring you to failure, or close to failure with each set.

With a seemingly ever-increasing inventory of new equipment entering our gyms, it’s important to note that some of the more traditional exercises are still epic when it comes to making gains. A perfect example is the humble calf raise machine, and there’s no bigger fan than Samson Dauda.
Taking to Instagram
, Dauda recently demonstrated the tired and tested move as he readies himself for the 2025 Arnold Classic. Having won $600,000 for taking the Olympia title home last year, “The Nigerian Lion,” now has his sights firmly set on the $500,000 prize money that goes to the victor in Columbus, Ohio. “No muscle group left behind,” wrote Dauda in a post for his almost 1.5 million IG followers.

A post shared by Samson Dauda (@samson__dauda)
Samson Dauda Executes Standing Calf Raises Ahead of the 2025 Arnold Classic
Dauda took his first Olympia trophy in 2024
after presenting the full package of muscle, definition, and symmetry, and by the looks of his calves, no stone is being left unturned in the pursuit of perfection.
By performing the standing calf raise, you will activate two muscles at the rear of the lower leg (the gastrocnemious and the soleus muscles). Calf raises are also great because they are low impact and will improve strength and flexibility in each calf while helping to build muscle mass at the same time. “Every body part get its own full attention,” said Dauda of his detailed approach. “That’s how you grow symmetrically.”
To try it for yourself, replicate Dauda’s technique and hold the position for around a second at the top of the lift for increased time under tension. For hypotrophy, aim for 3 sets of 12 reps, working with a weight that will bring you to failure, or close to failure with each set.

Just a few weeks out from one of bodybuilding’s biggest annual shows, the guests joining Dennis James on “The Menace Podcast” have cast their votes on who will place in the top 6 — and a clear favorite is emerging.
James, who has competed in an astonishing 11 Mr. Olympia contests was joined by Milos Sarcev, Chris Cormier, and
British bodybuilder “The Big Dea” on Jan. 24, 2025 (Episode 216)
as they covered a range of bodybuilding’s latest developments. Top of the list was the panels evolving picks for who will walk out of the Arnold Classic 2025 with the winner’s trophy, and a cool half-a-million dollars.
Here’s how the actual placings panned out last year:
Arnold Classic 2024 results
1) Hadi Choopan
2) Samson Dauda
3) Rafael Brandao
4) Jonathan Delerosa
5) James Hollingshead
6) Akim Williams
And these were the panel’s latest picks for this year:
Chris Cormier’s Arnold Classic 2025 picks
1) Derek Lunsford
2) Samson Dauda
3) Andrew Jacked
4) Shaun Clarida
5) Carlos Thomas Jr
6) Brandon Curry
Milos Sarcev’s Arnold Classic 2025 picks
1) Samson Dauda
2) Andrew Jacked
3) Derek Lunsford
4) Shaun Clarida
5) Brandon Curry
6) William Bonac
Big Dea’s Arnold 2025 picks
1) Samson Dauda
2) Andrew Jacked
3) Derek Lunsford
4) Carlos Thomas Jr
5) Shaun Clarida
6) Brandon Curry
Dennis James Arnold 2025 picks
1) Samson Dauda
2) Andrew Jacked
3) Derek Lunsford
4) Brandon Curry
5) Shaun Clarida
6) Carlos Thomas Jr or William Bonac
With three out of the four votes placing him first at the Arnold 2025, Samson Dauda has unsurprisingly emerged as the clear favorite. “Samson is coming off the Olympia, I think he’s on a role,” explains James of his choice. “I think he will do what Mr Olympia is supposed to do. Come back and win.”
The guys also predicted big things for Andrew Jacked after a disappointing Olympia appearance last year, and a potential surprise from Brandon Curry who is looking huge right now, but James feared that there may be “too many cooks” in Derek Lunsford camp as of late, so it will be interesting to see which version of himself arrives in Columbus, Ohio.

Just a few weeks out from one of bodybuilding’s biggest annual shows, the guests joining Dennis James on “The Menace Podcast” have cast their votes on who will place in the top 6 — and a clear favorite is emerging.
James, who has competed in an astonishing 11 Mr. Olympia contests was joined by Milos Sarcev, Chris Cormier, and
British bodybuilder “The Big Dea” on Jan. 24, 2025 (Episode 216)
as they covered a range of bodybuilding’s latest developments. Top of the list was the panels evolving picks for who will walk out of the Arnold Classic 2025 with the winner’s trophy, and a cool half-a-million dollars.
Here’s how the actual placings panned out last year:
Arnold Classic 2024 results
1) Hadi Choopan
2) Samson Dauda
3) Rafael Brandao
4) Jonathan Delerosa
5) James Hollingshead
6) Akim Williams
And these were the panel’s latest picks for this year:
Chris Cormier’s Arnold Classic 2025 picks
1) Derek Lunsford
2) Samson Dauda
3) Andrew Jacked
4) Shaun Clarida
5) Carlos Thomas Jr
6) Brandon Curry
Milos Sarcev’s Arnold Classic 2025 picks
1) Samson Dauda
2) Andrew Jacked
3) Derek Lunsford
4) Shaun Clarida
5) Brandon Curry
6) William Bonac
Big Dea’s Arnold 2025 picks
1) Samson Dauda
2) Andrew Jacked
3) Derek Lunsford
4) Carlos Thomas Jr
5) Shaun Clarida
6) Brandon Curry
Dennis James Arnold 2025 picks
1) Samson Dauda
2) Andrew Jacked
3) Derek Lunsford
4) Brandon Curry
5) Shaun Clarida
6) Carlos Thomas Jr or William Bonac
With three out of the four votes placing him first at the Arnold 2025, Samson Dauda has unsurprisingly emerged as the clear favorite. “Samson is coming off the Olympia, I think he’s on a role,” explains James of his choice. “I think he will do what Mr Olympia is supposed to do. Come back and win.”
The guys also predicted big things for Andrew Jacked after a disappointing Olympia appearance last year, and a potential surprise from Brandon Curry who is looking huge right now, but James feared that there may be “too many cooks” in Derek Lunsford camp as of late, so it will be interesting to see which version of himself arrives in Columbus, Ohio.

The defined Dutchman, Wesley Vissers, won first place at the 2024 Arnold Classic, and already
has his sights set on Olympia gold in 2025
. Boiling over with enthusiasm, he has now taken to social media in order to share his Wesley Vissers Olympia Rule Change suggestion for the Olympia and other major bodybuilding competitions.
“Who else thinks the side tricep pose should be mandatory in classic?” asked Vissers of his one-million-plus Instagram followers on Jan 25. In the post, Vissers can be seen breaking out the aforementioned side triceps pose, while revealing huge arms that closely resemble twisted steel. By perfecting the pose, he had his followers impressed, but it’s not obligatory at the Olympia or other classic division shows.

A post shared by Wesley Vissers (@wesleyvissers)
Making Sense of the ‘Wesley Vissers Olympia Rule Change’
As of now, the mandatory poses in the Classic Division consist of:
Front Double Biceps
Side Chest
Back Double Biceps
Abdominal and Thighs
Favorite Classic Pose (a variation on the above)
While the side triceps pose is not mandatory in classic physique, judges may still call for it, so it makes sense to be like Vissers and practice it for good measure. Still, despite his success at the Arnold, the big man placed a disappointing eighth place at last year’s Olympia But with Chris Bumstead lifting what may prove to be his sixth and final trophy at the event, before hanging up the lifting straps, there’s everything to fight for. “Amazing physique,” wrote one fan. “Classic lines!” commented another.
When it came to the Wesley Vissers Olympia rule change suggestion, other fans felt that there was another way for the athlete to deliver it as a mandatory pose. “I think you should just compete in the open,” wrote one follower. “Just do open?” echoed another. Of course, Vissers’ suggestion was largely made as a bit of fun to accompany his tremendous triceps pics but never say never in the world of bodybuilding.
One thing is for sure: This will be a pivotal year for the Dutchman.

The defined Dutchman, Wesley Vissers, won first place at the 2024 Arnold Classic, and already
has his sights set on Olympia gold in 2025
. Boiling over with enthusiasm, he has now taken to social media in order to share his Wesley Vissers Olympia Rule Change suggestion for the Olympia and other major bodybuilding competitions.
“Who else thinks the side tricep pose should be mandatory in classic?” asked Vissers of his one-million-plus Instagram followers on Jan 25. In the post, Vissers can be seen breaking out the aforementioned side triceps pose, while revealing huge arms that closely resemble twisted steel. By perfecting the pose, he had his followers impressed, but it’s not obligatory at the Olympia or other classic division shows.

Making Sense of the ‘Wesley Vissers Olympia Rule Change’
As of now, the mandatory poses in the Classic Division consist of:
Front Double Biceps
Side Chest
Back Double Biceps
Abdominal and Thighs
Favorite Classic Pose (a variation on the above)
While the side triceps pose is not mandatory in classic physique, judges may still call for it, so it makes sense to be like Vissers and practice it for good measure. Still, despite his success at the Arnold, the big man placed a disappointing eighth place at last year’s Olympia But with Chris Bumstead lifting what may prove to be his sixth and final trophy at the event, before hanging up the lifting straps, there’s everything to fight for. “Amazing physique,” wrote one fan. “Classic lines!” commented another.
When it came to the Wesley Vissers Olympia rule change suggestion, other fans felt that there was another way for the athlete to deliver it as a mandatory pose. “I think you should just compete in the open,” wrote one follower. “Just do open?” echoed another. Of course, Vissers’ suggestion was largely made as a bit of fun to accompany his tremendous triceps pics but never say never in the world of bodybuilding.
One thing is for sure: This will be a pivotal year for the Dutchman.

Let’s be honest, for most guys, one of the main reasons to get a pump going at the gym is to
build sleeve busting biceps
that Olympia champions like Jay Cutler have amassed. Fortunately, the man himself is always giving when it comes to passing down the moves that work best for him, and in this case, it seems that there’s one awesome arm exercise that is at the top of his list.
While the regular dumbbell bicep curl is one of the most repeated exercises in the free weight area of your local gym, there are other ways and means to win at building brilliant biceps
explained the four-time Mr Olympia kingpin in a recent Instagram demonstration
. “We’re gonna focus on the cambered bar curl,” Cutler schooled his 5.5 million followers.
Why Use a Cambered Bar for Bicep Curls?
Cutler’s cambered bar of choice here is also known as an EZ-curl bar. Not only do
some studies show that using a bar activates the biceps better than dumbbells
, but many people find the shape more accessible for their grip, requiring less rotation in the wrist and avoiding potential strains while upping the loading potential.

A post shared by Jay Cutler (@jaycutler)
Jay Cutler Demonstrates Cable Bicep Curls with a Cambered Bar
“Now, what I love about the cables is that constant tension,” explained Cutler. “So, what I like to do is get that nice stretch.” The bodybuilding legend says that the tension from lowering the weighted plates on a cable machine is more constant than the sudden drop you get from a falling dumbbell. “We’re still gonna focus on 10 or 12 repetitions,” he said. “Really getting that contraction, and not necessarily powering or cheating through the movements.”
Cutler says that another advantage of cable curls is that you are more locked to the ground, leading to better form. “Now, with the free weights I tend to move a little but more of my body whereas (with) the cables I’m a little more stationary,” he explained. “This is more of a concentrated movement, contractive, and really, really good for you guys looking for that crazy pump.”
Cutler begins his demo by picking up the bar to around waist-height and then leans a little backwards so that his chest is further away from the cable station than his feet. The big man then keeps his legs and torso as still as possible while lifting the bar and curling his arms until his hands reach head height.
Note that Cutler maintains a controlled and consistent speed as he focuses on the movement and slows it down for that all-important time under tension. “Hitting these curls with the cables as opposed to free weights is gonna help with keeping the tension throughout the full range of motion,” he explained. “And make(s) is more difficult to let momentum do any of the work! Give these a try next time you’re hitting biceps!”

“Now, what I love about the cables is that constant tension,” explained Cutler. “So, what I like to do is get that nice stretch.” The bodybuilding legend says that the tension from lowering the weighted plates on a cable machine is more constant than the sudden drop you get from a falling dumbbell. “We’re still gonna focus on 10 or 12 repetitions,” he said. “Really getting that contraction, and not necessarily powering or cheating through the movements.”
Cutler says that another advantage of cable curls is that you are more locked to the ground, leading to better form. “Now, with the free weights I tend to move a little but more of my body whereas (with) the cables I’m a little more stationary,” he explained. “This is more of a concentrated movement, contractive, and really, really good for you guys looking for that crazy pump.”
Cutler begins his demo by picking up the bar to around waist-height and then leans a little backwards so that his chest is further away from the cable station than his feet. The big man then keeps his legs and torso as still as possible while lifting the bar and curling his arms until his hands reach head height.
Note that Cutler maintains a controlled and consistent speed as he focuses on the movement and slows it down for that all-important time under tension. “Hitting these curls with the cables as opposed to free weights is gonna help with keeping the tension throughout the full range of motion,” he explained. “And make(s) is more difficult to let momentum do any of the work! Give these a try next time you’re hitting biceps!”

If you’ve seen recent images of Jennifer Aniston looking fitter than ever at 55-years-young, then you may be wondering how the popular Hollywood star maintains her ageless beauty. Apparently, it’s all about “breaking a sweat without breaking your body,” explains her coach,
Dani Coleman
, talking exclusively to
M&F.
Dani Coleman is a seasoned dancer and has suffered unavoidable wear and tear due to the high impact nature of her favored art. The coach tells M&F that she first began her fitness journey as a way to stay in shape — without grinding herself into the ground. “Dance gave me my love of movement, while fitness gave me the ability to share that passion with people on a larger scale,” she explains.
It was Coleman’s burgeoning career as a fitness professional led her to join
Pvolve
in 2020 — an organization that teaches
functional methods for staying in shape
both in studio and online. When Jennifer Aniston was encouraged by a friend to try it out for herself, the two would forge a relationship based on trust, and a ton of sweat.
“I’ll never forget our first session,” shares Coleman. “We did a full-body workout using our p.band, p.ball, and gliders.” For the uninitiated, these are some of the patented accessories used in Pvolve’s varied classes. “Jen loves a challenging workout, and our sessions help you break a sweat without breaking your body,” explains Coleman. “No two workouts are ever the same, and I love programming her workouts using our unique resistance equipment to keep her on her toes, and to help meet her body where it’s at on a particular day.”
Jennifer Aniston’s Self-Care Routine
Of course, before even getting into the specific movements that Jennifer Aniston incorporates into her workouts, there will be those that say she has all the money and time in the world to invest in her physique. But really that’s just a cop-out mostly uttered by those who want to justify staying on the couch.
“What I love about working out is that no one can do it for you,” says Coleman. “You have to show up for yourself and do the work for yourself. When it comes to getting started, it’s about prioritizing your time and finding a workout that you actually enjoy and will commit to. Start small with 10 to15 minute workouts, three times a week, to help build consistency and then scale from there. Also,
find more ways to incorporate movement into your day-to-day
, like stretching during your favorite show, or taking your phone call on a walk. Movement doesn’t have to be done in a gym setting to count.”
Coleman details some of the easy tasks that can bring quick wins. These are the same methods practiced by Aniston and her other clients without even entering a gym.
Drink water and focus on hydration
Get enough sleep
Be mindful of posture, especially if on a computer all day
Take short walks

Exercises Jennifer Aniston Uses For A Super Star Body
Once you begin to see those big results by making small changes, it’s game on! Aniston never allows herself a chance to become bored, so her workouts rotate to keep her body guessing. Coleman explains that Pvolve’s classes include sessions such as ‘Strength & Sculpt’, ‘Sculpt & Burn’, and progressive weight training. “We train your core 360-degrees,” enthuses the coach. Not only does Aniston stick to the plan, but she’s even helped design her own workout sessions called ‘Strength Redefined.’ If you want to follow her path to fitness, then these are some exercises you can try:
Plank variations
Resistance band work
Dumbbell lunges
Weighted stretches
Cardio – moving your body while staying on a mat
These movements don’t have to be done via the Pvolve platform, but many people find that this type of group fitness class, either online or in person, keeps them coming back for more says Coleman. In fact,
studies have shown the benefits of group fitness
compared to individual workouts, those who worked out in groups felt more “intrinsically motivated to engage in high intensity-exercises.”
Jennifer Aniston is Highly Invested in Her Health
For a Hollywood A-Lister like Aniston, aesthetics is everything in the competitive world of showbiz, but her sweat equity is resulting in more than an epic resume. “The results go far beyond aesthetics,” says Coleman.
For women, working out as they mature can also alleviate the symptoms of menopause.
One study has concluded
that “Sedentary women should consider modification of their lifestyle to include physical activity as it leads to improvement in their quality of life.” By balancing her hormones via weight training, and building her cardiovascular endurance through moving and stretching, Jennifer Aniston looks set to glow for some time to come. Coach Coleman says that the secret to saying consistent is all about balancing work with fun. “Our sessions are filled with hard work, a good playlist, and a few intermissions to play with the pups!”

It’s that time of the year. What’s next on the agenda for weight loss? Should you still spend hours on the treadmill, or are there more
innovative approaches to conquering your fitness goals
?
When it comes to weight loss in 2025, the old mantra of “eat less, move more” no longer cuts it. Science and experience have shown us there are more creative, effective ways to shed pounds and keep them off—without chaining yourself to the treadmill or starving through crash diets. These aren’t your grandmother’s weight-loss tips; they’re the new rules, rooted in research and practicality, that
focus on building a sustainable, healthier you
.
These are my five key strategies for reimagining weight loss for today’s world. From prioritizing strength training over marathon cardio sessions to leveraging recovery and smarter nutrition, these rules help you work smarter—not harder—on your fitness journey. Whether you’re just starting or looking to fine-tune your approach, these insights will equip you with the tools to lose fat, preserve muscle, and feel your best long-term.
Valerii Apetroaiei
1. Prioritize Strength Training Over Endless Cardio
Why it’s a new rule;
Strength training is the cornerstone of effective weight loss, and it’s time to replace the myth that endless cardio is the answer. Unlike traditional cardio, which can sometimes result in muscle loss, strength training actively supports muscle preservation and growth while boosting your metabolism. As your muscle mass increases, your body burns more calories at rest, setting the stage for sustainable fat loss and a more sculpted physique. By building strength, you’re not just shedding weight; you’re shaping your body for lasting results. Combined with strategically planned cardio, this one-two punch maximizes fat-burning and muscle-building.
How to apply it:
For time-crunched individuals, prioritize full-body workouts 1-2 times a week, focusing on compound lifts like squats, deadlifts, and overhead presses that work multiple muscle groups. If you can train more frequently, incorporate a split routine with a dedicated day for legs, upper body, and core/mobility. A push-pull split is another excellent option: Day 1 could feature bench press and squats, while Day 2 incorporates deadlifts and pullups. Shorten your rest periods between sets (30-60 seconds) to keep your heart rate elevated and maximize calorie burn.
2. Leverage High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT)
Why it’s a new rule:
HIIT training combines the best of both worlds. It’s a time-efficient,
science-backed way
to burn fat and boost cardiovascular fitness. Unlike steady-state cardio, HIIT maximizes calorie burn during and after your workout, thanks to the excess post-exercise oxygen consumption (EPOC) effect. This makes it ideal for those with tight schedules who still want effective fat-loss results.
How to apply it:
Incorporate 20-30 minutes of HIIT into your weekly routine up to three times. A simple approach can be this: Alternate 30 seconds of high-intensity effort with 30 seconds of active recovery. Choose dynamic exercises that challenge your entire body and maintain proper form for the best results. Here are a few quick and easy workouts.
Dumbbell HIIT
6 Rounds: 30 seconds on, 30 seconds off
Dumbbell Thruster
Renegade Rows
Dumbbell Chops
Kettlebell HIIT
8 Rounds: 40 seconds on, 20 seconds off
Kettlebell Swings
Kettlebell Push Press
Plank with Kettlebell Taps
Bodyweight HIIT
Perform as many rounds as possible (AMRAP) in 5 minutes. After each round, take a 2-minute rest before repeating the circuit two more times.
Squat Jumps
(5 reps)
Reverse Lunges
(8 reps each)
Mountain Climbers
(10 reps each)
3. Optimize Non-Exercise Activity Thermogenesis (NEAT)
Why it’s a new rule:
NEAT (Non-Exercise Activity Thermogenesis) refers to the calories burned through everyday movements like walking, standing, and even fidgeting. When you prioritize NEAT, you make the most of every moment to burn calories, whether you’re running errands or working from home. Small, consistent movements throughout the day can make a big difference in overall fat loss, helping you bridge the gap between workouts and achieving your weight-loss goals without needing more intense sessions.
How to apply it:
Set a daily step goal of 8,000 to 10,000 steps and find opportunities to move more throughout the day. Take walking breaks every hour, use a standing desk, or park farther away to add more steps to your routine. If you work at a desk, consider investing in a walking treadmill or taking short walks after meals to boost NEAT. These simple changes can significantly increase your calorie burn and help accelerate your fat-loss progress without adding extra stress to your schedule.

4. Focus on Recovery: Sleep & Stress Management
Why it’s a new rule:
Sleep and
stress management are the new wave
of fitness. These two critical components are pivotal in your body’s ability to burn fat. Chronic stress elevates cortisol levels, encouraging fat retention—especially around the belly. Meanwhile, lack of sleep disrupts the hormones responsible for hunger and satiety, leading to overeating and fat storage. Prioritizing rest and recovery allows your body to repair, rebalance, and regulate the key hormones in fat loss, giving you the edge you need for sustainable progress.
How to apply it: Aim for 7-9 hours of sleep each night to support recovery. Establish a consistent bedtime routine by dimming the lights, avoiding screens, and incorporating relaxation techniques like deep breathing or meditation. For stress management, practice yoga, take outdoor walks, or engage in mindfulness exercises to reduce cortisol levels. In addition to these strategies, using mobile apps designed to manage stress and anxiety can be highly effective.
Apps that guide you through deep breathing, meditation, or mindfulness exercises can help calm your mind, reduce stress, and improve sleep quality. Remember, sleep and stress management are as important as workouts for maximizing fat loss and keeping your body functioning optimally.
5. Fuel for Fat Loss: Smart Nutrition Over Extreme Diets
Why it’s a new rule:
Extreme, restrictive diets might show short-term results, but they’re difficult to maintain and often lead to rebound weight gain. The shift has moved towards sustainable nutrition, focusing on whole, nutrient-dense foods to fuel your body and support fat loss. A well-balanced diet, rich in protein, healthy fats, and complex carbs, promotes muscle maintenance, reduces cravings, and energizes you for workouts. The key is consistency, not deprivation.
How to apply it:
Make protein the foundation of each meal, aiming for 20-30 grams per serving to support muscle repair and satiety. Fill your plate with nutrient-dense vegetables, healthy fats (like olive oil or avocado), and complex carbs (whole grains or starchy vegetables) to fuel your body for fat loss and muscle preservation. The 80/20 rule works well here: focus on eating whole, unprocessed foods 80% of the time, leaving room for occasional indulgences. Meal prepping is a great way to stay on track and ensure you meet your nutritional needs without feeling restricted.

2. Leverage High-Intensity Interval Training (HIIT)
Why it’s a new rule:
HIIT training combines the best of both worlds. It’s a time-efficient,
science-backed way
to burn fat and boost cardiovascular fitness. Unlike steady-state cardio, HIIT maximizes calorie burn during and after your workout, thanks to the excess post-exercise oxygen consumption (EPOC) effect. This makes it ideal for those with tight schedules who still want effective fat-loss results.
How to apply it:
Incorporate 20-30 minutes of HIIT into your weekly routine up to three times. A simple approach can be this: Alternate 30 seconds of high-intensity effort with 30 seconds of active recovery. Choose dynamic exercises that challenge your entire body and maintain proper form for the best results. Here are a few quick and easy workouts.
Dumbbell HIIT
6 Rounds: 30 seconds on, 30 seconds off
Dumbbell Thruster
Renegade Rows
Dumbbell Chops
Kettlebell HIIT
8 Rounds: 40 seconds on, 20 seconds off
Kettlebell Swings
Kettlebell Push Press
Plank with Kettlebell Taps
Bodyweight HIIT
Perform as many rounds as possible (AMRAP) in 5 minutes. After each round, take a 2-minute rest before repeating the circuit two more times.
Squat Jumps
(5 reps)
Reverse Lunges
(8 reps each)
Mountain Climbers
(10 reps each)
3. Optimize Non-Exercise Activity Thermogenesis (NEAT)
Why it’s a new rule:
NEAT (Non-Exercise Activity Thermogenesis) refers to the calories burned through everyday movements like walking, standing, and even fidgeting. When you prioritize NEAT, you make the most of every moment to burn calories, whether you’re running errands or working from home. Small, consistent movements throughout the day can make a big difference in overall fat loss, helping you bridge the gap between workouts and achieving your weight-loss goals without needing more intense sessions.
How to apply it:
Set a daily step goal of 8,000 to 10,000 steps and find opportunities to move more throughout the day. Take walking breaks every hour, use a standing desk, or park farther away to add more steps to your routine. If you work at a desk, consider investing in a walking treadmill or taking short walks after meals to boost NEAT. These simple changes can significantly increase your calorie burn and help accelerate your fat-loss progress without adding extra stress to your schedule.

4. Focus on Recovery: Sleep & Stress Management
Why it’s a new rule:
Sleep and
stress management are the new wave
of fitness. These two critical components are pivotal in your body’s ability to burn fat. Chronic stress elevates cortisol levels, encouraging fat retention—especially around the belly. Meanwhile, lack of sleep disrupts the hormones responsible for hunger and satiety, leading to overeating and fat storage. Prioritizing rest and recovery allows your body to repair, rebalance, and regulate the key hormones in fat loss, giving you the edge you need for sustainable progress.
How to apply it: Aim for 7-9 hours of sleep each night to support recovery. Establish a consistent bedtime routine by dimming the lights, avoiding screens, and incorporating relaxation techniques like deep breathing or meditation. For stress management, practice yoga, take outdoor walks, or engage in mindfulness exercises to reduce cortisol levels. In addition to these strategies, using mobile apps designed to manage stress and anxiety can be highly effective.
Apps that guide you through deep breathing, meditation, or mindfulness exercises can help calm your mind, reduce stress, and improve sleep quality. Remember, sleep and stress management are as important as workouts for maximizing fat loss and keeping your body functioning optimally.
5. Fuel for Fat Loss: Smart Nutrition Over Extreme Diets
Why it’s a new rule:
Extreme, restrictive diets might show short-term results, but they’re difficult to maintain and often lead to rebound weight gain. The shift has moved towards sustainable nutrition, focusing on whole, nutrient-dense foods to fuel your body and support fat loss. A well-balanced diet, rich in protein, healthy fats, and complex carbs, promotes muscle maintenance, reduces cravings, and energizes you for workouts. The key is consistency, not deprivation.
How to apply it:
Make protein the foundation of each meal, aiming for 20-30 grams per serving to support muscle repair and satiety. Fill your plate with nutrient-dense vegetables, healthy fats (like olive oil or avocado), and complex carbs (whole grains or starchy vegetables) to fuel your body for fat loss and muscle preservation. The 80/20 rule works well here: focus on eating whole, unprocessed foods 80% of the time, leaving room for occasional indulgences. Meal prepping is a great way to stay on track and ensure you meet your nutritional needs without feeling restricted.

The holiday season is upon us and for many, thoughts of revealing our shoulders during Christmas social occasions have us wishing we’d tried a bit harder for the past 12 months! Still, if you want to get a perfect pump before putting on that new dress, fear not, because Stephanie Sanzo’s shoulder workout can be done in the busiest of gyms, and you’ll also tax your core for good measure.
Gyms often become less frequented in winter, only to see a spike in December when panic sets in regarding those slinky numbers that were purchased weeks ago, for upcoming Christmas parties (and don’t get us started on January!) If you are in a hurry but want to get your sweat on during a busy gym session, Stephanie Sanzo’s cable shoulder workout could be the gift that keeps on giving. “This was a short but effective workout using the cable machine, targeting the shoulders,” said the fitness instructor and
Instagram star
after demonstrating the details for her 3.5 million Instagram followers. “Great if you’re pressed for time and in a busy gym but still want to get a quick pump done.” Try it for yourself:

Workout Breakdown
Sanzo challenges you to aim for 3 to 4 rounds of this workout, and while you will be seriously working those scapulas, you’ll also be tightening the core and even working the legs as you replicate this fitness coaches perfect posture. There’s a mixture of double and single limb work, meaning you’ll be working on balance in addition to power. “Saved,” wrote multiple IG followers, either hoping to make all the difference at an upcoming gathering, or more realistically hoping to reach their goals in 2025. “Perfect technique, you are my inspiration,” wrote another fan. If 3 to 4 rounds seems too intense for your level of fitness, simply reduce the frequency, but work with a weight that is challenging while maintaining form, and be sure to keep those rest periods limited.
If you stayed to the end Stephanie Sanzo’s workout video, you’ll have seen an adorable doggie make an appearance. Mascots are not obligatory, but gains are guaranteed!

Still, if you want to get a perfect pump before putting on that new dress, fear not, because Stephanie Sanzo’s shoulder workout can be done in the busiest of gyms, and you’ll also tax your core for good measure.
Gyms often become less frequented in winter, only to see a spike in December when panic sets in regarding those slinky numbers that were purchased weeks ago, for upcoming Christmas parties (and don’t get us started on January!) If you are in a hurry but want to get your sweat on during a busy gym session, Stephanie Sanzo’s cable shoulder workout could be the gift that keeps on giving. “This was a short but effective workout using the cable machine, targeting the shoulders,” said the fitness instructor and
Instagram star
after demonstrating the details for her 3.5 million Instagram followers. “Great if you’re pressed for time and in a busy gym but still want to get a quick pump done.” Try it for yourself:

Workout Breakdown
Sanzo challenges you to aim for 3 to 4 rounds of this workout, and while you will be seriously working those scapulas, you’ll also be tightening the core and even working the legs as you replicate this fitness coaches perfect posture. There’s a mixture of double and single limb work, meaning you’ll be working on balance in addition to power. “Saved,” wrote multiple IG followers, either hoping to make all the difference at an upcoming gathering, or more realistically hoping to reach their goals in 2025. “Perfect technique, you are my inspiration,” wrote another fan. If 3 to 4 rounds seems too intense for your level of fitness, simply reduce the frequency, but work with a weight that is challenging while maintaining form, and be sure to keep those rest periods limited.
If you stayed to the end Stephanie Sanzo’s workout video, you’ll have seen an adorable doggie make an appearance. Mascots are not obligatory, but gains are guaranteed!

Whether we are
coming off a holiday
and find ourselves greeted with a higher-than-expected result on the scales, or perhaps we have stayed consistent but still find that the needle sometimes moves in the wrong direction, certified personal trainers like McKenna Olsen say that you shouldn’t freak out over short term weight gain. Here’s what you need to know.
Olsen, who was herself
an NPC bikini competitor
, and a national bikini champion, trains the current stars of the wellness and bodybuilding stage, along with anyone else who is looking to improve their physique. Fortunately, in a recent Instagram post, the trainer took to social media in order to add some much-needed perspective to the subject of scales spikes. “Understand there is approximately 3500 calories in ONE pound of fat,” she explains. “That means if you had gained 2 pounds of purely FAT, you would have eaten 7,000 calories OVER your maintenance calories.” Olsen says that for someone who typically eats 2,500 calories in a day, they would have needed to eat 9,500+ calories to achieve that type of fat gain.
“So, basically impossible, to put it simple,” she concludes. Well, perhaps not that impossible for some of us! But the point is well made, and your two extra pounds on the scales are unlikely to be the result of that many extra calories. But if they are, you’ll need to address your relationship with food before you can win the battle of the bulge.
For those who are working hard, the odd short term weight gain should not be of concern. “To put this into perspective, an average slice of pizza is 300 calories. You would have to eat over 23 slices of pizza ON TOP of your normal daily caloric intake to see just 2 pounds of fat gain happen,” says the beauty. “Unless you had basically just (eaten) about 3 entire pizzas to yourself, plus all of your normal food for the day, you have literally nothing to worry about,” says Olsen, reassuringly for most. But, if that pesky needle on the scales isn’t signalling fat gain, then what’s causing the added weight? “You did not gain 2 lbs of fat overnight. You are likely retaining water and here’s what to do moving forward,” guides the coach.

A post shared by McKenna Olsen|Health Coach Pn1 (@mckennahenrie)
What Should You Do If The Scale Goes Up
“Focus on getting back into a normal routine with eating vs restricting,” says Olsen, pointing out that going to extremes with the calorie restriction element is an inefficient way to lose weight of any kind, because it eventually leads to “over consuming, which leads to the never-ending yo-yo cycle.” Olsen goes on to say that hydration is important, because it is key to flushing out any
extra sodium from holiday food
or toxins from alcohol. Finally, she advises that you should “move your body, not to punish but to keep the habit/routine going and the get those endorphins released to put you in a better headspace.”
So, next time you see a scales spike, remember that the additional weight is probably the result of water retention brought about by too many treats, or could even be hormonal and perfectly natural. The important thing is to listen your body and don’t freak out, you got this!

Whether we are
coming off a holiday
and find ourselves greeted with a higher-than-expected result on the scales, or perhaps we have stayed consistent but still find that the needle sometimes moves in the wrong direction, certified personal trainers like McKenna Olsen say that you shouldn’t freak out over short term weight gain. Here’s what you need to know.
Olsen, who was herself
an NPC bikini competitor
, and a national bikini champion, trains the current stars of the wellness and bodybuilding stage, along with anyone else who is looking to improve their physique. Fortunately, in a recent Instagram post, the trainer took to social media in order to add some much-needed perspective to the subject of scales spikes. “Understand there is approximately 3500 calories in ONE pound of fat,” she explains. “That means if you had gained 2 pounds of purely FAT, you would have eaten 7,000 calories OVER your maintenance calories.” Olsen says that for someone who typically eats 2,500 calories in a day, they would have needed to eat 9,500+ calories to achieve that type of fat gain.
“So, basically impossible, to put it simple,” she concludes. Well, perhaps not that impossible for some of us! But the point is well made, and your two extra pounds on the scales are unlikely to be the result of that many extra calories. But if they are, you’ll need to address your relationship with food before you can win the battle of the bulge.
For those who are working hard, the odd short term weight gain should not be of concern. “To put this into perspective, an average slice of pizza is 300 calories. You would have to eat over 23 slices of pizza ON TOP of your normal daily caloric intake to see just 2 pounds of fat gain happen,” says the beauty. “Unless you had basically just (eaten) about 3 entire pizzas to yourself, plus all of your normal food for the day, you have literally nothing to worry about,” says Olsen, reassuringly for most. But, if that pesky needle on the scales isn’t signalling fat gain, then what’s causing the added weight? “You did not gain 2 lbs of fat overnight. You are likely retaining water and here’s what to do moving forward,” guides the coach.

A post shared by McKenna Olsen|Health Coach Pn1 (@mckennahenrie)
What Should You Do If The Scale Goes Up
“Focus on getting back into a normal routine with eating vs restricting,” says Olsen, pointing out that going to extremes with the calorie restriction element is an inefficient way to lose weight of any kind, because it eventually leads to “over consuming, which leads to the never-ending yo-yo cycle.” Olsen goes on to say that hydration is important, because it is key to flushing out any
extra sodium from holiday food
or toxins from alcohol. Finally, she advises that you should “move your body, not to punish but to keep the habit/routine going and the get those endorphins released to put you in a better headspace.”
So, next time you see a scales spike, remember that the additional weight is probably the result of water retention brought about by too many treats, or could even be hormonal and perfectly natural. The important thing is to listen your body and don’t freak out, you got this!

The Olympia logo has long been iconic in the fitness world, but it’s now recognizable in everyday life. It can be seen on clothing, in gyms around the world, and even on the panels of an official NASCAR racecar. Most recently, the global symbol of bodybuilding excellence was prominently featured on the #45 Chevrolet that was part of the NASCAR Xfinity Series race at one of the most famous tracks in motorsports—Daytona International Speedway.
Courtesy of Alpha Prime
Caesar Bacarella was the driver and owner of that car, and he’s been a big name in the racing world for quite some time now. His passion for racing goes back to his youth.
“It’s a passion that I had as a kid because I’m Italian. I always loved cars.” said Bacarella, who grew up a Michael Schumacher fan, and he looked up to Jeff Gordon as well. He got his own opportunity to try his hand at it during a tryout on a track in Miami. It wasn’t long before he was in a race.
“I was good at it,” Bacarella says. “Four races in, I finished third. Two years later, I won a championship.”
Bacarella won both the 2018 and 2019 Pirelli World Challenge Sprint X Championships. His racing career has seen him race on numerous circuits, including the Ferrari GT3 Series and the NASCAR Xfinity circuit. His father didn’t understand why he was so ambitious about racing, but Bacarella recalled that he never saw a Ferrari in person during childhood. Now he gets paid to drive them.
“I told him ‘Dad, they’re paying me to get into a $750,000 Ferrari racecar and beat the piss out of it. ‘Please, beat the s*** out of it and go win.’”
He may be most famous as a driver, but he’s also made a name for himself in the fitness industry with the success of Alpha Prime supps, Alpha Prime clothing line, and AP PrimeBites Protein Brownies. Aside from his work ethic and determination, he credits the people around him for the success he’s achieved with the growth of his brands.
“When I hire someone, I want to give that person the opportunity, and I tell them, ‘Spread your f***ing wings. Show me what you’ve got.’ You can really see them excel,” he said. When they excel and give their all, they earn his trust, and he returns that to them in spades.
“The people that I do trust, I give them 120 percent,” Bacarella explained. “I am successful now because of my team, but it’s because I can trust them and I give them everything I have.”
Courtesy of Alpha Prime
Earning Bacarella’s trust could be considered a reward in itself because it doesn’t come easy. That’s because of what happened in his childhood. Bacarella grew up with his father because his mother left them at an early age. A parent leaving the family can be traumatizing in itself, but he shared that it hit different with him because of the natural trust that comes in a relationship between a mother and a child.
“
When you get hurt or sick
or something like that, it’s natural to cry for your mom,” Bacarella says. “It put me in a bad spot because I didn’t have that growing up.”
His mother may have left, but he did have his father, who ran a pizzeria while Caesar was growing up. He became very familiar with that pizzeria, and it wasn’t because he had nothing better to do. He was working for his father at a very young age, cutting pepperoni, sorting beer bottles, even making pizzas himself by the time he was 9 years old. Make no mistake: This wasn’t just to teach him how to perform tasks, rather it was necessary to keep the business successful. While having to grow up so young wasn’t easy, Bacarella can now see that there were some positives that came with it.
“By being put to work by my father at such a young age, I was already trained for that,” he shared. “I was like, ‘OK, I have to kick it into second gear now,’ but it made me who I am today.”
Aside from being both a racer and entrepreneur, Bacarella’s also a father now, which is what he is most proud of. When he began that role, the mission was obvious: His kids weren’t going to have the same struggles he did.
“I didn’t want to be in that position anymore. I don’t want them to eat Wonder Bread with cheese and ketchup because that’s all there is to eat,” he explained. “Three months after they were born, I bought a prepaid college fund. They’re going to have a diploma because I didn’t have one from a university. I don’t think I have a family member yet who has graduated from a university.”
The financial commitments were great, but Bacarella knew that wasn’t the most important part of being a parent. The best thing he could do to be there for them was just that—be there for them.
“I want them to know that I’m going to be there,” he says.  “I’m their safe zone, and I’ll be there no matter what. I’m their best friend.”
Courtesy of Alpha Prime
HIs relationship with his children is rock-solid, and that can be seen when they all go to work. Young Caesar had to go to his father’s workplace. Now, Caesar’s kids are coming to his office, but it isn’t because of obligations. They choose to, which Bacarella doesn’t take for granted.
“You see them, and you can tell they’re enjoying themselves,” he says. “My daughters came to work here, and I just recently gave them their first paychecks. One of them is working with a photographer making product docs, and I was like, ‘This is awesome!’ It makes you feel really good.”
He considers the opportunity to be that father a gift, and he sees all positives coming from their involvement in his companies. Believe it or not, the source of that gift comes from an unexpected place.
“What gave me the fuel to be the person I am today is my mom leaving me,” Bacarella admits. “It puts you in a state of mind that it can’t get any worse, but it’s made me a better father.”
Bacarella wants his kids to feel that same sense of ownership that he would eventually feel with the pizzeria during childhood. Beyond that, he wants everyone that he brings in to feel that ownership as well. One story he recalled exemplified that.
“One of my designers was at the store with his son, and they saw the brownies, and his son went, ‘Daddy, that’s your company.’ His father is so involved and so proud of what he does, that his child said and felt that.”
That pride can also be seen, felt, and tasted in the brownies themselves. Since Bacarella is very familiar with growing up without a lot of money, he wants his customers to know that when they choose to purchase something from one of his brands, it will last.

“Top quality is number one,” he says. “If nothing else, you’re going to get the bang for the buck, but it’s got to be affordable. I would rather make less money so more people can afford our products. I don’t care [about the money]. I’m already successful.”
Thanks to his upbringing, the unintended gifts he got from that upbringing, and the results that have come from applying those gifts, Bacarella has now made a name for himself in the world of fitness at the same speed and intensity that he did in racing. He’s also doing it with the same intentions—setting the highest standards possible with no compromises. That starts at the very beginning of each customer experience his companies have.
“When you have a home or business, the foyer or lobby sets the tone,” Bacarella says. “It’s the first impression. You have one shot to make that first impression with a new customer with your products. They try it once, and that’s it. So, it has to be the best.”
Bacarella will have plenty of first impressions to make because PrimeBites will be a part of the
2022 Olympia Expo in Las Vegas
on the weekend of Dec. 16-18. Bacarella’s ride with the Olympia logo will be there as well. Many of those people may have grown up in similar situations that he did, but they have their own dreams and goals. He hopes to be a positive vessel and example for those people.
“You may not get handed opportunities when you have a rough upbringing, You have to find it because it won’t fall on your lap. Never give up. Make your opportunities.”

Caesar Bacarella Is Building a Fitness Empire at Full Speed
The champion driver and entrepreneur never slows down.

The Olympia logo has long been iconic in the fitness world, but it’s now recognizable in everyday life. It can be seen on clothing, in gyms around the world, and even on the panels of an official NASCAR racecar. Most recently, the global symbol of bodybuilding excellence was prominently featured on the #45 Chevrolet that was part of the NASCAR Xfinity Series race at one of the most famous tracks in motorsports—Daytona International Speedway.
Courtesy of Alpha Prime
Caesar Bacarella was the driver and owner of that car, and he’s been a big name in the racing world for quite some time now. His passion for racing goes back to his youth.
“It’s a passion that I had as a kid because I’m Italian. I always loved cars.” said Bacarella, who grew up a Michael Schumacher fan, and he looked up to Jeff Gordon as well. He got his own opportunity to try his hand at it during a tryout on a track in Miami. It wasn’t long before he was in a race.
“I was good at it,” Bacarella says. “Four races in, I finished third. Two years later, I won a championship.”
Bacarella won both the 2018 and 2019 Pirelli World Challenge Sprint X Championships. His racing career has seen him race on numerous circuits, including the Ferrari GT3 Series and the NASCAR Xfinity circuit. His father didn’t understand why he was so ambitious about racing, but Bacarella recalled that he never saw a Ferrari in person during childhood. Now he gets paid to drive them.
“I told him ‘Dad, they’re paying me to get into a $750,000 Ferrari racecar and beat the piss out of it. ‘Please, beat the s*** out of it and go win.’”
He may be most famous as a driver, but he’s also made a name for himself in the fitness industry with the success of Alpha Prime supps, Alpha Prime clothing line, and AP PrimeBites Protein Brownies. Aside from his work ethic and determination, he credits the people around him for the success he’s achieved with the growth of his brands.
“When I hire someone, I want to give that person the opportunity, and I tell them, ‘Spread your f***ing wings. Show me what you’ve got.’ You can really see them excel,” he said. When they excel and give their all, they earn his trust, and he returns that to them in spades.
“The people that I do trust, I give them 120 percent,” Bacarella explained. “I am successful now because of my team, but it’s because I can trust them and I give them everything I have.”
Courtesy of Alpha Prime
Earning Bacarella’s trust could be considered a reward in itself because it doesn’t come easy. That’s because of what happened in his childhood. Bacarella grew up with his father because his mother left them at an early age. A parent leaving the family can be traumatizing in itself, but he shared that it hit different with him because of the natural trust that comes in a relationship between a mother and a child.
“
When you get hurt or sick
or something like that, it’s natural to cry for your mom,” Bacarella says. “It put me in a bad spot because I didn’t have that growing up.”
His mother may have left, but he did have his father, who ran a pizzeria while Caesar was growing up. He became very familiar with that pizzeria, and it wasn’t because he had nothing better to do. He was working for his father at a very young age, cutting pepperoni, sorting beer bottles, even making pizzas himself by the time he was 9 years old. Make no mistake: This wasn’t just to teach him how to perform tasks, rather it was necessary to keep the business successful. While having to grow up so young wasn’t easy, Bacarella can now see that there were some positives that came with it.
“By being put to work by my father at such a young age, I was already trained for that,” he shared. “I was like, ‘OK, I have to kick it into second gear now,’ but it made me who I am today.”
Aside from being both a racer and entrepreneur, Bacarella’s also a father now, which is what he is most proud of. When he began that role, the mission was obvious: His kids weren’t going to have the same struggles he did.
“I didn’t want to be in that position anymore. I don’t want them to eat Wonder Bread with cheese and ketchup because that’s all there is to eat,” he explained. “Three months after they were born, I bought a prepaid college fund. They’re going to have a diploma because I didn’t have one from a university. I don’t think I have a family member yet who has graduated from a university.”
The financial commitments were great, but Bacarella knew that wasn’t the most important part of being a parent. The best thing he could do to be there for them was just that—be there for them.
“I want them to know that I’m going to be there,” he says.  “I’m their safe zone, and I’ll be there no matter what. I’m their best friend.”
Courtesy of Alpha Prime
HIs relationship with his children is rock-solid, and that can be seen when they all go to work. Young Caesar had to go to his father’s workplace. Now, Caesar’s kids are coming to his office, but it isn’t because of obligations. They choose to, which Bacarella doesn’t take for granted.
“You see them, and you can tell they’re enjoying themselves,” he says. “My daughters came to work here, and I just recently gave them their first paychecks. One of them is working with a photographer making product docs, and I was like, ‘This is awesome!’ It makes you feel really good.”
He considers the opportunity to be that father a gift, and he sees all positives coming from their involvement in his companies. Believe it or not, the source of that gift comes from an unexpected place.
“What gave me the fuel to be the person I am today is my mom leaving me,” Bacarella admits. “It puts you in a state of mind that it can’t get any worse, but it’s made me a better father.”
Bacarella wants his kids to feel that same sense of ownership that he would eventually feel with the pizzeria during childhood. Beyond that, he wants everyone that he brings in to feel that ownership as well. One story he recalled exemplified that.
“One of my designers was at the store with his son, and they saw the brownies, and his son went, ‘Daddy, that’s your company.’ His father is so involved and so proud of what he does, that his child said and felt that.”
That pride can also be seen, felt, and tasted in the brownies themselves. Since Bacarella is very familiar with growing up without a lot of money, he wants his customers to know that when they choose to purchase something from one of his brands, it will last.
Courtesy of Alpha Prime
“Top quality is number one,” he says. “If nothing else, you’re going to get the bang for the buck, but it’s got to be affordable. I would rather make less money so more people can afford our products. I don’t care [about the money]. I’m already successful.”
Thanks to his upbringing, the unintended gifts he got from that upbringing, and the results that have come from applying those gifts, Bacarella has now made a name for himself in the world of fitness at the same speed and intensity that he did in racing. He’s also doing it with the same intentions—setting the highest standards possible with no compromises. That starts at the very beginning of each customer experience his companies have.
“When you have a home or business, the foyer or lobby sets the tone,” Bacarella says. “It’s the first impression. You have one shot to make that first impression with a new customer with your products. They try it once, and that’s it. So, it has to be the best.”
Bacarella will have plenty of first impressions to make because PrimeBites will be a part of the
2022 Olympia Expo in Las Vegas
on the weekend of Dec. 16-18. Bacarella’s ride with the Olympia logo will be there as well. Many of those people may have grown up in similar situations that he did, but they have their own dreams and goals. He hopes to be a positive vessel and example for those people.
“You may not get handed opportunities when you have a rough upbringing, You have to find it because it won’t fall on your lap. Never give up. Make your opportunities.”

WINNING STRATEGY: Whitney Jones Can Break, But Can Never Be Broken

Being crowned Ms. Fitness Olympia three times is what makes Whitney Jones an icon among her bodybuilding and fitness peers. However, if the mainstream sports world knew of the Arizona native’s comeback stories—and there are quite a few to choose from—Jones’ status would be universally legendary.
Not all of Jones’ adversities—Jones has racked up more than a dozen surgeries to go along with her multiple titles—ended with her named called as the winner, but rarely has Jones ever just thrown in the towel. Nope, Jones rather be dragged offstage—or in one instance, crawling offstage—than having to withdraw.
Just before the finals of the 2015 Arnold Classic, severe back spasms during warmups had Jones on the floor onstage. She crawled backstage and tried to find a way to continue that night, even while she couldn’t get off the floor. Her night eventually ended with a DNF, despite trying to convince herself she could make it happen. “It was pretty bad,” Jones says. “I was lying flat backstage, and they kept telling me, ‘Show’s about to start—you’re not going to be able to make it.’ I was like, ‘No, that’s not true! Just give me five more minutes.’ In my brain, we were not done.”
Two years later, a severe neck injury not only shut down her 2017 season, but came close to ending her career. But eight months later, Jones was in full training mode and four weeks out from the 2018 Arnold Classic—only to suffer an ACL and MCL tear to her right leg during drills. She not only competed at the Arnold—Jones came out victorious.
Capping her comeback résumé was last year’s Olympia, in which Jones was looking to regain the crown she lost a year earlier to Missy Truscott. She brought down the house in Orlando with an electrifyingly showstopping routine to earn her third title—only to reveal afterward that she had performed despite suffering a broken tibia just three days earlier.

You can call her
Fearless—just like the name of her clothing brand
—because there’s no pain or obstacle that will prevent her from trying to find a way to compete. Jones would probably call her toughness a by-product of growing up with two older brothers. Now as the mother of two boys, she’s also a world champion athlete, trainer,
gym owner,
and entrepreneur in part she says due to her dedication finding ways to make the best of situations. Jones says that having the ability to adjust and adapt to stressful moments is a skill all of possess and can apply to almost any situation—if you have the right mindset.
“It’s all a mental game at that point,” she says. “You’ve done all the physical work. Now, it’s you who controls or not you succeed or fail. And I’ve had a lot of experience to kind of master that. And I just get into like that go mode, and you got one shot. I was gonna put it all out there. And if it works great, if it didn’t, it didn’t, but you there’s no tapping out. you got to make it work, make some modifications to your routine and you just go all in.”
Now just weeks out from
this year’s Olympia weekend
, Jones remains relatively healthy as she prepares to defend her Olympia fitness crown and attempt to earn a fourth title. There’s nothing left to prove, championship-wise, but as Jones says, doing what you love remains a motivating factor. Passion, along with learning to make adjustments as you push through life’s limitations are all part of her Winning Strategy.
“That’s what I am, and I take that approach with so many things,” Jones says. Because you can’t level up until you totally banish all fear and say, let’s just go for it. And if you have passion, and you’re strategic in what you’re doing, you should have the confidence that whatever it is you’re doing, it’s going to work out.”

DIG DEEP AND FIND WHAT YOU’RE CAPABLE OF
For me personally, I never have a backup plan. Going into the 2018 Arnold Classic, my routine was set, then I blew out my ACL with four weeks left. I had to start from scratch and literally figure out what could I do without having to utilize my right leg. Since my neck was still recovering and there was so much atrophy in my shoulders at that point, it then became
what could I do with just upper-body strength
. I went back to the drawing board. I stopped thinking about all these like crazy skills I could do that I’d been working on for years, and went back to the basics and built it from there.
I was like, “I can do XYZ—but how can I make that more explosive and exciting?” Because I was thrown for a loop by the injury, It truly forced me to think out of the box with no backup plan.
This is where I feel a lot of people tap out—they don’t want to look at their true talents, realize what they’re capable of until they’re tested. I was tested. And there was just no way I was not going to show up for that show. And for me, I [already] had to prove that I could come back from a broken neck. So when the ACL injury happened, I was like, Okay, well, this is a true test for me as an athlete. Where’s my championship mentality coming from? Is it there or not? And I was dead set on proving to myself more than anyone else that I was capable of it.
Bottom line: You work with what you got. Don’t focus on your faults and what’s not working in your favor.
Focus on
what is and that’s the way I was able to be successful. But that was probably the closest I ever came to tapping out because of my neck, then my upper body and lower body was a little bit jacked. What am I going to do? But you just got to tap into that mentality and know like, I’m here to fight. I’ve worked hard. I want to get on that stage and I want my shots.

DWELL AND YOU’LL BE LEFT BEHIND
The best advice I have is to put yourself on the other side of the situation. So if it’s a friend or family member telling you about their obstacles, what would you tell them? It’s easy to fall into that victim, pity-party mentality. But everybody knows that serves you no purpose, it’s a waste of time.
If you have goals, if you want to achieve something, you’ve got to be able to learn from whatever mistakes you made. Life is not always amazing. You learn your lessons from failures. So if it was an epic failure, you should have epic lessons that you’re learning from. You have to look at it in that mindset to go, yeah, today sucked, and whatever the case is, you don’t want to relive it, but what can you learn from it? Because then there’s something productive you can take from that to improve on and it’s just constant forward thinking.
Again, something that I always say is, you know, everyone in our sport is focused on an outcome and a goal. Would you ever want to be outworked? Probably not. So guess what, when you’re sitting in your pity-party mentality and you’re wasting days doing sorry for yourself or dwelling on some negative aspect that happened, someone else is working you and that’s up to you so you can allow it or not, I wouldn’t allow it. I will not be outworked.
BRING YOUR BEST AND YOU’VE WON
Focus on your goal—but that goal needs to be internal. You can’t be motivated by external validation
Our sport is subjective, so you’ve got to feel like a champion way before you hit the stage. You need to be like, “Hey, I already won, and everyone is in the audience to watch me win.” Having that mentality helps get you in a spot for that to actually come to fruition. If you have doubts or hesitation, bad stuff’s gonna happen because you’re not confident.
So if you’ve prepared properly, and have done everything you should have to get to that point, you should feel like a winner. You should feel like it’s your day to achieve success. And no matter what happens when you walk off the stage, you still need to be proud of yourself.
Never giving the validation to the judges is one of the most powerful things I’ve done. I haven’t won every show—Hello! everyone takes knocks in life—but I’ve learned something from it. And there have been plenty of times I’m like, I should have won. I felt amazing. I you know, I did the best I could, I didn’t. But guess what, as long as I felt proud of what I presented, then I won.
You’ve got to just continually be better than your previous self. You’ve got to show up better to every show. Your routines need to be better, more exciting, and with a higher degree of difficulty. Some people may require victory, but I feel like that’s the wrong mentality. If you do all of that, then you’ve won, with or without a trophy.

CREATE A CHAMPION PLATFORM
In the fitness industry, there’s so many opportunities for self fulfillment and financial fulfillment. You can monetize your fitness passion, but if you’re too focused on yourself you’re not enjoying this experience or keeping your eyes open to opportunities,  friendships, even sponsorships. You’re also missing opportunities to really give back to the community.
One of the biggest things I’ve learned, without a doubt, is that you’re a champion not for those moments that you are onstage for two minutes, and they give you that trophy, it’s what you do the minute you walk off the stage, and that entire year that truly dictates what kind of champion you are. How do you hold yourself? What are you representing? Are you helping younger athletes benefit from the sport and gain everything that you have? For me, being a champion allowed me a platform and a voice that I’d never had before, to share my experience to share my excitement to share my love the sport.
I’m just like everybody else—no one on the street knows that I’ve ever won the Olympia, and they don’t care. But if I could motivate someone to start getting active, become healthier for their children, or help a young athlete recover from an injury and realize their life’s not over. It’s allowed me a platform to really help motivate and inspire others. And to me, that’s what a true champion is, you’re a good representation of the sport, you represent your division well, and you’re helping to share your passion.
ACT LIKE ALL EYES ARE ON YOU—ALWAYS
What keeps me motivated? I truly love this sport. From a creative aspect, I love trying to challenge myself with, “Hey, can you do this skill?” People will throw ideas at me, and for me there’s only way to find out. I love thinking about new costumes, new music, new routines. That’s what keeps me motivated.
But also, being a mom, and coaching athletes all over the world, I’m also setting an example. So you got to walk the walk and also talk the talk. Not that I don’t have bad days, but I realize eyes are watching and what I do and what I say can absolutely inspire and motivate. My two boys are now teenagers and they’re getting into their own athletic careers. And they’re trying to dedicate their lives to schoolwork, so everything I’m doing is setting that example. So that motivates me to push harder every single day. Because if I fall down and slack, that’s giving my clients as well as my boys, a pass or an excuse to kind of do the same. So by modeling the behavior that I would love to see for my kids and my clients that holds me accountable, it keeps me motivated and I always just focus on enjoying what I do again. I don’t have to—I get to.

Being crowned Ms. Fitness Olympia three times is what makes Whitney Jones an icon among her bodybuilding and fitness peers. However, if the mainstream sports world knew of the Arizona native’s comeback stories—and there are quite a few to choose from—Jones’ status would be universally legendary.
Not all of Jones’ adversities—Jones has racked up more than a dozen surgeries to go along with her multiple titles—ended with her named called as the winner, but rarely has Jones ever just thrown in the towel. Nope, Jones rather be dragged offstage—or in one instance, crawling offstage—than having to withdraw.
Just before the finals of the 2015 Arnold Classic, severe back spasms during warmups had Jones on the floor onstage. She crawled backstage and tried to find a way to continue that night, even while she couldn’t get off the floor. Her night eventually ended with a DNF, despite trying to convince herself she could make it happen. “It was pretty bad,” Jones says. “I was lying flat backstage, and they kept telling me, ‘Show’s about to start—you’re not going to be able to make it.’ I was like, ‘No, that’s not true! Just give me five more minutes.’ In my brain, we were not done.”
Two years later, a severe neck injury not only shut down her 2017 season, but came close to ending her career. But eight months later, Jones was in full training mode and four weeks out from the 2018 Arnold Classic—only to suffer an ACL and MCL tear to her right leg during drills. She not only competed at the Arnold—Jones came out victorious.
Capping her comeback résumé was last year’s Olympia, in which Jones was looking to regain the crown she lost a year earlier to Missy Truscott. She brought down the house in Orlando with an electrifyingly showstopping routine to earn her third title—only to reveal afterward that she had performed despite suffering a broken tibia just three days earlier.

You can call her
Fearless—just like the name of her clothing brand
—because there’s no pain or obstacle that will prevent her from trying to find a way to compete. Jones would probably call her toughness a by-product of growing up with two older brothers. Now as the mother of two boys, she’s also a world champion athlete, trainer,
gym owner,
and entrepreneur in part she says due to her dedication finding ways to make the best of situations. Jones says that having the ability to adjust and adapt to stressful moments is a skill all of possess and can apply to almost any situation—if you have the right mindset.
“It’s all a mental game at that point,” she says. “You’ve done all the physical work. Now, it’s you who controls or not you succeed or fail. And I’ve had a lot of experience to kind of master that. And I just get into like that go mode, and you got one shot. I was gonna put it all out there. And if it works great, if it didn’t, it didn’t, but you there’s no tapping out. you got to make it work, make some modifications to your routine and you just go all in.”
Now just weeks out from
this year’s Olympia weekend
, Jones remains relatively healthy as she prepares to defend her Olympia fitness crown and attempt to earn a fourth title. There’s nothing left to prove, championship-wise, but as Jones says, doing what you love remains a motivating factor. Passion, along with learning to make adjustments as you push through life’s limitations are all part of her Winning Strategy.
“That’s what I am, and I take that approach with so many things,” Jones says. Because you can’t level up until you totally banish all fear and say, let’s just go for it. And if you have passion, and you’re strategic in what you’re doing, you should have the confidence that whatever it is you’re doing, it’s going to work out.”

DIG DEEP AND FIND WHAT YOU’RE CAPABLE OF
For me personally, I never have a backup plan. Going into the 2018 Arnold Classic, my routine was set, then I blew out my ACL with four weeks left. I had to start from scratch and literally figure out what could I do without having to utilize my right leg. Since my neck was still recovering and there was so much atrophy in my shoulders at that point, it then became
what could I do with just upper-body strength
. I went back to the drawing board. I stopped thinking about all these like crazy skills I could do that I’d been working on for years, and went back to the basics and built it from there.
I was like, “I can do XYZ—but how can I make that more explosive and exciting?” Because I was thrown for a loop by the injury, It truly forced me to think out of the box with no backup plan.
This is where I feel a lot of people tap out—they don’t want to look at their true talents, realize what they’re capable of until they’re tested. I was tested. And there was just no way I was not going to show up for that show. And for me, I [already] had to prove that I could come back from a broken neck. So when the ACL injury happened, I was like, Okay, well, this is a true test for me as an athlete. Where’s my championship mentality coming from? Is it there or not? And I was dead set on proving to myself more than anyone else that I was capable of it.
Bottom line: You work with what you got. Don’t focus on your faults and what’s not working in your favor.
Focus on
what is and that’s the way I was able to be successful. But that was probably the closest I ever came to tapping out because of my neck, then my upper body and lower body was a little bit jacked. What am I going to do? But you just got to tap into that mentality and know like, I’m here to fight. I’ve worked hard. I want to get on that stage and I want my shots.

DWELL AND YOU’LL BE LEFT BEHIND
The best advice I have is to put yourself on the other side of the situation. So if it’s a friend or family member telling you about their obstacles, what would you tell them? It’s easy to fall into that victim, pity-party mentality. But everybody knows that serves you no purpose, it’s a waste of time.
If you have goals, if you want to achieve something, you’ve got to be able to learn from whatever mistakes you made. Life is not always amazing. You learn your lessons from failures. So if it was an epic failure, you should have epic lessons that you’re learning from. You have to look at it in that mindset to go, yeah, today sucked, and whatever the case is, you don’t want to relive it, but what can you learn from it? Because then there’s something productive you can take from that to improve on and it’s just constant forward thinking.
Again, something that I always say is, you know, everyone in our sport is focused on an outcome and a goal. Would you ever want to be outworked? Probably not. So guess what, when you’re sitting in your pity-party mentality and you’re wasting days doing sorry for yourself or dwelling on some negative aspect that happened, someone else is working you and that’s up to you so you can allow it or not, I wouldn’t allow it. I will not be outworked.
BRING YOUR BEST AND YOU’VE WON
Focus on your goal—but that goal needs to be internal. You can’t be motivated by external validation
Our sport is subjective, so you’ve got to feel like a champion way before you hit the stage. You need to be like, “Hey, I already won, and everyone is in the audience to watch me win.” Having that mentality helps get you in a spot for that to actually come to fruition. If you have doubts or hesitation, bad stuff’s gonna happen because you’re not confident.
So if you’ve prepared properly, and have done everything you should have to get to that point, you should feel like a winner. You should feel like it’s your day to achieve success. And no matter what happens when you walk off the stage, you still need to be proud of yourself.
Never giving the validation to the judges is one of the most powerful things I’ve done. I haven’t won every show—Hello! everyone takes knocks in life—but I’ve learned something from it. And there have been plenty of times I’m like, I should have won. I felt amazing. I you know, I did the best I could, I didn’t. But guess what, as long as I felt proud of what I presented, then I won.
You’ve got to just continually be better than your previous self. You’ve got to show up better to every show. Your routines need to be better, more exciting, and with a higher degree of difficulty. Some people may require victory, but I feel like that’s the wrong mentality. If you do all of that, then you’ve won, with or without a trophy.

CREATE A CHAMPION PLATFORM
In the fitness industry, there’s so many opportunities for self fulfillment and financial fulfillment. You can monetize your fitness passion, but if you’re too focused on yourself you’re not enjoying this experience or keeping your eyes open to opportunities,  friendships, even sponsorships. You’re also missing opportunities to really give back to the community.
One of the biggest things I’ve learned, without a doubt, is that you’re a champion not for those moments that you are onstage for two minutes, and they give you that trophy, it’s what you do the minute you walk off the stage, and that entire year that truly dictates what kind of champion you are. How do you hold yourself? What are you representing? Are you helping younger athletes benefit from the sport and gain everything that you have? For me, being a champion allowed me a platform and a voice that I’d never had before, to share my experience to share my excitement to share my love the sport.
I’m just like everybody else—no one on the street knows that I’ve ever won the Olympia, and they don’t care. But if I could motivate someone to start getting active, become healthier for their children, or help a young athlete recover from an injury and realize their life’s not over. It’s allowed me a platform to really help motivate and inspire others. And to me, that’s what a true champion is, you’re a good representation of the sport, you represent your division well, and you’re helping to share your passion.
ACT LIKE ALL EYES ARE ON YOU—ALWAYS
What keeps me motivated? I truly love this sport. From a creative aspect, I love trying to challenge myself with, “Hey, can you do this skill?” People will throw ideas at me, and for me there’s only way to find out. I love thinking about new costumes, new music, new routines. That’s what keeps me motivated.
But also, being a mom, and coaching athletes all over the world, I’m also setting an example. So you got to walk the walk and also talk the talk. Not that I don’t have bad days, but I realize eyes are watching and what I do and what I say can absolutely inspire and motivate. My two boys are now teenagers and they’re getting into their own athletic careers. And they’re trying to dedicate their lives to schoolwork, so everything I’m doing is setting that example. So that motivates me to push harder every single day. Because if I fall down and slack, that’s giving my clients as well as my boys, a pass or an excuse to kind of do the same. So by modeling the behavior that I would love to see for my kids and my clients that holds me accountable, it keeps me motivated and I always just focus on enjoying what I do again. I don’t have to—I get to.

2022 Boston Pro Wellness winner Yarishna Ayala is one of the most popular athletes in her division. That means she has quite a hectic schedule between making appearances and preparing for the 2022 Olympia this December in Las Vegas, Nevada. Ayala told Fit Rockstar host Isabelle Turell that while she stays busy, it’s worth the grind.
“I love competing, but more I love helping other people,” said the former New York Pro winner. “For me, this is my favorite part because it’s amazing for me to just do that for the people.”
Ayala sees her efforts as her doing her part to make the Wellness division grow. It has already gained a lot of popularity in a short time, but she evens even more potential in the future.
“You still don’t see too many girls competing. So, I’m working for that growing.”
Ayala has worked with several ladies that have had apprehensions to compete because of the quality of athletes, but her advice to them is to go all in anyway. If nothing else, they can reach their full potential by giving their best.
“Just focus on yourself and what you need to improve to be the best. You don’t care if this other person competes or not,” she told Turell. That philosophy is one that she also applies to herself, which is why she is considered a contender for the 2022 Wellness Olympia title. Ayala is drawing from her 2021 Olympia experience to help her prepare for the contest this year.
“It was an amazing experience. I was always dreaming of competing in the Olympia, but this year, I think I’m more focused. I know what to expect. I know what I need to do to be the best at this year’s Olympia.”
Turell and Ayala covered a lot of ground in this episode, including her clothing line, stories from her travels around the world, and more. Subscribe to the

2022 Boston Pro Wellness winner Yarishna Ayala is one of the most popular athletes in her division. That means she has quite a hectic schedule between making appearances and preparing for the 2022 Olympia this December in Las Vegas, Nevada. Ayala told Fit Rockstar host Isabelle Turell that while she stays busy, it’s worth the grind.
“I love competing, but more I love helping other people,” said the former New York Pro winner. “For me, this is my favorite part because it’s amazing for me to just do that for the people.”
Ayala sees her efforts as her doing her part to make the Wellness division grow. It has already gained a lot of popularity in a short time, but she evens even more potential in the future.
“You still don’t see too many girls competing. So, I’m working for that growing.”
Ayala has worked with several ladies that have had apprehensions to compete because of the quality of athletes, but her advice to them is to go all in anyway. If nothing else, they can reach their full potential by giving their best.
“Just focus on yourself and what you need to improve to be the best. You don’t care if this other person competes or not,” she told Turell. That philosophy is one that she also applies to herself, which is why she is considered a contender for the 2022 Wellness Olympia title. Ayala is drawing from her 2021 Olympia experience to help her prepare for the contest this year.
“It was an amazing experience. I was always dreaming of competing in the Olympia, but this year, I think I’m more focused. I know what to expect. I know what I need to do to be the best at this year’s Olympia.”
Turell and Ayala covered a lot of ground in this episode, including her clothing line, stories from her travels around the world, and more. Subscribe to the

E-Commerce
All features, content, specifications, products and prices of products and services described or depicted on the Website are subject to change at any time without notice. Certain weights, measures and similar descriptions are approximate and are provided for convenience purposes only. We make all reasonable efforts to accurately display the attributes of our products, including the applicable colors; however, the actual color you see will depend on your computer system, and we cannot guarantee that your computer will accurately display such colors. The inclusion of any products or services on the Website at a particular time does not imply or warrant that these products or services will be available at any time. It is your responsibility to ascertain and obey all applicable local, state, federal and international laws (including minimum age requirements) in regard to the possession, use and sale of any item purchased from the Website.

All videocassettes, DVDs and similar products sold are for private, home use (where no admission fee is charged), non-public performance and may not be duplicated.
When an order is placed, it will be shipped to an address designated by the purchaser as long as that shipping address is compliant with the shipping restrictions contained on the Website. All purchases from this Website are made pursuant to a shipment contract. As a result, risk of loss and title for items purchased from the Website pass to you upon delivery of the items to the carrier. You are responsible for filing any claims with carriers for damaged and/or lost shipments.
We attempt to ensure that information on the Website is complete, accurate and current. Despite our efforts, the information on the Website may occasionally be inaccurate, incomplete, or out of date. We make no representation as to the completeness, accuracy or how current of any information on the Website. For example, products included on the Website may be unavailable, may have different attributes than those listed, or may actually carry a different price than that stated on the Website. In addition, we may make changes in information about price and availability without notice.
We make every effort to ensure the accuracy of the price on our web site. When errors are discovered, we will correct them.

Privacy Policy
Last Revised: January 10, 2023
The following Privacy Policy describes the collection, disclosure, use of, and rights regarding any Personal Information (“Personal Information”) obtained by J. Wood Ventures LLC, Wings of Strength LLC, Wings of Strength Productions LLC, Digital Muscle LLC, Olympia Productions LLC, JW Media LLC, Mr Olympia LLC, JW Holdings LLC, Jake Wood, and any publications associated with those entities (collectively, the “Company” and/or “we”, “us”, “our”) when you interact with our websites, mobile applications, or other digital services (collectively, the “Services”).
Collection of Information
When you use the Services, we collect various categories of Personal Information, which will generally fall into two categories: information that you provide to us directly, and information that we collect automatically.
Information You Provide Directly
Basic Information.
When you use the Services, we will collect information that you provide to us, for example, through our websites, mobile apps, and/or any agreements you’ve entered into with respect to the Services. This information may include, for example, your first name, last name, residence address, phone number, e-mail address. We may also collect billing information, such as credit card numbers and related information necessary to complete online and/or in-app transactions.
External Sources
. We may receive Personal Information from publicly available databases, joint marketing partners and event sponsors, entities to which we provide client services, such as your employer, and social media platforms.
Information We Collect Automatically
Cookies
. We employ cookies on the website. A cookie is a small, encoded text file sent between a web server and web browser when you visit the website. That file is stored on the hard drive of the device used to access the internet, and will be accessed when you revisit the website that created the cookie file. Your web browser uses the information stored in the cookie to make navigating the website easier, such as automatic login and other functions and preferences. Cookies come in many flavors. Functional cookies ensure that certain parts of the website work properly. By placing functional cookies, we make it easier for you to visit our website and use the Services. We may place these cookies without your consent. Analytical cookies are used to optimize the website experience for our users. Through the use of analytical cookies, we receive insight into the usage of our website. We ask your permission to place analytical cookies to ensure our website offers a continued positive user experience.
Other Technologies
. We may use clear GIFs, pixel tags, and other such cookie-like technologies to track the activities of users of our website and to compile statistics about the use of our website and/or e-mail response rates. We may collect information about your computer, mobile device, browser and operating system (e.g., type, model, or version), or internet protocol (IP) address (which may be used to derive your general geographic area).
Log files
. Our servers may automatically record information related to your use of our website, which may include information such as your IP address, browser type, operating system, mobile device type, diagnostic information, referring web page, and other web pages visited.
Use of Information
We use the Personal Information detailed above for a variety of purposes, including providing our services to you, managing customer relationships, responding to your inquiries, enforcing our terms of use, personalizing your experience on the website, providing information regarding careers with us, and engaging in marketing activities, such as providing newsletters, publications, updates, and other information that we believe might be of interest to you.
The Personal Information may also be used to send you alerts or other communications via SMS messages or other media or networks, notify you about new features of the Services, special events, or products, services, and special offers, administer sweepstakes and contests, attribute content to you that you make available through the Services (such as comments you post), personalize the content and advertising that you see on the Services and to understand how users interact with and use our advertisements and Services.
With respect to marketing activities, certain information that you provide to us, such as your first name, last name, company name, e-mail address, physical address, and phone number may be aggregated with other such data in one or more contact lists. We may then use these contact lists to send you information regarding our services via an automated mailing system and/or to send you surveys via an automated survey generation system. These contact lists may be integrated into our client relation management (CRM) system and/or our internal e-mail contact lists).
Sharing of Information
We do not sell, exchange, transfer, or give your Personal Information to any other company or individual except as follows:
We may share, on a limited basis, Personal Information with our service providers, suppliers, subcontractors, and similar third parties so that they can assist us in the maintenance of our website and other services. We may also share Personal Information with financial institutions in connection with invoicing and payments.
We may rent, sell, or share your Personal Information with non-affiliated third parties: (a) in order to provide services or products that we believe may be of interest to you; (b) when we have your permission; or (c) as described in this Privacy Policy.
We may share your information with our agents or companies in order to provide the Services or advertising or to communicate with you on our behalf.
When you sign up to participate in a contest or sweepstakes, your information may also be provided to our sweepstakes or contest advertisers, operators, and/or sponsors and the use of that information will be also governed by the privacy policies or practices of those advertisers, operators, and/or sponsors.
We may disclose your Personal Information to comply with any court order, law or legal process, including to respond to any government or regulatory request; to enforce or apply our terms of use and other agreements, including for billing and collection purposes; if we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to protect the rights, property, or safety of ourselves, our clients, or others.
We may aggregate and/or de-identify your information so that the information no longer relates to you individually. Our use and disclosure of such aggregated or de-identified information is not subject to this Privacy Policy, and may be disclosed to others without limitation and for any purpose.
Access to Information
You may access and update your Personal Information that we hold by sending a request to the e-mail address listed below under Contact Us.
You may unsubscribe from our marketing or promotional emails by clicking the “Unsubscribe” link in our emails or, for certain Services, by logging into your account and adjusting your preferences.
Third Party websites and Links
We may provide links to third-party websites, services, plug-ins, content, and applications that are not operated by us. This Privacy Policy does not apply to such services, and we cannot take responsibility for the privacy policies, content, or practices of those services and websites.
Some of the services and advertisements are delivered or served by third-party companies. These companies place or recognize cookies, pixel tags, web beacons or other technology to track certain information about our Services website users. In many cases, this information could be used to show you ads on other websites based on your interests. We do not have access to, nor control over, these third parties’ use of cookies or other tracking technologies or how they may be used.
Data Retention
We store the information we collect about you for as long as is necessary for the purposes for which we collected it, and in accordance with our legal obligations and legitimate business interests.
Sensitive Information
We ask that you not send us, and you not disclose, any sensitive Personal Information (e.g., social security numbers, information related to racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religion or other beliefs, health, biometrics, or genetic characteristics, criminal background or trade union membership) when using the Services.
Residents of the European Economic Area
If you are located in the European Economic Area (“EEA”), you may have certain additional rights and protections under the EU General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) regarding the processing of your personal data. In this regard, we may ask you to identify which country you are located in when you use or access the Services, or we may rely on your IP address to make this determination. If any terms in this section conflict with other terms of this Privacy Policy, the terms in this section shall apply to individuals located in the EEA when the Personal Information is collected or processed.
For example, you may have the following rights: i) the right to be informed of how your Personal Information is being used, ii) the right to access to your Personal Information, iii) the right to rectification of data discrepancies, iv) the right to be forgotten, v) the right to restrict processing of your data, vi) the right to data portability, vii) the right to object to processing, and vii) the right to avoid automated profiling.
In the sections above, we describe the categories of Personal Information collected and explain various ways that we process your Personal Information. Generally, we will process your Personal Information only (1) with your consent; (2) to perform in accordance with a contract between you and us; (3) to comply with a legal obligation; or (4) where we have a legitimate interest to do so, balancing this interest against your interests and fundamental rights.
If you are in the EEA and you would like to contact us regarding these or other possible rights under the GDPR, please use the e-mail address listed below under Contact Us. You may also have the right to lodge a complaint with the local data protection authority if you believe that we have not complied with applicable data protection laws. See
http://ec.europa.eu/justice/article-29/structure/data-protection-authorities/index_en.htm
.
Children’s Privacy
Our Services are not directed to children under the age of 16. We do not knowingly collect Personal Information from children under the age of 16. If we receive Personal Information that we discover was provided by a child under the age of 16, we will promptly destroy such information. If you would like to learn more about the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), please visit the Federal Trade Commission home page at
http://www.ftc.gov
.
California Residents
“Shine the Light” Law
. If you are a California resident who has provided us with your Personal Information during the creation of or during the course of establishing a legal services relationship that is primarily for personal, family, or household purposes, you may, once per calendar year, request information regarding our disclosure of certain categories of your Personal Information. Specifically, pursuant to California Civil Code 1798.83 (the “Shine the Light” law), we will provide you a list of the categories of Personal Information disclosed to third parties for their direct marketing purposes during the immediately preceding calendar year, along with the names and addresses of these third parties. You must submit your request to us either by the e-mail address listed under the Contact Us section below, or by mail at 2025 S Airport Blvd, Chandler, Arizona, 85286, USA.
California Consumer Protection Act (CCPA)
. The California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (CCPA), California Civil Code 1798.100-199, is directed at providing California consumers more control over the Personal Information that businesses collect about them. While we do not believe we are subject to the CCPA under 1798.140(c), we are committed to safeguarding the Personal Information of visitors to our website, as detailed above.
If you would like to learn more about the CCPA, please visit the California Office of the Attorney General site at
https://oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa
.
Do-not-track Signals
We do not guarantee that our Services will respond to do-not-track signals. For more information about do-not-track signals, please see
https://allaboutdnt.com/
. You may, however, disable certain tracking as set forth in our Cookie Policy.
Security
We employ measures that are appropriate to protect your Personal Information against unauthorized access, improper use or disclosure, unauthorized or unlawful destruction or accidental loss, and all of our employees and any third parties that process your Personal Information on our behalf are obligated to respect the confidentiality of your information. However, we cannot and do not provide any assurance that these measures will be sufficient to protect the information you choose to transmit to our site.
Personal Information we collect may be transferred to, and stored and processed in, the United States or any other country in which we or our affiliates or processors maintain facilities. We have put in place reasonable safeguards to ensure the protection of any Personal Information transferred from the EEA to the United States and other countries. By using the Services, you consent to your information being transferred to our facilities and to the facilities of those third parties with whom we share it as described in this Privacy Policy.
Revisions to our Privacy Policy
We reserve the right to revise this Privacy Policy or any part of it from time to time. Please review this Privacy Policy periodically for changes. If we make material changes, we will endeavor to provide notice ahead of such changes, such as by email or through a notice at the website.

We make all reasonable efforts to accurately display the attributes of our products, including the applicable colors; however, the actual color you see will depend on your computer system, and we cannot guarantee that your computer will accurately display such colors. The inclusion of any products or services on the Website at a particular time does not imply or warrant that these products or services will be available at any time. It is your responsibility to ascertain and obey all applicable local, state, federal and international laws (including minimum age requirements) in regard to the possession, use and sale of any item purchased from the Website. By placing an order, you represent that the products ordered will be used only in a lawful manner. All videocassettes, DVDs and similar products sold are for private, home use (where no admission fee is charged), non-public performance and may not be duplicated.
When an order is placed, it will be shipped to an address designated by the purchaser as long as that shipping address is compliant with the shipping restrictions contained on the Website. All purchases from this Website are made pursuant to a shipment contract. As a result, risk of loss and title for items purchased from the Website pass to you upon delivery of the items to the carrier. You are responsible for filing any claims with carriers for damaged and/or lost shipments.
We attempt to ensure that information on the Website is complete, accurate and current. Despite our efforts, the information on the Website may occasionally be inaccurate, incomplete, or out of date. We make no representation as to the completeness, accuracy or how current of any information on the Website. For example, products included on the Website may be unavailable, may have different attributes than those listed, or may actually carry a different price than that stated on the Website. In addition, we may make changes in information about price and availability without notice.
We make every effort to ensure the accuracy of the price on our web site. When errors are discovered, we will correct them. Be advised that we reserve the right to revoke any stated offer and to correct any errors, inaccuracies, or omissions, including after an order has been submitted, after it has been confirmed, or after your credit card has been charged. If we discover a pricing error after your credit card has been charged and your order is canceled as a result of the error, your credit card will be refunded back the full amount of your order. You will be notified via email if your order has been canceled and be given the opportunity to place the order at the correct price. Please note that individual bank policies vary when the amount is credited back to your account. Prices and availability are subject to change without prior notice.
While it is our practice to confirm orders by email, the receipt of an email order confirmation does not constitute our acceptance of an order or our confirmation of an offer to sell a product or service. We reserve the right, without prior notice, to limit the order quantity on any product or service and/or to refuse service to any customer. We also may require verification of information prior to the acceptance and/or shipment of any order.

Privacy Policy
Last Revised: January 10, 2023
The following Privacy Policy describes the collection, disclosure, use of, and rights regarding any Personal Information (“Personal Information”) obtained by J. Wood Ventures LLC, Wings of Strength LLC, Wings of Strength Productions LLC, Digital Muscle LLC, Olympia Productions LLC, JW Media LLC, Mr Olympia LLC, JW Holdings LLC, Jake Wood, and any publications associated with those entities (collectively, the “Company” and/or “we”, “us”, “our”) when you interact with our websites, mobile applications, or other digital services (collectively, the “Services”).
Collection of Information
When you use the Services, we collect various categories of Personal Information, which will generally fall into two categories: information that you provide to us directly, and information that we collect automatically.
Information You Provide Directly
Basic Information.
When you use the Services, we will collect information that you provide to us, for example, through our websites, mobile apps, and/or any agreements you’ve entered into with respect to the Services. This information may include, for example, your first name, last name, residence address, phone number, e-mail address. We may also collect billing information, such as credit card numbers and related information necessary to complete online and/or in-app transactions.
External Sources
. We may receive Personal Information from publicly available databases, joint marketing partners and event sponsors, entities to which we provide client services, such as your employer, and social media platforms.
Information We Collect Automatically
Cookies
. We employ cookies on the website. A cookie is a small, encoded text file sent between a web server and web browser when you visit the website. That file is stored on the hard drive of the device used to access the internet, and will be accessed when you revisit the website that created the cookie file. Your web browser uses the information stored in the cookie to make navigating the website easier, such as automatic login and other functions and preferences. Cookies come in many flavors. Functional cookies ensure that certain parts of the website work properly. By placing functional cookies, we make it easier for you to visit our website and use the Services. We may place these cookies without your consent. Analytical cookies are used to optimize the website experience for our users. Through the use of analytical cookies, we receive insight into the usage of our website. We ask your permission to place analytical cookies to ensure our website offers a continued positive user experience.
Other Technologies
. We may use clear GIFs, pixel tags, and other such cookie-like technologies to track the activities of users of our website and to compile statistics about the use of our website and/or e-mail response rates. We may collect information about your computer, mobile device, browser and operating system (e.g., type, model, or version), or internet protocol (IP) address (which may be used to derive your general geographic area).
Log files
. Our servers may automatically record information related to your use of our website, which may include information such as your IP address, browser type, operating system, mobile device type, diagnostic information, referring web page, and other web pages visited.
Use of Information
We use the Personal Information detailed above for a variety of purposes, including providing our services to you, managing customer relationships, responding to your inquiries, enforcing our terms of use, personalizing your experience on the website, providing information regarding careers with us, and engaging in marketing activities, such as providing newsletters, publications, updates, and other information that we believe might be of interest to you.
The Personal Information may also be used to send you alerts or other communications via SMS messages or other media or networks, notify you about new features of the Services, special events, or products, services, and special offers, administer sweepstakes and contests, attribute content to you that you make available through the Services (such as comments you post), personalize the content and advertising that you see on the Services and to understand how users interact with and use our advertisements and Services.
With respect to marketing activities, certain information that you provide to us, such as your first name, last name, company name, e-mail address, physical address, and phone number may be aggregated with other such data in one or more contact lists. We may then use these contact lists to send you information regarding our services via an automated mailing system and/or to send you surveys via an automated survey generation system. These contact lists may be integrated into our client relation management (CRM) system and/or our internal e-mail contact lists).
Sharing of Information
We do not sell, exchange, transfer, or give your Personal Information to any other company or individual except as follows:
We may share, on a limited basis, Personal Information with our service providers, suppliers, subcontractors, and similar third parties so that they can assist us in the maintenance of our website and other services. We may also share Personal Information with financial institutions in connection with invoicing and payments.
We may rent, sell, or share your Personal Information with non-affiliated third parties: (a) in order to provide services or products that we believe may be of interest to you; (b) when we have your permission; or (c) as described in this Privacy Policy.
We may share your information with our agents or companies in order to provide the Services or advertising or to communicate with you on our behalf.
When you sign up to participate in a contest or sweepstakes, your information may also be provided to our sweepstakes or contest advertisers, operators, and/or sponsors and the use of that information will be also governed by the privacy policies or practices of those advertisers, operators, and/or sponsors.
We may disclose your Personal Information to comply with any court order, law or legal process, including to respond to any government or regulatory request; to enforce or apply our terms of use and other agreements, including for billing and collection purposes; if we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to protect the rights, property, or safety of ourselves, our clients, or others.
We may aggregate and/or de-identify your information so that the information no longer relates to you individually. Our use and disclosure of such aggregated or de-identified information is not subject to this Privacy Policy, and may be disclosed to others without limitation and for any purpose.
Access to Information
You may access and update your Personal Information that we hold by sending a request to the e-mail address listed below under Contact Us.
You may unsubscribe from our marketing or promotional emails by clicking the “Unsubscribe” link in our emails or, for certain Services, by logging into your account and adjusting your preferences.
Third Party websites and Links
We may provide links to third-party websites, services, plug-ins, content, and applications that are not operated by us. This Privacy Policy does not apply to such services, and we cannot take responsibility for the privacy policies, content, or practices of those services and websites.
Some of the services and advertisements are delivered or served by third-party companies. These companies place or recognize cookies, pixel tags, web beacons or other technology to track certain information about our Services website users. In many cases, this information could be used to show you ads on other websites based on your interests. We do not have access to, nor control over, these third parties’ use of cookies or other tracking technologies or how they may be used.
Data Retention
We store the information we collect about you for as long as is necessary for the purposes for which we collected it, and in accordance with our legal obligations and legitimate business interests.
Sensitive Information
We ask that you not send us, and you not disclose, any sensitive Personal Information (e.g., social security numbers, information related to racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religion or other beliefs, health, biometrics, or genetic characteristics, criminal background or trade union membership) when using the Services.
Residents of the European Economic Area
If you are located in the European Economic Area (“EEA”), you may have certain additional rights and protections under the EU General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) regarding the processing of your personal data. In this regard, we may ask you to identify which country you are located in when you use or access the Services, or we may rely on your IP address to make this determination. If any terms in this section conflict with other terms of this Privacy Policy, the terms in this section shall apply to individuals located in the EEA when the Personal Information is collected or processed.
For example, you may have the following rights: i) the right to be informed of how your Personal Information is being used, ii) the right to access to your Personal Information, iii) the right to rectification of data discrepancies, iv) the right to be forgotten, v) the right to restrict processing of your data, vi) the right to data portability, vii) the right to object to processing, and vii) the right to avoid automated profiling.
In the sections above, we describe the categories of Personal Information collected and explain various ways that we process your Personal Information. Generally, we will process your Personal Information only (1) with your consent; (2) to perform in accordance with a contract between you and us; (3) to comply with a legal obligation; or (4) where we have a legitimate interest to do so, balancing this interest against your interests and fundamental rights.
If you are in the EEA and you would like to contact us regarding these or other possible rights under the GDPR, please use the e-mail address listed below under Contact Us. You may also have the right to lodge a complaint with the local data protection authority if you believe that we have not complied with applicable data protection laws. See
http://ec.europa.eu/justice/article-29/structure/data-protection-authorities/index_en.htm
.
Children’s Privacy
Our Services are not directed to children under the age of 16. We do not knowingly collect Personal Information from children under the age of 16. If we receive Personal Information that we discover was provided by a child under the age of 16, we will promptly destroy such information. If you would like to learn more about the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), please visit the Federal Trade Commission home page at
http://www.ftc.gov
.
California Residents
“Shine the Light” Law
. If you are a California resident who has provided us with your Personal Information during the creation of or during the course of establishing a legal services relationship that is primarily for personal, family, or household purposes, you may, once per calendar year, request information regarding our disclosure of certain categories of your Personal Information. Specifically, pursuant to California Civil Code 1798.83 (the “Shine the Light” law), we will provide you a list of the categories of Personal Information disclosed to third parties for their direct marketing purposes during the immediately preceding calendar year, along with the names and addresses of these third parties. You must submit your request to us either by the e-mail address listed under the Contact Us section below, or by mail at 2025 S Airport Blvd, Chandler, Arizona, 85286, USA.
California Consumer Protection Act (CCPA)
. The California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (CCPA), California Civil Code 1798.100-199, is directed at providing California consumers more control over the Personal Information that businesses collect about them. While we do not believe we are subject to the CCPA under 1798.140(c), we are committed to safeguarding the Personal Information of visitors to our website, as detailed above.
If you would like to learn more about the CCPA, please visit the California Office of the Attorney General site at
https://oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa
.
Do-not-track Signals
We do not guarantee that our Services will respond to do-not-track signals. For more information about do-not-track signals, please see
https://allaboutdnt.com/
. You may, however, disable certain tracking as set forth in our Cookie Policy.
Security
We employ measures that are appropriate to protect your Personal Information against unauthorized access, improper use or disclosure, unauthorized or unlawful destruction or accidental loss, and all of our employees and any third parties that process your Personal Information on our behalf are obligated to respect the confidentiality of your information. However, we cannot and do not provide any assurance that these measures will be sufficient to protect the information you choose to transmit to our site.
Personal Information we collect may be transferred to, and stored and processed in, the United States or any other country in which we or our affiliates or processors maintain facilities. We have put in place reasonable safeguards to ensure the protection of any Personal Information transferred from the EEA to the United States and other countries. By using the Services, you consent to your information being transferred to our facilities and to the facilities of those third parties with whom we share it as described in this Privacy Policy.
Revisions to our Privacy Policy
We reserve the right to revise this Privacy Policy or any part of it from time to time. Please review this Privacy Policy periodically for changes. If we make material changes, we will endeavor to provide notice ahead of such changes, such as by email or through a notice at the website.

You’re
training hard
every day with your program, going heavy on the weights and sweating up a storm with
cardio
. News flash: While that’s critical to your ultimate success, it’s just not enough for you to
lose the excess fat
.
To reach your get-lean goal, you must also follow a get-lean diet, filled with the
best foods to burn fat
. Why? Even if you work out hard for an hour every day, that still leaves 23 more hours for you to wreck all your hard work in the gym with just one slip-up: a measly handful of chips, a beer with the guys, or a burger at lunch. Diet is a huge, so to speak, part of the
fat-loss
equation. It’s the backbone of your entire plan, the
foundation of a hard body
.
Bodybuilding nutrition consultant Jim Juge says nutrition determines your success or failure, plain and simple. “The diet is 65% of what you need to get in shape,” he says. Juge would know, as he’s helped countless dedicated people reach their goals, from achieving their best body ever to placing first in bodybuilding competitions.
You’ve got 28 days to get to your goal, so we’ve recruited Juge to help you every step of the way. He’s adapted a traditional bodybuilding competitor’s diet for a noncompetitor (that means you!) who wants to look his best, shedding as much fat as possible in a very short time. With just under a month, there’s no time to fool around, so get started on your
high-protein meal plan
now to lose weight and build muscle while you’re at it. Go to the grocery store and stock up tonight. Come breakfast time tomorrow, follow his plan as strictly as you can and get ready to show off those impressive muscles in a month.

Your Get-Lean Principles
Strict. Strict. Strict. This is your mantra for the next 28 days. There’s just no way around the diet, says Juge, and eating clean is the name of this get-lean game. Juge’s diet plan is filled with fresh, clean foods that are as unprocessed as possible. Here are his three simple principles to shed fat fast.
Eat at least 1g of protein per pound of bodyweight, daily. If your protein intake is too low on a restricted-calorie diet, you’ll lose a lot of muscle in addition to any fat you’re lucky enough to shed. A high-protein intake will help you preserve lean mass during your dieting phase. Choose lean, high-quality proteins like egg whites, poultry, lean red meat, and protein supplements. The diet provided here contains about 220-250g of protein daily, fine for a male weighing 200-250lbs. Up your protein only if you’re heavier than 250lbs, or you’re very hungry and need to add food during the day. Juge suggests an additional protein shake for an easy quick fix. (If you’re under 180lbs, cut out 3oz of meat or chicken per day from the diet.)
Keep your carbohydrates low to moderate when trying to lose weight. “On a low day you’ll have closer to 100g of carbs,” he says. “A moderate day is about 150g of carbs.” Juge prefers to rotate low and moderate days to keep energy high and provide a change of pace. Good, clean, fiber-rich carbs include oats, potatoes, rice, and whole-grain bread.
Drink at least a gallon of water per day. It’ll keep you hydrated and healthy. Water should be your primary beverage during dieting. Though many rely on diet sodas, Crystal Light, and other low-calorie sweetened drinks, plain old water is really your best bet.

How to Stay on Track
Habits and cravings are the devil when it comes to dieting. Let’s first deal with habits. Juge explains that it takes a good week or two to ease into dieting. “Fast food is so easy and there’s a McDonald’s on every corner. The hardest thing is to develop the new habit of preparing your meals and taking them with you.” The first week is the most difficult, so prepare yourself for some challenges as you abandon your usual routine. For example, you might usually go out for a sub sandwich or burger at lunch. You’ll now have to bring your food with you and resist the temptation of spicing up your meal with the Doritos in the vending machine or your usual can of Coke. It can be a real mental battle to stick to your food plan.
To stay motivated and deal with cravings, Juge has a couple of great recommendations. First, schedule a cheat meal on every seventh day. “Many of my clients have their cheat meal on Sunday, so then they’re ready for Monday and the week to come,” he says. If you feel deprived during the week, concentrate on the cheat meal to come, knowing you can eat absolutely anything you want to—pizza, lasagna, doughnuts, beer, chips, you name it. Remember, though, it’s just one cheat meal, not an entire day of cheating. Afterward, get right back on the wagon with your next scheduled meal.
Second, take a few photos of yourself to keep your motivation up. “Most of the people who come to me are doing it for a reason,” he explains. “They’re going on vacation, competing in a bodybuilding show, or maybe going to a reunion. I always have them strive for that goal. I take front, side, and back pictures of them at the beginning and have them post the photos on their mirror at home. I tell them, just keep looking at that picture and think of what you’re going to look like in a few weeks.”
When it comes to cravings, protein drinks and bars may also help cure your need for sugar, says Juge. He recommends mixing a flavored protein powder in a blender with as much ice as possible, so it’ll taste more like a milkshake. Day Five’s protein shake includes a cup of berries, which will also help with sugar cravings. Once or twice per week, Juge adds, you can have a low-sugar, high-protein bar. The newest varieties taste more like candy bars, with state-of-the-art sweetening techniques.
Your habits and cravings may both rear their heads at restaurants, where it’s easy to blow your diet in seconds. To stick to the plan, says Juge, be diligent in ordering. “Ask them to grill your meat without oil or grease. Ask for steamed vegetables with no butter. Get a salad (no cheese) with either fat-free dressing or a vinaigrette.” After his 14 years in bodybuilding, Juge testifies that he’s found many restaurants are accommodating, so there’s no reason to avoid them as long as they’ll cook to your preferences.

What to Expect
Some men can lose up to 5 lbs. per week, says Juge, if they follow the diet strictly. He recommends striving for a weekly 2- to 3-lb. loss for more lasting effects. “That way it’s not such a drastic change and you’ll be less likely to put all the weight back on when the diet’s done,” he adds. Weigh yourself naked just once per week, at the same time, preferably on the same scale. That way it’ll be as accurate as possible.
If you haven’t lost any weight after the first week, it may be time to troubleshoot. In addition to following an exercise program, Juge’s first line of defense is upping your cardio. Instead of one cardio session per day, he recommends doing 45 minutes of cardio in the morning on an empty stomach. Then add a second 30-minute session in the late afternoon or evening.
If that doesn’t stimulate weight loss, Juge’s second line of defense is to cut carbs slightly. On lower days, drop to 60-80g a day rather than 100. Eat this low-carb diet for two days, then insert one higher-carb day (150g).
Think of your nutritional plan as the anchor to stabilize all of your other efforts. Eating right will help you shed fat, increase your energy, and definitely look the way you want to. Follow this get-lean plan faithfully and you’ll be showing off your new, leaner body in less than a month.

Favorite Diet Foods
Here are Juge’s picks for the top three foods to turn to when you’re trying to shed fat.
Egg whites
“There’s no fat or cholesterol and they’re pure protein. They’re very easy to prepare—they take just a couple of minutes to make.”
Oatmeal
It’s low in sugar, high in fiber, and provides sustained energy. Choose the old-fashioned variety if you have a few minutes to spare, and the one-minute oats if you’re in a rush. In a pinch, you can even rip open a packet of instant oatmeal (plain flavor only)—just add hot water and stir.
Green veggies
They’re healthy and deliver many benefits, like fiber for improved digestion. They contain many valuable vitamins, phytochemicals, and antioxidants for better health. Plus, they’re bulky and fill you up for just a few grams of carbs per cup of veggies.
(
Quick tip:
To quickly steam veggies, put an inch or two of water in a bowl, add veggies, cover bowl, and microwave for 2-3 minutes.)

Maintain Your Gains
Your 28 days are up; you look great and want to keep it that way. Juge has an easy plan to maintain your body, yet enjoy greater flexibility with your diet. No.1, he says, is to eat a good, clean breakfast. If you’re at home, it’s much easier to do—just scramble a few egg whites and have a whole-grain item (whole-wheat bread or a bagel, for instance), and/or some fruit. Eat dinner at home, again a healthy, clean meal consisting of a lean protein source, green vegetable, and whole grains. Then, bring a protein shake or bar with you to work for a midday meal. “You’ve now got three clean meals taken care of,” says Juge. So if you’re eating at a restaurant at lunch and you want to have something different, you can have it. Just keep the rest of your meals pretty strict, without added sugars and fats.

You’re
training hard
every day with your program, going heavy on the weights and sweating up a storm with
cardio
. News flash: While that’s critical to your ultimate success, it’s just not enough for you to
lose the excess fat
.
To reach your get-lean goal, you must also follow a get-lean diet, filled with the
best foods to burn fat
. Why? Even if you work out hard for an hour every day, that still leaves 23 more hours for you to wreck all your hard work in the gym with just one slip-up: a measly handful of chips, a beer with the guys, or a burger at lunch. Diet is a huge, so to speak, part of the
fat-loss
equation. It’s the backbone of your entire plan, the
foundation of a hard body
.
Bodybuilding nutrition consultant Jim Juge says nutrition determines your success or failure, plain and simple. “The diet is 65% of what you need to get in shape,” he says. Juge would know, as he’s helped countless dedicated people reach their goals, from achieving their best body ever to placing first in bodybuilding competitions.
You’ve got 28 days to get to your goal, so we’ve recruited Juge to help you every step of the way. He’s adapted a traditional bodybuilding competitor’s diet for a noncompetitor (that means you!) who wants to look his best, shedding as much fat as possible in a very short time. With just under a month, there’s no time to fool around, so get started on your
high-protein meal plan
now to lose weight and build muscle while you’re at it. Go to the grocery store and stock up tonight. Come breakfast time tomorrow, follow his plan as strictly as you can and get ready to show off those impressive muscles in a month.

Your Get-Lean Principles
Strict. Strict. Strict. This is your mantra for the next 28 days. There’s just no way around the diet, says Juge, and eating clean is the name of this get-lean game. Juge’s diet plan is filled with fresh, clean foods that are as unprocessed as possible. Here are his three simple principles to shed fat fast.
Eat at least 1g of protein per pound of bodyweight, daily. If your protein intake is too low on a restricted-calorie diet, you’ll lose a lot of muscle in addition to any fat you’re lucky enough to shed. A high-protein intake will help you preserve lean mass during your dieting phase. Choose lean, high-quality proteins like egg whites, poultry, lean red meat, and protein supplements. The diet provided here contains about 220-250g of protein daily, fine for a male weighing 200-250lbs. Up your protein only if you’re heavier than 250lbs, or you’re very hungry and need to add food during the day. Juge suggests an additional protein shake for an easy quick fix. (If you’re under 180lbs, cut out 3oz of meat or chicken per day from the diet.)
Keep your carbohydrates low to moderate when trying to lose weight. “On a low day you’ll have closer to 100g of carbs,” he says. “A moderate day is about 150g of carbs.” Juge prefers to rotate low and moderate days to keep energy high and provide a change of pace. Good, clean, fiber-rich carbs include oats, potatoes, rice, and whole-grain bread.
Drink at least a gallon of water per day. It’ll keep you hydrated and healthy. Water should be your primary beverage during dieting. Though many rely on diet sodas, Crystal Light, and other low-calorie sweetened drinks, plain old water is really your best bet.

How to Stay on Track
Habits and cravings are the devil when it comes to dieting. Let’s first deal with habits. Juge explains that it takes a good week or two to ease into dieting. “Fast food is so easy and there’s a McDonald’s on every corner. The hardest thing is to develop the new habit of preparing your meals and taking them with you.” The first week is the most difficult, so prepare yourself for some challenges as you abandon your usual routine. For example, you might usually go out for a sub sandwich or burger at lunch. You’ll now have to bring your food with you and resist the temptation of spicing up your meal with the Doritos in the vending machine or your usual can of Coke. It can be a real mental battle to stick to your food plan.
To stay motivated and deal with cravings, Juge has a couple of great recommendations. First, schedule a cheat meal on every seventh day. “Many of my clients have their cheat meal on Sunday, so then they’re ready for Monday and the week to come,” he says. If you feel deprived during the week, concentrate on the cheat meal to come, knowing you can eat absolutely anything you want to—pizza, lasagna, doughnuts, beer, chips, you name it. Remember, though, it’s just one cheat meal, not an entire day of cheating. Afterward, get right back on the wagon with your next scheduled meal.
Second, take a few photos of yourself to keep your motivation up. “Most of the people who come to me are doing it for a reason,” he explains. “They’re going on vacation, competing in a bodybuilding show, or maybe going to a reunion. I always have them strive for that goal. I take front, side, and back pictures of them at the beginning and have them post the photos on their mirror at home. I tell them, just keep looking at that picture and think of what you’re going to look like in a few weeks.”
When it comes to cravings, protein drinks and bars may also help cure your need for sugar, says Juge. He recommends mixing a flavored protein powder in a blender with as much ice as possible, so it’ll taste more like a milkshake. Day Five’s protein shake includes a cup of berries, which will also help with sugar cravings. Once or twice per week, Juge adds, you can have a low-sugar, high-protein bar. The newest varieties taste more like candy bars, with state-of-the-art sweetening techniques.
Your habits and cravings may both rear their heads at restaurants, where it’s easy to blow your diet in seconds. To stick to the plan, says Juge, be diligent in ordering. “Ask them to grill your meat without oil or grease. Ask for steamed vegetables with no butter. Get a salad (no cheese) with either fat-free dressing or a vinaigrette.” After his 14 years in bodybuilding, Juge testifies that he’s found many restaurants are accommodating, so there’s no reason to avoid them as long as they’ll cook to your preferences.

What to Expect
Some men can lose up to 5 lbs. per week, says Juge, if they follow the diet strictly. He recommends striving for a weekly 2- to 3-lb. loss for more lasting effects. “That way it’s not such a drastic change and you’ll be less likely to put all the weight back on when the diet’s done,” he adds. Weigh yourself naked just once per week, at the same time, preferably on the same scale. That way it’ll be as accurate as possible.
If you haven’t lost any weight after the first week, it may be time to troubleshoot. In addition to following an exercise program, Juge’s first line of defense is upping your cardio. Instead of one cardio session per day, he recommends doing 45 minutes of cardio in the morning on an empty stomach. Then add a second 30-minute session in the late afternoon or evening.
If that doesn’t stimulate weight loss, Juge’s second line of defense is to cut carbs slightly. On lower days, drop to 60-80g a day rather than 100. Eat this low-carb diet for two days, then insert one higher-carb day (150g).
Think of your nutritional plan as the anchor to stabilize all of your other efforts. Eating right will help you shed fat, increase your energy, and definitely look the way you want to. Follow this get-lean plan faithfully and you’ll be showing off your new, leaner body in less than a month.

Favorite Diet Foods
Here are Juge’s picks for the top three foods to turn to when you’re trying to shed fat.
Egg whites
“There’s no fat or cholesterol and they’re pure protein. They’re very easy to prepare—they take just a couple of minutes to make.”
Oatmeal
It’s low in sugar, high in fiber, and provides sustained energy. Choose the old-fashioned variety if you have a few minutes to spare, and the one-minute oats if you’re in a rush. In a pinch, you can even rip open a packet of instant oatmeal (plain flavor only)—just add hot water and stir.
Green veggies
They’re healthy and deliver many benefits, like fiber for improved digestion. They contain many valuable vitamins, phytochemicals, and antioxidants for better health. Plus, they’re bulky and fill you up for just a few grams of carbs per cup of veggies.
(
Quick tip:
To quickly steam veggies, put an inch or two of water in a bowl, add veggies, cover bowl, and microwave for 2-3 minutes.)

Maintain Your Gains
Your 28 days are up; you look great and want to keep it that way. Juge has an easy plan to maintain your body, yet enjoy greater flexibility with your diet. No.1, he says, is to eat a good, clean breakfast. If you’re at home, it’s much easier to do—just scramble a few egg whites and have a whole-grain item (whole-wheat bread or a bagel, for instance), and/or some fruit. Eat dinner at home, again a healthy, clean meal consisting of a lean protein source, green vegetable, and whole grains. Then, bring a protein shake or bar with you to work for a midday meal. “You’ve now got three clean meals taken care of,” says Juge. So if you’re eating at a restaurant at lunch and you want to have something different, you can have it. Just keep the rest of your meals pretty strict, without added sugars and fats.

You’re
training hard
every day with your program, going heavy on the weights and sweating up a storm with
cardio
. News flash: While that’s critical to your ultimate success, it’s just not enough for you to
lose the excess fat
.
To reach your get-lean goal, you must also follow a get-lean diet, filled with the
best foods to burn fat
. Why? Even if you work out hard for an hour every day, that still leaves 23 more hours for you to wreck all your hard work in the gym with just one slip-up: a measly handful of chips, a beer with the guys, or a burger at lunch. Diet is a huge, so to speak, part of the
fat-loss
equation. It’s the backbone of your entire plan, the
foundation of a hard body
.
Bodybuilding nutrition consultant Jim Juge says nutrition determines your success or failure, plain and simple. “The diet is 65% of what you need to get in shape,” he says. Juge would know, as he’s helped countless dedicated people reach their goals, from achieving their best body ever to placing first in bodybuilding competitions.
You’ve got 28 days to get to your goal, so we’ve recruited Juge to help you every step of the way. He’s adapted a traditional bodybuilding competitor’s diet for a noncompetitor (that means you!) who wants to look his best, shedding as much fat as possible in a very short time. With just under a month, there’s no time to fool around, so get started on your
high-protein meal plan
now to lose weight and build muscle while you’re at it. Go to the grocery store and stock up tonight. Come breakfast time tomorrow, follow his plan as strictly as you can and get ready to show off those impressive muscles in a month.

Your Get-Lean Principles
Strict. Strict. Strict. This is your mantra for the next 28 days. There’s just no way around the diet, says Juge, and eating clean is the name of this get-lean game. Juge’s diet plan is filled with fresh, clean foods that are as unprocessed as possible. Here are his three simple principles to shed fat fast.
Eat at least 1g of protein per pound of bodyweight, daily. If your protein intake is too low on a restricted-calorie diet, you’ll lose a lot of muscle in addition to any fat you’re lucky enough to shed. A high-protein intake will help you preserve lean mass during your dieting phase. Choose lean, high-quality proteins like egg whites, poultry, lean red meat, and protein supplements. The diet provided here contains about 220-250g of protein daily, fine for a male weighing 200-250lbs. Up your protein only if you’re heavier than 250lbs, or you’re very hungry and need to add food during the day. Juge suggests an additional protein shake for an easy quick fix. (If you’re under 180lbs, cut out 3oz of meat or chicken per day from the diet.)
Keep your carbohydrates low to moderate when trying to lose weight. “On a low day you’ll have closer to 100g of carbs,” he says. “A moderate day is about 150g of carbs.” Juge prefers to rotate low and moderate days to keep energy high and provide a change of pace. Good, clean, fiber-rich carbs include oats, potatoes, rice, and whole-grain bread.
Drink at least a gallon of water per day. It’ll keep you hydrated and healthy. Water should be your primary beverage during dieting. Though many rely on diet sodas, Crystal Light, and other low-calorie sweetened drinks, plain old water is really your best bet.

How to Stay on Track
Habits and cravings are the devil when it comes to dieting. Let’s first deal with habits. Juge explains that it takes a good week or two to ease into dieting. “Fast food is so easy and there’s a McDonald’s on every corner. The hardest thing is to develop the new habit of preparing your meals and taking them with you.” The first week is the most difficult, so prepare yourself for some challenges as you abandon your usual routine. For example, you might usually go out for a sub sandwich or burger at lunch. You’ll now have to bring your food with you and resist the temptation of spicing up your meal with the Doritos in the vending machine or your usual can of Coke. It can be a real mental battle to stick to your food plan.
To stay motivated and deal with cravings, Juge has a couple of great recommendations. First, schedule a cheat meal on every seventh day. “Many of my clients have their cheat meal on Sunday, so then they’re ready for Monday and the week to come,” he says. If you feel deprived during the week, concentrate on the cheat meal to come, knowing you can eat absolutely anything you want to—pizza, lasagna, doughnuts, beer, chips, you name it. Remember, though, it’s just one cheat meal, not an entire day of cheating. Afterward, get right back on the wagon with your next scheduled meal.
Second, take a few photos of yourself to keep your motivation up. “Most of the people who come to me are doing it for a reason,” he explains. “They’re going on vacation, competing in a bodybuilding show, or maybe going to a reunion. I always have them strive for that goal. I take front, side, and back pictures of them at the beginning and have them post the photos on their mirror at home. I tell them, just keep looking at that picture and think of what you’re going to look like in a few weeks.”
When it comes to cravings, protein drinks and bars may also help cure your need for sugar, says Juge. He recommends mixing a flavored protein powder in a blender with as much ice as possible, so it’ll taste more like a milkshake. Day Five’s protein shake includes a cup of berries, which will also help with sugar cravings. Once or twice per week, Juge adds, you can have a low-sugar, high-protein bar. The newest varieties taste more like candy bars, with state-of-the-art sweetening techniques.
Your habits and cravings may both rear their heads at restaurants, where it’s easy to blow your diet in seconds. To stick to the plan, says Juge, be diligent in ordering. “Ask them to grill your meat without oil or grease. Ask for steamed vegetables with no butter. Get a salad (no cheese) with either fat-free dressing or a vinaigrette.” After his 14 years in bodybuilding, Juge testifies that he’s found many restaurants are accommodating, so there’s no reason to avoid them as long as they’ll cook to your preferences.

What to Expect
Some men can lose up to 5 lbs. per week, says Juge, if they follow the diet strictly. He recommends striving for a weekly 2- to 3-lb. loss for more lasting effects. “That way it’s not such a drastic change and you’ll be less likely to put all the weight back on when the diet’s done,” he adds. Weigh yourself naked just once per week, at the same time, preferably on the same scale. That way it’ll be as accurate as possible.
If you haven’t lost any weight after the first week, it may be time to troubleshoot. In addition to following an exercise program, Juge’s first line of defense is upping your cardio. Instead of one cardio session per day, he recommends doing 45 minutes of cardio in the morning on an empty stomach. Then add a second 30-minute session in the late afternoon or evening.
If that doesn’t stimulate weight loss, Juge’s second line of defense is to cut carbs slightly. On lower days, drop to 60-80g a day rather than 100. Eat this low-carb diet for two days, then insert one higher-carb day (150g).
Think of your nutritional plan as the anchor to stabilize all of your other efforts. Eating right will help you shed fat, increase your energy, and definitely look the way you want to. Follow this get-lean plan faithfully and you’ll be showing off your new, leaner body in less than a month.

Favorite Diet Foods
Here are Juge’s picks for the top three foods to turn to when you’re trying to shed fat.
Egg whites
“There’s no fat or cholesterol and they’re pure protein. They’re very easy to prepare—they take just a couple of minutes to make.”
Oatmeal
It’s low in sugar, high in fiber, and provides sustained energy. Choose the old-fashioned variety if you have a few minutes to spare, and the one-minute oats if you’re in a rush. In a pinch, you can even rip open a packet of instant oatmeal (plain flavor only)—just add hot water and stir.
Green veggies
They’re healthy and deliver many benefits, like fiber for improved digestion. They contain many valuable vitamins, phytochemicals, and antioxidants for better health. Plus, they’re bulky and fill you up for just a few grams of carbs per cup of veggies.
(
Quick tip:
To quickly steam veggies, put an inch or two of water in a bowl, add veggies, cover bowl, and microwave for 2-3 minutes.)

Maintain Your Gains
Your 28 days are up; you look great and want to keep it that way. Juge has an easy plan to maintain your body, yet enjoy greater flexibility with your diet. No.1, he says, is to eat a good, clean breakfast. If you’re at home, it’s much easier to do—just scramble a few egg whites and have a whole-grain item (whole-wheat bread or a bagel, for instance), and/or some fruit. Eat dinner at home, again a healthy, clean meal consisting of a lean protein source, green vegetable, and whole grains. Then, bring a protein shake or bar with you to work for a midday meal. “You’ve now got three clean meals taken care of,” says Juge. So if you’re eating at a restaurant at lunch and you want to have something different, you can have it. Just keep the rest of your meals pretty strict, without added sugars and fats.

If you are seeking advice on how to increase your bench press max, you’ve probably discovered that there’s no shortage of experts and theories for you to sink your teeth into, but when it comes to learning from the best, you can’t do much better than the
teachings of a world record breaker
. Bill Gillespie shocked the world in January when, at age 62, he lifted 1,129.9 pounds and became the champion of the equipped bench press before triumphantly retiring from active competition, thus completing a 50-year journey of trial and error that serves as a great blue print for lifters of all abilities.
M&F
sat down with the man mountain from Virginia, to discover the “dos” and “don’ts” for besting the bench.
“Big Bill” was given his first weight set at 14, fueling a passion for powerlifting that he later passed on to his son, and fellow lifter, Cameron Gillespie. “I did pushups, situps, whatever I could do to get strong,” says the record-breaker. “As soon as I was old enough to know that there was such a thing as muscles, and being strong, I wanted to be strong.” It was a desire that his mom used to great advantage, having him do yard work and various household chores to
keep those muscles working
. That early hardcore training mentality served him well because not only did Gillespie make a career from strength, including a coaching role with the Seattle Seahawks, but he also now gets to share his knowledge with all types of athletes as a strength coach for
Sorinex
.
Don’t:
Train to your maximum lift during each session
“
Speed training and strength training go hand-in-hand
,” says Gillespie. “When we come into the weight room, we get this bodybuilding confusion of what we do and we want to go and push the limits of the repetitions. So, when moving the weight, instead of doing it 6 times, we’ll go and do it 10 or 12 times. Yes, we can do it, and yes we might be capable, but the problem is that the last few reps are so slow that you are over straining, you are frying the nervous system and you are not training for speed and explosion. The secret to putting up big weights is to be able to exhibit your strength in a shorter period of time. The heavier the weight gets, the shorter amount of time you have to exhibit your strength”
Gillespie says that the sweet spot for making bench press gains is to practice three times per week. “Here’s the biggest mistake people make,” shares Gillespie. “If my training max is 400 pounds, and then all of a sudden, I hit 450 for my max, everybody goes to 450 for their new training max. It’s the worst mistake you can make. I would go to 402.5-Pounds. Because if
I’m making great gains at 400 pounds, I’m going to
continue to make great gains
as my body adapts to the work capacity. What people are doing is putting the cart before the horse. You want to focus on developing your work capacity by slowly progressing and making the body change and then the big numbers will come.”
Do:
Develop your upper back
View this post on Instagram
A post shared by Bill Gillespie (@master_strength_)
“Pullups are the key exercise,” shares Gillespie, who was coached by
Ed Coan
and found himself in awe of Coan’s own back development. “I looked at him, and I saw that upper-back he had, and I thought, ‘Wait a minute. I’ve seen guys bench press a lot of weight with small arms and small chests, but all the great lifters have big backs!”
Bill Gillespie
practiced his pullups
six times per week, but never went above 6 reps so that he didn’t fatigue himself too much before a lift. “The more I did pullups, the more my bench went up,” shares Gillespie.
Don’t:
Waste your energy before a big lift
Many champion lifters pre-empt their lifts with a number of rituals in order to dial in, and focus themselves mentally. Some of these athletes have a war cry and others prefer to dance, to get themselves into the zone. For this record breaker, however, conserving your energy is more important than emotional outbursts.
“When people see me lift, they think that I’m not very focussed because I don’t get very outwardly emotional,” says Gillespie. “But I’ve learned that the bench press is a very high energy consumption exercise, and you have to watch your energy levels very carefully. The mental focus comes from the discipline of the preparation.”
Do:
Concentrate on the bigger picture
The reality was that other factors were negatively impacting Gillespie rather than his genetics or the brief part of his day that was spent on the bench. A relatable drag on his lift was the 60 to 70 hours he was working in the day job. So, when Gillespie was hired by Sorinex, as a strength coach, he was able to dedicate more to his lift and essentially the bigger picture in terms of his lifestyle. “It gave me the opportunity to train, recover, and Sorinex supplied me with Thorne supplements. Now, with the whole package, things took off. At 59, my bench press went to 855, 900 and 1,000-plus pounds. At that point I realized, that if I dedicated myself, I’d have a chance [at breaking the record]. I poured everything I had into it, and I hurt lots, but I was determined even with everyone around me, telling me that I should quit.”
Don’t:
Convince yourself that champion lifters are ‘born gifted’
Courtesy of Bill Gillespie
If you are just getting started with any type of weightlifting, but are feeling dejected because progress may be slow, don’t convince yourself that champion lifters are all born gifted.
“You know what? I was incredibly weak. I was not gifted at the bench press,” shares Gillespie. “By far, I’m not even the strongest guy that I’ve ever trained with. When I was in the ninth grade, I did 600 pushups per day, I worked out all the time, I was an All-American shot putter, so I should have been pretty strong. But I went to the first drug free nationals in 1983 and I bench-pressed 341 pounds that day. I sucked at the bench press and I just thought that genetically I had a weak upper-body. I wasn’t that gifted. At the age of 35, by bench was stuck at around 450 pounds. Never did I think, until about two years ago, that I was going to be the guy that would stand on top of that mountain with the number 1 bench.”
Do:
Know your opponent
Bill Gillespie says that understanding how the weight moves, and practicing slight variations in your grips and positioning is essential for mastering the bench press. If you think that your only opponent is yourself, you might want to give a bit more credit to the barbell and plates that you need to lift.
Getting to know the weight and becoming familiar with each load is essential to your preparation. “You know, that 1,000 pounds doesn’t have a bad day,” says Gillespie. “You can’t do it reluctantly. If you do it reluctantly, you are going to get negative results. You’ve got to find a way to go in there, be positive, enthusiastic and maximize that moment.”
Don’t:
Give up (but say your prayers!)
View this post on Instagram
A post shared by Bill Gillespie (@master_strength_)
There’s no doubt about it;: Failing sucks. But quitters never win, and winners never quit. “I missed the world record on 20 different attempts in a row,” says Gillespie. “I came into the meet (on Jan. 22nd), and I had been in an adverse situation the night before, where it was snowing and I’m going down the highway. Someone did not properly secure a ladder in their truck and it came out of the truck. I hit it, blew out my front tire and I had to spend 3 1/2 hours changing the tire in the dark and freezing rain with 800 pounds loaded in the back of my truck … and the lug nuts were ceased. I was exhausted, my arms were killing me and I was thinking to myself that there was no way in this world that I’m going to get that bench press record the next day, but I said ‘you know what? It is what it is, and I gotta go try.”
The next day, Gillespie went into the “365 Strong New Year Power Bash” and missed his first attempt pretty badly. His second attempt failed too. But on the third attempt, he focused and prayed to God, thanking him for the 50-year journey with strength that he’d enjoyed to date. Big Bill moved his grip out an eighth of an inch and this time brought the bar down a little faster under the guidance of the good Lord, and with every ounce of energy and strength that Gillespie had in his soul, the strongman pressed the barbell skyward to shatter the world record at 1,129.9 pounds.
As is the inevitable truth of world records, it was broken again in February, when Jimmy Kolb pressed 1,320 pounds at the IPA Pennsylvania State Powerlifting championships, but for Bill Gillespie, this in no way diminishes the heart and fire that was displayed on his most successful day of lifting. “Records are made to be broken, that’s fine, but what they can’t take away from me is that 50-year journey.” This bench-pressing legend serves as inspiration to anyone who wishes to up their game.

If you are seeking advice on how to increase your bench press max, you’ve probably discovered that there’s no shortage of experts and theories for you to sink your teeth into, but when it comes to learning from the best, you can’t do much better than the
teachings of a world record breaker
. Bill Gillespie shocked the world in January when, at age 62, he lifted 1,129.9 pounds and became the champion of the equipped bench press before triumphantly retiring from active competition, thus completing a 50-year journey of trial and error that serves as a great blue print for lifters of all abilities.
M&F
sat down with the man mountain from Virginia, to discover the “dos” and “don’ts” for besting the bench.
“Big Bill” was given his first weight set at 14, fueling a passion for powerlifting that he later passed on to his son, and fellow lifter, Cameron Gillespie. “I did pushups, situps, whatever I could do to get strong,” says the record-breaker. “As soon as I was old enough to know that there was such a thing as muscles, and being strong, I wanted to be strong.” It was a desire that his mom used to great advantage, having him do yard work and various household chores to
keep those muscles working
. That early hardcore training mentality served him well because not only did Gillespie make a career from strength, including a coaching role with the Seattle Seahawks, but he also now gets to share his knowledge with all types of athletes as a strength coach for
Sorinex
.
Don’t:
Train to your maximum lift during each session
“
Speed training and strength training go hand-in-hand
,” says Gillespie. “When we come into the weight room, we get this bodybuilding confusion of what we do and we want to go and push the limits of the repetitions. So, when moving the weight, instead of doing it 6 times, we’ll go and do it 10 or 12 times. Yes, we can do it, and yes we might be capable, but the problem is that the last few reps are so slow that you are over straining, you are frying the nervous system and you are not training for speed and explosion. The secret to putting up big weights is to be able to exhibit your strength in a shorter period of time. The heavier the weight gets, the shorter amount of time you have to exhibit your strength”
Gillespie says that the sweet spot for making bench press gains is to practice three times per week. “Here’s the biggest mistake people make,” shares Gillespie. “If my training max is 400 pounds, and then all of a sudden, I hit 450 for my max, everybody goes to 450 for their new training max. It’s the worst mistake you can make. I would go to 402.5-Pounds. Because if
I’m making great gains at 400 pounds, I’m going to
continue to make great gains
as my body adapts to the work capacity. What people are doing is putting the cart before the horse. You want to focus on developing your work capacity by slowly progressing and making the body change and then the big numbers will come.”
Do:
Develop your upper back

A post shared by Bill Gillespie (@master_strength_)
“Pullups are the key exercise,” shares Gillespie, who was coached by
Ed Coan
and found himself in awe of Coan’s own back development. “I looked at him, and I saw that upper-back he had, and I thought, ‘Wait a minute. I’ve seen guys bench press a lot of weight with small arms and small chests, but all the great lifters have big backs!”
Bill Gillespie
practiced his pullups
six times per week, but never went above 6 reps so that he didn’t fatigue himself too much before a lift. “The more I did pullups, the more my bench went up,” shares Gillespie.
Don’t:
Waste your energy before a big lift
Many champion lifters pre-empt their lifts with a number of rituals in order to dial in, and focus themselves mentally. Some of these athletes have a war cry and others prefer to dance, to get themselves into the zone. For this record breaker, however, conserving your energy is more important than emotional outbursts.
“When people see me lift, they think that I’m not very focussed because I don’t get very outwardly emotional,” says Gillespie. “But I’ve learned that the bench press is a very high energy consumption exercise, and you have to watch your energy levels very carefully. The mental focus comes from the discipline of the preparation.”
Do:
Concentrate on the bigger picture
The reality was that other factors were negatively impacting Gillespie rather than his genetics or the brief part of his day that was spent on the bench. A relatable drag on his lift was the 60 to 70 hours he was working in the day job. So, when Gillespie was hired by Sorinex, as a strength coach, he was able to dedicate more to his lift and essentially the bigger picture in terms of his lifestyle. “It gave me the opportunity to train, recover, and Sorinex supplied me with Thorne supplements. Now, with the whole package, things took off. At 59, my bench press went to 855, 900 and 1,000-plus pounds. At that point I realized, that if I dedicated myself, I’d have a chance [at breaking the record]. I poured everything I had into it, and I hurt lots, but I was determined even with everyone around me, telling me that I should quit.”
Don’t:
Convince yourself that champion lifters are ‘born gifted’
Courtesy of Bill Gillespie
If you are just getting started with any type of weightlifting, but are feeling dejected because progress may be slow, don’t convince yourself that champion lifters are all born gifted.
“You know what? I was incredibly weak. I was not gifted at the bench press,” shares Gillespie. “By far, I’m not even the strongest guy that I’ve ever trained with. When I was in the ninth grade, I did 600 pushups per day, I worked out all the time, I was an All-American shot putter, so I should have been pretty strong. But I went to the first drug free nationals in 1983 and I bench-pressed 341 pounds that day. I sucked at the bench press and I just thought that genetically I had a weak upper-body. I wasn’t that gifted. At the age of 35, by bench was stuck at around 450 pounds. Never did I think, until about two years ago, that I was going to be the guy that would stand on top of that mountain with the number 1 bench.”
Do:
Know your opponent
Bill Gillespie says that understanding how the weight moves, and practicing slight variations in your grips and positioning is essential for mastering the bench press. If you think that your only opponent is yourself, you might want to give a bit more credit to the barbell and plates that you need to lift.
Getting to know the weight and becoming familiar with each load is essential to your preparation. “You know, that 1,000 pounds doesn’t have a bad day,” says Gillespie. “You can’t do it reluctantly. If you do it reluctantly, you are going to get negative results. You’ve got to find a way to go in there, be positive, enthusiastic and maximize that moment.”
Don’t:
Give up (but say your prayers!)

A post shared by Bill Gillespie (@master_strength_)
There’s no doubt about it;: Failing sucks. But quitters never win, and winners never quit. “I missed the world record on 20 different attempts in a row,” says Gillespie. “I came into the meet (on Jan. 22nd), and I had been in an adverse situation the night before, where it was snowing and I’m going down the highway. Someone did not properly secure a ladder in their truck and it came out of the truck. I hit it, blew out my front tire and I had to spend 3 1/2 hours changing the tire in the dark and freezing rain with 800 pounds loaded in the back of my truck … and the lug nuts were ceased. I was exhausted, my arms were killing me and I was thinking to myself that there was no way in this world that I’m going to get that bench press record the next day, but I said ‘you know what? It is what it is, and I gotta go try.”
The next day, Gillespie went into the “365 Strong New Year Power Bash” and missed his first attempt pretty badly. His second attempt failed too. But on the third attempt, he focused and prayed to God, thanking him for the 50-year journey with strength that he’d enjoyed to date. Big Bill moved his grip out an eighth of an inch and this time brought the bar down a little faster under the guidance of the good Lord, and with every ounce of energy and strength that Gillespie had in his soul, the strongman pressed the barbell skyward to shatter the world record at 1,129.9 pounds.
As is the inevitable truth of world records, it was broken again in February, when Jimmy Kolb pressed 1,320 pounds at the IPA Pennsylvania State Powerlifting championships, but for Bill Gillespie, this in no way diminishes the heart and fire that was displayed on his most successful day of lifting. “Records are made to be broken, that’s fine, but what they can’t take away from me is that 50-year journey.” This bench-pressing legend serves as inspiration to anyone who wishes to up their game.

So, when Gillespie was hired by Sorinex, as a strength coach, he was able to dedicate more to his lift and essentially the bigger picture in terms of his lifestyle. “It gave me the opportunity to train, recover, and Sorinex supplied me with Thorne supplements. Now, with the whole package, things took off. At 59, my bench press went to 855, 900 and 1,000-plus pounds. At that point I realized, that if I dedicated myself, I’d have a chance [at breaking the record]. I poured everything I had into it, and I hurt lots, but I was determined even with everyone around me, telling me that I should quit.”
Don’t:
Convince yourself that champion lifters are ‘born gifted’
Courtesy of Bill Gillespie
If you are just getting started with any type of weightlifting, but are feeling dejected because progress may be slow, don’t convince yourself that champion lifters are all born gifted.
“You know what? I was incredibly weak. I was not gifted at the bench press,” shares Gillespie. “By far, I’m not even the strongest guy that I’ve ever trained with. When I was in the ninth grade, I did 600 pushups per day, I worked out all the time, I was an All-American shot putter, so I should have been pretty strong. But I went to the first drug free nationals in 1983 and I bench-pressed 341 pounds that day. I sucked at the bench press and I just thought that genetically I had a weak upper-body. I wasn’t that gifted. At the age of 35, by bench was stuck at around 450 pounds. Never did I think, until about two years ago, that I was going to be the guy that would stand on top of that mountain with the number 1 bench.”
Do:
Know your opponent
Bill Gillespie says that understanding how the weight moves, and practicing slight variations in your grips and positioning is essential for mastering the bench press. If you think that your only opponent is yourself, you might want to give a bit more credit to the barbell and plates that you need to lift.
Getting to know the weight and becoming familiar with each load is essential to your preparation. “You know, that 1,000 pounds doesn’t have a bad day,” says Gillespie. “You can’t do it reluctantly. If you do it reluctantly, you are going to get negative results. You’ve got to find a way to go in there, be positive, enthusiastic and maximize that moment.”
Don’t:
Give up (but say your prayers!)

A post shared by Bill Gillespie (@master_strength_)
There’s no doubt about it;: Failing sucks. But quitters never win, and winners never quit. “I missed the world record on 20 different attempts in a row,” says Gillespie. “I came into the meet (on Jan. 22nd), and I had been in an adverse situation the night before, where it was snowing and I’m going down the highway. Someone did not properly secure a ladder in their truck and it came out of the truck. I hit it, blew out my front tire and I had to spend 3 1/2 hours changing the tire in the dark and freezing rain with 800 pounds loaded in the back of my truck … and the lug nuts were ceased. I was exhausted, my arms were killing me and I was thinking to myself that there was no way in this world that I’m going to get that bench press record the next day, but I said ‘you know what? It is what it is, and I gotta go try.”
The next day, Gillespie went into the “365 Strong New Year Power Bash” and missed his first attempt pretty badly. His second attempt failed too. But on the third attempt, he focused and prayed to God, thanking him for the 50-year journey with strength that he’d enjoyed to date. Big Bill moved his grip out an eighth of an inch and this time brought the bar down a little faster under the guidance of the good Lord, and with every ounce of energy and strength that Gillespie had in his soul, the strongman pressed the barbell skyward to shatter the world record at 1,129.9 pounds.
As is the inevitable truth of world records, it was broken again in February, when Jimmy Kolb pressed 1,320 pounds at the IPA Pennsylvania State Powerlifting championships, but for Bill Gillespie, this in no way diminishes the heart and fire that was displayed on his most successful day of lifting. “Records are made to be broken, that’s fine, but what they can’t take away from me is that 50-year journey.” This bench-pressing legend serves as inspiration to anyone who wishes to up their game.

I’m to be open with you all. I’ve been having some.. not very happy days recently. I often believe & preach that happiness is to be found within, but sometime she manages to be elusive. She is not about what you have, where you are at or who is around.  And finding her is the whole propuse of this fleeting existence.  May I ask you then, are you happy? Where do you find your happiness?

If you’re like us, you spend more time than you’d like to admit scrolling through your
Instagram
feed, admiring people with stories—and bodies—that’ll inspire you to bring everything you’ve got to your workout that day.
Instagram
is arguably the internet’s largest platform for fitness, and there are countless trainers and models providing followers with the motivation they need to stay consistent with their fitness regimens.
Since we’re spending so much time in the app (and posting on our Instagrams @
muscleandfitnesshers
and @
muscleandfitness
), the obvious next step is to make sure that we’re following influencers who inspire us with their badass workouts and fit physiques.
Here are some of the top female fitness trainers we’re crushing on (in no particular order) and think you’ll want to follow, too.

I’m to be open with you all. I’ve been having some.. not very happy days recently. I often believe & preach that happiness is to be found within, but sometime she manages to be elusive. She is not about what you have, where you are at or who is around.  And finding her is the whole propuse of this fleeting existence.  May I ask you then, are you happy? Where do you find your happiness?

If you’re like us, you spend more time than you’d like to admit scrolling through your
Instagram
feed, admiring people with stories—and bodies—that’ll inspire you to bring everything you’ve got to your workout that day.
Instagram
is arguably the internet’s largest platform for fitness, and there are countless trainers and models providing followers with the motivation they need to stay consistent with their fitness regimens.
Since we’re spending so much time in the app (and posting on our Instagrams @
muscleandfitnesshers
and @
muscleandfitness
), the obvious next step is to make sure that we’re following influencers who inspire us with their badass workouts and fit physiques.
Here are some of the top female fitness trainers we’re crushing on (in no particular order) and think you’ll want to follow, too.

I’m to be open with you all. I’ve been having some.. not very happy days recently. I often believe & preach that happiness is to be found within, but sometime she manages to be elusive. She is not about what you have, where you are at or who is around.  And finding her is the whole propuse of this fleeting existence.  May I ask you then, are you happy? Where do you find your happiness?

One of the biggest misconceptions around sprint training is that it can’t benefit you, the weekend warrior. For most of us who participated in youth sports, high school and maybe even college athletics, that might have been the peak as far as
athletic training
goes. From sprinting, jumping, and
plyometrics
—that all seems to cease once we no longer rely on our athleticism in our normal day-to-day.
Here, however, Greany explains that not just running, but the functional training that goes along with a good sprint training program, can help almost everyone improve their strength and explosiveness, elements we can’t afford to lose as we age.
“It’s OK to do some jump training, speed training, use the med ball, do sprints, and run up a hill,”
S&C coach Joey Greany, C.S.C.S
., said. “You can do that into your 40s and 50s — definitely into your 30s. But I think a lot of people, once they hit 20 to 25, they just completely cut out that type of training. If you want to stay young, look young, look athletic and be athletic, you need to include the speed and sprint training into your routine.”
The strength and conditioning coach for the Tampa Bay Rays provides this four-week, two-day-a-week sprint training program in which in you can develop sprinter like skills to tackle everyday life.

One of the biggest misconceptions around sprint training is that it can’t benefit you, the weekend warrior. For most of us who participated in youth sports, high school and maybe even college athletics, that might have been the peak as far as
athletic training
goes. From sprinting, jumping, and
plyometrics
—that all seems to cease once we no longer rely on our athleticism in our normal day-to-day.
Here, however, Greany explains that not just running, but the functional training that goes along with a good sprint training program, can help almost everyone improve their strength and explosiveness, elements we can’t afford to lose as we age.
“It’s OK to do some jump training, speed training, use the med ball, do sprints, and run up a hill,”
S&C coach Joey Greany, C.S.C.S
., said. “You can do that into your 40s and 50s — definitely into your 30s. But I think a lot of people, once they hit 20 to 25, they just completely cut out that type of training. If you want to stay young, look young, look athletic and be athletic, you need to include the speed and sprint training into your routine.”
The strength and conditioning coach for the Tampa Bay Rays provides this four-week, two-day-a-week sprint training program in which in you can develop sprinter like skills to tackle everyday life.

One of the biggest misconceptions around sprint training is that it can’t benefit you, the weekend warrior. For most of us who participated in youth sports, high school and maybe even college athletics, that might have been the peak as far as
athletic training
goes. From sprinting, jumping, and
plyometrics
—that all seems to cease once we no longer rely on our athleticism in our normal day-to-day.
Here, however, Greany explains that not just running, but the functional training that goes along with a good sprint training program, can help almost everyone improve their strength and explosiveness, elements we can’t afford to lose as we age.
“It’s OK to do some jump training, speed training, use the med ball, do sprints, and run up a hill,”
S&C coach Joey Greany, C.S.C.S
., said. “You can do that into your 40s and 50s — definitely into your 30s. But I think a lot of people, once they hit 20 to 25, they just completely cut out that type of training. If you want to stay young, look young, look athletic and be athletic, you need to include the speed and sprint training into your routine.”
The strength and conditioning coach for the Tampa Bay Rays provides this four-week, two-day-a-week sprint training program in which in you can develop sprinter like skills to tackle everyday life.

Fit to Serve is proudly sponsored by The Transcend Foundation.
United States Air Force Master Sergeant Chase Griffin has what he considers to be a beneficial and enjoyable job. Griffin works as a recruiter in Rockledge, Florida and speaks to high school students that may be interested in joining the military.
“I am very blessed to be where I am at.”
Griffin can speak about why the military can be such a life-changing decision because he knows it firsthand. He shared that he came from a broken home in Kansas, with his parents splitting up when he was very young. After going back and forth between his parents, his mother would get into trouble with drugs and be sentenced to prison. By the time he was in high school, he wasn’t living with either parent.
“I lived with my best friend and his parents. I slept on the couch.”
A blessing that came from his childhood was spending a lot of time outside, which kept him active. He recalled throwing hay bales, which he said served as his first connection to weightlifting. He also played various sports.
“It was always football, track, and wrestling when I was in junior high. I focused on football and wrestling in high school.”
He may not have known that the military would be his calling, but he did have family members that served. His maternal grandfather was in the Army, serving in the Criminal Investigation division. He passed away before Griffin was born, but he heard several stories about him and was proud to share how much of an impact he had.
“He was inducted into the Army CID Hall of Fame in 2017 or 2018,” he said. “It inspired me to at least think about the military.”
Because of the connection with his grandfather, he had considered the Army before the Air Force, but there was an Air National Guard base close to where he lived. A wrestling teammate from high school convinced him to join, and the rest was history.
“I joined on 16 December 2008.”
Even though he was in shape from playing sports, the introduction to service was a wake-up call that he had room for improvement, specifically with cardio.
He admitted, “The amount of cardio we had to do was a shock to me. I had always did the 100 meters in track but didn’t run much longer than that. I had to do a mile and a half run for the PT test. That was new to me.”
He obviously adjusted and began his career in ground transportation. He went to South Korea for that, followed by postal service in Germany. He then relocated to Florida, then back to South Korea, and Arizona, where he was in 2021 when he was tapped to take the position that he has now.
Chase Giffin
Looking back on his time traveling the world while serving his country, he had several proud moments. One of the proudest was when he was in South Korea and worked with the United States Secret Service while President Donald Trump was traveling to North Korea during peace treaty talks. Griffin was one of those that worked to ensure the transportation and protection went as planned. He even briefly met the 45th President.
“It’s not often you get to see the Commander-in-chief in person and shake his hand.”
As of 2024, Griffin covers five schools as a recruiter. He visits each school monthly to connect with students and share that the Air Force is an option they should consider. They don’t have to be locked into taking on student debt to get through college.
It is no secret that the military has been working hard to bring new members of the military in. Griffin feels that a combination of misinformation and lack of reliable information being shared is partly to blame for that.
“All of the branches deal with that,” he shared. One of the biggest misconceptions is that there is no option for further education, which is the furthest thing from the truth. Griffin himself has two Associate’s degrees, a bachelor’s degree and multiple certifications.
“The education opportunities are there.”
Besides increasing awareness of the facts of service, the husband and father can lean on his experience when he is talking to potential recruits because he can emphasize that joining the military can be a special opportunity to be a part of history in the making – one that can make kids today pivotal in world-changing events tomorrow.
“They can say that they helped support this. Without them, it may not have happened.”
He does advise students that they should start focusing on being in shape now before they commit. The standards for the Air Force are the same as the Department of Defense, but Griffin shared that whether students join or not, getting in shape is never a bad idea. That said, he has faith in the future of service for our country and freedom abroad, and he hopes more young people consider service.
“You can 100 percent get better, learn to follow, and learn to lead.”

Fit to Serve is proudly sponsored by The Transcend Foundation.
United States Air Force Master Sergeant Chase Griffin has what he considers to be a beneficial and enjoyable job. Griffin works as a recruiter in Rockledge, Florida and speaks to high school students that may be interested in joining the military.
“I am very blessed to be where I am at.”
Griffin can speak about why the military can be such a life-changing decision because he knows it firsthand. He shared that he came from a broken home in Kansas, with his parents splitting up when he was very young. After going back and forth between his parents, his mother would get into trouble with drugs and be sentenced to prison. By the time he was in high school, he wasn’t living with either parent.
“I lived with my best friend and his parents. I slept on the couch.”
A blessing that came from his childhood was spending a lot of time outside, which kept him active. He recalled throwing hay bales, which he said served as his first connection to weightlifting. He also played various sports.
“It was always football, track, and wrestling when I was in junior high. I focused on football and wrestling in high school.”
He may not have known that the military would be his calling, but he did have family members that served. His maternal grandfather was in the Army, serving in the Criminal Investigation division. He passed away before Griffin was born, but he heard several stories about him and was proud to share how much of an impact he had.
“He was inducted into the Army CID Hall of Fame in 2017 or 2018,” he said. “It inspired me to at least think about the military.”
Because of the connection with his grandfather, he had considered the Army before the Air Force, but there was an Air National Guard base close to where he lived. A wrestling teammate from high school convinced him to join, and the rest was history.
“I joined on 16 December 2008.”
Even though he was in shape from playing sports, the introduction to service was a wake-up call that he had room for improvement, specifically with cardio.
He admitted, “The amount of cardio we had to do was a shock to me. I had always did the 100 meters in track but didn’t run much longer than that. I had to do a mile and a half run for the PT test. That was new to me.”
He obviously adjusted and began his career in ground transportation. He went to South Korea for that, followed by postal service in Germany. He then relocated to Florida, then back to South Korea, and Arizona, where he was in 2021 when he was tapped to take the position that he has now.
Chase Giffin
Looking back on his time traveling the world while serving his country, he had several proud moments. One of the proudest was when he was in South Korea and worked with the United States Secret Service while President Donald Trump was traveling to North Korea during peace treaty talks. Griffin was one of those that worked to ensure the transportation and protection went as planned. He even briefly met the 45th President.
“It’s not often you get to see the Commander-in-chief in person and shake his hand.”
As of 2024, Griffin covers five schools as a recruiter. He visits each school monthly to connect with students and share that the Air Force is an option they should consider. They don’t have to be locked into taking on student debt to get through college.
It is no secret that the military has been working hard to bring new members of the military in. Griffin feels that a combination of misinformation and lack of reliable information being shared is partly to blame for that.
“All of the branches deal with that,” he shared. One of the biggest misconceptions is that there is no option for further education, which is the furthest thing from the truth. Griffin himself has two Associate’s degrees, a bachelor’s degree and multiple certifications.
“The education opportunities are there.”
Besides increasing awareness of the facts of service, the husband and father can lean on his experience when he is talking to potential recruits because he can emphasize that joining the military can be a special opportunity to be a part of history in the making – one that can make kids today pivotal in world-changing events tomorrow.
“They can say that they helped support this. Without them, it may not have happened.”
He does advise students that they should start focusing on being in shape now before they commit. The standards for the Air Force are the same as the Department of Defense, but Griffin shared that whether students join or not, getting in shape is never a bad idea. That said, he has faith in the future of service for our country and freedom abroad, and he hopes more young people consider service.
“You can 100 percent get better, learn to follow, and learn to lead.”

Fit to Serve is proudly sponsored by The Transcend Foundation.
United States Air Force Master Sergeant Chase Griffin has what he considers to be a beneficial and enjoyable job. Griffin works as a recruiter in Rockledge, Florida and speaks to high school students that may be interested in joining the military.
“I am very blessed to be where I am at.”
Griffin can speak about why the military can be such a life-changing decision because he knows it firsthand. He shared that he came from a broken home in Kansas, with his parents splitting up when he was very young. After going back and forth between his parents, his mother would get into trouble with drugs and be sentenced to prison. By the time he was in high school, he wasn’t living with either parent.
“I lived with my best friend and his parents. I slept on the couch.”
A blessing that came from his childhood was spending a lot of time outside, which kept him active. He recalled throwing hay bales, which he said served as his first connection to weightlifting. He also played various sports.
“It was always football, track, and wrestling when I was in junior high. I focused on football and wrestling in high school.”
He may not have known that the military would be his calling, but he did have family members that served. His maternal grandfather was in the Army, serving in the Criminal Investigation division. He passed away before Griffin was born, but he heard several stories about him and was proud to share how much of an impact he had.
“He was inducted into the Army CID Hall of Fame in 2017 or 2018,” he said. “It inspired me to at least think about the military.”
Because of the connection with his grandfather, he had considered the Army before the Air Force, but there was an Air National Guard base close to where he lived. A wrestling teammate from high school convinced him to join, and the rest was history.
“I joined on 16 December 2008.”
Even though he was in shape from playing sports, the introduction to service was a wake-up call that he had room for improvement, specifically with cardio.
He admitted, “The amount of cardio we had to do was a shock to me. I had always did the 100 meters in track but didn’t run much longer than that. I had to do a mile and a half run for the PT test. That was new to me.”
He obviously adjusted and began his career in ground transportation. He went to South Korea for that, followed by postal service in Germany. He then relocated to Florida, then back to South Korea, and Arizona, where he was in 2021 when he was tapped to take the position that he has now.
Chase Giffin
Looking back on his time traveling the world while serving his country, he had several proud moments. One of the proudest was when he was in South Korea and worked with the United States Secret Service while President Donald Trump was traveling to North Korea during peace treaty talks. Griffin was one of those that worked to ensure the transportation and protection went as planned. He even briefly met the 45th President.
“It’s not often you get to see the Commander-in-chief in person and shake his hand.”
As of 2024, Griffin covers five schools as a recruiter. He visits each school monthly to connect with students and share that the Air Force is an option they should consider. They don’t have to be locked into taking on student debt to get through college.
It is no secret that the military has been working hard to bring new members of the military in. Griffin feels that a combination of misinformation and lack of reliable information being shared is partly to blame for that.
“All of the branches deal with that,” he shared. One of the biggest misconceptions is that there is no option for further education, which is the furthest thing from the truth. Griffin himself has two Associate’s degrees, a bachelor’s degree and multiple certifications.
“The education opportunities are there.”
Besides increasing awareness of the facts of service, the husband and father can lean on his experience when he is talking to potential recruits because he can emphasize that joining the military can be a special opportunity to be a part of history in the making – one that can make kids today pivotal in world-changing events tomorrow.
“They can say that they helped support this. Without them, it may not have happened.”
He does advise students that they should start focusing on being in shape now before they commit. The standards for the Air Force are the same as the Department of Defense, but Griffin shared that whether students join or not, getting in shape is never a bad idea. That said, he has faith in the future of service for our country and freedom abroad, and he hopes more young people consider service.
“You can 100 percent get better, learn to follow, and learn to lead.”

Switching to outside training
can be a refreshing change regarding cardio. The fresh air, the extra space, and the touch of nature can transform a workout from a chore to an adventure. And the best part? You can achieve all this in just 15 minutes. This quick and intense outdoor strength and cardio workout routine is designed to make you sweat and smile while
fitting cardio into your busy (vacation) schedule
.
Here, I will introduce an effective outdoor cardio workout that can be done anywhere. Whether you’re tired of the treadmill or want to enjoy the outdoors, this 15-minute session will get your heart pumping and muscles burning (in a good way) in no time.
Here, we’ll explore why outdoor workouts can be a fantastic addition to your routine and how to maximize your time with this efficient, high-intensity workout. Ready to embrace the outdoors and transform your strength and cardio routine? Then let’s go.

Benefits of an Outdoor Strength and Cardio Workout
Exercising outdoors has four great benefits, in addition to relieving the boredom of the cardio machine and adding much-needed variety to your routine.
Mental Health Boost
There’s a reason why a stroll in the park feels so rejuvenating. Outdoor workouts tap into nature’s built-in stress relievers, significantly boosting your mental health.
Studies have shown
that fresh air, sunshine, and greenery can work wonders for your mood and stress.
Soak Up The Sun
One of the simplest benefits of taking your workout outside is the exposure to natural sunlight. This is your body’s best source of vitamin D, which is essential for bone health, immune function, and mood regulation.
Variety and Fun
Let’s face it: running on a treadmill or doing the same indoor routine is boring. When you take your cardio outdoors, the world becomes your gym. Hills, trails, parks, and even city streets provide a constantly changing environment that keeps things interesting. This variety can make your workout feel more like play and less like work, keeping you distracted from the pain.
Improved Cardiovascular Health
Combining fresher air and natural environments can further improve cardiovascular health, reducing the risk of heart disease. Plus, the refreshing breeze on your face and the rhythmic sound of your feet hitting the ground makes things more interesting.

Outdoor Workout Precautions
Before you jump in and take your cardio outdoors, ensure you have all your safety bases covered so your muscles and lungs are the only things burning.
Warm-Up and Cool-Down Importance
Before you dive in, remember that a solid warm-up and cool-down are non-negotiable. A dynamic warm-up gets your blood flowing, muscles ready, and mind focused, reducing the risk of injury. Conversely, cooling down helps your body transition back to a resting state, easing muscle tension and promoting recovery.
Hydration and Sun Protection
Staying hydrated is a must, especially when sweating outdoors. Bring a water bottle and take regular sips throughout your workout. Don’t wait until you’re thirsty—by then, you’re already on your way to dehydration. Also, wear sunscreen with at least SPF 30, and consider wearing lightweight, UV-protective clothing and a hat.
Weather Considerations
Mother Nature can be unpredictable, so always check the weather before heading out. If it’s cool, dress in layers; when it’s warm, opt for moisture-wicking fabrics to keep sweat at bay. In hot weather, exercise early in the morning or later in the evening when temperatures are cooler.
It all sounds like common sense, but you know what they say about common sense? It’s not all that common.
15 Minute Outdoor Strength and Cardio Workout
Okay, enough talk, and now it’s time for action. Here’s a bodyweight cardio workout that can be performed anywhere for your cardio pleasure. Combining strength and cardio exercises with getting up and down from the ground makes your heart happy. You, maybe not so much.
Instructions
Following each bodyweight strength exercise, there will be a cardio move for reps. You will have one minute to complete each of the five supersets below. If you finish before the minute is up, that is your rest before moving on to the next one. Complete three circuits in 15 minutes for your cardio goodness.a

Switching to outside training
can be a refreshing change regarding cardio. The fresh air, the extra space, and the touch of nature can transform a workout from a chore to an adventure. And the best part? You can achieve all this in just 15 minutes. This quick and intense outdoor strength and cardio workout routine is designed to make you sweat and smile while
fitting cardio into your busy (vacation) schedule
.
Here, I will introduce an effective outdoor cardio workout that can be done anywhere. Whether you’re tired of the treadmill or want to enjoy the outdoors, this 15-minute session will get your heart pumping and muscles burning (in a good way) in no time.
Here, we’ll explore why outdoor workouts can be a fantastic addition to your routine and how to maximize your time with this efficient, high-intensity workout. Ready to embrace the outdoors and transform your strength and cardio routine? Then let’s go.
Jacob Lund
Benefits of an Outdoor Strength and Cardio Workout
Exercising outdoors has four great benefits, in addition to relieving the boredom of the cardio machine and adding much-needed variety to your routine.
Mental Health Boost
There’s a reason why a stroll in the park feels so rejuvenating. Outdoor workouts tap into nature’s built-in stress relievers, significantly boosting your mental health.
Studies have shown
that fresh air, sunshine, and greenery can work wonders for your mood and stress.
Soak Up The Sun
One of the simplest benefits of taking your workout outside is the exposure to natural sunlight. This is your body’s best source of vitamin D, which is essential for bone health, immune function, and mood regulation.
Variety and Fun
Let’s face it: running on a treadmill or doing the same indoor routine is boring. When you take your cardio outdoors, the world becomes your gym. Hills, trails, parks, and even city streets provide a constantly changing environment that keeps things interesting. This variety can make your workout feel more like play and less like work, keeping you distracted from the pain.
Improved Cardiovascular Health
Combining fresher air and natural environments can further improve cardiovascular health, reducing the risk of heart disease. Plus, the refreshing breeze on your face and the rhythmic sound of your feet hitting the ground makes things more interesting.

Outdoor Workout Precautions
Before you jump in and take your cardio outdoors, ensure you have all your safety bases covered so your muscles and lungs are the only things burning.
Warm-Up and Cool-Down Importance
Before you dive in, remember that a solid warm-up and cool-down are non-negotiable. A dynamic warm-up gets your blood flowing, muscles ready, and mind focused, reducing the risk of injury. Conversely, cooling down helps your body transition back to a resting state, easing muscle tension and promoting recovery.
Hydration and Sun Protection
Staying hydrated is a must, especially when sweating outdoors. Bring a water bottle and take regular sips throughout your workout. Don’t wait until you’re thirsty—by then, you’re already on your way to dehydration. Also, wear sunscreen with at least SPF 30, and consider wearing lightweight, UV-protective clothing and a hat.
Weather Considerations
Mother Nature can be unpredictable, so always check the weather before heading out. If it’s cool, dress in layers; when it’s warm, opt for moisture-wicking fabrics to keep sweat at bay. In hot weather, exercise early in the morning or later in the evening when temperatures are cooler.
It all sounds like common sense, but you know what they say about common sense? It’s not all that common.
15 Minute Outdoor Strength and Cardio Workout
Okay, enough talk, and now it’s time for action. Here’s a bodyweight cardio workout that can be performed anywhere for your cardio pleasure. Combining strength and cardio exercises with getting up and down from the ground makes your heart happy. You, maybe not so much.
Instructions
Following each bodyweight strength exercise, there will be a cardio move for reps. You will have one minute to complete each of the five supersets below. If you finish before the minute is up, that is your rest before moving on to the next one. Complete three circuits in 15 minutes for your cardio goodness.a

Ryan Terry’s 2023 season was well-documented as the UK bodybuilding icon finally
took home the title of Olympia Men’s Physique champion
, thanks to a rigorous prep that included bolstering his back. Now, with the chance to repeat his success just a few months away, Terry continues to leave no stone unturned as he shores up his front with this Ryan Terry’s chest day workout, that you can try it too.
This chest day workout, shared by Terry via his Instagram account, is another example of the hard work and commitment that the Men’s Physique competitor puts into each and every gym session. Here, the 2023 champ can be seen taking in a high number of sets and reps as he looks push his workouts towards failure, encouraging hypertrophy and that all-important muscle growth. For Terry however, there’s no ego lifting,
as he explained on June 3, 2024
“… at this stage, for me it’s not about shifting mass weight, it’s truly getting that mind to muscle connection and making sure you feel every rep, slowing them down when needed to get that extra connection, and pushing to absolute failure every session,” he explained. “Emptying the tank completely… walking out the gym drained and tired but knowing another quality session ticked off. No feeling like it.”
Ryan Terry
Having worked out with Ryan Terry myself, I know that the 35-year-old uses his wisdom to work smart as well as hard, carefully selecting each exercise for the precise angle and efficiency that it can deliver in terms of bringing him closer to success. Whether it’s
his back workout
or front, Terry is prepping to bring his best physique yet to Las Vegas in October and, if you want to earn your chops, you can try his chest workout for yourself. It’s a doozy though, so make sure to tailor it to your own level of fitness by reducing the number of sets as required. And, be sure to
concentrate on the mind-muscle connection
by practicing proper form and executing each rep with time under tension.

Ryan Terry’s 2023 season was well-documented as the UK bodybuilding icon finally
took home the title of Olympia Men’s Physique champion
, thanks to a rigorous prep that included bolstering his back. Now, with the chance to repeat his success just a few months away, Terry continues to leave no stone unturned as he shores up his front with this Ryan Terry’s chest day workout, that you can try it too.
This chest day workout, shared by Terry via his Instagram account, is another example of the hard work and commitment that the Men’s Physique competitor puts into each and every gym session. Here, the 2023 champ can be seen taking in a high number of sets and reps as he looks push his workouts towards failure, encouraging hypertrophy and that all-important muscle growth. For Terry however, there’s no ego lifting,
as he explained on June 3, 2024
“… at this stage, for me it’s not about shifting mass weight, it’s truly getting that mind to muscle connection and making sure you feel every rep, slowing them down when needed to get that extra connection, and pushing to absolute failure every session,” he explained. “Emptying the tank completely… walking out the gym drained and tired but knowing another quality session ticked off. No feeling like it.”
Ryan Terry
Having worked out with Ryan Terry myself, I know that the 35-year-old uses his wisdom to work smart as well as hard, carefully selecting each exercise for the precise angle and efficiency that it can deliver in terms of bringing him closer to success. Whether it’s
his back workout
or front, Terry is prepping to bring his best physique yet to Las Vegas in October and, if you want to earn your chops, you can try his chest workout for yourself. It’s a doozy though, so make sure to tailor it to your own level of fitness by reducing the number of sets as required. And, be sure to
concentrate on the mind-muscle connection
by practicing proper form and executing each rep with time under tension.

The key to workout consistency is adaptability, which is when this short 15 minute tri-set strength workout comes into play. There is a common misconception that
if you haven’t the time for your usual workout
, you should live to fight again another day.
Although there is nothing wrong with that line of thinking, it doesn’t account for a thing called life.
If you haven’t figured it out already, life is pretty good at throwing you curveballs. And by curveballs, I mean the time you have reserved for your workout is not happening. Longer workouts are great because that’s where the gains happen;
short workouts
are handy when time is of the essence.
Adapting to your current circumstances is the
key to health and fitness
, longevity, and consistency. When time and equipment access are limited, bookmark this 15-minute strength workout for future reference.
You can thank us later—or not.
Benefits of a Quick 15-Minute Workout
It’s not all bad that you don’t have the time for your usual long duration of training. Here are four benefits to consider when time is short.
Efficiency
: Shorter sessions mean you can easily fit your workouts into a busy schedule. Short workouts are great for those who can’t dedicate hours to the gym but want to maintain their gains.
Intensity Focus
: With less time, you focus better on the intensity of your workout. High-intensity sessions can increase strength and muscular endurance and improve metabolic health.
Better Recovery
: Shorter workouts can reduce the risk of overtraining, allowing for better recovery. Refraining from overtraining is crucial for muscle growth and strength, as muscles need time to repair and strengthen afterward.
Flexibility and Variety
: Short, focused workouts allow more flexibility in your workout schedule. You can concentrate on different muscle groups in separate sessions or mix in cardiovascular and flexibility training without feeling overwhelmed.
The 15 Minute Tri-Set Strength Workout Directions
Use the following training as a stop-gap when time and equipment are limited. It will be a high-intensity workout because you’re working out for a short time. Good workouts/programming is a trade-off between time and intensity. Less time equals more intensity, and more time equals less intensity. So, get after it and keep the intensity high.
Here, you’ll perform the same reps for every exercise in the triset and complete as many rounds as you can in six minutes. You’ll do that for both tri-sets.
There is a tendency to lighten the load when working for time, but don’t do that. Choose a weight you can do for eight to 10 reps, and if you need to go down in load, that’s fine. Just start heavy.
15 Minute Tri-Set Strength Workout You Can Do in a Pinch
Start with a simple two-minute warm consisting of four bodyweight exercises performed for 30 seconds each. Here’s an example.

The key to workout consistency is adaptability, which is when this short 15 minute tri-set strength workout comes into play. There is a common misconception that
if you haven’t the time for your usual workout
, you should live to fight again another day.
Although there is nothing wrong with that line of thinking, it doesn’t account for a thing called life.
If you haven’t figured it out already, life is pretty good at throwing you curveballs. And by curveballs, I mean the time you have reserved for your workout is not happening. Longer workouts are great because that’s where the gains happen;
short workouts
are handy when time is of the essence.
Adapting to your current circumstances is the
key to health and fitness
, longevity, and consistency. When time and equipment access are limited, bookmark this 15-minute strength workout for future reference.
You can thank us later—or not.
Benefits of a Quick 15-Minute Workout
It’s not all bad that you don’t have the time for your usual long duration of training. Here are four benefits to consider when time is short.
Efficiency
: Shorter sessions mean you can easily fit your workouts into a busy schedule. Short workouts are great for those who can’t dedicate hours to the gym but want to maintain their gains.
Intensity Focus
: With less time, you focus better on the intensity of your workout. High-intensity sessions can increase strength and muscular endurance and improve metabolic health.
Better Recovery
: Shorter workouts can reduce the risk of overtraining, allowing for better recovery. Refraining from overtraining is crucial for muscle growth and strength, as muscles need time to repair and strengthen afterward.
Flexibility and Variety
: Short, focused workouts allow more flexibility in your workout schedule. You can concentrate on different muscle groups in separate sessions or mix in cardiovascular and flexibility training without feeling overwhelmed.
The 15 Minute Tri-Set Strength Workout Directions
Use the following training as a stop-gap when time and equipment are limited. It will be a high-intensity workout because you’re working out for a short time. Good workouts/programming is a trade-off between time and intensity. Less time equals more intensity, and more time equals less intensity. So, get after it and keep the intensity high.
Here, you’ll perform the same reps for every exercise in the triset and complete as many rounds as you can in six minutes. You’ll do that for both tri-sets.
There is a tendency to lighten the load when working for time, but don’t do that. Choose a weight you can do for eight to 10 reps, and if you need to go down in load, that’s fine. Just start heavy.
15 Minute Tri-Set Strength Workout You Can Do in a Pinch
Start with a simple two-minute warm consisting of four bodyweight exercises performed for 30 seconds each. Here’s an example.

With summer just several weeks away, many of us are looking forward to sunny days and the chance to catch some rays, but the idea of losing a layer or two of clothing is something that we are not quite as ready for. The good news is that there is still time to make an investment in our ‘gym bods’ before we are called upon to
hit the beach
. Here,
Ryan Scrooc
, a certified personal trainer and assistant fitness manager at
UFC Gym Torrance
, shares his full-body beach workout with
M&F.
“Full-body workouts are a great way to get in shape for everyone from beginners to seasoned lifters,” says Scrooc. “There are a lot of benefits to full-body workout routine, but for me the biggest one is the ability to burn more calories in less time. Most people don’t want to spend lots of hours each day in the gym but a good full body program can be done in as little as 45 to 60 minutes per session, three times a week.”
To this end, Scrooc advises that supersets are an efficient way to save time while
maximizing effort in the gym
, using little rest time and simply getting the job done quicker.
Full Body Beach Workout Breakdown By Body Part
Legs
“I always recommend working out from the bottom to the top,” says Scrooc, who has helped countless clients to lose weight and build muscle. “Leg exercises are the toughest and require the most movement and energy. So, since we have the most energy at the beginning of a workout, let’s use this on our biggest muscle group!
“We’ll start with a leg-focused superset, which means you’ll go immediately from the squats straight into the lunges with no rest in between. It’s important to have a stable base when performing squats. So, create a solid starting position by placing your feet even with each other, about shoulder-width apart. Once you’ve set your feet, then you can concentrate on the upper body and always remember to keep your chest up. While you can use a variety of equipment to perform squats, your own body weight can also be effective. And, since this superset requires that you will go directly from squats straight into lunges, I recommend using dumbbells, kettle bells, Bulgarian bags or any other weights that will work for both exercises so that you can make an easy transition with as little rest as possible.
“Lunges can be a difficult movement to perfect at first, so just remember to take it slow and focus. Begin in a split stance with your feet about two to three feet apart and then slowly bend one knee at a time, lowering yourself down and then pushing yourself back up to the starting position.”
Upper Body
“Now that we’ve gotten the legs out of the way, it’s time to start having some fun,” says Scrooc, who is also a competitive bodybuilder. “This next superset is going to help transform your upper body; by focusing on the muscles involved in pushing and pulling. Your chest and triceps play a big role in the floor press, while row exercises focus on your back.
“To execute a proper floor press, find a spot on the floor to lie down and use a pair of dumbbells that you’re comfortable with. Lift both weights simultaneously at a 45-degree angle, until your arms are fully extended, then lower them until both elbows touch the ground. Be sure to maintain control as you lower the dumbbells slowly so that you aren’t slamming your elbows into the ground repeatedly.
“You will then go immediately from the floor press into the bent over row, so stand tall with your chest up and a slight bend in the knees, while holding the dumbbells in each hand. Then, slowly lower your upper body so that it’s parallel to the ground, while keeping your back as straight as possible. From this position, pull the dumbbells up until you reach approximately hip height, then lower them back to your starting position.”
Shoulders
“Your shoulders are a very important muscle group that are used every day without you even realizing it,” explains Scrooc. “This superset will strengthen your shoulders by utilizing three exercises, beginning with the standing shoulder press. Start with a pair of dumbbells by your side and then use some momentum to bring both of your arms up simultaneously to about chin height. From there you will press the weights straight up and high above your head before lowering them slowly back to your starting position.
“Proceed immediately from the shoulder presses into a set of lateral raises, starting with the dumbbells by your hips. Then, raise both arms out to the side as if you are trying to fly away, before lowering them slowly back to your starting position. You don’t need to bring the dumbbells any higher than shoulder height.
“For the rear delt fly, similar to the row, you will bend your knees and bring your upper body parallel to the ground. From this bent over position, lift the dumbbells simultaneously out to the side, but again, you don’t need to bring your arms any higher than shoulder height. Lower the weights slowly back to your starting position.”
Abs & Core
“Having a strong core is much more than just having a small stomach or a six-pack,” says Scrooc, who appreciates that while ab exercises will help with size and definition, these muscles will only show if the appropriate nutritional regime is in-check. Still, larger abs will pop more, making core work all the more important for looking great on the beach. “The core is what keeps your entire body stable throughout the day and is the key to everything from sitting to standing,” explains the coach. “So, to focus on the abdominal muscles we start with lying crunches. Find a comfortable spot on the ground, or a mat, to lie down flat on your back, with your knees bent and feet flat on the floor. Now, cross your arms over your chest with your palms just below your shoulders and then lift your head and shoulders off the ground and squeeze your abs at the top of the movement. Complete by lowering yourself slowly to your starting position.
“Then, still lying on the ground, you will transition into lying leg raises. Place your hands under your rear and slowly lift both legs up as high as you can before slowly bringing them back down to your starting position on the ground. With minimal rest, you’ll move immediately into Russian twists. Start by sitting on the ground and slowly lifting your legs while keeping them bent. Be sure to keep your upper body up so that you’re
creating a ‘V’ shape
with your body and legs. Then proceed to twist from left to right while doing your best to touch the ground with each twist.
“With the end in sight, your final ab exercise will be mountain climbers. Position yourself in a high plank and proceed to bring one knee up to your chest and back to your starting position alternating between each leg.”
Back
“Your final full body workout exercise is designed to strengthen your lower back,” explains Scrooc. “You will need to use a hyperextension machine to do these back extensions. First, position yourself on the bench with your feet secured before slowly lowering your upper body as far as you can. Then engage your lower back to bring yourself back up.” Those who may not have access to a hyperextension machine can do good mornings instead, says Scrooc. “To execute a proper ‘good morning’, start with your feet shoulder width apart and toes pointed out, to open your hips. From there, just like the row, you’ll have a slight bend in the knees. Slowly lower your upper body down while bringing your hips back. This will focus primarily on the hamstrings and lower back.
“If you’ve made it this far, congratulations! You’re that much closer to achieving the summer body of your dreams! Try to stay consistent with this full body beach workout, performing them at least three days a week while giving yourself a rest day in between. Remember: maintain a clean diet as this will accelerate rate your physique change. Good luck and see you on the beach!”

M&F.
“Full-body workouts are a great way to get in shape for everyone from beginners to seasoned lifters,” says Scrooc. “There are a lot of benefits to full-body workout routine, but for me the biggest one is the ability to burn more calories in less time. Most people don’t want to spend lots of hours each day in the gym but a good full body program can be done in as little as 45 to 60 minutes per session, three times a week.”
To this end, Scrooc advises that supersets are an efficient way to save time while
maximizing effort in the gym
, using little rest time and simply getting the job done quicker.
Full Body Beach Workout Breakdown By Body Part
Legs
“I always recommend working out from the bottom to the top,” says Scrooc, who has helped countless clients to lose weight and build muscle. “Leg exercises are the toughest and require the most movement and energy. So, since we have the most energy at the beginning of a workout, let’s use this on our biggest muscle group!
“We’ll start with a leg-focused superset, which means you’ll go immediately from the squats straight into the lunges with no rest in between. It’s important to have a stable base when performing squats. So, create a solid starting position by placing your feet even with each other, about shoulder-width apart. Once you’ve set your feet, then you can concentrate on the upper body and always remember to keep your chest up. While you can use a variety of equipment to perform squats, your own body weight can also be effective. And, since this superset requires that you will go directly from squats straight into lunges, I recommend using dumbbells, kettle bells, Bulgarian bags or any other weights that will work for both exercises so that you can make an easy transition with as little rest as possible.
“Lunges can be a difficult movement to perfect at first, so just remember to take it slow and focus. Begin in a split stance with your feet about two to three feet apart and then slowly bend one knee at a time, lowering yourself down and then pushing yourself back up to the starting position.”
Upper Body
“Now that we’ve gotten the legs out of the way, it’s time to start having some fun,” says Scrooc, who is also a competitive bodybuilder. “This next superset is going to help transform your upper body; by focusing on the muscles involved in pushing and pulling. Your chest and triceps play a big role in the floor press, while row exercises focus on your back.
“To execute a proper floor press, find a spot on the floor to lie down and use a pair of dumbbells that you’re comfortable with. Lift both weights simultaneously at a 45-degree angle, until your arms are fully extended, then lower them until both elbows touch the ground. Be sure to maintain control as you lower the dumbbells slowly so that you aren’t slamming your elbows into the ground repeatedly.
“You will then go immediately from the floor press into the bent over row, so stand tall with your chest up and a slight bend in the knees, while holding the dumbbells in each hand. Then, slowly lower your upper body so that it’s parallel to the ground, while keeping your back as straight as possible. From this position, pull the dumbbells up until you reach approximately hip height, then lower them back to your starting position.”
Shoulders
“Your shoulders are a very important muscle group that are used every day without you even realizing it,” explains Scrooc. “This superset will strengthen your shoulders by utilizing three exercises, beginning with the standing shoulder press. Start with a pair of dumbbells by your side and then use some momentum to bring both of your arms up simultaneously to about chin height. From there you will press the weights straight up and high above your head before lowering them slowly back to your starting position.
“Proceed immediately from the shoulder presses into a set of lateral raises, starting with the dumbbells by your hips. Then, raise both arms out to the side as if you are trying to fly away, before lowering them slowly back to your starting position. You don’t need to bring the dumbbells any higher than shoulder height.
“For the rear delt fly, similar to the row, you will bend your knees and bring your upper body parallel to the ground. From this bent over position, lift the dumbbells simultaneously out to the side, but again, you don’t need to bring your arms any higher than shoulder height. Lower the weights slowly back to your starting position.”
Abs & Core
“Having a strong core is much more than just having a small stomach or a six-pack,” says Scrooc, who appreciates that while ab exercises will help with size and definition, these muscles will only show if the appropriate nutritional regime is in-check. Still, larger abs will pop more, making core work all the more important for looking great on the beach. “The core is what keeps your entire body stable throughout the day and is the key to everything from sitting to standing,” explains the coach. “So, to focus on the abdominal muscles we start with lying crunches. Find a comfortable spot on the ground, or a mat, to lie down flat on your back, with your knees bent and feet flat on the floor. Now, cross your arms over your chest with your palms just below your shoulders and then lift your head and shoulders off the ground and squeeze your abs at the top of the movement. Complete by lowering yourself slowly to your starting position.
“Then, still lying on the ground, you will transition into lying leg raises. Place your hands under your rear and slowly lift both legs up as high as you can before slowly bringing them back down to your starting position on the ground. With minimal rest, you’ll move immediately into Russian twists. Start by sitting on the ground and slowly lifting your legs while keeping them bent. Be sure to keep your upper body up so that you’re
creating a ‘V’ shape
with your body and legs. Then proceed to twist from left to right while doing your best to touch the ground with each twist.
“With the end in sight, your final ab exercise will be mountain climbers. Position yourself in a high plank and proceed to bring one knee up to your chest and back to your starting position alternating between each leg.”
Back
“Your final full body workout exercise is designed to strengthen your lower back,” explains Scrooc. “You will need to use a hyperextension machine to do these back extensions. First, position yourself on the bench with your feet secured before slowly lowering your upper body as far as you can. Then engage your lower back to bring yourself back up.” Those who may not have access to a hyperextension machine can do good mornings instead, says Scrooc. “To execute a proper ‘good morning’, start with your feet shoulder width apart and toes pointed out, to open your hips. From there, just like the row, you’ll have a slight bend in the knees. Slowly lower your upper body down while bringing your hips back. This will focus primarily on the hamstrings and lower back.
“If you’ve made it this far, congratulations! You’re that much closer to achieving the summer body of your dreams! Try to stay consistent with this full body beach workout, performing them at least three days a week while giving yourself a rest day in between. Remember: maintain a clean diet as this will accelerate rate your physique change. Good luck and see you on the beach!”

With summer just several weeks away, many of us are looking forward to sunny days and the chance to catch some rays, but the idea of losing a layer or two of clothing is something that we are not quite as ready for. The good news is that there is still time to make an investment in our ‘gym bods’ before we are called upon to
hit the beach
. Here,
Ryan Scrooc
, a certified personal trainer and assistant fitness manager at
UFC Gym Torrance
, shares his full-body beach workout with
M&F.
“Full-body workouts are a great way to get in shape for everyone from beginners to seasoned lifters,” says Scrooc. “There are a lot of benefits to full-body workout routine, but for me the biggest one is the ability to burn more calories in less time. Most people don’t want to spend lots of hours each day in the gym but a good full body program can be done in as little as 45 to 60 minutes per session, three times a week.”
To this end, Scrooc advises that supersets are an efficient way to save time while
maximizing effort in the gym
, using little rest time and simply getting the job done quicker.

If you hadn’t noticed, it’s still snow ski season, and many people are taking time off work to hit the slopes. If you like the cold and snow, skiing is an
excellent recreational sport
where you can play and work simultaneously. Over the years, I have had clients hit the slopes in varying physical conditions, and one thing stood out. Those in shape or strong had a better time and were less sore because they weren’t picking themselves off the snow as often.
Strength training makes many recreational sports more enjoyable, including snow skiing. Here, along with the help of
Katie Prendergast of KPX Fitness
, we’ll dive into why strength training matters for skiers and a simple strength training routine for skiing so you can look and feel like a pro.
Strap in; this is going to be a fun ride.
Muscles Used For Skiing
Before getting into a strength training routine for skiing, it helps to know which muscles are used when flying down the slopes.
Quads/Adductors:
The quads are the muscles you will feel after a day on the slopes. With your knees bent in the athletic-ready position, it’s similar to performing a wall squat all day but with bumps. Much like a shock absorber on a car, the quads act like this for your knees, which means you’ll be walking funny the next day.
Core:
A strong core with good muscular endurance improves everything, skiing included. The core bridges your lower and upper body, and preventing unnecessary movement means you’ll stay upright longer. Strengthening the core will keep the pelvis and lower back strong and hopefully pain-free.
Glutes:
Strong glutes are vital to skiing, as generating forward momentum is kind of important. Hip extension makes this happen when you stride and push down through your foot, especially on an incline, so putting juice in your caboose is essential. Having stronger glutes will help you deal with uneven terrain better and give you something to land on when you lose balance.
Hamstrings
:
Maintaining strength in the hammies is excellent for skiing because if you don’t, there will be a strength imbalance between the quads and hamstrings, and you don’t want that. Plus, the hamstrings assist with hip extension and are relied on when your leg is extended back to propel you forward.
Upper Body (Chest, Back, Shoulders, And Arms):
The upper body leans forward and counterbalances the lower body so you don’t lose balance. It is involved with ski poles for forward momentum and balance.
Why Strength Training Matters For Skiing
A few things are going on in your body while skiing. You need to develop and manage muscular tension, you need to generate force, and you need to do it repeatedly. Although it may seem counterintuitive to get strong for skiing, it’s the perfect complement for the reasons explained below.
Injury Prevention
“ Skiing and snowboarding put serious “eccentric” demands on your muscles due to gravity. Your muscles must absorb a lot of force as you ski or ride downhill. Strength training increases your body’s ability to absorb those forces safely and efficiently, making it more straightforward to get down the mountain each time.
Strength is also protective: the stronger you are, the less likely you are to injure yourself skiing or riding; if you do injure yourself, having a solid base of strength can help you recover from your injury faster and get back on the mountain sooner.” explains Prendergast.
Improves Performance And Recovery
“Getting stronger will make skiing and snowboarding easier because your muscles will be more efficient, making it feel like you’re doing less work on the mountain. Strength training will improve your power and athleticism so that you feel more capable on the slopes, allowing you to progress to more difficult terrain and have more fun on the mountain,” says Prendergast.
Consistent strength training will help build your efficiency and power while skiing and help you recover faster between sessions due to your muscles’ increased efficiency and strength.
Fall Prevention
It’s going to be said anyway. Whether skiing uphill, downhill, or snowboarding, it’s not a perfectly flat surface. You’re constantly having to adjust to the uneven terrain to prevent face-planting or landing on your butt. So, including unilateral exercises for the lower and upper body and some core strengthening exercises will improve your proprioception to avoid ending up on a blooper video.

Strength Training Routine For Skiing
“Skiing engages multiple muscle groups, and you want to stress hitting a range of muscle groups and mimicking the motions those muscles will do out on the hill as best you can,” explains Prendergast. Here is a two-day-a-week strength program that does just that.
INSTRUCTIONS
After a thorough warm-up, perform this A B workout twice weekly, resting 48 to 72 hours between sessions. Start at the lower end of the rep range and go up in reps per week, but keep the same weight. Then, once you hit the upper range, go up in load, back to the lower range, and repeat.
Rest 30 to 60 seconds between exercises and 2 minutes are each tri-set. Perform each tri-set three times.

Strength Training Routine For Skiing
“Skiing engages multiple muscle groups, and you want to stress hitting a range of muscle groups and mimicking the motions those muscles will do out on the hill as best you can,” explains Prendergast. Here is a two-day-a-week strength program that does just that.
INSTRUCTIONS
After a thorough warm-up, perform this A B workout twice weekly, resting 48 to 72 hours between sessions. Start at the lower end of the rep range and go up in reps per week, but keep the same weight. Then, once you hit the upper range, go up in load, back to the lower range, and repeat.
Rest 30 to 60 seconds between exercises and 2 minutes are each tri-set. Perform each tri-set three times.

If you hadn’t noticed, it’s still snow ski season, and many people are taking time off work to hit the slopes. If you like the cold and snow, skiing is an
excellent recreational sport
where you can play and work simultaneously. Over the years, I have had clients hit the slopes in varying physical conditions, and one thing stood out. Those in shape or strong had a better time and were less sore because they weren’t picking themselves off the snow as often.
Strength training makes many recreational sports more enjoyable, including snow skiing. Here, along with the help of
Katie Prendergast of KPX Fitness
, we’ll dive into why strength training matters for skiers and a simple strength training routine for skiing so you can look and feel like a pro.
Strap in; this is going to be a fun ride.
Muscles Used For Skiing
Before getting into a strength training routine for skiing, it helps to know which muscles are used when flying down the slopes.
Quads/Adductors:
The quads are the muscles you will feel after a day on the slopes. With your knees bent in the athletic-ready position, it’s similar to performing a wall squat all day but with bumps. Much like a shock absorber on a car, the quads act like this for your knees, which means you’ll be walking funny the next day.
Core:
A strong core with good muscular endurance improves everything, skiing included. The core bridges your lower and upper body, and preventing unnecessary movement means you’ll stay upright longer. Strengthening the core will keep the pelvis and lower back strong and hopefully pain-free.
Glutes:
Strong glutes are vital to skiing, as generating forward momentum is kind of important. Hip extension makes this happen when you stride and push down through your foot, especially on an incline, so putting juice in your caboose is essential. Having stronger glutes will help you deal with uneven terrain better and give you something to land on when you lose balance.
Hamstrings
:
Maintaining strength in the hammies is excellent for skiing because if you don’t, there will be a strength imbalance between the quads and hamstrings, and you don’t want that. Plus, the hamstrings assist with hip extension and are relied on when your leg is extended back to propel you forward.
Upper Body (Chest, Back, Shoulders, And Arms):
The upper body leans forward and counterbalances the lower body so you don’t lose balance. It is involved with ski poles for forward momentum and balance.
Why Strength Training Matters For Skiing
A few things are going on in your body while skiing. You need to develop and manage muscular tension, you need to generate force, and you need to do it repeatedly. Although it may seem counterintuitive to get strong for skiing, it’s the perfect complement for the reasons explained below.
Injury Prevention
“ Skiing and snowboarding put serious “eccentric” demands on your muscles due to gravity. Your muscles must absorb a lot of force as you ski or ride downhill. Strength training increases your body’s ability to absorb those forces safely and efficiently, making it more straightforward to get down the mountain each time.
Strength is also protective: the stronger you are, the less likely you are to injure yourself skiing or riding; if you do injure yourself, having a solid base of strength can help you recover from your injury faster and get back on the mountain sooner.” explains Prendergast.
Improves Performance And Recovery
“Getting stronger will make skiing and snowboarding easier because your muscles will be more efficient, making it feel like you’re doing less work on the mountain. Strength training will improve your power and athleticism so that you feel more capable on the slopes, allowing you to progress to more difficult terrain and have more fun on the mountain,” says Prendergast.
Consistent strength training will help build your efficiency and power while skiing and help you recover faster between sessions due to your muscles’ increased efficiency and strength.
Fall Prevention
It’s going to be said anyway. Whether skiing uphill, downhill, or snowboarding, it’s not a perfectly flat surface. You’re constantly having to adjust to the uneven terrain to prevent face-planting or landing on your butt. So, including unilateral exercises for the lower and upper body and some core strengthening exercises will improve your proprioception to avoid ending up on a blooper video.

“People often tell me that I’m a fighter, that life has brought me to my knees, but that I haven’t let it get me down,” explained Edgard John-Augustin in an
Instagram post on Dec. 30, 2023
. Indeed, the “Bionic Body” proved himself to be a contender once again last year, not just on the wheelchair circuit but also among his able-bodied peers. He took to the stage in the Men’s Physique division, earning fourth place at the 2023 Toronto Pro Supershow. Now he shares his epic machine workout plan with Muscle & Fitness as he preps for competition in the year ahead.
“This is my actual training schedule,” explains John-Augustin, who finds a way to train every day, often repping his latest on-trend
activewear collaboration with BohooMAN
as he moves heaven and earth in the weight room. “And my split is push, pull, and legs,” he notes. As you will see from John-Augustin’s extensive machine workout plan, he builds muscle by getting into a state of hypotrophy, taxing his muscle fibers and encourange them to grow back stronger by following a
high rep scheme
and executing an extensive array of exercises. He also keeps his body guessing by alternating the number of sets and reps that he undertakes for each move, in addition to taking some of his exercises all the way to failure.
BoohooMAN
As an experienced bodybuilder, his Bionic Body is able to cope with a punishing workout schedule, but for beginners and even intermediate gym goers, it would be wise to take on a sample part of the program initially, or reduce the number of sets and reps rather than expect to complete this champions plan on week one. As if the below schedule wasn’t epic enough, John-Augustin also tells M&F that before he hits the gym and follows this plan, he undertakes morning cardio and trains his abs. On Sundays, on his day of “rest” he still performs cardio and ab training. Whether he’s sweating it out during long workout sessions or tweaking the angles to make sure he’s hitting each muscle part that he possibly can, the “Bionic Body” is a testament to what the human body can accomplish through determination and a driven work ethic. “I receive thousands of messages from people who are inspired,” says our man. “And those messages also help me through my journey! It means a lot to me;  to know that I can help at least one person get up and try!”

“People often tell me that I’m a fighter, that life has brought me to my knees, but that I haven’t let it get me down,” explained Edgard John-Augustin in an
Instagram post on Dec. 30, 2023
. Indeed, the “Bionic Body” proved himself to be a contender once again last year, not just on the wheelchair circuit but also among his able-bodied peers. He took to the stage in the Men’s Physique division, earning fourth place at the 2023 Toronto Pro Supershow. Now he shares his epic machine workout plan with Muscle & Fitness as he preps for competition in the year ahead.
“This is my actual training schedule,” explains John-Augustin, who finds a way to train every day, often repping his latest on-trend
activewear collaboration with BohooMAN
as he moves heaven and earth in the weight room. “And my split is push, pull, and legs,” he notes. As you will see from John-Augustin’s extensive machine workout plan, he builds muscle by getting into a state of hypotrophy, taxing his muscle fibers and encourange them to grow back stronger by following a
high rep scheme
and executing an extensive array of exercises. He also keeps his body guessing by alternating the number of sets and reps that he undertakes for each move, in addition to taking some of his exercises all the way to failure.
BoohooMAN
As an experienced bodybuilder, his Bionic Body is able to cope with a punishing workout schedule, but for beginners and even intermediate gym goers, it would be wise to take on a sample part of the program initially, or reduce the number of sets and reps rather than expect to complete this champions plan on week one. As if the below schedule wasn’t epic enough, John-Augustin also tells M&F that before he hits the gym and follows this plan, he undertakes morning cardio and trains his abs. On Sundays, on his day of “rest” he still performs cardio and ab training. Whether he’s sweating it out during long workout sessions or tweaking the angles to make sure he’s hitting each muscle part that he possibly can, the “Bionic Body” is a testament to what the human body can accomplish through determination and a driven work ethic. “I receive thousands of messages from people who are inspired,” says our man. “And those messages also help me through my journey! It means a lot to me;  to know that I can help at least one person get up and try!”

“People often tell me that I’m a fighter, that life has brought me to my knees, but that I haven’t let it get me down,” explained Edgard John-Augustin in an
Instagram post on Dec. 30, 2023
. Indeed, the “Bionic Body” proved himself to be a contender once again last year, not just on the wheelchair circuit but also among his able-bodied peers. He took to the stage in the Men’s Physique division, earning fourth place at the 2023 Toronto Pro Supershow. Now he shares his epic machine workout plan with Muscle & Fitness as he preps for competition in the year ahead.
“This is my actual training schedule,” explains John-Augustin, who finds a way to train every day, often repping his latest on-trend
activewear collaboration with BohooMAN
as he moves heaven and earth in the weight room. “And my split is push, pull, and legs,” he notes. As you will see from John-Augustin’s extensive machine workout plan, he builds muscle by getting into a state of hypotrophy, taxing his muscle fibers and encourange them to grow back stronger by following a
high rep scheme
and executing an extensive array of exercises. He also keeps his body guessing by alternating the number of sets and reps that he undertakes for each move, in addition to taking some of his exercises all the way to failure.
BoohooMAN
As an experienced bodybuilder, his Bionic Body is able to cope with a punishing workout schedule, but for beginners and even intermediate gym goers, it would be wise to take on a sample part of the program initially, or reduce the number of sets and reps rather than expect to complete this champions plan on week one. As if the below schedule wasn’t epic enough, John-Augustin also tells M&F that before he hits the gym and follows this plan, he undertakes morning cardio and trains his abs. On Sundays, on his day of “rest” he still performs cardio and ab training. Whether he’s sweating it out during long workout sessions or tweaking the angles to make sure he’s hitting each muscle part that he possibly can, the “Bionic Body” is a testament to what the human body can accomplish through determination and a driven work ethic. “I receive thousands of messages from people who are inspired,” says our man. “And those messages also help me through my journey! It means a lot to me;  to know that I can help at least one person get up and try!”

Right now, you might be experiencing the post-holiday bloat and blues. Even if you didn’t totally go overboard, your body may feel a bit sluggish and slow from the increase in alcohol,
calorie-laden foods
, and less time in the gym.  To make things worse, lack of motivation can rear its ugly after the Holiday indulging is over, as feelings of guilt set in and the scale tips upward. That’s where this 3-Day Detox Workout Program comes into play.
Although getting back into the gym is crucial at this point, it can feel like a daunting task for those who went off track.
This is where the Detox workout program comes in to help you move, sweat, and feel better as you ease your way back into a solid routine.
How The Program Works
The Detox workout program is a moderately intense full-body program to slowly and progressively get yourself back into working order. It’s exactly the kind of reset your body needs to
reenergize your metabolism
and get your muscles firing back to normal.
Personal trainer
John Gioffre
demonstrates the three days you’ll be working out in the gym.
Two other days will be spent on cardio, one as “active rest,” and the other reserved for complete rest.
Detox Workout Program Breakdown
Monday, Wednesday, and Friday:
Weight Training
Tuesday and Thursday:
Interval cardio and Steady-state cardio
For the exercises labeled “Finishers,” perform 10 reps of each exercise as part of one circuit, and then do 3 complete circuits. For example: On day 1, you’ll do a circuit of 10 burpees, 10 pushups, and 10 crunches, and then repeat that circuit twice more.

Right now, you might be experiencing the post-holiday bloat and blues. Even if you didn’t totally go overboard, your body may feel a bit sluggish and slow from the increase in alcohol,
calorie-laden foods
, and less time in the gym.  To make things worse, lack of motivation can rear its ugly after the Holiday indulging is over, as feelings of guilt set in and the scale tips upward. That’s where this 3-Day Detox Workout Program comes into play.
Although getting back into the gym is crucial at this point, it can feel like a daunting task for those who went off track.
This is where the Detox workout program comes in to help you move, sweat, and feel better as you ease your way back into a solid routine.
How The Program Works
The Detox workout program is a moderately intense full-body program to slowly and progressively get yourself back into working order. It’s exactly the kind of reset your body needs to
reenergize your metabolism
and get your muscles firing back to normal.
Personal trainer
John Gioffre
demonstrates the three days you’ll be working out in the gym.
Two other days will be spent on cardio, one as “active rest,” and the other reserved for complete rest.
Detox Workout Program Breakdown
Monday, Wednesday, and Friday:
Weight Training
Tuesday and Thursday:
Interval cardio and Steady-state cardio
For the exercises labeled “Finishers,” perform 10 reps of each exercise as part of one circuit, and then do 3 complete circuits. For example: On day 1, you’ll do a circuit of 10 burpees, 10 pushups, and 10 crunches, and then repeat that circuit twice more.

Although packing on muscle increases strength and size, helping you look younger, your joints end up taking a beating causing them to not only ache but age.
While this is true for many lifters, especially those who focus on gains, joint pain doesn’t always have to tag along with your hard-earned results.
In fact, there is a way to safely increase size and strength without compromising your joint health.
Here, this workout plan incorporates careful programming, mobility, and corrective exercise to help you safely and effectively build size and strength one move at a time.

Why it works
Lifting weights compresses the joints, and can lead to injury. There are two main ways to prevent lifting-related aches and pains:
Master perfect technique so your body can bear the stress of heavy weights as safely as possible.
Vary the loads you use so you never undergo too much stress for too long.
This program improves technique by way of mobility, with exercises such as the face-pull that activate and balance out the muscles around the shoulder to allow for safe, efficient lifting.
Good to Know:
These moves help you perform your bench press better, so we tucked them in between your first few sets. We also change the sets and reps on your main lifts weekly to vary the stimulus. All of these safety precautions make you a better lifter, so it’s easier to add muscle.
How to do it
Perform each workout (Day I, II, and III) once a week, resting a day between each session.

Although packing on muscle increases strength and size, helping you look younger, your joints end up taking a beating causing them to not only ache but age.
While this is true for many lifters, especially those who focus on gains, joint pain doesn’t always have to tag along with your hard-earned results.
In fact, there is a way to safely increase size and strength without compromising your joint health.
Here, this workout plan incorporates careful programming, mobility, and corrective exercise to help you safely and effectively build size and strength one move at a time.
Workout Routines
The quick-hit workout plan to gain more muscle in ...
You only need 30 minutes to get in the best shape of your life.

Why it works
Lifting weights compresses the joints, and can lead to injury. There are two main ways to prevent lifting-related aches and pains:
Master perfect technique so your body can bear the stress of heavy weights as safely as possible.
Vary the loads you use so you never undergo too much stress for too long.
This program improves technique by way of mobility, with exercises such as the face-pull that activate and balance out the muscles around the shoulder to allow for safe, efficient lifting.
Good to Know:
These moves help you perform your bench press better, so we tucked them in between your first few sets. We also change the sets and reps on your main lifts weekly to vary the stimulus. All of these safety precautions make you a better lifter, so it’s easier to add muscle.
How to do it
Perform each workout (Day I, II, and III) once a week, resting a day between each session.

, two things are certain: You’re going to be immersed in gym culture, and you’re going to be working with guys who eat meat—a lot of it. If it once walked, crawled, flew, swam, or was hit by a Buick, these guys will eat it.
Truth is, the protein found in meat—whatever animal it comes from—reigns supreme when it comes to the diet of your average M&F staffer and reader.
In the race to build bigger muscles, everyone can agree that protein is the driving force that powers your body to the finish line. And most would also argue that meat— along with certain dairy products—is the preferred food for getting your fill. In the
quest for protein
, however, this is where a few of us jump ship and head for greener pastures.
Specifically, I’m talking about
plant proteins
. I’m not trying to convert carnivores with this. My only beef with some beef eaters is their quick condemnation of those who look beyond livestock for their protein fix. Believe me, it’s not easy ordering a
black bean burger
in the company of a bunch of guys who expect to see food with whip marks. From subtle digs to outright mockery, the response to my food selection continues to be a point of contention. I often think I would be judged less harshly if I ordered fried panda with a side of kitten.
Just know that
a well-rounded, plant-based diet
rich in fruits, vegetables, nuts, and whole grains can easily provide all the protein your body needs to build muscle. More important, according to numerous studies, including the landmark Adventist Health Study-2, people who eat a plant-based diet live longer, healthier lives. They have fewer cases of cancer, heart disease, type-2 diabetes, and are less likely to be overweight. And if your carbon footprint is important to you, you’ll leave a smaller one of those, too.
Research also shows that the risk of hospitalization or death from heart disease is 32% lower for
vegetarians
. Never mind the fact that you won’t have to worry about the next mad cow disease beef recall.
True, veggies might not be as satisfying to the palette, but they satisfy my nutritional needs, and more significantly, my soul. Plus, I’m in great shape. I’m lifting big weights and have conquered some brutal Spartan races. I’m continuing to add more lean muscle mass to my physique—all while on a plant-based diet.
This route is not for everyone, and that’s to be expected. But the world is changing, and as more men learn about the immense health benefits of plant-based nutrition, the more likely they’ll be able to accept it as a viable alternative to meat on occasion— or maybe even for good.

<p>Imagine these scenarios: You’re all pumped for leg day and make a beeline to the squat racks, <a href="https://www.muscleandfitness.com/workouts/workout-tips/10-killer-substitutes-crowded-exercise-machines/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">but they are all taken</a>. Or you woke up all geared for deadlifts, but your lower back has different ideas. As a lifter, it’s always handy to have a Plan B when things don’t go as planned. An excellent alternate workout is landmine training.</p>
<p>The landmine is an underrated tool for <a href="https://www.muscleandfitness.com/workouts/leg-exercises/7-exercises-work-your-legs-exhaustion-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">building lower-body strength and power</a>. This simple and versatile method allows you to get after it without further beating up your lower back. It reduces compressive forces on the spine, making it an excellent choice for anyone recovering from or dealing with lower back issues.</p>
<p>With the landmine, you can challenge your lower body from angles, and its compact setup is ideal for busy gyms or home workouts. This lower-body blast will deliver if you’re looking for an effective way to strengthen and muscle up your quads, hamstrings, glutes, and core.</p>
<p>Let’s examine the benefits of landmine training and why it’s perfect for building strength and power. Afterward, try our provided landmine workout (below) to get you rockin’ and rollin’.</p>
<p></p>
<h2>The Benefits of Lower Body Landmine Training</h2>
<p>Landmine training is an effective way to build lower body strength and power, and here’s why:</p>
<h3>Joint-Friendly</h3>
<p>The landmine’s angled barbell path allows for a more natural range of motion, reducing strain on the knees, hips, and lower back. This makes it an excellent option for those with joint discomfort or previous injuries.</p>
<h3>Engages More Muscle</h3>
<p>The landmine engages stabilizing muscles to maintain balance and control while lifting. Unilateral exercises like the landmine RDLs require excellent core stability to maintain good form.</p>
<h3>Versatility</h3>
<p>With landmine training, you can perform various exercises and target every lower body muscle. The landmine is perfect for bilateral moves like squats or unilateral moves like Cossack Squats and RDLs, offering endless possibilities for progression.</p>
<h3>Perfect for Most Fitness Levels</h3>
<p>Landmine exercises can be quickly regressed and progressed, making them excellent options for strengthening the lower body for everyone, from beginners to advanced lifters. You can adjust the load, modify the range of motion, or focus on tempo.</p>
<p></p>
<h2>The Lower Body Landmine Workout Instructions</h2>
<p>This lower-body workout is structured for efficiency and intensity. It maximizes your muscle pump and helps you miss the squat rack less.</p>
<p><strong>Duration:</strong> 30 to 45 minutes, including the warmup, depending on the number of rounds completed.</p>
<p><strong>Format:</strong> Supersets: Perform two back-to-back exercises with minimal rest between moves and rest for 60 seconds between exercises and one to two minutes between supersets. Aim for 2-3 rounds for each superset.</p>
<p><strong>Repetition Range:</strong> Focus on 6–12 reps per exercise and side, prioritizing form and control.</p>
<p><strong>Progressive Overload:</strong> Gradually increase the load or reps as you get stronger. If the weight feels easy during your workout, up it by five to 10 pounds. Having the weight plates handy will save transition time between exercises.</p>
<p><strong>Form First:</strong> Keep each movement smooth and controlled to minimize strain and maximize muscle.</p>
<h2>Landmine Lower Body Blast Workout</h2>
<p>This workout focuses on compound movements and targets every lower body muscle, helping you build strength, power, and muscle.</p>
<h3>Warmup (5 Minutes)</h3>
<p><strong>Prying Goblet Squats:</strong> Stay in the bottom position for 30 seconds to loosen your hips and activate your quads and glutes.</p>
<p><strong>Hip Bridges with Marching:</strong> Engage your glutes and hamstrings for stability and power. Do two sets of 12 reps per leg.</p>
<p><strong>Inchworms with Reach:</strong> Do two sets of eight reps to loosen your hamstrings and spine and wake up your core.</p>
<h3>Workout (30-40 minutes)</h3>
<p><strong> 1A.</strong> Jump Squat</p>
<p><strong>1B.</strong> Rollout (Do both sides)</p>
<p><strong>2A.</strong> Single-Leg RDL (Do both sides)</p>
<p><strong> 2B.</strong> Cossack Squat (Alternate sides)</p>
<p><strong>3A.</strong> Tall Kneeling Rotation (Do both sides)</p>
<p><strong>3B.</strong> Bilateral RDL (Go heavy)</p>
<h2>Workout Tips</h2>
<p>To get the most out of the Landmine Lower Body Blast, keep these tips in mind:</p>
<p><strong>Prioritize Form Over Weight:</strong> Good technique ensures the correct muscles are being hit while minimizing the risk of injury.</p>
<p><strong>Progression:</strong> Start with a doable weight to build confidence and strength. If it feels easy, increase the reps or weight for future sets.</p>
<p>Adjust To Your Level Beginners can reduce the range of motion or use a lighter weight, and advanced lifters can increase the intensity by adding tempo variations (e.g., slow eccentrics) or pauses to up the difficulty.</p>

<p>For bodybuilders that dream of commanding the stage, there’s often little thought given to injury as each warrior lifts the heaviest possible weight in the hopes of raising an Olympia trophy, but Dorian Yates has recently shed light on a crossover effect method that he used to stay in the game when his body gave out, and it’s an approach that is backed by science.</p>
<p>“<a href="https://www.muscleandfitness.com/flexonline/the-heavy-duty-life-and-career-of-dorian-yates/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">During my Olympia reign</a>, I had two major injuries which put my attendance in both contests (1994 and 1997) into serious, serious doubt,” explained Yates in a recent post shared with his 1.8 million Instagram followers. “Both injuries occurred close to the contests, and I believe were due to myself still trying to lift the same weights as in the off season when my strength levels were higher, but you just can’t do that when you’re so depleted this close to competing.”</p>
<p>While known for his intense approach, Yates now realizes that lowering his calories while trying to maintain the same lifting regiment was a recipe for disaster. “In my mind, I was just so focused on winning the Olympia, all my time and energy was spent on this goal, and I wanted to leave no doubt when winning,” he explained of his blinkered approach.</p>
<p>Injuries would provide a serious wake-up call, however.</p>

<h2>How Dorian Yates Kept His 1994 and 1997 Mr Olympia Dreams Alive</h2>
<p>“The initial thoughts running through my mind were just that the Olympia is over and everything I worked for this year had been for nothing,” he shared. “But I’m a very calculated person, so I did the maths and worked around the injuries to win both times!”</p>
<p>In fact, Yates’ commitment to working around his injuries is what kept those Olympia dreams alive. “During my rehab phase, I was training the opposite side as there is evidence that by working the non-injured side, it can help the injured side to recover faster,” he explained. <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC5972467/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Studies have shown that exercising a good limb</a> can preserve the size of an immobilized opposing muscle while maintaining a measure of strength due to the “Crossover Effect.”</p>
<p>“But not just this, I needed to train for mental reasons,” wrote the legend, never willing to just sit it out while his competitors overtook him. “It helped massively with my mindset on the road to recovery, that I was still being active and doing everything I possibly could to heal.” As the history books show, thanks to his will to win, Dorian Yates lifted the Mr Olympia trophy for a total of six times. So, next time you feel like skipping a gym session, give yourself half a chance instead.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DFQUkY8oW-s/?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Taking to Instagram</a>, Dauda recently demonstrated the tired and tested move as he readies himself for the 2025 Arnold Classic. Having won $600,000 for taking the Olympia title home last year, “The Nigerian Lion,” now has his sights firmly set on the $500,000 prize money that goes to the victor in Columbus, Ohio. “No muscle group left behind,” wrote Dauda in a post for his almost 1.5 million IG followers.</p>

<h2>Samson Dauda Executes Standing Calf Raises Ahead of the 2025 Arnold Classic</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.muscleandfitness.com/flexonline/flex-news/samson-dauda-is-the-new-2024-mr-olympia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dauda took his first Olympia trophy in 2024</a> after presenting the full package of muscle, definition, and symmetry, and by the looks of his calves, no stone is being left unturned in the pursuit of perfection.</p>
<p>By performing the standing calf raise, you will activate two muscles at the rear of the lower leg (the gastrocnemious and the soleus muscles). Calf raises are also great because they are low impact and will improve strength and flexibility in each calf while helping to build muscle mass at the same time. “Every body part get its own full attention,” said Dauda of his detailed approach. “That’s how you grow symmetrically.”</p>
<p>To try it for yourself, replicate Dauda’s technique and hold the position for around a second at the top of the lift for increased time under tension. For hypotrophy, aim for 3 sets of 12 reps, working with a weight that will bring you to failure, or close to failure with each set.</p>

<p>“Stone Cold” Steve Austin is in the history books as one of pro wrestling’s most popular performers, but this type of epic success has <a href="https://www.muscleandfitness.com/workouts/workout-tips/why-the-skierg-could-be-key-to-a-stone-cold-steve-austin-comeback/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">required great physical sacrifice</a>. Last week, however, Austin provided a positive update following his latest stint under the knife.</p>
<p>“I am 7 weeks post op on a total knee replacement,” revealed the WWE Hall of Famer on Jan 21, 2025, via Instagram. “My left knee was on its last leg, and I have been putting surgery off for years.” This means Austin would likely have been working through immense pain during his last match to date with WWE. (That bout took place in 2022 at WrestleMania in Dallas.) Fortunately, “The Rattlesnake” went on to explain that his post op X-rays have showed “everything is healing nicely.”</p>
<h2>‘Stone Cold’ Steve Austin Always Comes Back Stronger</h2>
<p>Austin is no stranger to going under the knife. His most significant injury occurred in the ring back at SummerSlam 1997, when the late Owen Hart dropped him on his head and caused spinal damage while executing an inverted piledriver. While the former six-time WWE champ wrestled for years following reconstructive neck surgery, he had to reduce his move set in order to prolong his career. Incredibly, “<a href="https://www.muscleandfitness.com/athletes-celebrities/news/stone-cold-steve-austin-stuns-wrestlemania-38-at-age-57/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stone Cold” was 57 when he made a return and beat Kevin Owens at WrestleMania 38</a>. Following the widespread critical acclaim for that match, Austin said he couldn’t rule out putting on his boots one more time. Still, wrestling has taken a back seat to off-road racing in recent years, and “Stone Cold” (now 60) has joined forces with the GFI Nevada Racing team, riding Kawasaki.</p>

<h2>Will ‘Stone Cold’ Steve Austin Ever Return to a WWE Ring?</h2>
<p>These days, Austin in busy with his highly successful “Broken Skull” beer brand but revealed that he is “back in the gym and training” after trying to rush his recovery and suffering an initial set back. “I came out of the gate aggressively and started walking way too soon.” Austin explained, adding that recovery will likely take him a year. This means the chances of him dishing out one of his trademark stunners at this year’s WrestleMania seems pretty unlikely. Still, they do say that anything can happen in WWE.</p>
<p>One thing is for sure, the pro wrestling legend has been looking ripped as of late and fully intends to get back to racing. “I have my sights set to race in The Mint 400 outside of Las Vegas,” he said. “I am thankful to have found the challenge of desert off road racing. I love the competition and the hard conditions that come with it. So, here goes…” God speed, Stone Cold!</p>

<p>New year, new detox, right? Whether it’s green juices, <a href="https://www.muscleandfitness.com/nutrition/healthy-eating/what-happens-to-your-body-after-fasting-for-7-days/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fasting protocols</a>, or teas that claim to flush you clean, January is when we collectively try to undo the indulgences of the past year. It feels equal parts hopeful and desperate—and frankly, if we’re honest, doesn’t last long.</p>
<p>We’ve heard these buzzwords before: activated charcoal to “bind toxins,” <a href="https://www.muscleandfitness.com/features/active-lifestyle/can-red-light-therapy-be-the-recovery-tool-you-need/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">infrared saunas to “sweat it out,”</a> and dry brushing to “stimulate the lymphatic system.” They each help the body’s natural detox pathways—your liver, kidneys, and lymphatic system. But what if there was a way to take detoxing a step further? What if you could directly cleanse almost all the blood flowing through your body?</p>
<p>EBO2 or EBOO—short for Extracorporeal Blood Oxygenation and Ozonation—offers a novel way to detox—filtering out toxins, heavy metals, built-up lipids, and cellular junk directly from your bloodstream. Physicians say it helps target some of the root causes of inflammation and chronic disease.</p>
<p>When I sat down with <a href="https://www.a4m.com/christopher-davis.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dr. Christopher Davis</a>, an interventional cardiologist with a passion for health optimization, his words set the stage for our conversation: “We get old and get sick because of the toxins around us.”</p>
<p>Davis didn’t sugarcoat the reality of modern life. While exercise, nutrition, and stress management are non-negotiables in the staying healthy hierarchy, oftentimes our environment often works against us.</p>
<p>“We’re talking about heavy metals—mercury, cadmium, lead, arsenic,” he explained. “Add to that insecticides and pesticides like atrazine and DDT. Then there’s plastics—BPA, phthalates, flame retardants, and the nonstick coatings on our cookware. Even the stain-resistant carpets and furniture in our homes contribute to the toxic load we carry.”</p>
<p>It’s quite scary to think how much toxic chemicals we eat, breathe, and drink every day. These substances don’t just float harmlessly through our bodies, nor do they simply come and go. They accumulate, creating oxidative stress, which over time triggers chronic inflammation. Davis points to <a href="https://www.muscleandfitness.com/features/inflammation-types-benefits-causes-cures/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">chronic inflammation as the root cause of many diseases</a>, including heart disease, autoimmune disorders, Parkinson’s and Alzheimer’s diseases, and even certain cancers. “Inflammation is at the heart of it all,” he said. “And much of it is driven by these toxins.”</p>
<p>Dr. Davis has seen the impact of EBO2, observing significant improvements in patients with autoimmune conditions, high toxic loads, and even cancer. Plus, this cutting-edge treatment is gaining traction among high performers, athletes, and biohackers. Why? For them, optimizing recovery, slowing down aging, boosting energy, and counteracting the effects of modern environmental toxins are top priority.</p>
<p>Despite the buzz, EBO2 is not without its skeptics. While it’s safe when administered correctly in a clinical setting, the majority of the reported benefits are anecdotal, with limited large-scale clinical studies to back up its efficacy. As with any new modality, there’s a need for more robust, peer-reviewed research to determine its long-term effects and potential risks.</p>
<h2>What is EBO2?</h2>
<p>Get cozy because this treatment requires you to be hooked to an IV in both arms for 45 minutes while approximately 2 to 4 liters of your blood—between 40-80% of your body’s supply—is drawn, filtered, treated with ozone and specific wavelengths of light, and reintroduced into your body.</p>
<p>Plus, there’s a container on the side where all the junk gets filtered into. It looks murky and yellowish, making it hard to miss how much toxins we carry throughout our lives.</p>
<p>Dr. Joseph Purita, a pioneer in regenerative medicine and one of the physicians behind EBO2’s growing popularity in the U.S., describes the process in vivid terms. “When blood comes out of the body, it’s darkish. Looks like what we call venous blood. But when it’s filtered and treated with ozone and light, it returns bright red, looking like arterial blood. It’s almost as if we had a heart-lung machine oxygenating the blood. But it’s not that we’re just giving oxygen back, because your lungs can do that. There’s a number of interesting things that are happening, and that’s why I like it.”</p>
<p>EBO2 is a relatively new modality you might find in a longevity, upscale IV, or functional medicine clinic with a hefty price tag ranging from $875 to $1,800. And, unfortunately for many or us, it’s likely an out-of-pocket expense.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption "><img src="https://i0.wp.com/www.muscleandfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Blood-cells-releasing-toxins-from-the-EBO2-therapy.jpg?quality=86&strip=all" alt="Blood cells releasing toxins from the EBO2 therapy" width="1109" height="614" data-fallback-img="https://i0.wp.com/www.muscleandfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Blood-cells-releasing-toxins-from-the-EBO2-therapy.jpg?quality=86&strip=all"><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><span class="credit">Olga Gorkun</span></figcaption></figure>
<h2>The Science Behind EBO2</h2>
<p>Davis and Purita explained that EBO2 leverages the body’s own mechanisms to heal and create positive adaptation by triggering hormesis—a so-called “good stress” in which small amounts of oxidative stress stimulates the body to adapt. As the blood flows through the dialysis machine it’s exposed to ozone, a process that removes toxins, heavy metals, and cellular debris and creates beneficial oxidative compounds that stimulate your body’s natural antioxidant defenses, such as glutathione and superoxide dismutase. As an additional step, exposure to specific wavelengths of light—aka photobiomodulation—further reduces inflammation, boosts oxygen delivery, and kills harmful pathogens.</p>
<p>The process is entirely external, and as Purita emphasized, “ozone is toxic when inhaled, so no ozone enters the body. When ozone starts mixing with plasma, it’s converted right away to hydrogen peroxide, oxygen, and a few other things.”</p>
<p>In addition to cleansing your blood, this process evokes several interesting cellular mechanisms. Purita added that “EBO2 stimulates pathways like AMPk, which improves energy efficiency at the cellular level.”</p>
<p>AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPk) is an enzyme that plays a role in energy regulation. It acts like a metabolic thermostat, detecting energy deficits in your cells and triggering mechanisms to restore balance. AMPk activation boosts cellular energy production and encourages your body to burn fat for energy. Plus, studies link AMPk activation to improved cellular repair and reduced aging markers.</p>
<p>EBO2 upregulates another key pathway known as your body’s antioxidant powerhouse—the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2, (NRF2). NRF2 is a transcription factor that regulates the body’s antioxidant response. Think of it as the master regulator of detoxification and inflammation control. When activated, NRF2 turns on genes that produce antioxidant and anti-inflammatory compounds. These may help the body eliminate harmful substances, reduce oxidative stress, and protect cells from damage caused by environmental toxins and free radicals.</p>
<p>Dr. Davis noted that this treatment also stimulates mitochondrial biogenesis, creating more of the energy-producing powerhouses within your cells.</p>
<h2>Benefits of EBO2</h2>
<p>For athletes, high performers, and longevity enthusiasts, the benefits of EBO2 can mean a number of things. Improved oxygen delivery and mitochondrial health translate to better endurance, faster recovery, and a sharper mind. Reduced inflammation and oxidative stress may help improve mitochondrial function (think more energy at the cellular level). It also helps boost your immune system, and enhance recovery from workouts or illness.</p>
<p>Davis explained that more efficient red blood cell behavior also leads to increased oxygen delivery. “EBO2 improves how red blood cells flow through the microvascular system, reducing viscosity and enabling them to move more efficiently,” he said. “The therapy also enhances the release of oxygen from red blood cells, making oxygen delivery to tissues more effective.”</p>
<p>Additionally, ozone also helps stimulate nitric oxide production, which relaxes blood vessels and increases blood flow, Dr. Davis added. By addressing the mechanics of red blood cells and their oxygen-releasing capabilities, EBO2 ensures that tissues and organs receive the oxygen they need to perform optimally.</p>
<p>“People will typically have more energy, less brain fog, and just a sense of well-being and vitality,” Davis says, sharing how his patients often describe feeling after a session.</p>
<p>Subjective outcomes are not the only ones that may shift. Dr. Davis mentioned that there are a number of biomarkers and objective data he looks at to track EBO2’s efficacy. “We</p>
<p>can look at measures of inflammation like CRP, and other markers of oxidative stress,” he added.</p>
<h2>Is EBO2 right for you?</h2>
<p>EBO2 isn’t a cure-all. However, it’s a powerful tool for those looking to level up their detox protocol or address a chronic issue. It is also not something you would do every week. Dr. Purita explained that unless you have mold toxicity, Lyme disease or other autoimmune condition, he’d recommend EBO2 once a quarter or once every six months.</p>
<p>You could consider EBO2 if:</p>
<ul>
<li>You are exposed to high levels of environmental toxins.</li>
<li>You are an athlete seeking faster recovery and better performance.</li>
<li>You are focused on aging gracefully and maintaining vitality.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, EBO2 may not not suitable for everyone. Davis and Purita did highlight that people with certain conditions, like G6PD deficiency, or those on blood thinners should consult their healthcare provider before trying EBO2.</p>
<p>One important consideration both doctors pointed out is that since ozone activates the AMPk pathway, it mobilizes and pushes glucose into cells. While this is a positive metabolic effect, it can lead to a temporary drop in blood sugar during the session.</p>
<p>“Because blood sugar can drop during the procedure, we recommend having a high-carbohydrate meal beforehand,” Purita says. “If blood sugar levels fall too low during the treatment, we’re prepared to address it with intravenous glucose to keep patients comfortable and safe.”</p>
<p>Davis adds that EBO2 is also not a standalone solution. Pairing EBO2 with tools like hyperbaric oxygen therapy, molecular hydrogen, red light therapy, and cryotherapy may create a synergistic effect that can take recovery and performance to the next level. However, there’s no one-size-fits-all protocol, and we don’t yet know what’s the most effective way to combine them.</p>
<p>“Everyone’s experimenting,” Dr. Davis noted, “so I’m trying to figure out the right timing to stack all the modalities.”</p>

It’s all about <a href="https://www.muscleandfitness.com/muscle-fitness-hers/hers-workouts/wellness-coach-marnie-alton-gets-your-mornings-movingpage-sep-sitename/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">early morning yoga sessions</a>, Deeley tells M&F.</p>
<p>It’s hard to believe that Cat Deeley has been on television for more than 25 years, first appearing on the children’s show <em>SMTV Live</em> in 1998 and later moving into primetime television. While Deeley is fondly known to fellow Brits for her early on-screen partnership with Ant and Dec, U.S. fans on the other side of the pond will recall her hosting <em>So You Think You Can Dance</em> and presenting Fox’s New Year’s Eve Special from Times Square.</p>
<p>While this presenter’s resume includes being a children’s author, an actor, and a patron of London’s Great Ormand Street Hospital, she is also a loving mother to two sons and has now entered what is perhaps the busiest era of her career to date. In the UK, Deeley has taken up the duties as co-presenter on T<em>his Morning,</em> and is now promoting her recently wrapped project <em>The Joe Schmo Show</em> in the U.S.</p>
<p>My first question is simple: How on earth does she fit it all in? “With Grandma and Grandad, and an amazing nanny,” explains the star while making a juggling gesture with her arms!</p>

<h2>Cat Deeley Stays Composed in the Chaotic World of Television</h2>
<p>For <em>The Joe Schmo Show,</em> Deeley’s brief is to present what seems like a standard reality-show based competition, until you learn that everyone is an actor except for the one contestant who has been given the role of Joe. In this case, Ben Frisone, an electrician from Baltimore, puts himself through all manner of insane challenges to win $100,000. What he doesn’t realize is that he’s the only one who thinks the show is real. All of the other contestants are in on the joke, and they are only there to increase the tension and hilarity in equal measure.</p>
<p>I ask Deeley how she stays composed while explaining the various tasks to Frisone, such as the requirement for him to wade through excrement in order to be the first to find a golden nugget. “I actually don’t know,” she confides with all honesty. Of course, her skillset is honed and her chops as an experienced television personality were in full force here, as she helped to raise the comedy stakes. But the host almost turned down the job through fear of being involved with anything that might turn out to be cruel to the contestant.</p>
<p>“I said I don’t know, if the idea is that I’m going to have to be really mean,” she says of some early conversations. “This guy, he’s the only one who doesn’t know that this show has been [scripted] and I’m like, I’m not your girl.” But because Deeley had collaborated with the show’s producer going back to her days working for MTV, there was a level of trust that finally persuaded her to sign-on. The star says the beauty of <em>The Joe Schmo Show</em> in 2025 is that it is able to find a balance between being “an improv and funny,” while “not pushing Ben too far the other way.”</p>
<p>Still, had Deeley made just one verbal mistake or laughed in the wrong place and given up the game, the crew would have needed to scramble to salvage the whole season. It’s the type of pressure that Deeley also faces each day on <em>This Morning,</em> the live magazine style show where anything can and often does go wrong. Deeley says she is no “gym bunny,” but has found her own path to serenity outside of the unpredictable world of TV with yoga.</p>

<h2>Cat Deeley Says Yoga Helps Her Meet Her Daily Demands</h2>
<p>“I’m not really very flexible,” says the star. “So, actually, the yoga really works for me … It makes me breathe and calms down my mind at the same time. I can do it wherever I want to do it.” Deeley says that while she started out her yoga path with various in-person teachers, she is now able to hop online and be guided through a pre-recorded session. “I do it that way instead, so I can fit in whenever I need to do,” she says. “Around two small boys and working.” The presenter tells M&F that she aims for 30-minute daily sessions.</p>
<p>Her busy weekday routine begins when the alarm clock goes off at 5am and the star makes a drink containing celery, ginger, and lemon: a revitalizing shot of antioxidants that also aids with digestion. Deeley then finds some early morning peace with her 30 minutes of yoga before sipping a coffee and hitting the shower. By the time Deeley leaves the house at 6.20am precisely, she is raring to get to the <em>This Morning</em> studio in London.</p>
<p>Yoga is, of course, a great way for busy people to balance their health and fitness with mindfulness. <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10184339/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">One major scientific review</a> has concluded that “almost all of the participants described that doing yoga has positive benefits on the mind and body.” Those benefits include working on Deeley’s flexibility while helping her to alleviate any aches and pains and even promoting better sleep quality. All these points are paramount for an in-demand television presenter.</p>
<h2>Cat Deeley Schedules Intermittent Fasting Around Work</h2>
<p>The star says that she didn’t take up intermittent fasting as a means of calorie restriction or losing weight, but her busy family life and career made her take a look at exactly when her own optimum eating times might be. These days, Deeley likes to sit down at the table with the fam (she is married to comedian Patrick Kielty) and finishes dinner by around 7pm. She next eats a meal at 11.30am the next day, while in the studio at <em>This Morning,</em> tasting the food of the celebrity guest chef of the day. “It just seems to work for me,” she explains. When the star does have some time off, Deeley loves the great outdoors and engaging in activities like surfing or horse riding. No doubt, her next vacation will be well-earned but for now, at least she is able to navigate each crazy day with a sensible approach to health and fitness.</p>
<p><em>The Joe Schmo Show</em> Season 4 airs on TBS and is now available to stream on the TBS app.</p>

<p>Just a few weeks out from one of bodybuilding’s biggest annual shows, the guests joining Dennis James on “The Menace Podcast” have cast their votes on who will place in the top 6 — and a clear favorite is emerging.</p>
<p>James, who has competed in an astonishing 11 Mr. Olympia contests was joined by Milos Sarcev, Chris Cormier, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JgvloXE57B8" target="_blank" rel="noopener">British bodybuilder “The Big Dea” on Jan. 24, 2025 (Episode 216)</a> as they covered a range of bodybuilding’s latest developments. Top of the list was the panels evolving picks for who will walk out of the Arnold Classic 2025 with the winner’s trophy, and a cool half-a-million dollars.</p>
<p>Here’s how the actual placings panned out last year:</p>
<h3>Arnold Classic 2024 results</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>1) Hadi Choopan</strong></li>
<li><strong>2) Samson Dauda</strong></li>
<li><strong>3) Rafael Brandao</strong></li>
<li><strong>4) Jonathan Delerosa</strong></li>
<li><strong>5) James Hollingshead</strong></li>
<li><strong>6) Akim Williams</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>And these were the panel’s latest picks for this year:</p>
<h3>Chris Cormier’s Arnold Classic 2025 picks</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>1) Derek Lunsford</strong></li>
<li><strong>2) Samson Dauda</strong></li>
<li><strong>3) Andrew Jacked</strong></li>
<li><strong>4) Shaun Clarida</strong></li>
<li><strong>5) Carlos Thomas Jr</strong></li>
<li><strong>6) Brandon Curry</strong></li>
</ul>
<h3>Milos Sarcev’s Arnold Classic 2025 picks</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>1) Samson Dauda</strong></li>
<li><strong>2) Andrew Jacked</strong></li>
<li><strong>3) Derek Lunsford</strong></li>
<li><strong>4) Shaun Clarida</strong></li>
<li><strong>5) Brandon Curry</strong></li>
<li><strong>6) William Bonac</strong></li>
</ul>
<h3>Big Dea’s Arnold 2025 picks</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>1) Samson Dauda</strong></li>
<li><strong>2) Andrew Jacked</strong></li>
<li><strong>3) Derek Lunsford</strong></li>
<li><strong>4) Carlos Thomas Jr</strong></li>
<li><strong>5) Shaun Clarida</strong></li>
<li><strong>6) Brandon Curry</strong></li>
</ul>
<h3>Dennis James Arnold 2025 picks</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>1) Samson Dauda</strong></li>
<li><strong>2) Andrew Jacked</strong></li>
<li><strong>3) Derek Lunsford</strong></li>
<li><strong>4) Brandon Curry</strong></li>
<li><strong>5) Shaun Clarida</strong></li>
<li><strong>6) Carlos Thomas Jr or William Bonac</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>With three out of the four votes placing him first at the Arnold 2025, Samson Dauda has unsurprisingly emerged as the clear favorite. “Samson is coming off the Olympia, I think he’s on a role,” explains James of his choice. “I think he will do what Mr Olympia is supposed to do. Come back and win.”</p>
<p>The guys also predicted big things for Andrew Jacked after a disappointing Olympia appearance last year, and a potential surprise from Brandon Curry who is looking huge right now, but James feared that there may be “too many cooks” in Derek Lunsford camp as of late, so it will be interesting to see which version of himself arrives in Columbus, Ohio.</p>

If you’ve seen recent images of Jennifer Aniston looking fitter than ever at 55-years-young, then you may be wondering how the popular Hollywood star maintains her ageless beauty.

<p>If you’ve seen recent images of Jennifer Aniston looking fitter than ever at 55-years-young, then you may be wondering how the popular Hollywood star maintains her ageless beauty. Apparently, it’s all about “breaking a sweat without breaking your body,” explains her coach, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/dani_bcoleman/?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dani Coleman</a>, talking exclusively to <em>M&F.</em></p>
<p>Dani Coleman is a seasoned dancer and has suffered unavoidable wear and tear due to the high impact nature of her favored art. The coach tells M&F that she first began her fitness journey as a way to stay in shape — without grinding herself into the ground. “Dance gave me my love of movement, while fitness gave me the ability to share that passion with people on a larger scale,” she explains.</p>
<p>It was Coleman’s burgeoning career as a fitness professional led her to join <a href="https://www.pvolve.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pvolve</a> in 2020 — an organization that teaches <a href="https://www.muscleandfitness.com/routine/workouts/workout-routines/the-functional-workout-routine/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">functional methods for staying in shape</a> both in studio and online. When Jennifer Aniston was encouraged by a friend to try it out for herself, the two would forge a relationship based on trust, and a ton of sweat.</p>
<p>“I’ll never forget our first session,” shares Coleman. “We did a full-body workout using our p.band, p.ball, and gliders.” For the uninitiated, these are some of the patented accessories used in Pvolve’s varied classes. “Jen loves a challenging workout, and our sessions help you break a sweat without breaking your body,” explains Coleman. “No two workouts are ever the same, and I love programming her workouts using our unique resistance equipment to keep her on her toes, and to help meet her body where it’s at on a particular day.”</p>
<h2>Jennifer Aniston’s Self-Care Routine</h2>
<p>Of course, before even getting into the specific movements that Jennifer Aniston incorporates into her workouts, there will be those that say she has all the money and time in the world to invest in her physique. But really that’s just a cop-out mostly uttered by those who want to justify staying on the couch.</p>
<p>“What I love about working out is that no one can do it for you,” says Coleman. “You have to show up for yourself and do the work for yourself. When it comes to getting started, it’s about prioritizing your time and finding a workout that you actually enjoy and will commit to. Start small with 10 to15 minute workouts, three times a week, to help build consistency and then scale from there. Also, <a href="https://www.muscleandfitness.com/workouts/workout-tips/mobility-training-tips-to-maximize-movement-and-strength/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">find more ways to incorporate movement into your day-to-day</a>, like stretching during your favorite show, or taking your phone call on a walk. Movement doesn’t have to be done in a gym setting to count.”</p>
<p>Coleman details some of the easy tasks that can bring quick wins. These are the same methods practiced by Aniston and her other clients without even entering a gym.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Drink water and focus on hydration</strong></li>
<li><strong>Get enough sleep</strong></li>
<li><strong>Be mindful of posture, especially if on a computer all day</strong></li>
<li><strong>Take short walks </strong></li>
</ul>

<h2>Exercises Jennifer Aniston Uses For A Super Star Body</h2>
<p>Once you begin to see those big results by making small changes, it’s game on! Aniston never allows herself a chance to become bored, so her workouts rotate to keep her body guessing. Coleman explains that Pvolve’s classes include sessions such as ‘Strength & Sculpt’, ‘Sculpt & Burn’, and progressive weight training. “We train your core 360-degrees,” enthuses the coach. Not only does Aniston stick to the plan, but she’s even helped design her own workout sessions called ‘Strength Redefined.’ If you want to follow her path to fitness, then these are some exercises you can try:</p>
<ul>
<li>Plank variations</li>
<li>Resistance band work</li>
<li>Dumbbell lunges</li>
<li>Weighted stretches</li>
<li>Cardio – moving your body while staying on a mat</li>
</ul>
<p>These movements don’t have to be done via the Pvolve platform, but many people find that this type of group fitness class, either online or in person, keeps them coming back for more says Coleman. In fact, <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6756792/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">studies have shown the benefits of group fitness</a> compared to individual workouts, those who worked out in groups felt more “intrinsically motivated to engage in high intensity-exercises.”</p>
<h2>Jennifer Aniston is Highly Invested in Her Health</h2>
<p>For a Hollywood A-Lister like Aniston, aesthetics is everything in the competitive world of showbiz, but her sweat equity is resulting in more than an epic resume. “The results go far beyond aesthetics,” says Coleman.</p>
<p>For women, working out as they mature can also alleviate the symptoms of menopause. <a href="https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC4828504/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">One study has concluded</a> that “Sedentary women should consider modification of their lifestyle to include physical activity as it leads to improvement in their quality of life.” By balancing her hormones via weight training, and building her cardiovascular endurance through moving and stretching, Jennifer Aniston looks set to glow for some time to come. Coach Coleman says that the secret to saying consistent is all about balancing work with fun. “Our sessions are filled with hard work, a good playlist, and a few intermissions to play with the pups!”</p>

<p>The defined Dutchman, Wesley Vissers, won first place at the 2024 Arnold Classic, and already <a href="https://www.muscleandfitness.com/flexonline/training/wesley-vissers-2-move-road-to-olympia-biceps-workout/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has his sights set on Olympia gold in 2025</a>. Boiling over with enthusiasm, he has now taken to social media in order to share his Wesley Vissers Olympia Rule Change suggestion for the Olympia and other major bodybuilding competitions.</p>
<p>“Who else thinks the side tricep pose should be mandatory in classic?” asked Vissers of his one-million-plus Instagram followers on Jan 25. In the post, Vissers can be seen breaking out the aforementioned side triceps pose, while revealing huge arms that closely resemble twisted steel. By perfecting the pose, he had his followers impressed, but it’s not obligatory at the Olympia or other classic division shows.</p>

<h2>Making Sense of the ‘Wesley Vissers Olympia Rule Change’</h2>
<p>As of now, the mandatory poses in the Classic Division consist of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Front Double Biceps</li>
<li>Side Chest</li>
<li>Back Double Biceps</li>
<li>Abdominal and Thighs</li>
<li>Favorite Classic Pose (a variation on the above)</li>
</ul>
<p>While the side triceps pose is not mandatory in classic physique, judges may still call for it, so it makes sense to be like Vissers and practice it for good measure. Still, despite his success at the Arnold, the big man placed a disappointing eighth place at last year’s Olympia But with Chris Bumstead lifting what may prove to be his sixth and final trophy at the event, before hanging up the lifting straps, there’s everything to fight for. “Amazing physique,” wrote one fan. “Classic lines!” commented another.</p>
<p>When it came to the Wesley Vissers Olympia rule change suggestion, other fans felt that there was another way for the athlete to deliver it as a mandatory pose. “I think you should just compete in the open,” wrote one follower. “Just do open?” echoed another. Of course, Vissers’ suggestion was largely made as a bit of fun to accompany his tremendous triceps pics but never say never in the world of bodybuilding.</p>
<p>One thing is for sure: This will be a pivotal year for the Dutchman.</p>

<p>Alzheimer’s disease is a cruel ailment that gradually takes our memory, language, and sense of self, but new research is showing how regular exercise can serve as a preventative tool, minimizing many of its markers.</p>
<p>Alzheimer’s main biological features are the presence of amyloid protein plaques, tau tangles (abnormal accumulations of the tau protein in the brain) and myelin degeneration (myelin helps to transmit electrical impulses in the brain). <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0006899324006747?via%3Dihub" target="_blank" rel="noopener">A new study, recently published in <em>Science Direct: Brain Research</em></a> has successfully built on a growing body of evidence that points to physical exercise as a means of reducing these biological features. Experts from the University of Bristol (UK), and the Federal University of São Paulo (Brazil) put aged rodents through structured programs of aerobic activity and <a href="https://www.bristol.ac.uk/news/2025/january/aerobic-exercise-alzheimers.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">found that physical exercise had the following positive effects</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Reduced amyloid protein plaques by approximately 76%</strong></li>
<li><strong>Reduced tau tangles by around 63%</strong></li>
<li><strong>Reduced inflammation by up to 68%</strong></li>
<li><strong>Improved communication between brain cells</strong></li>
<li><strong>Increased the number of brain protective cells</strong></li>
</ul>
<h2>Exercise is Essential To Fighting Alzheimer’s Disease</h2>
<p><span style="font-size: 16px">While a firm number is yet to be placed on how often you should exercise in order to help alleviate AD, the take home message is simple: <a href="https://www.muscleandfitness.com/features/feature-news/avoid-a-sedentary-lifestyle-to-improve-brain-function/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Swapping a sedentary lifestyle for one that includes regular aerobic activity is essential for longevity</a>. “Alzheimer’s is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder with no known cure, impacting millions worldwide,” says Dr Augusto Coppi, who is one of the study’s authors. “While physical exercise is known to reduce cognitive decline, the cellular mechanisms behind its neuroprotective effects have remained elusive—until now. This research highlights the potential for aerobic exercise to serve as a cornerstone in preventive strategies for Alzheimer’s.”</span></p>
<p>The authors of the study also suggest that public health initiatives should prioritise the promotion of exercise programs that are tailored to aging populations. <a href="https://www.muscleandfitness.com/features/feature-news/study-shows-possible-reversal-of-physical-decline-in-old-age/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">For the elderly, exercises such as cycling or swimming could be a safe option</a> where avoiding injury is paramount. But you don’t have to be getting on in years to begin the fight against AD. The onset of Alzheimer’s disease can begin 20 years before symptoms appear, so there’s no better time to get your body moving than today.</p>

<p>If you love <em>Rambo, Die Hard,</em> and <em>Taken,</em> you’ll be pleased to learn that Jason Statham’s new movie, <em>A Working Man</em> is following in the footsteps of the one-man-army who takes on a gazillion bad guys to save the day. With the trailer hitting more than 12 million views in a single week, here’s what you need to know about this epic cinema event.</p>
<p>It’s only January but there’s already a contender for the best action-thriller the year. If you think you’ve had a bad day at work, spare a thought for Jason Statham who plays an ex-Roral Marines commando who just wants to settle down to normality as a peaceful construction worker. He’s enraged however, when his boss’s teenage daughter is kidnapped by human traffickers and so begins the uncovering of a conspiracy involving corrupt government agents. It’s the type of premise you’ve seen before, but the personnel involved in this project make for a must-see-movie.</p>
<h2>Who Wrote ‘A Working Man’?</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.muscleandfitness.com/entertainment/every-rocky-movie-ranked/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sylvester Stallone created the <em>Rocky</em> franchise</a> and who starred in five <em>Rambo</em> movies and four Expendable films, not to mention classics like <em>Cobra</em> and <em>Cliff Hanger</em>, wrote the screenplay after adapting the story from the Chuck Dixon novel, Levon’s Trade. The movie itself was shot in London and Berkshire, England, in 2024, and the highly anticipated trailer was released on Jan 9, 2025.</p>
<h2>When is the Release Date for ‘A Working Man’?</h2>
<p>Amazon MGM Studios have announced that all hell will break loose as Statham attempts to obliterate the bad guys in theaters starting March 28, 2025.</p>
<h2>Watch the Official ‘A Working Man’ Trailer</h2>
<p></p>
<p>With more than 12 million hits in the first week, it appears that action fans are ready and eagerly waiting for more of the same from Statham. “Jason Statham can play the same action role over and over and I’ll never get tired of it,” <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zTbgNC42Ops" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote one YouTube user</a>. “Just the perfect movies to shut off your brain and relax after a long day,” wrote another. <em>M&F</em> says pass the popcorn; we’re here for this!</p>

<p>Let’s be honest, for most guys, one of the main reasons to get a pump going at the gym is to <a href="https://www.muscleandfitness.com/flexonline/training/7-best-moves-massive-biceps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">build sleeve busting biceps</a> that Olympia champions like Jay Cutler have amassed. Fortunately, the man himself is always giving when it comes to passing down the moves that work best for him, and in this case, it seems that there’s one awesome arm exercise that is at the top of his list.</p>
<p>While the regular dumbbell bicep curl is one of the most repeated exercises in the free weight area of your local gym, there are other ways and means to win at building brilliant biceps <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DFJT2MNxVxm/?igsh=d3BnaTJqanlwYXl3" target="_blank" rel="noopener">explained the four-time Mr Olympia kingpin in a recent Instagram demonstration</a>. “We’re gonna focus on the cambered bar curl,” Cutler schooled his 5.5 million followers.</p>
<h2>Why Use a Cambered Bar for Bicep Curls?</h2>
<p>Cutler’s cambered bar of choice here is also known as an EZ-curl bar. Not only do <a href="https://peerj.com/articles/5165/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">some studies show that using a bar activates the biceps better than dumbbells</a>, but many people find the shape more accessible for their grip, requiring less rotation in the wrist and avoiding potential strains while upping the loading potential.</p>

<h2>Jay Cutler Demonstrates Cable Bicep Curls with a Cambered Bar</h2>
<p>“Now, what I love about the cables is that constant tension,” explained Cutler. “So, what I like to do is get that nice stretch.” The bodybuilding legend says that the tension from lowering the weighted plates on a cable machine is more constant than the sudden drop you get from a falling dumbbell. “We’re still gonna focus on 10 or 12 repetitions,” he said. “Really getting that contraction, and not necessarily powering or cheating through the movements.”</p>
<p>Cutler says that another advantage of cable curls is that you are more locked to the ground, leading to better form. “Now, with the free weights I tend to move a little but more of my body whereas (with) the cables I’m a little more stationary,” he explained. “This is more of a concentrated movement, contractive, and really, really good for you guys looking for that crazy pump.”</p>
<p>Cutler begins his demo by picking up the bar to around waist-height and then leans a little backwards so that his chest is further away from the cable station than his feet. The big man then keeps his legs and torso as still as possible while lifting the bar and curling his arms until his hands reach head height.</p>
<p>Note that Cutler maintains a controlled and consistent speed as he focuses on the movement and slows it down for that all-important time under tension. “Hitting these curls with the cables as opposed to free weights is gonna help with keeping the tension throughout the full range of motion,” he explained. “And make(s) is more difficult to let momentum do any of the work! Give these a try next time you’re hitting biceps!”</p>

<p>WWE wrestlers are known as “Superstars” for a number of valid reasons. Not only do they bounce back like superheroes, weathering the rigors of the ring in one town only to come back stronger in the next, but they also juggle an insane out-of-ring schedule all while trying to bag a golden belt. I recently found myself being put through the type of workout that is befitting of a pro wrestler, and it soon became clear that AMRAP style circuits come about as close as you can get to training like a WWE Superstar without being on the wrong end of a punishing piledriver.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.instagram.com/judesamuel_/?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jude Samuel</a>, a 4th degree BJJ Black belt and lead fitness instructor at <a href="https://eightclub.co.uk/core/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Eight Club in Shoreditch</a>, London, was selected as coach for the day, and his mission was to take WWE’s most flamboyant tag-team “Pretty Deadly,” and the rest of us mere mortal journalists through an intense session of sweat. Pretty Deadly are former WWE NXT and WWE NXT UK tag-team champions and are currently at the top of their game.</p>
<p>Having spent quite a bit of time in the wrestling ring myself <a href="https://www.muscleandfitness.com/athletes-celebrities/pro-tips/how-to-become-a-pro-wrestler-with-tna-impact-wrestling/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">(you can read about some of my latest exploits here )</a>, I came to this workout with a ton of respect for how physically fit a WWE grappler really needs to be. There’s no question that performing as a pro wrestler requires explosive speed, strength, and stamina. So, whether you want to follow in the footsteps of The Rock or John Cena, or just want to test your own mettle, here’s how to try it for yourself:</p>

<h2>The ‘Pretty Deadly’ AMRAP Circuit Workout</h2>
<h3>Warmup</h3>
<p>To start the blood flowing and the muscles moving ahead our 7.30am workout, we began with a warmup of banded lateral steps to get us ready for action.</p>
<h3>The Workout</h3>
<p>To attempt this circuit, you will perform as many reps as you can (AMRAP) for sets of 30 seconds and then take a 15 second rest. You will perform three sets with each exercise before moving on to the next. Here are the exercises:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FbGrHJyG8o" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Inclined seated dumbbell curl</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGnhixvC8uA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Overhead barbell press</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QxYhFwMd1Ks" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Medicine Ball Slams</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kBWAon7ItDw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Barbell Rows</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LUWFQORjevE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Medicine Ball Lunges</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apsp_uuXZTU" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Side Lunges</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyK8UiC-BUw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dumbbell Lateral Raise</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0GcZ24pK6k" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bodyweight Squats</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>The Finisher</h3>
<p>Sprint as fast as you can for those three remaining sets.</p>
<p></p>
<h2>The ‘Pretty Deadly’ AMRAP Circuit Workout Breakdown</h2>
<p>To execute the inclined seated dumbbell curl, you’ll be letting your arms drop almost all the way to the ground before lifting the weight back up. This is a movement that WWE</p>
<p>SmackDown’s Pretty Deadly tag-team partners; Elton Prince and Kit Wilson find themselves doing dozens of times per match, as they reach down for their bulky opponents before attempting to lift them up. Here, you’ll be building your own bicep strength. By making sure that your range of motion really gets low before you raise the dumbbell back up, this will increase the tension of the curl.</p>
<p>If you’ve ever seen <a href="https://www.muscleandfitness.com/athletes-celebrities/news/top-25-wwe-superstars-all-time/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Ultimate Warrior, Goldberg, Brock Lesnar, or more recently, Braun Strowman</a> in action, then you will be aware that the overhead press is one of the most celebrated moves in WWE, as these beasts demonstrate their dominance over a hapless foe. Okay, so you might not be quite ready to lift a human being over your head, but make sure to work with a challenging weight on the barbell to increase upper-body strength without sacrificing form.</p>
<p>In the gym, and in the ring, what goes up must come down. We practiced the principle of slamming our opponents into the mat by driving a medicine ball down with authority. “Yes boy!” shouted Pretty Deadly to motivate me. “Yes boy!” I shouted back as I attempted to slam my rival… I mean medicine ball through the matted floor of Club Eight. This was followed up with some barbell rows, just to make sure that we never “back out” of an important match.</p>
<p>Lunges are an essential move to master in order to prevent injury, especially when it comes to marquee matches like the upcoming Royal Rumble where bodies can come at you from all directions. Side lunging is great for flexibility, while adding a medicine ball into the mix will build on your potential for explosive power, too.</p>
<p>The dumbbell lateral raise is great for improving shoulder mobility and will also bolster your performance in terms of lifts. As an added bonus, by executing this move you’ll be on the path to realizing that coveted pro wrestler physique as you begin to build some boulder shoulders.</p>
<p>As I begin my rounds of bodyweight squats, Elton Prince and Kit Wilson decide to play a prank and commandeer a nearby camera, blocking the view of my exhausted movements in favor of some of their trademark showboating. I try to carry on regardless as the two combatants demonstrate that their performances in front of a crowd are just as important as the one they must smash in each and every gym session.</p>
<p>“Here we can see the common man learning how to squat,” commentates Wilson with his pretty decent David Attenborough impression before recreating what looked like a scene from the movie Zoolander, gyrating in front of the camera. At this point I felt like a deer in the headlights!</p>
<p>In terms of sprinting, racing from rope-to-rope before crushing your opponent with a thunderous clothesline is par for the course in WWE, and gone are the days of the plodding grapplers from yesteryear. To hang with today’s crop of athletic wrestlers, you’ll need stamina as well as strength, so sprints are a great way to work on your cardiovascular conditioning. It certainly requires a great deal of heart to make it in the wild world of WWE.</p>
<p>Battered but not beaten, I completed the workout thanks to the eccentric encouragement of Pretty Deadly. “He put in a shift!” remarks Elton Prince, providing me with his much hoped for seal approval. All I can say is that this workout is worthy of a WWE champion, so make sure you hydrate! Pretty Deadly may have tested my endurance by making me use my lungs for laughing on several occasions, but they do say that fitness should be fun! Hats off to you guys, there’s no questioning that WWE Superstars are deadly serious athletes.</p>

United States Army Lieutenant Colonel Sean Donohue was familiar with military service long before his own career began in 2002.

<p>United States Army Lieutenant Colonel Sean Donohue was familiar with military service long before his own career began in 2002. Both of his grandfathers served their country, and Donohue grew up in Tacoma, WA near Joint Base Lewis-McChord. It may come as a surprise that one of his parents were not on board with the prospect of him putting on the nation’s cloth.</p>
<p>“I always thought the military was an intriguing opportunity,” Donohue said. “But it was nothing my mother ever wanted me associated with, nor did she ever articulate why she felt that way.”</p>
<p>What Donohue did take part in was sports. He played baseball and football at different points of his childhood, but he acknowledged that fitness was not his best quality growing up.</p>
<p>Donohue recalled, “I was an active kid, but weight was always problem for me.” He did find success in the pool and even swam competitively in college. However, he opted to focus more on music and got his degree in Music Business.</p>
<p>“I thought I was going to be working with rock bands,” he shared.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption "><img loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.muscleandfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/LTC-Sean-Donohue-giving-a-presentation-on-behalf-of-the-Armys-Holistic-Health-and-Fitness-H2F.jpg?quality=86&strip=all" alt="LTC Sean Donohue giving a presentation on behalf of the Army’s Holistic Health and Fitness (H2F)" width="1109" height="614" data-fallback-img="https://i0.wp.com/www.muscleandfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/LTC-Sean-Donohue-giving-a-presentation-on-behalf-of-the-Armys-Holistic-Health-and-Fitness-H2F.jpg?quality=86&strip=all"><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><span class="credit">LTC Sean Donohue</span></figcaption></figure>
<h2>He Answered His Country’s Call</h2>
<p>Like many current members of the <a href="https://www.defense.gov/About/our-forces/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Armed Forces</a>, Donohue opted to consider service after the terrorist attacks on the United States on September 11, 2001. By 2002, Donohue officially shifted his focus from music to the Army. In spite of his athletic background, he was concerned about how he would hold up in basic training. Things turned out okay for him, though.</p>
<p>“It worked well enough and I remember being the oldest guy in my basic training company at 23 and one of only two of us who passed the old APFT on the first test.”</p>
<p>In the 23 years since, he worked in several capacities while traveling the world, including as a combat medic, legislative liaison, TRADOC-IMT Surgeon, and is currently a PA while living in Virginia. He is thankful for the leaders that have challenged and supported him throughout his two decades in service.</p>
<p>“I’ve been very fortunate to be surrounded by great leaders throughout my career and I’m grateful that some of them have encouraged me to do things that I wasn’t entirely convinced of at the time.”</p>
<p>He may be the one performing on a day-to-day basis, but the husband and father of three emphasizes that he did not make this commitment alone.</p>
<p>“I’m most proud of my family though, Lexey and I joined the Army- meaning we made the choice together to become an Army family.”</p>
<p>They have found fitness to be another common bond that holds them together and a great way to stay connected while continuing to be at their best for themselves and each other. Donohue got into cycling during the lockdowns, and his family joined him in pursuing the new passion.</p>
<p>Donohue explained, “For our family, it was a great way to connect and share nature and the outdoors together.”</p>
<figure class="wp-caption "><img loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.muscleandfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/LTC-Sean-Donohue-mountain-biking-down-a-scenic-dirt-path.jpg?quality=86&strip=all" alt="LTC Sean Donohue mountain biking down a scenic dirt path" width="1109" height="614" data-fallback-img="https://i0.wp.com/www.muscleandfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/LTC-Sean-Donohue-mountain-biking-down-a-scenic-dirt-path.jpg?quality=86&strip=all"><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><span class="credit">LTC Sean Donohue</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>He took it a step further and went on to coach the largest team in Virginia, and he proudly shared that his youngest son continued cycling and raced nationally for a few years. His son eventually shifted his focus back to academics, but he himself went on to start taking part in cyclocross, a hybrid of road and mountain biking.</p>
<p>“Lots of mud, sand, hills and running. Legend says it started as a way for French soldiers to train in winter. It’s a blast and I love the community.”</p>
<p>That is only one aspect of his personal commitment to being his best self. He has also been dedicated to the weights and running, which made his travels across the globe a little more enjoyable.</p>
<p>“My travels would never have been so rich if it wasn’t for making time to squeeze in a run.”</p>
<p>Donohue is currently involved with the <a href="https://www.muscleandfitness.com/athletes-celebrities/pro-tips/maj-gen-john-kline-shares-how-h2f-can-reshape-the-future-of-the-u-s-army/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Army’s Holistic Health and Fitness (H2F)</a> readiness system, which is designed to help soldiers improve in five different pillars (physical, mental, spiritual, nutrition, sleep). As a Clinical Integration lead, Donohue is helping lay the groundwork of this program and sees its potential for success now and later as they develop over 100 teams across the Army over the next few years.</p>
<p>“Not only will H2F serve soldiers now, but it will help make life easier for them after they become veterans.”</p>
<p>Donohue will be sharing his passion and knowledge with many attendees at an upcoming United States Air Force Honor Guard Symposium in Washington, D.C. on Feb. 13, 2025. Donohue will be bringing his knowledge and experience with H2F with him as he joins other well-respected members of the military community such as LTC Charjo Grant, USAF SSgt Chase Griffin, and others. Donohue is excited to be in a position to help many others learn how to be their best so they can continue giving their best to the nation. He sees the opportunity for what it is, a way to reach Americans that they normally may not.</p>
<p>“We’re really fortunate to have a national platform. Militarily speaking, we may only be one percent of the nation, yet we can have an outweighing effect on the greater environment. This is a great opportunity to have more of a national discourse.”</p>
<p>Donohue’s impact has been and will continue to be felt for the rest of his career and even after by many that he may never meet in person. He looks back at his career fondly and sees his future as bright with many more opportunities to come. He also hopes that the next generation of Americans that enter service will be aware of their own potential and invest into that with the same energy and commitment that he had into his own career.</p>
<p>“Take a chance on being truly great yourself.”</p>

<p>Manchester City Women’s Football Club, more affectionately known as “Manchester City Women” are working hard in the Women’s Super League this season after a period of resurgence that saw them come a very close second to Chelsea last year. Helping to spearhead that surge in soccer progress after the team suffered setbacks and injuries in previous years is Emma Deakin, the Director of Performance Services at MCWFC.</p>
<p>For Deakin, who comes to soccer with a wealth of experience gained by training Olympic gold winning athletes such as triathlon’s Brownlee brothers, building a winning team is about forging strong relationships. The Manchester City Women’s performance coach must also navigate personal player circumstances as she carefully considers factors such as training load, injury prevention, and recovery.</p>
<p><em>M&F</em> sat down to find out more from Deakin, who has been an important contributor to some of City’s most recent soccer PRs.</p>
<p><strong>You have worked extensively with Olympic athletes in the past, were you able to travel to any of the Games?</strong></p>
<p>I’ve been lucky enough to go to four Olympic Games and have special memories from each one. Beijing 2008 was my first Games and my first time in that major multi-sporting environment. As a massive sports fan there’s something really unique about everyone being in the same place at the same time with the same goal, and very surreal sat having dinner with Usain Bolt on one side of you and the Williams sisters on the other!</p>
<p><strong>You originally joined Manchester Women’s Football Club in January 2023 as their new Injury Management lead. What are some of the most common injuries in soccer?</strong></p>
<p>Muscle injuries are obviously common in any running-based sport and in women’s football, quad and hamstring injuries are more common. Our aim is to condition our players as well as possible to cope with the growing demands of the game and reduce the risk and severity of these types of injuries.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.muscleandfitness.com/workouts/workout-tips/top-techniques-avoiding-knee-injuries/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) injuries</a> are commonly discussed in the media but aren’t isolated to women’s football. I’d say that most injuries we see are sports-specific, rather than gender specific. For example, ankle inversions or issues related to tackles and concussions. For me, especially coming from a physiotherapy background, it’s vital that we take a multi-discipline approach to all our injuries, with clear exit criteria and ‘return to play’ guidelines. At City we involve the football coaches in the recovery journey as early as possible – we want to <a href="https://www.muscleandfitness.com/muscle-fitness-hers/hers-features/when-are-women-most-likely-to-be-injured-playing-sports-heres-the-answer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">minimize risk and optimize player performance on return</a>.</p>

<p><strong>What are some of the best ways for a soccer player to rest and recover?</strong></p>
<p>We spend a lot of time monitoring and reviewing wellness data and trends – both across the squad and in individual players. Recovery is specific to each player, and we develop bespoke plans which incorporate a range of modalities including cryotherapy, massage or nutrition. Properly incorporating rest and recovery based on wellness data is a key strategy for preventing injury and something we really focus on.</p>
<p><strong>How would you describe your current role as the Director of Performance Services?</strong></p>
<p>My role as Director of Performance Services for MCWFC is to align and drive all the performance service departments to deliver our performance strategy. Across our multi-disciplinary team, we deliver a range of services – from strength and conditioning, to nutrition, rehab and recovery. One area of the role that’s relatively new to me is player recruitment, which includes assessing the physical condition of incoming players and how they’ll adapt to our training style and load.</p>
<p><strong>You mentioned training load. How is this designed?</strong></p>
<p>Our overall philosophy is to keep training load high to support performance and protect against injuries. Generally, squad training load is designed around fixtures and the team schedule so a week with two games looks different to a one game week. But within that there’s a lot of bespoke programming, and individual load will change based on the position they play, what we want them to achieve during a game, their history, any risk factors, injuries or return to play modifications etc.</p>
<p><strong>Do you encourage players to get in the gym on their own time?</strong></p>
<p>Generally, we don’t encourage working out away from the Club because gym programming is built into each individual player’s schedule and based around results from profiling and individual athlete plans. We design programs so that the rest days are to be true days off, and our players are world-class professional athletes who understand their program of activity.</p>
<p><strong>What types of exercise sessions would you recommend to a soccer player?</strong></p>
<p>Every player is different, but football is a running-based sport with lots of high intensity actions and maximum acceleration and deceleration, so any gym program needs to support an athlete’s ability to perform these actions again and again. Ultimately there’s no escaping the basics of strength training and in particular lower limb strength-based training is key.</p>
<p>Our players come from a wide variety of countries and cultures and ultimately, they are individuals with their own training histories and experiences. If they have an interest in different training methods, whether that’s yoga, swimming or boxing, we’ll always try to look at how to incorporate that in a way that works with their player program and doesn’t detract from their ability to perform at training or in a game.</p>
<p><strong>How much of a role does nutrition play in performance services and are players provided with plans or meals, or education around the subject?</strong></p>
<p>Nutrition is huge for both performance and recovery. We have a full-time nutritionist that works on an individual, squad and educational basis. The nutritionist ensures players have access to the right food at the right time and that regularly means working closely with our chefs at Manchester City Football Academy, and hotels and catering when we’re on the road. They work with individual players to develop nutrition plans to support their goals, for example if they’re recovering from an injury or if they are looking to put on extra lean muscle.</p>
<p>The nutritionist delivers education to players based on the most up-to-date research and literature, so our players understand why they’re eating certain foods at certain times, so that they can make empowered decisions that help them be the best athlete.</p>
<p><strong>What does the training schedule of a professional female soccer player at Manchester City look like?</strong></p>
<p>A typical day starts with a wellness check-in during the morning. We’ll talk about how they’re feeling, how they slept and ultimately if they’re good to train. Then they have breakfast as a team on-site. After breakfast they go to analysis where the team runs through what the training objectives are for the day, and they might review a specific game or some individual player clips.</p>
<p>Then we move onto preparation for on-field training by working the gym with programs tailored to an individual player based on their data, any injuries and the performance required of them at training. After training on the pitch as a team, they’ll come back in and we’ll do a shorter additional one-on-one or smaller group-based training session, depending on what a player needs that day or anything specific they’re working on. The squad then all have lunch together before an afternoon gym session. Then it might be on to commercial or media obligations, or educational activity before finishing for the day.</p>
<p><strong>I understand that there’s a great relationship between the staff in both the men’s and women’s teams!</strong></p>
<p>There’s a great relationship and learning environment across Manchester City Football Academy and that’s important for the development of football generally, not just the women’s game. We recruit the best individuals in their fields and to have that level of knowledge and experience under one roof is incredible.</p>
<p>The MCWFC performance team has seen real benefits from recruiting staff from both inside and outside of football. Together, we’ve got broad experience and expertise, and it’s allowed us to merge and take best practice from across world sport.</p>

<p><strong>The past couple of years have been a period of resurgence for the team. How much has fitness and conditioning played a role in these results?</strong></p>
<p>The demands of the women’s game are changing all the time and our approach to fitness and conditioning reflects that. For us, it’s not just about ensuring our players can perform at their best right now but also that we prepare them for the future demands of the game too. We want them to have long, healthy, high-performance careers. So, strength and conditioning, rehab, recovery and nutrition all play a vital role.</p>
<p><strong>In your time at Manchester City, how have the female athletes evolved in terms of their physical skills and acumen for fitness?</strong></p>
<p>The demands of the game are changing—both in terms of the physical intensity and frequency of games. We’re not just focused on ensuring players have the right level of fitness now, but we want to keep pushing on and raising the level too. Over the last few years, our benchmarks have been getting higher and higher, and our athletes have risen to meet them.</p>
<p><strong>What have been some of your personal highlights since joining Manchester City Women?</strong></p>
<p>Off the pitch; the development of the performance team. As individuals and as a department we’ve really progressed and grown. We’ve created a safe environment in which we can challenge each other and are encouraged to be curious about best practice and that’s really enabled us to develop the best possible programmes for our athletes.

Time. It’s the one thing we all wish we had more of, right? Carving out an hour for the gym is tough between work, family, and life throwing its usual curveballs.

<p>Time. It’s the one thing we all wish we had more of, right? Carving out an hour for the gym is tough between work, family, and life throwing its usual curveballs. But here’s the good news: you don’t always need one-hour workouts to get results. A focused 15-minute workout will help build strength and endurance, but only if you bring the heat.</p>
<p>Enter the 15-minute triset workout. This efficient approach is perfect <a href="https://www.muscleandfitness.com/workouts/workout-tips/8-ways-get-workout-busy-schedule/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">when life gets busy</a>, but your goals remain unchanged. Whether short on time, equipment, or motivation, this workout has you covered.</p>
<p>Let’s cut through the excuses and get to it—because 15 minutes is all you need to move the needle. Ready? Let’s get after it.</p>
<p></p>
<h2>Why Trisets are Effective</h2>
<p>When time is short, you need training that doesn’t waste a second—and that’s what a triset delivers. A triset is a series of three exercises performed back-to-back with little to no rest in between. It’s an excellent approach for getting stronger, building muscular endurance, and breaking a sweat.</p>
<p>Here’s why it works so well:</p>
<p><strong>Efficiency:</strong> Combining three moves into a continuous circuit maximizes every minute of your workout.</p>
<p><strong>Intensity:</strong> The nonstop nature of trisets keeps your heart rate up, giving you the double benefit of strength and conditioning in one workout.</p>
<p><strong>Muscle Growth:</strong> Trisets create a deep level of fatigue that stimulates muscle growth and strength development. Pushing your muscles to their limits will help you see results in half the time or less.</p>
<p></p>
<h3>Higher Reps Work Too</h3>
<p>Eight to twelve reps are not the be-all and end-all regarding muscle growth because muscle is built in varying rep ranges. Yes, you can build muscle by performing 15 reps and above. What does that mean for you? You can unlock gains you didn’t know you were missing, and here’s how.</p>
<h3>Endurance</h3>
<p>High-rep training pushes your muscles to sustain effort over extended periods, which is excellent for endurance and a game-changer for flex time. Plus, the mental grit you build by pushing through those extra reps carries over to all areas in and out of the gym.</p>
<h3>Increased Time Under Tension</h3>
<p>More reps mean your muscles are under more time under tension because prolonged tension is one of the keys to muscle growth. By keeping your muscles working longer, you’re building size and strengthening your connective tissues. Strong tendons and ligaments mean a more resilient body and the ability to do fun stuff longer.</p>
<h3>Motor Control</h3>
<p>High-rep sets allow you to refine your form and lock in efficient movement patterns. The more you practice a movement, the better you get at it. When your form improves, especially when you’re fatigued, so does your ability to lift heavier and train harder with a reduced injury risk.</p>
<h2>Strength and Endurance Warmup</h2>
<p>Take two minutes to rev up the engine by spending 30 seconds on each move. It will get your blood flowing and prepare your body for the intensity ahead:</p>
<p><strong>Warm-Up</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>High Knees or Jump Rope:</strong> Get your heart rate up and wake up those legs.</li>
<li><strong>Prying Bodyweight Squat:</strong> Loosen your hips and inner thighs.</li>
<li><strong>Yoga Push-Up:</strong> Train your chest, triceps, shoulders, and core with this hybrid exercise.</li>
<li><strong>Side Plank (15 seconds per side):</strong> Activate your obliques and shoulders.</li>
</ul>

<h2>15-Minute Strength and Endurance Workout</h2>
<p>Here’s what you have been waiting for: the good stuff. Perform 15 reps of each exercise, resting little between exercises and trisets, and do as many rounds as possible in 15 minutes. But don’t be a hero; if you need more rest, take it because quality over quantity always rules.</p>
<p><strong> 1A. Dumbbell Kang Squat</strong> (can be performed with bodyweight or a barbell)</p>
<p><strong>1B. Push Up Plus</strong> (can be performed on an incline if you’re unable to hit 15 reps at any time)</p>
<p><strong>1C. Unilateral Dumbbell Row Variation:</strong> 15 reps per side</p>
<h3>Cool-Down</h3>
<p>Cooling down is vital to recovery and preventing post-workout soreness. It helps slow your heart rate and breathing and enhances flexibility. After crushing your 15-minute triset workout, take a few minutes to wind down by doing the four exercises below.</p>
<p><strong>Cat-Cow Stretch (30 seconds):</strong> The Cat Cow stretches the muscles around your spine after all those rows and Kang squats.</p>
<p><strong>Child’s Pose (30 seconds):</strong> This stretch relieves tension in your lower back, hips, and shoulders.</p>
<p><strong>Standing Hamstring Stretch (30 seconds per leg):</strong> After the Kang squats, your hamstrings will thank you for this stretch.</p>
<p><strong>Standing Chest Stretch (30 seconds):</strong> Opens the chest muscles after all those push-ups.</p>
<p>Now, wasn’t that fun?</p>

Healthy Eating
https://www.muscleandfitness.com/?p=1170082
Cheese is rich and creamy, and that is the reason most of us love the stuff. So much so, that the average American guy consumes nearly 42 pounds of the dairy product each year, an amount that has been inching upwards in recent years. Sliced, shredded, melted, crumbled, or baked, we can’t get enough of [&#8230;]
<p>Cheese is rich and creamy, and that is the reason most of us love the stuff. So much so, that <a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/183785/per-capita-consumption-of-cheese-in-the-us-since-2000/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the average American guy consumes nearly 42 pounds of the dairy product each year</a>, an amount that has been inching upwards in recent years. Sliced, shredded, melted, crumbled, or baked, we can’t get enough of it.</p>
<p>Cheese is a staple in cultures all over the world, as before industrialization and refrigerators, fermented dairy products (cheese, kefir, yogurt) were common ways to keep dairy around for longer. These days, there are thousands of varieties ranging from rather pedestrian to truly funky.</p>
<p>As much as we adore this dairy product, though, most of us are a little weary of that block of cheddar or oozy mozzarella. “Cheese is my weakness” might be the way you think of it as if you are committing a dietary sin by digging into game-day nachos. It’s considered more of an indulgence than a health food. It’s easy to see why people might feel conflicted about this food group. Yes, the various types can be dense in calories, fat, and salt. But it’s also a source of protein, calcium, B vitamins, and other nutrients you want more of. That makes it a challenge to pigeonhole it into the healthy or unhealthy category.</p>
<p>Luckily, it appears as if cheese is something you can feel good about eating for health and muscle, as long as you play by the rules. Read on for the cheese facts you need to know before you make another call to Domino’s.</p>
<h2>How To Eat Cheese Without The Guilt</h2>
<p>If you always want more Parm on your pasta and can’t imagine your turkey sandwich minus the slice of Swiss, know this: Modern day research suggests that even full-fat cheese won’t necessarily harm your ticker or make your midriff more soft than solid.</p>
<p>Firstly, it appears that cheese doesn’t raise (or necessarily reduce) your risk for some of today’s biggest killers, such as heart disease. <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37328108/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">This review of research even suggests</a> that there could be an inverse relationship between cheese consumption and heart disease death. A large meta-analysis of 15 studies published in the <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27517544/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>European Journal of Nutrition</em></a> that looked at cheese’s impact on heart disease found that people eating the most (1.5 ounces per day) had a surprisingly 10% lower risk than those who didn’t eat any. One reason might be the impact it has on our cholesterol.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2475299123111000" target="_blank" rel="noopener">In a six-week randomized clinical trial it was discovered</a> that when people consumed full-fat cheddar cheese they did not experience the same rise in smaller LDL-cholesterol particles as they did when eating the same amount of fat from butter. Small, dense LDL particles are believed to be more strongly related to cardiovascular disease risk than larger particles.</p>
<p>Experts have varying theories about why cheese might be more benign than perhaps butter or a slab of fatty steak. One thought that makes sense is that it has a lot more than its saturated fat content – an ounce of cheddar has about 5 grams of saturated fat. For cheese, a nutrition matrix effect exists, where different nutrients and compounds such as sphingolipids within the food work in concert to produce a net positive (or, at the least more of a neutral) health impact and essentially cancelling out the potentially deleterious effects of saturated fat.</p>
<p>When milk is transformed into cheese, the process alters the way the nutrients and other components in it are chemically arranged. This may affect how cheese is digested and processed by the body, which can lead to varying health effects that are different from the effects of eating dairy in altered forms, such as butter. All of us should be putting more emphasis on entire foods and how their nutrients, antioxidants, and other components interact with each other.</p>
<p>Many of the studies on cheese and health use it in a non-melted form, which is different than eating cheese on pizza or in cooked dishes like lasagne. Though there is <a href="https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlehtml/2024/fo/d4fo02708f" target="_blank" rel="noopener">some initial research</a> to suggest that it might be more advantageous to eat un-melted cheese for heart health, it is not yet fully known how melting impacts the overall cheese matrix structure, and if this can alter the nutrition and health impact. This would be good to know since so much of the cheese in America is consumed in melted form as is the case with pizza.</p>
<p>Let’s not overlook that when its made it can gain some beneficial compounds, too. For instance, Vitamin K2 can form during the fermentation process and this harder to find form of the nutrient can be important for cardiovascular health. Just don’t expect much in the way of vitamin K from Velveeta.</p>
<p>Different cheeses are made with different types of bacteria, which, in large part, are responsible for the unique flavors. These same micro-critters may have beneficial effects on our microbiome, which, in turn, could lead to improved health outcomes including some relief from digestive concerns like irritable bowel disease. With this said the impact of eating cheese on the microbiome is yet to be properly studied. It’s not known if you get anywhere near the concentration of beneficial microorganisms from a slice of Gouda or blue cheese as you would from a cup of yogurt.</p>
<p>Despite being a concentrated source of calories, some studies suggest you don’t need to skip cheese to keep your six-pack well stocked. In one research paper, published in <a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/nejmoa1014296" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The <em>New England Journal of Medicine,</em> researchers set out to determine which foods were linked to weight gain</a> by following 120,877 men and women in the U.S. for two decades, examining their weight every four years. While they found that consuming more of certain foods such as refined grains (hello, white bread) and sugary drinks was associated with weight gain, eating more of others, like nuts and fruits, helped with weight loss.</p>
<p>Cheese wasn’t associated with either gain or loss, even for people who increased the amount of it they ate during the study. One reason cheese may help with weight control is that its protein and fat content may help moderate appetite. Still, there is a dearth of quality research examining the impact that it has on body composition and whether its source matters. It’s likely only problematic if it contributes to an excess of calories and is part of ultra-processed food at which point you should be questioning how wise it was to order a second helping.</p>
<p>And here is some awesome news for cheese lovers! It can help you get more buff. <a href="https://jn.nutrition.org/article/S0022-3166(22)00599-5/fulltext" target="_blank" rel="noopener">In a recent <em>Journal of Nutrition</em> study</a>, 20 healthy males took in 30 grams of protein provided as cheese or milk protein concentrate following a bout of weight training to determine if there would be any differences in the rate of post-training muscle protein synthesis. Despite there being higher peak concentrations of blood amino acids with the milk protein concentrate there was no difference in the rate of muscle-building between the cheese and milk protein powder.</p>
<p>This has been supported by other research showing that cheese protein can help with muscle-making efforts when combined with resistance training. A single ounce serving of cheese has about 6 to 8 grams of high-quality protein (most cheeses is higher in protein than saturated fat) that can certainly help you pack on more lean mass. However, you may not want to get 30 grams of protein solely from cheese after pumping iron. But it certainly can be a significant part of your post-training protein intake, maybe just not all.</p>
<p>As you might be all too aware of, lactose, a naturally present sugar in milk, can be difficult for some people to digest, leading to digestive woes like gas and bloating. However, the bacteria used to make cheese digests most of the lactose in the milk. Much of the remaining lactose is present in the whey, which is separated from the curds toward the end of the cheese-making process and drained off. This means many types of cheese have very little to no lactose and are safe to consume for sensitive tummies. In general, the higher in moisture a cheese is, the higher in lactose it is. That means harder cheese like provolone or cheddar will have less than cottage or ricotta cheese.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption "><img loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.muscleandfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Processed-cheese-slices-on-a-cutting-board.jpg?quality=86&strip=all" alt="Processed cheese slices on a cutting board" width="1109" height="614" data-fallback-img="https://i0.wp.com/www.muscleandfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Processed-cheese-slices-on-a-cutting-board.jpg?quality=86&strip=all"><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><span class="credit">Pixel-Shot</span></figcaption></figure>
<h2>Which Cheeses To Avoid</h2>
<p>Where cheese can fall off the rails is when it is part of a diet too rich in ultra-processed foods and contributes to an excess of calories, saturated fat, and sodium. Fast-food pizza, cheeseburgers, mac and cheese, and pizza pockets are not the way that we should be getting our daily nutrients. Sadly, this is exactly the way too many people are eating the stuff. So when its a fixture of a 500-calorie slice of pizza or triple-decker burger it’s no wonder it is often considered a dietary villain.</p>
<p>It’s also problematic when we consume more processed products than the real stuff. American cheese slices fall well short of actual cheddar, and Velveeta is not the way you should be dressing your broccoli. There is a good chance that these products don’t give you the same nutritional benefits of better quality cheese.</p>
<p>As for those cheese flavored products on supermarket shelves such as crackers and chips, these rarely contain any cheese and instead rely on mystery cheese flavoring. Again, not cheese.</p>
<p>For those watching their sodium intake, certain types can be pretty salty. Some versions like feta, halloumi, Parmesan, and cotija are especially salty. If your diet contains a lot of other salty foods, then adding a couple of servings of cheese can push you over the top. If you’re eating about an ounce or two a day and eat mostly lower salt whole foods, however, it’s not a big concern. But there are some individuals like those with hypertension that may need to scale back their intake of higher salt foods.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption "><img loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.muscleandfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Various-artisan-cheese-in-a-mini-shopping-cart.jpg?quality=86&strip=all" alt="Various artisan cheese in a mini-shopping cart" width="1109" height="614" data-fallback-img="https://i0.wp.com/www.muscleandfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Various-artisan-cheese-in-a-mini-shopping-cart.jpg?quality=86&strip=all"><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><span class="credit">vasyan_23</span></figcaption></figure>
<h2>How To Choose The Right Cheese For Your Diet</h2>
<p>Overall, there’s no need to steer clear of cheese—unless you are getting largely hails from ultra-processed foods at which point you need to revaluate how much you are eating and where you are getting it from. If all this (mostly) positive news has you ready to dig into a wheel of Brie with a spoon, here are some cheesy tidbits worth knowing.</p>
<h3>Watch Your Portions</h3>
<p>To keep saturated fat and calories in check, most guys should limit their daily portion of cheese to no more than 2 ounces, which is about 200 calories and 10-12 grams of saturated fat. Yes, that is some tough love. But most of us have no idea what this amount looks like, which can lead to portion distortion. A smart move is to weigh your portions for a few days so you can get a sense of how much you are serving yourself. Much of the research suggesting a neutral or beneficial effect to eating cheese involved subjects consuming roughly an average of 1.5 ounces a day. Not the mega-amount you’ll get from a slice of deep-dish.</p>
<h3>There is No One Best Choice</h3>
<p>The internet is rife with articles about the healthiest cheese you can buy. But, truth be told, any and all real cheese is fine in moderation and the nutrition content does not vary greatly among the varieties. There are a few exceptions, like cottage cheese which is much higher in protein than other varieties, but then again many of us don’t consider this to be the same as Camembert or Swiss are.</p>
<h3>Be a Softy</h3>
<p>Softer styles of cheeses such as fresh mozzarella, goat, and brie typically have fewer calories per ounce than harder types like cheddar and Parmesan. That’s because with more moisture comes less calorie density. So if you want to enjoy a daily cheese habit but also keep calorie intake more on the down low then you can gravitate toward those you can cut through with almost zero effort. After all, I’ve never met a salad that wasn’t made way better with a scattering of soft goat cheese.</p>
<h3>Swap it Out</h3>
<p>There’s a big difference between grating some Parmesan over a salad and feasting on a greasy pepperoni pizza. In some studies, the health benefits of cheese were found to be the greatest when it replaced other less beneficial foods like processed meats or refined grains. So you could swap out some of the bacon for a chunk of cheese and come out ahead. Not so by blanketing a bowl of white pasta with a bag of shredded three-cheese mix.</p>
<h3>Add it to Healthier Foods</h3>
<p>The best way to eat your cheese is to use it as a flavor enhancer for nutritious foods. Add a few chunks of feta to a veggie-rich salad, grate some aged cheddar over homemade chili, drape a slice of fresh mozzarella over a lean turkey burger, or blend ricotta into a smoothie for added protein and to make it taste extra decadent. Using cheese to make these foods more exciting to eat increases the chances you’ll eat higher amounts of healthy meals and snacks. That’s a win-win.</p>
<h3>Don’t Sack the Fat</h3>
<p>When it comes to choosing between low-fat and full-fat cheese, you need not settle for the former. Undeniably, full-fat cheese will be more satisfying, both from a taste and texture perspective, and most of the research suggesting cheese ain’t so bad for us has involved subjects eating regular cheese. Sometimes fillers are added to accommodate the lack of fat in lower fat cheese at which point you start venturing further away from what cheese should be. There is also <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0950329322001240" target="_blank" rel="noopener">evidence that people tend to eat larger portions</a> when choosing lower-fat (light) cheese, which could cancel out any calorie advantage.</p>
<p>As long as you aren’t going overboard on saturated fat intake elsewhere in your diet you will have room for the saturated fat you’ll get from a generous grating for Pecorino Romano. With this said, there is nothing wrong with opting for part-skim ricotta or mozzarella if you want to scale back your calorie and saturated fat intake. These also have a beneficial nutrition profile including protein and micronutrients like calcium.</p>
<h3>Imitation Is Not Flattery</h3>
<p>Short-cut cheese is not the way to go. On the whole, you want to focus on eating higher quality cheeses made the way it should be. You can read ingredient labels of packageg and look for products that contain questionable items like emulsifiers, cellulose, coloring, and modified corn starch, and then choose to give these a pass. Seeing “cheese product” on the food label should make you cut the cheese. Note that some American cheeses — the super melty, yellow-sliced processed variety you loved on toasted bread as a kit — is made from mostly water, so it has fewer nutrients than other cheeses. Processed cheese food slices are only required to have a minimum of 51% cheese. Why settle for less?</p>

<p>If you’ve ever wondered how to combine endurance racing with strength training in one epic fitness challenge, HYROX is the answer. This global fitness race is gaining momentum as the <a href="https://www.muscleandfitness.com/workouts/workout-tips/balance-strength-and-endurance-training-properly-max-results/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ultimate test of stamina and strength</a>, blending running with <a href="https://www.muscleandfitness.com/flexonline/training/8-compound-moves-building-functional-strength/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">functional exercises</a> like sled pushes, rowing, and burpees. Whether you’re a seasoned athlete or someone looking for a new goal to chase, HYROX workouts are designed to push you to your limits while building total-body resilience. With more people searching for HYROX vs. CrossFit comparisons and wondering what it takes to complete a HYROX race, it’s clear that this competition is making waves in the fitness world.</p>
<p>But what exactly is HYROX, and why should you train for one? In this guide, I’ll dish out everything you need to know, including how the event works, how it differs from CrossFit, what the workouts entail, and why it’s worth adding to your training calendar. Whether you’re in it to challenge yourself or simply to switch up your training, HYROX is an experience you won’t want to miss.</p>
<h2>What Is HYROX?</h2>
<p>HYROX is a global fitness race designed to test both <a href="https://www.muscleandfitness.com/workouts/workout-tips/balance-strength-and-endurance-training-properly-max-results/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">endurance and strength</a>. Unlike obstacle course races like Spartan or Tough Mudder, HYROX is a standardized indoor competition, meaning every race follows the same format—no surprises, just pure performance.</p>
<p>Each HYROX competition consists of eight 1km runs, each followed by a functional workout station. The total distance covered is 8K, but it’s not just about running—you’ll also battle through exercises like sled pushes, sled pulls, rowing, burpee broad jumps, and sandbag lunges. It’s a brutal mix of aerobic capacity, muscular endurance, and mental grit, making it one of the most complete fitness challenges available today.</p>

<h2>HYROX vs. CrossFit: What’s the Difference?</h2>
<p>At first glance, HYROX and CrossFit seem similar—both incorporate high-intensity functional movements, require a blend of strength and endurance, and attract competitive fitness enthusiasts. But when you break it down, the two are fundamentally different:</p>
<h3>Competition Structure</h3>
<p>HYROX follows a standardized race format across all events, so every competitor faces the exact same challenge. In contrast, CrossFit competitions vary widely, with workouts programmed differently at each event.</p>
<h3>Workout Style</h3>
<p>HYROX is predictable and endurance-based, featuring running and functional workout stations in every race. Conversely, CrossFit is constantly varied, incorporating Olympic lifts, gymnastics, and technical barbell movements that require skill mastery.</p>
<h3>No Barbells, No Gymnastics</h3>
<p>HYROX workouts focus on functional strength and endurance without requiring complex lifts like snatches, cleans, or overhead squats. You also won’t find muscle-ups, handstand walks, or ring dips—just raw fitness, tested through sleds, lunges, and running.</p>
<h3>Scalability</h3>
<p>HYROX offers multiple divisions (Open, Pro, Doubles, and Relay), making it accessible for different fitness levels. While CrossFit also provides scaling options, some workouts can be highly technical and skill-dependent, which can be a barrier for beginners.</p>
<p>In the words of the great Dr. Dre: “What’s the difference between me and you?”—HYROX would answer: “…that’s the difference.”</p>
<figure class="wp-caption "><img loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.muscleandfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Fit-people-running-in-an-indoor-hyrox-competition-in-hong-kong.jpg?quality=86&strip=all" alt="Fit people running in an indoor hyrox competition in hong kong" width="1109" height="614" data-fallback-img="https://i0.wp.com/www.muscleandfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Fit-people-running-in-an-indoor-hyrox-competition-in-hong-kong.jpg?quality=86&strip=all"><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><span class="credit">Liau Chung-ren/ZUMA Press Wire/Shutterstock</span></figcaption></figure>
<h2>HYROX Workout Breakdown: What to Expect in the Race</h2>
<p>A HYROX race consists of eight 1K runs, each followed by a functional workout station. Here’s the exact breakdown:</p>
<ol>
<li>1K Run → Ski Erg (1,000m)</li>
<li>1K Run → Sled Push (weighed sled, distance-based)</li>
<li>1K Run → Sled Pull (pull a weighted sled backward)</li>
<li>1K Run → Burpee Broad Jumps (crawling your way forward, one jump at a time)</li>
<li>1K Run → Rowing (1,000m on a Concept2 Rower)</li>
<li>1K Run → Farmers Carry (weighted kettlebell carry)</li>
<li>1K Run → Sandbag Lunges (weighted walking lunges)</li>
<li>1K Run → Wall Balls (reps based on category)</li>
</ol>
<p>It’s a brutal test of endurance, grit, and power. The combination of running and high-rep strength exercises forces athletes to balance pacing and efficiency—go too hard on the strength stations, and your running pace suffers. Go too fast on the runs, and you’ll burn out before the wall balls.</p>
<h2>Why You Should Train for a HYROX Competition</h2>
<p>Training for HYROX is more than just prepping for race day—it builds a well-rounded athlete. Here’s why it’s worth adding to your fitness goals:</p>
<p><strong>Improves Endurance & Strength:</strong> Unlike traditional endurance races, HYROX forces you to sustain strength output while running, making it a complete test of fitness.</p>
<p><strong>Enhances Functional Fitness:</strong> The exercises mimic real-life movement patterns, such as carrying, pushing, and lunging, which actually improves overall strength.</p>
<p><strong>Provides a Competitive Edge:</strong> If you love setting goals and pushing your limits, HYROX gives you a clear benchmark to train for and improve upon.</p>
<p><strong>Accessible to All Fitness Levels:</strong> HYROX races offer a low barrier to entry, thanks to the simplicity of its movements—yet they still pose a serious challenge. HYROX has multiple divisions to accommodate a wide range of fitness levels and is designed so that anyone can step up to the starting line and push themselves.</p>
<p>Plus, it’s a huge mental challenge. You have no option but to finish strong, which requires discipline, pacing, and mental toughness, making it one of the most rewarding fitness experiences you can take on.</p>
<h2>HYROX Competition Levels: Can Anyone Compete?</h2>
<p>The beauty of HYROX is that it’s for everyone. You don’t have to be an elite athlete to join—there are multiple divisions to choose from:</p>
<p><strong>Open</strong> – The standard category, ideal for first-timers and fitness enthusiasts.</p>
<p><strong>Pro</strong> – A step up from the open category, featuring heavier weights and increased difficulty.</p>
<p><strong>Doubles</strong> – A two-person team format where partners split the workout stations.</p>
<p><strong>Relay</strong> – A four-person team format where each teammate completes two workout stations.</p>
<p>No matter your fitness level, HYROX is designed to be accessible while pushing you to your limits. Whether you train alone or compete with a friend, the challenge remains: finish strong, push your boundaries, and embrace the grind.</p>
<h2>Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>HYROX is redefining fitness racing by blending running, functional strength, and endurance into one intense competition. Whether you’re looking to level up your training, challenge yourself in a new way, or see how you stack up against others, training for HYROX is a great way to build total-body athleticism. Could HYROX be the next “CrossFit?”, signs are pointing towards, “yes!”</p>

<p>Scotland’s knockout artist Nico Carrillo is the current WMO Welterweight Champion and Muay Thai World 65kg title holder. This Friday, he’s looking to add more gold to his collection when he clashes with Thailand’s Nabil Anane for the ONE Interim Bantamweight Muay Thai World Championship at ONE 170.</p>
<p>M&F sat down with “The King of the North” while in fight camp ahead of what is arguably the biggest bout of his career. And despite the hype, we soon found out that he’s taking the challenge seriously with 5 important training principles.</p>
<figure class="wp-caption "><img loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.muscleandfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Muay-Thai-fighter-Nico-Carrillo.jpg?quality=86&strip=all" alt="Muay Thai fighter Nico Carrillo" width="1109" height="614" data-fallback-img="https://i0.wp.com/www.muscleandfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Muay-Thai-fighter-Nico-Carrillo.jpg?quality=86&strip=all"><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><span class="credit">One Championship</span></figcaption></figure>
<h2>Nico Carrillo Started his Fight Camp Early</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.tapology.com/fightcenter/fighters/383856-nico-carrillo" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fighting out of Glasgow, Scotland</a>, 26-year-old Nico Carrillo has a dominating 27-3-1 record. But despite being undefeated in the ONE Championship promotion, he’s not resting on his laurels, and is taking the chance to become interim champion very seriously.</p>
<p>“It’s the reason that I started this journey,” says the combat star. “To be in the position I’m in now, fighting for the best title and the biggest promotion. It’s the creme de la creme. That’s the whole reason I took it so seriously.” Carrillo explains that six weeks is the standard timeframe for a fight camp. “However, for this fight camp, I started maybe 12 weeks out, so it’s by far the longest and hardest. Just because of the magnitude of the fight, leaving nothing to fate.”</p>
<figure class="wp-caption "><img loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.muscleandfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Muay-Thai-World-title-holder-Nico-Carrillo-throwing-a-kick-to-his-opponent.jpg?quality=86&strip=all" alt="Muay Thai World title holder Nico Carrillo throwing a kick to his opponent" width="1109" height="614" data-fallback-img="https://i0.wp.com/www.muscleandfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Muay-Thai-World-title-holder-Nico-Carrillo-throwing-a-kick-to-his-opponent.jpg?quality=86&strip=all"><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><span class="credit">One Championship</span></figcaption></figure>
<h2>Nico Carrillo Never Looks Past an Opponent</h2>
<p>This Interim World title clash was scheduled because Carrillo’s original opponent and world champion, Superlek Kiatmoo9 pulled out with a knee injury. This means “The King of the North” must defeat <a href="https://muaythairecords.com/fighters/nabil-anane" target="_blank" rel="noopener">20-year-old Nabil Anane (30-5-1)</a> before he can solidify the title against Superlek. The danger here is to look past his interim opponent. If he does so, he could find himself thrown out of the title picture altogether. It’s a trap that Carrillo has no intention of falling into.</p>
<p>“I’m focusing on [Superlek] later,” says Carrillo. “I’m an ‘all eggs in one basket’ kind of guy, so my full focus is on (Anane). Now, I’m getting that gold. That’s all of my focus. And when the time comes, I’m sure I’ll quickly move on to the next thing, but until (I beat Anane) that’s not going to happen.</p>
<h2>Nico Carrillo has Been Working With Taller Sparring Partners</h2>
<p>Another reason that Carrillo must focus on his next opponent is due to his sheer height. Nabil Anane is 6’4” and has a 78.7-inch reach. Carrillo is giving up 6 inches in height, so he’s bringing in taller sparring partners.</p>
<p>“I’m not going to be sparring people smaller than me,” he says, in order to replicate the mechanics of his upcoming fight. “I’m going to be punching up the way, in the fight, so for me to be punching down would be just stupid, so it is very important. You try and find people with the same body shape, same style (as your opponent) to mimic it. That is a very important part of training.”</p>

<h2>Nico Carrillo relies on hard work over talent</h2>
<p>With his immense speed and striking power, one wonders how much of Carrillo’s skill is God given, and whether he was born talented or has crafted his explosiveness in the gym. “Maybe I took to it quick. I was quite talented when I was younger, although where I am now is nothing to do with hard work,” he explains. “The punching power that I have now… I used to be a scrawny kid.”</p>
<p>Carrillo attributes his crushing blows to the time he has spent sweating it out in the gym. “Probably the most important thing for that is strength and conditioning,” he shares. “Having a coach who really knows the science behind how to get more explosive and powerful without putting too much muscle on. Honestly, that in itself is a fine art; perfecting that.” Carrillo shares that he likes to work on traditional lifts such as squats, deadlifts, and bench presses out of fight camps, but closer to bell time he works on his <a href="https://www.muscleandfitness.com/athletes-celebrities/pro-tips/bobby-holland-hanton-plyometric-workout/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">plyometric exercises</a>. These moves, such as box jumps, lunges, and jump squats work by pre-stretching the muscle and tendons in preparation for the move. The body then stores energy as it readies itself for some explosive power. As you finally explode, the muscle lengthens, and you are propelled in your chosen direction. It is for this reason that plyometrics are a crucial exercise in combat sports.</p>
<h2>Nico Carrillo sticks to the plan, no matter the sacrifice</h2>
<p>To be the best in the world, you can only focus on the goal ahead. From his early start in boxing through to his success in Muay Thai, Carrillo says that there is nothing else in his crosshairs other than the task at hand: beating Nabil Anane to become the Interim World Champion so that he can solidify the title against Superlek. “There is no balance,” says Carrillo. “Eat, sleep, train, repeat is my life. I’ve lost friends, I’ve lost family members (due to his unavailability to hang out), I don’t care. I’m so focused on this goal that I can’t have a balanced lifestyle.”</p>
<p>If the hard work, commitment, and sacrifice pays off, Nico Carrillo is successful in his biggest fight yet, the victor will get his spoils.</p>

Trying to lose weight can feel like a constant battle. The yo-yo effects of dieting can take its toll on the body, mind, and soul.

<p>Trying to lose weight can feel like a constant battle. The yo-yo effects of dieting can take its toll on the body, mind, and soul. Finding a sustainable and balanced approach to weight loss is something that most people struggle with, but Qi Gong Master Lee Holden has the answers to take all the stress out of the process—quite literally—by calming the nervous system.</p>
<p>Holden’s new book, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ready-Set-Slow-Improve-Relationships/dp/1649633262/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ready, Set, Slow: How to Improve Your Energy, Health, and Relationships Through the Power of Slow</a>, to be published in January 2025, shares the power of slowing down in life and the ripple effect this has on your physical and mental health. “The best moments in life happen when we slow down,” he says.</p>
<p>“If you have a sunset or a delicious dinner, you don’t want to speed through it because you’ll miss it altogether. Qi Gong is about slowing down and replacing busy with bliss. Slowing down can improve your health, your sleeping patterns, and digestion so it really benefits all aspects of your life.”</p>
<p>Holden is all about changing the ‘how’ of daily activities rather than the ‘what’. Concerning eating, this involves taking the time to appreciate and absorb the experience of eating a meal, rather than rushing it down in front of the TV, a common comfort practice known as ‘zombie eating.’</p>
<p>In his book, Holden shares studies that prove people feel fuller for longer when they slow down and eat with a mindful purpose. Something as simple as taking a deep breath before you start and taking a moment to smell your food can prime the body to digest more efficiently.</p>
<p>He points out that it takes 20 minutes for the brain to recognize that the stomach is full so if we eat too fast, we can frequently eat beyond the point of comfort or need because we’re not giving those satiety signals a chance to show themselves. As Holden writes in his book, “Fast eating and low chewing rates have been linked to a 35 percent increase in a person’s risk for metabolic syndrome.”</p>
<p>Eating slowly can boost your metabolism and make you eat less in a natural way instead of using deprivation as a tool. Qi Gong is a five-thousand-year-old art from ancient China, known as the ‘art of effortless power’, so harnessing its principles for eating can lead to effortless weight loss.</p>
<p>Holden brought these principles into practical use for his bespoke ‘Qi Flow’ program in the ‘Beyond the Scale’ section for Weight Watchers. Holden writes in his book, “Although the name of the organization implies that it’s all about weight loss, it’s actually more about forging a healthy, happy lifestyle.”</p>
<figure class="wp-caption "><img loading="lazy" src="https://i0.wp.com/www.muscleandfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/12.jpg?quality=86&strip=all" alt="Lee Holden" width="1109" height="614" data-fallback-img="https://i0.wp.com/www.muscleandfitness.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/12.jpg?quality=86&strip=all"><figcaption class="wp-caption-text"><span class="credit">Lee Holden</span></figcaption></figure>
<p>“During my time there, I’m delighted to report that 92 percent of the Weight Watchers members reported feeling better, more motivated, and able to make healthier choices. The program I ran using the Slow Principles turned out to be the highest-rated program that the company had ever piloted.”</p>
<p>“Our findings were that achieving food freedom and health was about much more than just counting calories. It had to do with a variety of principles like stress management, when and how we consume food, sleep, body movement, and the emotional state of the person while chewing their meals.”</p>
<p>Here are two simple exercises that Holden recommends to slow down eating habits. The following exercises have been adapted from Ready, Set, Slow: How to Improve Your Energy, Health, and Relationships Through the Power of Slow by Lee Holden (January 2025). Reprinted with permission from the publisher, Sounds True.</p>
<h3>Mealtime Mindfulness</h3>
<p>1. Sit down at the table with your meal (yes, a table, not in front of the TV!).<br />
2. Take a second to gaze lovingly at your food.<br />
3. Take a sniff . . . what aromas can you smell?<br />
4. Take a deep breath before taking your first bite.<br />
5. Notice the flavors, textures, and temperature of your food, chewing thoroughly but<br />
enjoying the experience. Is it delicious? Allow yourself to let out an “Mmmmm.”<br />
6. Put down your knife and fork (or spoon or chopsticks, whatever you’re using), and don’t<br />
be tempted to prepare your next mouthful while eating. Always put down your cutlery<br />
between bites.<br />
7. Swallow.<br />
8. Take another deep breath.<br />
9. Pick up your cutlery again and repeat until you feel full.</p>
<h3>Ear Acupressure to Cut Cravings</h3>
<p>1. Place your thumbs on the very top part of the front of the ears with your other four<br />
fingers behind the ear.<br />
2. Massage the top of the ear in slow, small circles with medium pressure.<br />
3. Take deep breaths as you do so.<br />
4. Keep massaging all the way down the ear to the lobe, the tragus (the bump in front of<br />
your ear canal), and the ear canal, continuing the small circles.<br />
5. Massage your way back up to the top of the ears.<br />
6. Repeat this process for 30 seconds to 1 minute to feel the calming effects.</p>
<p>Binge eating and comfort eating are common coping mechanisms for people to manage or avoid stress. Using Slow Principles from Lee Holden’s decades-long research into the art of Qi Gong can help break that cycle and introduce healthy eating habits that last a lifetime.</p>

<h2>Eric Janicki’s 4-Move Full Shoulder Workout</h2>

</ul>
<h2>Eric Janicki’s Full Shoulder Workout Breakdown</h2>
<p>Janicki begins his change-making session with lying cable Y-raises, hitting the front, rear, and lateral (side) delts. You will also build your traps and rhomboids too. “Anchor the cable at hip height, lie on a flat bench with shoulder blades hanging off (the bench),” explains Janicki. “Keep your arms slightly bent and raise them in a ‘Y’ shape. Stop just before your hands reach your ears to keep tension.”</p>
<p>Second is the Smith machine seated incline shoulder press. Janicki likes to go steep on the incline to target his front delts more efficiently. “Set the bench to a 75- to 85-degree incline for optimal shoulder targeting,” the coach told his more than 1.5 million Instagram followers. “Keep your wrists stacked directly under the bar for better control. Lower the bar to just below chin level, keeping your elbows slightly forward to protect your shoulders. Press up in a straight line without locking out fully to maintain tension.”</p>
<p>Third-up is another front delt taxer, as Janicki executes reps while in a supine (lying) position on the incline bench. “Lie front facing on an incline bench and grab the cables with palms facing up,” explains the man-mountain. “Keep your arms at 170 degrees and raise the handles to shoulder height, engaging your front delts. Control the movement and pause slightly at the top for peak activation. Avoid shrugging.”</p>
<p>For his finisher, Janicki blasts his front and side delts once more with reps on the incline bench, performing the dumbbell lateral raise. Want to get those perfect ‘boulder’ shoulders? This is the move for you: “Sit on an incline bench and let the dumbbells hang by your sides,” he explains. “Lead with your elbows, raising the dumbbells to shoulder height. Keep your arms slightly bent and avoid swinging or using momentum. Stop at shoulder level and lower with control to maximize lateral delt activation.”</p>
<p>For maximum gains, go heavy but don’t lose form. Aim for failure, or very close to failure, in the 8 to 12 rep range, completing 3 sets per exercise.</p>

<p>Arnold Schwarzenegger may have served as the governor of California between 2003 and 2007, but his fund-raising efforts continue to this day. In a recent update, the <a href="https://www.muscleandfitness.com/athletes-celebrities/news/arnolds-10-best-movie-roles-all-time/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">seven-time Mr. Olympia and popular action-movie star</a> provided a big boost for the LA fire relief efforts, promising a large monetary donation in addition to all of the proceeds from sales of a limited-edition”LA Strong” T-shirt.</p>
<p>Schwarzenegger, who keeps fans and fitness enthusiasts aware of his movements via the Arnold’s Pump Club email newsletter, had a worthwhile response to his subscribers in terms of what more can be done to alleviate the pressure being placed on the bodies that are tasked with managing the aftermath of the tragic Southern California wildfires that taken lives and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/January_2025_Southern_California_wildfires" target="_blank" rel="noopener">forced more than 200,000 residents to evacuate their homes</a>.</p>
<h2>Arnold Schwarzenegger Donates to the LA Fire Relief Efforts with “LA Strong” T-Shirt</h2>
<p>“Because you all wanted to show your support, I asked my team to design a shirt we could sell for the Arnold’s Pump Club team to show their support,” he said. “And I asked them that every single cent of profit be donated to the LAFD Foundation, the California Fire Foundation, and Habitat for Humanity Greater Los Angeles’ ReBUILD LA, to support people who have lost everything with immediate needs and long-term support.”</p>
<p>The <em>Commando</em> star continued; “I’m going to lead the way. I’m giving $1 million of my own money — split between those three organizations equally. Because I’m also not a fan of rich people or businesses with tons of money that ask their followers and fans to donate for them. It is not my style. This is not one of those things where I’m matching your donations or just counting your shirt profits as part of my donation. Knowing how much all of you care about lifting up the world, I won’t be surprised if you match me. But I’m giving a million no matter what. Everything you give is the cherry on top.”</p>
<p>With repair and rescue efforts stretched, the money provided by Arnold and his Pump Club members will come as a much-needed boost for those who hope to restore some normality after such a disastrous time.</p>
<h2>How to Order your LA Strong T-shirt</h2>
<p>Those looking to purchase the limited-edition “LA Strong” t-shirt can look good in the gym while feeling great about providing their own individual support. “These firefighters put their lives on the line for us,” said Schwarzenegger. “Some of these people lost absolutely everything. They need us now. Are you with me?”</p>

<p>Barbell hip thrusts are a tried and tested way to build glute strength and muscle for anyone from fitness models to elite athletes but by adding this small step you could benefit from even greater results.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.muscleandfitness.com/workouts/workout-tips/dr-andrew-locks-tips-for-better-hip-thrusters-and-stronger-glutes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Previously, <em>M&F</em> highlighted Dr Andrew Lock’s tip</a> that hip thrusts should end with a straight line at the top of the lift. Now, Coach Billy Coffey, a trainer with <a href="https://www.pinpointathlete.com.au" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pinpoint Athlete in Australia</a> has demonstrated an important step that you should consider adding to your own hip thrust sessions for explosive power and increased muscle.</p>
<p>In a recent Instagram post, Coffey details the added step that will build acceleration and even give football players the ability to “bump off defenders” with their newly found power. In the video, the lifter uses a soft box to support his upper-body while holding the barbell horizontally across his lower stomach. He then lowers to the ground until he can tap the weight plates on the floor. “Then bang,” encourages Coach Coffey, as the student takes the payload and raises it skyward with intensity. Now at the top of the lift, the game-changing step is to brace and hold the barbell. “That hold, that brace, that’s really important,” explains Coffey.</p>

<h2>Benefits of the Explosive Hip Thrust with a Hold at the Top</h2>
<p>For those who want to build glute strength and muscle, bracing at the top of the hip thrust increases the time that your muscles are under tension. While at the top of the lift, squeeze the glutes so that they are taking the load rather than it being focused on just your back. You can start with a one second pause and if doing multiple repetitions aim for around three seconds in hold. The brace position will also force the body to <a href="https://uppper.com/blogs/news/8-tips-to-nail-your-barbell-hip-thrusts-form-and-maximize-results?srsltid=AfmBOopu1PhvNpf1u-KljKDoDPTaNL7cfGacHXewz4T1aQYxM6-zdIWh" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recruit surrounding muscles</a> as you work on form and maintain balance.</p>
<p>For optimal glute gains, perform this exercise two to three times per week and aim for 3 sets of eight to 12 reps. Just be sure to pick a weight that is comfortable and work on your form before stacking on the plates to avoid injury. When driving the barbell upwards, push through the ground with your heels and lift with a fast, explosive movement before the hold at the top. “Explosive glutes mixed with an isometric brace is a high-quality technique,” says Coffey. Try it for yourself.</p>

Making sure that you don’t overdo your caloric intake is simple math, but sticking to the plan is a real challenge.

Feelings of hunger are not easy to ignore, but what is the difference between genuine hunger and cravings? Nutritionist Alan Aragon has the answer and shares three ways to win your long-term weight management goals.</p>
<p>If you’ve tracked your caloric intake all day and know that you are on a deficit or hitting your maintenance number, then a pang in your stomach for a slice of pizza at 9.30 p.m. is the last thing you need, but what about your muscle gains? If your body is telling you to consume food then ignoring that feeling will lead to muscle loss, right?</p>
<p>Wrong, says Aragon, who has a Master’s degree in Human Nutrition and is one of the most trusted evidence based fitness experts on the internet. <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DDhiuKSxt96/?hl=en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Aragon took to Instagram recently</a> to differentiate hunger versus cravings and explains that cravings are rarely about feeding the muscle but much more often about appeasing the mind.</p>

<h2>The Difference Between Food Hunger and Cravings</h2>
<p>“Food hunger and cravings are not the same thing,” he shares. “Hunger can influence the intensity of food craving, but food craving is very food specific. So, hunger can be satisfied by eating pretty much any food just filling the stomach. Craving, on the other hand, can typically only be satisfied with certain food or a certain type of food. Whether it’s a sweet type of dessert food or some sort of savory, greasy, crunchy snack.” The take home message here is that hunger can be satisfied with any food including healthy ingredients, while cravings typically involve trying to tempt you to the dark side and eat those stodgy, salty, and energy dense foods.</p>
<p>“So, contrary to popular belief, cravings rarely happen because of some sort of nutritional deficiency,” says Aragon, and this means that giving in to cravings will rarely help your fitness or weight loss goals. But if cravings threaten to derail our health, why do we get them?</p>
<p>“Food cravings are the result of conditioned responses to environment what reinforce the positive emotions and positive psychological state that you associate with a given food,” explains Aragon. “Like watching your favorite television show and what you happen to be mindlessly eating.” Aragon says that cravings likely won’t stop due to self-deprivation however, and that totally abstaining from the snacks that make you feel good could have a rebound effect later down the line. “So that kind of goes against the narrative that we should avoid foods,” he suggests. “Because that will only increase (your) cravings.”</p>
<p>Aragon says that the reason people often regain weight after a period of being lighter is due to losing their ongoing battle with cravings. Okay, so if food cravings are a fact of life, how can we build a better relationship with them?</p>
<h2>How To Manage Your Food Cravings</h2>
<p>“Instead of thinking how to completely overcome of stamp out cravings, I would rather think of it in terms of how to best manage the reality of food cravings,” concludes Nutritionist Alan Aragon. Here are three sensible steps to manage your cravings for a healthier diet.</p>
<h3>Design a diet that satisfies your appetite</h3>
<p>“First of all, design your diet so that it is a high satiety diet,” advises Aragon. Aim for meals containing high protein and fiber content as these will make you feel fuller for longer. Aragon says you should be aiming for whole-foods or minimally refined meals as these will have a greater tendency to satisfy your appetite.</p>
<h3>Make swaps for success</h3>
<p>Aragon encourages you to take a hard look at the foods that you typically crave, and see what you can swap them out with, for example dates are sweet and make for a great substitution for sugary treats. Or perhaps you could stick with the same foods that you crave but search the aisle for lower calorie options instead.</p>
<h3>Reduce the snacks, reduce the rebound</h3>
<p>As Aragon explains, eliminating your favorite snacks in the short-term could cause you to rebel and rack up the weight in the longer-term. Fortunately, you don’t have to completely avoid the foods that you crave. “It’s not a big deal, just don’t over do it,” says Aragon. “Just don’t have it with a high frequency throughout the week or through the month.”</p>

It’s an excellent regression of the traditional deadlift and a <a href="https://www.muscleandfitness.com/workouts/full-body-exercises/top-5-deadlift-accessory-exercises-for-a-stronger-pull/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fantastic accessory exercise for improving deadlift performance</a>. But when taking one foot off the ground and placing it against a wall the things become interesting with the single-leg wall RDL.</p>
<p>The single-leg RDL is the gold standard for enhancing single-leg strength. Its biggest benefit is also its biggest drawback. It improves balance and unilateral strength, but not everyone can do it without losing their balance.</p>
<p>It’s an exercise that can quickly humble you, and that’s where the wall comes in. Adding stability removes the balance factor while building strength and technique for the regular variation. Enter the Wall RDL, brought to you by <a href="https://www.instagram.com/thefitnessmaverick/">Gareth Sapstead, MSc CSCS</a>, a renowned coach who has used this exercise to build world-champion and Olympian physique athletes.</p>
<h2>Benefits of the Single-Leg Wall RDL</h2>
<p>Sapstead acknowledges the single-leg Romanian deadlift a difficult exercise, but also says it has many benefits.</p>
<p>“The single-leg Wall RDL will improve muscle symmetry and unilateral strength in the glutes and hamstrings, which is crucial whether being on stage, reducing the risk of hamstring strains because of improvements in eccentric hamstring strength, or improving performance with the regular deadlift,” explains Sapstead</p>
<p>One exercise unlocks many benefits, but if balance is an issue, Sapstead has a fix.</p>
<p></p>
<h2>How To Do The Single Leg Wall RDL</h2>
<p>Sapstead provides step-by-step instructions for doing it right and options for loading based on your goals and fitness level.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Starting Position:</strong> Stand with your feet about hip-width apart, facing away from the wall. Place one foot against the wall behind you at about knee height.</li>
<li><strong>Tilt Forward:</strong> Keep your planted leg slightly bent as you hinge at your hip, lowering your torso toward the floor. Engage your core and maintain a neutral spine throughout the movement.</li>
<li><strong>Load the Standing Leg:</strong> Focus on the standing leg as you lower. Press your foot into the wall, which will help you maintain balance and keep your hips aligned</li>
<li><strong>Return to Start:</strong> Drive through the heel of your standing leg to return to the starting position. Make sure to engage your glutes at lockout.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Single-Leg Wall RDL Techniques</h2>
<p>Here, Sapstead explains how introducing the wall to the single-leg RDL provides a unique stability aspect.</p>
<p>“By pressing the opposite foot against the wall, you create a stable base that allows for better hip alignment and a more focused loading of your working leg. When you push your foot against the wall, you can experiment with two ways to use the back foot to change the focus of this exercise.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Hover Technique:</strong> This approach allows your back foot to rest lightly against the wall, creating less stability. While this requires better balance and core strength, it may limit the weight you can use, making it ideal for those new to RDLs or looking to focus on balance.</li>
<li><strong>Press Technique:</strong> A common cue I provide during training is to press the foot into the wall. This action offers greater stability and encourages deeper engagement of the glutes, maximizing the exercise’s effectiveness,” says Sapstead.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Dumbbell Loading Options</h2>
<p><strong>Ipsilateral Loading:</strong> Hold the dumbbell in the same hand as the working leg. This setup creates a natural counterbalance and is excellent for beginners who want to hone their form.</p>
<p><strong>Contralateral Loading:</strong> Holding the dumbbell in the opposite hand to the working leg can increase the demand on your stabilizing muscles, providing a greater challenge to your balance and strength.</p>
<p><strong>Bilateral Loading:</strong> Using dumbbells in both hands distributes the load more evenly, making it suitable for those looking to lift heavier.</p>
<h2>Sets and Reps Suggestions</h2>
<p>Sapstead suggests that two to three sets of 8-15 reps for each leg is a great starting point. When performing eight reps or less, focus on lowering, using a 3-4 seconds eccentric phase.</p>

All purchases from this Website are made pursuant to a shipment contract. As a result, risk of loss and title for items purchased from the Website pass to you upon delivery of the items to the carrier. You are responsible for filing any claims with carriers for damaged and/or lost shipments.
We attempt to ensure that information on the Website is complete, accurate and current. Despite our efforts, the information on the Website may occasionally be inaccurate, incomplete, or out of date.

We make every effort to ensure the accuracy of the price on our web site. When errors are discovered, we will correct them. Be advised that we reserve the right to revoke any stated offer and to correct any errors, inaccuracies, or omissions, including after an order has been submitted, after it has been confirmed, or after your credit card has been charged.

You will be notified via email if your order has been canceled and be given the opportunity to place the order at the correct price. Please note that individual bank policies vary when the amount is credited back to your account. Prices and availability are subject to change without prior notice.
While it is our practice to confirm orders by email, the receipt of an email order confirmation does not constitute our acceptance of an order or our confirmation of an offer to sell a product or service. We reserve the right, without prior notice, to limit the order quantity on any product or service and/or to refuse service to any customer. We also may require verification of information prior to the acceptance and/or shipment of any order.

Privacy Policy
Last Revised: January 10, 2023
The following Privacy Policy describes the collection, disclosure, use of, and rights regarding any Personal Information (“Personal Information”) obtained by J. Wood Ventures LLC, Wings of Strength LLC, Wings of Strength Productions LLC, Digital Muscle LLC, Olympia Productions LLC, JW Media LLC, Mr Olympia LLC, JW Holdings LLC, Jake Wood, and any publications associated with those entities (collectively, the “Company” and/or “we”, “us”, “our”) when you interact with our websites, mobile applications, or other digital services (collectively, the “Services”).
Collection of Information
When you use the Services, we collect various categories of Personal Information, which will generally fall into two categories: information that you provide to us directly, and information that we collect automatically.
Information You Provide Directly
Basic Information.
When you use the Services, we will collect information that you provide to us, for example, through our websites, mobile apps, and/or any agreements you’ve entered into with respect to the Services. This information may include, for example, your first name, last name, residence address, phone number, e-mail address. We may also collect billing information, such as credit card numbers and related information necessary to complete online and/or in-app transactions.
External Sources
. We may receive Personal Information from publicly available databases, joint marketing partners and event sponsors, entities to which we provide client services, such as your employer, and social media platforms.
Information We Collect Automatically
Cookies
. We employ cookies on the website. A cookie is a small, encoded text file sent between a web server and web browser when you visit the website. That file is stored on the hard drive of the device used to access the internet, and will be accessed when you revisit the website that created the cookie file. Your web browser uses the information stored in the cookie to make navigating the website easier, such as automatic login and other functions and preferences. Cookies come in many flavors. Functional cookies ensure that certain parts of the website work properly. By placing functional cookies, we make it easier for you to visit our website and use the Services. We may place these cookies without your consent. Analytical cookies are used to optimize the website experience for our users. Through the use of analytical cookies, we receive insight into the usage of our website. We ask your permission to place analytical cookies to ensure our website offers a continued positive user experience.
Other Technologies
. We may use clear GIFs, pixel tags, and other such cookie-like technologies to track the activities of users of our website and to compile statistics about the use of our website and/or e-mail response rates. We may collect information about your computer, mobile device, browser and operating system (e.g., type, model, or version), or internet protocol (IP) address (which may be used to derive your general geographic area).
Log files
. Our servers may automatically record information related to your use of our website, which may include information such as your IP address, browser type, operating system, mobile device type, diagnostic information, referring web page, and other web pages visited.
Use of Information
We use the Personal Information detailed above for a variety of purposes, including providing our services to you, managing customer relationships, responding to your inquiries, enforcing our terms of use, personalizing your experience on the website, providing information regarding careers with us, and engaging in marketing activities, such as providing newsletters, publications, updates, and other information that we believe might be of interest to you.
The Personal Information may also be used to send you alerts or other communications via SMS messages or other media or networks, notify you about new features of the Services, special events, or products, services, and special offers, administer sweepstakes and contests, attribute content to you that you make available through the Services (such as comments you post), personalize the content and advertising that you see on the Services and to understand how users interact with and use our advertisements and Services.
With respect to marketing activities, certain information that you provide to us, such as your first name, last name, company name, e-mail address, physical address, and phone number may be aggregated with other such data in one or more contact lists. We may then use these contact lists to send you information regarding our services via an automated mailing system and/or to send you surveys via an automated survey generation system. These contact lists may be integrated into our client relation management (CRM) system and/or our internal e-mail contact lists).
Sharing of Information
We do not sell, exchange, transfer, or give your Personal Information to any other company or individual except as follows:
We may share, on a limited basis, Personal Information with our service providers, suppliers, subcontractors, and similar third parties so that they can assist us in the maintenance of our website and other services. We may also share Personal Information with financial institutions in connection with invoicing and payments.
We may rent, sell, or share your Personal Information with non-affiliated third parties: (a) in order to provide services or products that we believe may be of interest to you; (b) when we have your permission; or (c) as described in this Privacy Policy.
We may share your information with our agents or companies in order to provide the Services or advertising or to communicate with you on our behalf.
When you sign up to participate in a contest or sweepstakes, your information may also be provided to our sweepstakes or contest advertisers, operators, and/or sponsors and the use of that information will be also governed by the privacy policies or practices of those advertisers, operators, and/or sponsors.
We may disclose your Personal Information to comply with any court order, law or legal process, including to respond to any government or regulatory request; to enforce or apply our terms of use and other agreements, including for billing and collection purposes; if we believe disclosure is necessary or appropriate to protect the rights, property, or safety of ourselves, our clients, or others.
We may aggregate and/or de-identify your information so that the information no longer relates to you individually. Our use and disclosure of such aggregated or de-identified information is not subject to this Privacy Policy, and may be disclosed to others without limitation and for any purpose.
Access to Information
You may access and update your Personal Information that we hold by sending a request to the e-mail address listed below under Contact Us.
You may unsubscribe from our marketing or promotional emails by clicking the “Unsubscribe” link in our emails or, for certain Services, by logging into your account and adjusting your preferences.
Third Party websites and Links
We may provide links to third-party websites, services, plug-ins, content, and applications that are not operated by us. This Privacy Policy does not apply to such services, and we cannot take responsibility for the privacy policies, content, or practices of those services and websites.
Some of the services and advertisements are delivered or served by third-party companies. These companies place or recognize cookies, pixel tags, web beacons or other technology to track certain information about our Services website users. In many cases, this information could be used to show you ads on other websites based on your interests. We do not have access to, nor control over, these third parties’ use of cookies or other tracking technologies or how they may be used.
Data Retention
We store the information we collect about you for as long as is necessary for the purposes for which we collected it, and in accordance with our legal obligations and legitimate business interests.
Sensitive Information
We ask that you not send us, and you not disclose, any sensitive Personal Information (e.g., social security numbers, information related to racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religion or other beliefs, health, biometrics, or genetic characteristics, criminal background or trade union membership) when using the Services.
Residents of the European Economic Area
If you are located in the European Economic Area (“EEA”), you may have certain additional rights and protections under the EU General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) regarding the processing of your personal data. In this regard, we may ask you to identify which country you are located in when you use or access the Services, or we may rely on your IP address to make this determination. If any terms in this section conflict with other terms of this Privacy Policy, the terms in this section shall apply to individuals located in the EEA when the Personal Information is collected or processed.
For example, you may have the following rights: i) the right to be informed of how your Personal Information is being used, ii) the right to access to your Personal Information, iii) the right to rectification of data discrepancies, iv) the right to be forgotten, v) the right to restrict processing of your data, vi) the right to data portability, vii) the right to object to processing, and vii) the right to avoid automated profiling.
In the sections above, we describe the categories of Personal Information collected and explain various ways that we process your Personal Information. Generally, we will process your Personal Information only (1) with your consent; (2) to perform in accordance with a contract between you and us; (3) to comply with a legal obligation; or (4) where we have a legitimate interest to do so, balancing this interest against your interests and fundamental rights.
If you are in the EEA and you would like to contact us regarding these or other possible rights under the GDPR, please use the e-mail address listed below under Contact Us. You may also have the right to lodge a complaint with the local data protection authority if you believe that we have not complied with applicable data protection laws. See
http://ec.europa.eu/justice/article-29/structure/data-protection-authorities/index_en.htm
.
Children’s Privacy
Our Services are not directed to children under the age of 16. We do not knowingly collect Personal Information from children under the age of 16. If we receive Personal Information that we discover was provided by a child under the age of 16, we will promptly destroy such information. If you would like to learn more about the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), please visit the Federal Trade Commission home page at
http://www.ftc.gov
.
California Residents
“Shine the Light” Law
. If you are a California resident who has provided us with your Personal Information during the creation of or during the course of establishing a legal services relationship that is primarily for personal, family, or household purposes, you may, once per calendar year, request information regarding our disclosure of certain categories of your Personal Information. Specifically, pursuant to California Civil Code 1798.83 (the “Shine the Light” law), we will provide you a list of the categories of Personal Information disclosed to third parties for their direct marketing purposes during the immediately preceding calendar year, along with the names and addresses of these third parties. You must submit your request to us either by the e-mail address listed under the Contact Us section below, or by mail at 2025 S Airport Blvd, Chandler, Arizona, 85286, USA.
California Consumer Protection Act (CCPA)
. The California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018 (CCPA), California Civil Code 1798.100-199, is directed at providing California consumers more control over the Personal Information that businesses collect about them. While we do not believe we are subject to the CCPA under 1798.140(c), we are committed to safeguarding the Personal Information of visitors to our website, as detailed above.
If you would like to learn more about the CCPA, please visit the California Office of the Attorney General site at
https://oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa
.
Do-not-track Signals
We do not guarantee that our Services will respond to do-not-track signals. For more information about do-not-track signals, please see
https://allaboutdnt.com/
. You may, however, disable certain tracking as set forth in our Cookie Policy.
Security
We employ measures that are appropriate to protect your Personal Information against unauthorized access, improper use or disclosure, unauthorized or unlawful destruction or accidental loss, and all of our employees and any third parties that process your Personal Information on our behalf are obligated to respect the confidentiality of your information. However, we cannot and do not provide any assurance that these measures will be sufficient to protect the information you choose to transmit to our site.
Personal Information we collect may be transferred to, and stored and processed in, the United States or any other country in which we or our affiliates or processors maintain facilities. We have put in place reasonable safeguards to ensure the protection of any Personal Information transferred from the EEA to the United States and other countries. By using the Services, you consent to your information being transferred to our facilities and to the facilities of those third parties with whom we share it as described in this Privacy Policy.
Revisions to our Privacy Policy
We reserve the right to revise this Privacy Policy or any part of it from time to time. Please review this Privacy Policy periodically for changes. If we make material changes, we will endeavor to provide notice ahead of such changes, such as by email or through a notice at the website.

General
The term “cookies” refers to a small text file sent to us by your computing device (e.g., desktop computer, laptop, tablet, or smart phone) each time you visit a site associated with our Services. There are two general categories of cookies: session-based cookies that last only while your browser is open and are automatically deleted when you close your browser; and persistent cookies, which last until you or your browser delete them or until they expire. Many browsers default to accepting cookies, but you can generally change those settings, as described below in the Opting Out section.
Types of Cookies
We may use a variety of cookies in connection with providing you the Services.
Essential cookies

Functionality cookies
allow the Services to remember preferences you have selected, such as login details and other selections you may have made during previous browser sessions. These are designed to make it easier for you to use our site without setting your preferences each time you visit.

Based on your browsing history and with our permission, we may use third-party advertising partners who can then display to you a relevant ad when you are on a third-party site such as a social media platform.
