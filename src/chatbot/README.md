# Chatbot Application Setup and Usage Guide

### 1. **Frontend (Streamlit)**

- **File:** `chat_client.py`
- Users enter a username and chat with the fitness assistant.
- Sessions are stored and resumed based on username.
- Chat history is retrieved from the backend via REST.

### 2. **Backend (FastAPI + LangGraph)**

- **File:** `main.py`
- REST endpoints for:
  - Creating users
  - Creating and fetching chat sessions
  - Posting and retrieving messages
- Uses:
  - **PostgreSQL** (via SQLAlchemy): permanent session/message storage
  - **Redis**: fast chat history caching
  - **LangGraph**: structured agent logic with memory and checkpointer
  - **OpenAI GPT**: generates AI responses

### 3. **Agent System**

- **Folder:** `agent/`
- Prompts and graph logic to drive the AI‚Äôs memory, summarization, and recommendation behavior.

### 4. **Data & Logging**

- **ELK Stack Integration** via `elk_logging.py`
- Fitness exercises (e.g. from Hevy) are stored in `hevy_exercises.json`
- Additional logs and experiments tracked in `experiments.ipynb`
