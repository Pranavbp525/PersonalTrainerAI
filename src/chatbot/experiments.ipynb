So, these three studies weve just overviewed indicate between 3045 weekly sets for a muscle group are beneficial for muscle hypertrophy.

      "**Research Report: Effective Training Frequency and Volume for Natural Lifters Aiming for Hypertrophy with 3-4 Gym Sessions per Week**\n",
      "\n",
      "**Introduction**\n",
      "\n",
      "This report explores the optimal training frequency and volume for natural lifters aiming for muscle hypertrophy within a time-limited schedule of 3-4 gym sessions per week. The focus is on intermediate lifters using standard gym equipment, with an emphasis on effective exercise selection, progression management, and the role of nutrition timing in optimizing recovery and muscle growth.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Training Frequency and Volume**\n",
      "\n",
      "Recent studies indicate that no specific training frequency per week is superior for muscle hypertrophy, allowing for flexibility in scheduling. For intermediate lifters, evidence suggests that performing between 30-45 weekly sets per muscle group is beneficial for hypertrophy. This range accommodates individual response and time constraints, aligning with the user's goal of 3-4 sessions per week.\n",
      "\n",
      "The recommended approach is to distribute these 30-45 weekly sets per muscle group over two to three days each week. This typically involves performing 15-16 sets for a muscle group per session, fitting well within a 3-4 session weekly schedule. This distribution also allows for longer rest intervals, which have been associated with optimal muscle growth.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Exercise Selection**\n",
      "\n",
      "For effective muscle hypertrophy using standard gym equipment, compound exercises such as back squats and conventional deadlifts are highly recommended. These exercises engage multiple muscle groups and promote overall hypertrophy. A recent meta-analysis supports the inclusion of both free weights and machine exercises, indicating that both are comparably effective for hypertrophy. While the findings highlight back squats and deadlifts, a broader range of compound exercises, such as bench press, overhead press, bent-over rows, and pull-ups, could also be beneficial. However, specific guidance on integrating these exercises into a 3-4 session weekly workout plan was not fully explored.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Progression Management**\n",
      "\n",
      "Managing progression in a time-limited training schedule is crucial for continuous muscle growth. While the findings provide a foundation for understanding weekly set distribution and exercise selection, they do not fully address specific strategies for progression management. Detailed strategies on progressively overloading within the constraints of a time-limited schedule, such as adjusting intensity, volume, or exercise selection over time, were not covered. Insights into periodization techniques, progression models, and how to incorporate deload weeks or adjust training variables over time are areas for further exploration.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Nutrition Timing**\n",
      "\n",
      "The role of nutrition timing in optimizing recovery and muscle protein synthesis for natural lifters was not directly addressed in the findings. However, it is generally understood that proper nutrition timing can enhance recovery and support muscle growth, particularly when aligned with training sessions.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Conclusion**\n",
      "\n",
      "The findings provide a comprehensive overview of effective training frequency and volume for natural lifters aiming for hypertrophy within a 3-4 session weekly schedule. The recommendation to distribute 30-45 weekly sets per muscle group over two to three days is well-supported. While the report identifies key compound exercises, further exploration of a broader range of exercises and detailed progression strategies would enhance the understanding of optimizing hypertrophy in a time-limited schedule. Future research could also delve into the role of nutrition timing in supporting muscle growth and recovery.\n",

    "**User Profile:**\n",
    "{{user_profile}}\n",
    "\n",
    "**Research Findings:**\n",
    "{{research_findings}}\n",
    "\n",
    "**Instructions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Design the Routine:** Create a structured workout plan including specific exercises, the number of sets for each, the target repetitions (reps) per set, and rest periods (in seconds) between exercises. Specify set types (e.g., 'warmup', 'normal', 'dropset') where appropriate (default is 'normal').\n",
    "2.  **Use Exact Exercise Names:** You **MUST** use the precise, official 'title' for each exercise as found in the Hevy application's standard exercise library. For example, use \"Bench Press (Barbell)\", \"Lat Pulldown (Cable)\", \"Squat (Barbell)\", etc. Do NOT invent exercises or use variations unless you are certain they exist with that exact name in Hevy.\n",
    "3.  **Specify Supersets:** If exercises should be performed as a superset, assign them the same `superset_group` identifier (e.g., \"A\", \"B\", or 1, 2). Exercises not in a superset should have no `superset_group`.\n",
    "4.  **Weight Guidance:** Provide guidance on weight selection if possible (e.g., target RPE, %1RM, or a starting weight recommendation based on profile). If specific weights are required, provide `weight_kg`.\n",
    "5.  **Output Format:** Structure your response as a JSON object containing the following keys:\n",
    "    *   `title`: A descriptive title for the workout routine.\n",
    "    *   `notes`: General notes or instructions for the routine.\n",
    "    *   `exercises`: A list of exercise objects, where each object has:\n",
    "        *   `exercise_name`: The exact Hevy exercise title (string).\n",
    "        *   `sets`: A list of set objects, each with `type` (string, default 'normal'), `reps` (integer), and optionally `weight_kg` (float).\n",
    "        *   `rest_seconds`: Rest time in seconds after this exercise (integer).\n",
    "        *   `notes`: Specific notes for the exercise (string).\n",

    "\n",
    "Advantages of this Approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "Clear Separation of Concerns: The LLM planner focuses on high-level planning, while deterministic code handles the precise data lookup and formatting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Robustness: Less prone to LLM hallucinations regarding IDs. Errors in exercise naming are caught before calling the API.\n",
    "\n",
    "Maintainability: Easier to update the exercise list (just update the DB/JSON) without changing the planner prompt significantly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Flexibility: The conceptual plan can be used for other purposes besides just Hevy export (e.g., displaying in a UI).\n",
    "\n",
    "This structured approach directly addresses the blocker you encountered and aligns the planning agent's capabilities with the requirements of the Hevy API tool. Remember to implement proper error handling, especially for cases where exercise names from the planner don't match your database."
