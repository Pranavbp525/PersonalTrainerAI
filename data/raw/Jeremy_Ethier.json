    "title": "What Happens To Your Body After Taking Creatine For 30 Days?",
    "published_at": "2022-04-24T15:45:44Z",
    "transcript": "creatine has been consistently proven to make you look bigger build muscle faster improve your performance and even make you smarter in fact over 50 percent of professional power athletes such as power lifters boxers and track and field athletes are reportedly using creatine for these reasons not to mention its rising popularity amongst high school lifters and athletes as well but what exactly does creatine do to your body and where does it go what should you expect to feel and how soon is it safe and are there any side effects you should know about how do you know if it's working or not today we'll cover all that by doing a deep dive into what to expect throughout your first 30 days of taking creatine now before you even start taking creatine it's important to understand what it does to the body and why it doesn't necessarily work for everyone so creatine is a substance that we naturally produce and use up as an indirect energy source to power our muscles through high intensity activities such as sprints or tough set of bench press for this reason we store most of our creatine in our muscles but about five percent of creatine is actually stored in the brain and as we'll discuss later on is why it's been heavily linked to both improvements and impairments in brain function now although we have a baseline level of creatine in our muscles supplementing with it can actually increase our baseline levels by about 30 percent as a result our muscles have more creatine to power them with leading to more strength and muscle mass over time but not everyone will experience the same increase in creatine levels approximately 20 to 30 percent of individuals naturally walk around with just about fully saturated muscle creatine levels as a result they experience little to no benefit from creatine supplementation other individuals especially vegetarians since creatine is found in small amounts in meat have naturally lower levels of creatine and will experience a greater benefit from supplementation so odds are you will experience some benefit from taking it but even if you don't that's not a bad thing it just means that the gods have blessed you with top tier genetics now as for what to expect in terms of what the feel side effects and how to tell if it's actually working let's dive into our 30 day timeline so when you first start taking creatine it takes time for your muscles to become fully saturated with that additional creatine although you will experience a few side effects throughout this period you won't experience the performance benefits until full saturation which we'll talk about later as for how long the saturation process takes it depends on how much creatine you take every day as i've discussed in a past creatine video which i'll link at the end of this one there's two ways you can start taking creatine you can do what's known as a loading phase where you take quite a bit of creatine every day to increase your stores as fast as possible and then decrease the dose to maintain the elevated levels using this method it'll take about seven days to fully saturate your muscles and is when you can start experiencing some of its benefits the other method is to just take a baseline dose of creatine every day to slowly increase your creatine levels over time often taken about two to three weeks to reach full saturation both methods that get you to the same end destination but will differ in some of the side effects you may experience for example one of the side effects most people experience during the saturation phase is water retention and a small spike in their body weight this is because when creatine is taken into a muscle cell it also draws water into that cell although this may sound like a bad thing it can actually make your muscles look and feel a lot fuller now as for how much initial weight gain to expect research suggests anywhere from one to three pounds but if you choose a loading phase you'll see this initial weight spike during the first seven days of using creatine whereas if you use the non-loading phase your weight will instead gradually increase over a period of two to three weeks until your muscles are fully saturated another often reported side effect throughout the saturation phase is stomach discomfort if you experience this or you want to avoid experiencing it in the first place there's a few things you can do first off research has shown that stomach discomfort is more likely to occur when larger amounts of creatine are taken all at once such as with a loading phase so if you're using a loading protocol splitting up your creatine into multiple smaller doses throughout the day may help if it doesn't you may just want to stick with the non-loaded protocol in addition to this you want to avoid taking creatine on an empty stomach or with caffeine as both of those scenarios seem to increase the likelihood of an upset stomach lastly sometimes discomfort is due to creatine being poorly dissolved by the body to mitigate this when you take your creatine you can try mixing it with hot water to get it fully dissolved and see if that helps by the way guys before we dive into the last side effect i'm curious for those of you who have taken creatine what side effects have you experienced this next one it personally really took me by surprise but leave a comment below as i'm curious if there's anything i missed alright so the last side effect you and your doctor should know about has to do with your creatinine levels nope not creatine creatinine creatinine is a breakdown product of creatine since you're taking more creatine your creatinine levels will also slightly increase and since high creatinine levels can indicate impaired kidney function this can be alarming to see on a blood test if you're not aware of it however creatine has been consistently proven to be a safe supplement for healthy individuals and your health professional should be aware of its effect on creatinine but as with any blood test results please consult with your health professional and follow their guidance alright so our muscles are now locked and loaded with creatine what happens now are you gonna turn into the hulk overnight let's see what the science has to say first off your strengths should start increasing across most of your movements a meta-analysis reviewing 22 creatine studies found that on average train lifters can expect roughly an eight percent boost in strength and 14 boost in number of reps performed less experienced lifters however seem to reap even larger benefits with one study showing an average performance increase of 30 percent in untrained individuals this could mean going from benching 100 pounds to 130 pounds as a result of creatine that said even just a slight increase in your strength or reps performed is a very solid return as far as supplements go and can lead to significantly greater muscle mass over time in addition to just improving performance however a study that surveyed 52 ncaa athletes found that 81 percent of them reported faster recovery from their training as one of the benefits they noticed after taking creatine so after you reach saturation pay attention to how fast you recover between your workouts as you may notice an improvement and lastly a relatively new yet exciting area of creatine research has to do with its benefits on brain function believe it or not your brain is one of the most metabolically active tissues in the body it is in constant need of energy and seems to rely heavily on creatine for that energy in fact when children are born with creatine deficiency in the brain severe effects on cognitive function and development are often observed when healthy individuals creatine supplementation can actually further increase brain creatine levels by up to 10 percent which seems to have positive effects on how well the brain functions illustrating this is a recent systematic review that found creatine supplementation to consistently improve performance on short-term memory and tests of intelligence with the benefits becoming even more apparent under stress states such as sleep deprivation and as we could have predicted based on what we talked about earlier the subjects of these studies that experience the most benefit or vegans of vegetarians so just be aware of this potential benefit and see if you notice any difference after you reach peak saturation so that should give you a very good idea as to what to expect once you start taking creatine if you'd like to learn more about the finer details of how exactly to take it to maximize its benefits what type of creatine you should be using and how much of it i'll leave a link to a recent video i did that covers all of that in the description box down below and also at the end of the video that said guys creatine or any supplement for that matter it's just icing on the cake if you want to truly transform your body and see incredible results then you need to prioritize your training and your nutrition and if you need help in these areas and are looking for a simple yet highly effective science-based program you can trust that shows you exactly how to train and how to eat to transform your body as efficiently as possible and simply head on over to

    "title": "How To Lose MORE Fat And KEEP/BUILD Muscle (3 WORST Dieting Mistakes You Need To Avoid)",
    "published_at": "2019-10-27T16:18:15Z",
    "transcript": "what's going on everyone Jeremy here and today we're gonna cover dieting more specifically it will cover the wrong ways in which people approach and go about implementing the diet that in turn not only limits the amount of fat that you lose but also compromises your ability to retain or even build muscle throughout the process which is detrimental because by the end of your dieting period you don't just want to end up skinnier or skinny fat for example you want to instead strip off a significant amount of fat while maintaining or building as much muscle as possible in the process in order to achieve a lean well-defined physique and in this video that's exactly what I'll show you how to do so the first mistake people make is actually losing weight too aggressively because when it comes to maximizing fat loss while increasing the odds of you keeping and even building muscle throughout the process you need to supply your body with enough energy and nutrients to do so which can only be achieved by actually slowing down the rate at which you lose weight you're in your diet and I've not only noticed this myself when dieting but I've also seen this multiple times in the literature as well so for example a well-known 2011 paper illustrates is perfectly by comparing the effects of a fast diet versus a slow diet on body composition and strength so they had two groups to train subjects who were all put on a calorie deficit to lose weight but with the fast diet group being put on a more aggressive deficit than a slow group so when a daily basis the fast group was even roughly 300 calories less in the slow group they then analyzed the effect it had on their muscle and fat levels after each group lost the same amount of total weight which keep of mine took the slow group 60 days to do so and the fast group only poured it is to do what's interesting is that despite reaching the weight loss marked faster the fast group actually lost significantly less fat than a slow group and they also lost a little bit of muscle mass as well whereas the slow group was actually able to gain a little bit of muscle gain significantly more strength and lost a greater amount of fat as well and other papers have found similar results with the general suggestion being made that while more aggressive diets may yield faster weight loss the percentage of weight loss coming from muscle instead of tends to increase as well so what I'd suggest is instead taking a slower approach that you can preserve or even build muscle as you burn off your fat and a good general recommendation is to aim to lose around 0.5 to 1 percent of your body weight per week but this does depend on your current level of body fat so for example if your body fat is relatively high I'd stick to the higher end of this range since you're actually able to lose more fat for a week without losing muscle whereas the opposite is true for leaner individuals who should instead slow down their rate of weight loss even further by aiming for the lower end of the range or regardless by sticking to this range you'll be able to maximize your chances of building or at least preserving your muscle as you strip off your excess fat and the next mistake I want to go through is simply doing too much too soon at the start of your diet so for example what a lot of people do as soon as they start dieting is they'll drastically reduce their food intake or even cut out the carbs completely while ramping up their cardio and thinking that this is gonna speed up the process and while that may be true in the short term it's actually going to prevent you from losing a significant amount of fat and getting really lean in the long run because not only is this approach very difficult to sustain for extended periods and it will cause you to feel the effects of the dive very quickly well most people don't realize is that this approach actually prevents you from having any leverage when you reach a fat loss plateau because when you start dieting and you put your body in a calorie deficit over time your body compensates by decreasing its metabolism to burn less calories which it does mainly by decrease in the various movements that you make throughout the day or your NEET which eventually leaves you stuck in a fat loss plateau since your metabolism has decreased to the point where you're no longer in a calorie deficit to lose fat and then to break through this fat loss plateau typically it would be simply a matter of either decreasing your calorie intake slightly and/or adding a little more cardio but the problem is if you're already starving yourself and you're already doing a ton of cardio then how on earth or you can inconsistently continue to push more and more to break through this fat loss plateau and through the several other plateaus that you're going to counter in the future it's you're not and this is what leaves a lot of people both stuck spinning their wheels in their fat loss journey and losing a lot of muscle from just doing too much so instead you want to first start at a small to moderate calorie deficit of roughly 10 to 20 percent or 500 calories below your maintenance for example you also want to start out with minimal cardio so for example just one to two low intensity sessions per week and then as the week's go by and your weight and your fat loss begins to stagnate you can simply drop your calories further and/or increase your cardio slightly as needed to break through these plateaus every time that you reach them so for example during one of my last item periods I started out eating that roughly 2,500 calories with just one low intensity cardio session for a week 12 weeks and 20 pounds later though I was much leaner and down to roughly 2,200 calories with about 4 low intensity cardio sessions per week before then transitioned out of my diet but how'd I not started out easy I wouldn't have had that leverage I needed to break through the various plateaus I encountered which is what ultimately enabled me to drastically drop my body fat now the last mistake is not taking breaks more specifically I mean breaks with your calorie deficit because as I mentioned earlier the longer you diet for the more your body begins to physiologically adapt to both slow down your fat loss and make you more prone to losing muscle the reverse is the fact though you can use a strategy where instead of dieting continuously for X amount of weeks for example you die intermittently with the use of something called diet breaks now diet breaks are somewhat novel yet very effective dieting strategy where you simply increase your calories back up to maintenance for a week or two during your diet and what this does is it actually reverses a lot of the physiological adaptations that your body is made in response to your diet in order to make your weeks of dieting after this break a lot more effective for both fat loss and muscle retention and illustrating this is a well-known 2017 paper where researchers compare dieting continuously for 16 weeks versus taking a 2 week diet break after every 2 weeks have died in now after both dieting periods were over despite being in a car deficit for the same amount of time the die break group ended up losing 50 percent more fat without losing more muscle and experience significantly less of a drop in their metabolism throughout their diet which actually helped them better maintain the new weight after the diet when compared to the continuous group the only major downside with diet breaks though is that it will extend the length of your diet as a result but rather than implementing the protocol that was used in this study what I'd recommend for a similar effect is simply implementing a one-week diet break after every four to eight weeks or so of diet in this way you're gonna avoid increasing the length of your diet too much while still getting the many benefits that diets have to offer so as you may have noticed guys when it comes to properly leaning down and retaining or even building muscle in the process you need to avoid rush in the process and instead slow it down by using a more controlled and a more systematic approach and if you're looking for a step-by-step program that shows you exactly how to implement this with both your workouts and your nutrition such that you can lean down while improving your muscle definition and strength just like jason statham over here was able to do on his built with science program then simply head

    "title": "How to PROPERLY Deadlift for Growth (5 Easy Steps)",
    "published_at": "2023-01-22T14:00:25Z",
    "transcript": "deadlifts are scary but they don't have to be and five super simple steps I'll show you exactly how to properly deadlift to maximize growth unlock your untapped strength and performance and minimize your risk of injury one creating the pillar getting this right is crucial we need to get your bones in the right place before we even consider bending down to grab the bar let's start with your feet walk up to the bar and align it right over your shoelaces in the middle of your foot widen your feet to about hip width apart with your toes facing forward for most people this is the best foot stance but later in Step 4 if this feels uncomfortable you can widen your feet and or Point your toes outward and see if that works better for you next we need to fix your hips and ribs into the correct position dead lifting with the hips and ribs misaligned is the most common reason for back injury they should remain stacked like a pillar and stay that way as you lift to do that let's start with the hips so think of your hips as a bowl full of water most people stand with an anterior pelvic tilt which causes the water to tip over the front of the bowl instead tilt your pelvis back so the bowl is flat you can think as if you were trying to bring your belt buckle up to your chin as for the ribs most people stand with them flared out flatten them by engaging your core at this point your ribs and hips should be stacked evenly on top of each other but to keep them locked in that position I want you to squeeze your glutes and inner thighs together and feel yourself getting taller as you do so and finally make a fist in each hand and push them down towards the ground to straighten your arms and activate your lats at this point you should feel your glutes inner thighs core and lats all working you're ready for step two grabbing the bar this is where most people will round their back and shoulders and lose the tightness we work so hard to create instead I want you to keep the pillar we created in step one and start pushing your hips back while keeping your fist pushing straight down under your shoulders you can imagine you had a bag full of groceries in each hand and you're trying to close the car door with your butt you want to continue pushing your hips back as far as you can without your big toes coming off the ground the moment you lose pressure in the big toe is a moment you've pushed your hips back too far once you reach that end point bend your knees and bring your shins to the bar to pull yourself down those last few inches keep going until you can hook your hands onto the bar just outside your knees at this point there's three things you must look out for before you move on to the next step number one the further away the bar is from you the more strain will be placed on the lower back this is why the bar must be directly over your midfoot with your shins just about touching the bar number two if your hips are too high you'll use more of your lower back but if your hips are too low you'll end up doing more of a squat than a deadlift although it will look slightly different depending on your Anatomy you want your hips to be somewhere above your knees but below your shoulders and number three a neutral spine but don't forget that your neck is part of the spine so draw your head back and pick a spot on the floor a few feet in front of you so that your head extends in the same line as the rest of your back you're now ready for step three creating the wedge this is the last thing you need to do before liftoff the wedge is a powerful position that'll prevent your lower back from being compromised as soon as you lift the weight to create it drive your knees out against your arms then take a deep 360 breath as if you were wearing a belt and trying to push air against all sides of it and then brace your core as if someone were about to punch your stomach next to get rid of any rounding in the upper back and shoulders think about extending your chest and getting tall from your hips all the way to your head and finally activate your lats by squeezing your armpits as if you had oranges in them and you were trying to make orange juice if you've done this properly you should feel tension in your lats core glutes and hamstrings you're ready for step four push [Music] but first comment below what other exercises you might be struggling with I'm doing a series all of these exercise porn videos and I'd love to hear what you'd like to see me cover next this is actually the simplest step but it's also where most people screw up they think of the deadlift as a pull and end up breaking out of the position we work so hard to create to avoid this imagine your arms were ropes with hooks at the end of them just hanging onto the bar then to lift the weight rather than going from zero to a hundred and jerking the weight off the floor keep the tightness recreated in step 3 and think about pushing the floor away with your feet harder and harder until the bar lifts off the ground when done correctly rather than your hips Rising first and lower back rounding your hips and chest should rise at the same rate continue pushing the floor away until the bar passes your knees and then think about thrusting your hips forward or humping the air in front of you to meet the bar at the top of the lift but to avoid injuring your back at the top your shoulders should not be behind your heels and your lower back should not be arched this is a sign that you've extended your back too far to prevent this as you come to the top imagine you're about to get punched in the stomach and keep your glutes squeezed together at the top your hips ribs shoulders and Chin should all be stacked like parallel floors of a building now if you've done this step correctly you should feel a slight pump in your lats hamstrings and glutes but don't be alarmed if you also feel this in the lower back muscles they help stabilize the weight as you lift and will be an area where you'll notice a lot of growth but you want to avoid doing too many lower back demanding exercises all in one workout as it can be too much for these muscles to handle that's exactly why it's so important that you use a well-written program a first step-by-step plan that shows you exactly how to work out every week and how to do every single exercise in the detail you need to minimize injury and maximize growth just head on over to build science.com and take our free analysis quiz to find out what program is best for you and your body but for now it's time for step five descent foreign this is where many people not only injure themselves but also miss out on a lot of muscle growth by letting gravity drop the weight we want to control the weight down but we need to do this correctly now this will look very similar to what we did back in step two the only difference now is that you have a bar many people tend to let the bar sway forward in front of them which causes a lot of stress on the lower back instead push your hips back and Slide the bar down as close as possible along your thighs as soon as a bar passes your kneecaps that's when you can bend your knees and Slide the bar along your shins to get the bar back over your mid foot but to avoid losing tension and leaving gains at the table avoid bouncing the weight up off the floor instead stay tight and gently touch the floor with the weight before your next rep congrats my friend you've just done the perfect deadlift not so scary after all right can give this video a watch next to find out what other exercises will help grow your back and I'll see you next time"

    "title": "What Happens To Body After 30 Days Cold Showers (Science Explained)",
    "published_at": "2023-05-07T13:00:34Z",
    "transcript": "what would happened like a 30 Days War up you took a whole shower every single day and through the cold today we're doing a deep dive into the science and I'll also reveal the results I got from doing the 30-day cold protocol I'll share later on now it seems like wherever you look all the top athletes and celebrities are taking cold showers ice baths and just using cold therapy in general and honestly after looking at the research I can see why they do but what are the specific benefits you can expect how cold does a water need to be can it help with fat loss or built-in muscle are there any side effects you should know about well you'll start experiencing benefits right from day one it will be the hardest day but also the most rewarding you see exposing your body to cold seems to release three key hormones norepinephrine epinephrine and dopamine together these stimulate what's known as your sympathetic nervous system or your fight or flight response this is what makes you panic and feel as if you need to escape or yell during the cold exposure now the cold not only elevates these hormones during the exposure but it keeps them elevated for an extended period of time afterwards anywhere from 30 minutes to several hours depending on how cold the water was and how long you were in it the benefit of this is improve mood energy and focus similar to the feeling you get after going for a run or doing a workout coffee actually works in a similar way but activating the sympathetic nervous system it's why many people find they no longer need to rely on coffee in the morning if they instead just jump straight into the cold but to experience these benefits there's a few things you need to know first the temperature of the water needs to be cold enough one study compared cold water immersion at 90\u00b0 70\u00b0 and 60\u00b0 F they found a significant increase in dopamine and norepinephrine in the 60\u00b0 group but not the others now I measured a couple of showers after setting it to the coldest setting and it clocked in at about 50\u00b0 F I am from Canada so the water is a little bit colder here but still I'd expect most showers should be able to get around that level but to tell if it's cold enough without a thermometer research suggest it should trigger what's known as the initial inspiratory Gap this is a deep breath your body instinctively PES as soon as you feel the cold but you also need to stay in the cold for long enough enough thing is the subjects in the study I mentioned earlier they sat in the cold water for an hour I don't know about you but I'm not planning to take hour long showers every day I did however find several studies showing benefits with shorter durations of even just 20 seconds of cold exposure but in most cases they Ed an ice bath instead of a shower so the body could be fully immersed but this doesn't mean a 30-second cold shower won't do anything even if your hormonal increase isn't significant by research standards you'll still very like likely feel a benefit and an increased mood I mean ask you do and comment below if you also notice the difference after a cold shower but to keep feeling that mental benefit over time there's one more thing you need to know it's called attenuation so over time your body adapts to the cold and the hormonal response seems to die down once you notice this you can try making the water colder or stay in it for longer to continue feeling the benefit all right we've talked about the mental benefits but what about fat loss a common theory is that exposure to the cold boost your metabolism since your body is trying to heat up this burns more calories and can accelerate fat loss as a result what does research say well it's true cold exposure can boost your metabolism most research suggest that exposure to the cold increases your metabolism by around 15% a 2021 study however found that cold water immersion increased calorie burning far more than this up to 50% in well-trained athletes this took their estimated daily calorie burn from 2,000 calories a day all the way up to 3,000 calories and given that 1 lb of fat is equivalent to roughly 3500 calories this would in theory mean the subjects could burn off a pound of fat every 3 days just from their cold protocol however before you plan your move to Antarctica there's two catches you need to be aware of first subjects in the study were immersed in the cold for over 3 hours the average shower length is 8 minutes and the amount of time You' spend showering in the cold would only be a fraction of that second the researchers tested metabolism while the subjects were in the cold they used that value to estimate how many calories they burn for 24 hours but this assumes they'd continue burning calories at the same rate for the rest of the day which is very unlikely so even if you crunch the data while being super optimistic it likely wouldn't end up anywhere close to enough to make a meaningful effect for fat loss unless you quite literally sat in the cold water all day every day but that said there was a study released just this year that throws a curveball to what I just said and even took me by surprise subjects were put into a weekly cold protocol of 53c cold showers and one 2minute cold water immersion to the neck after each exposure they let their bodies naturally warm up for 10 minutes meaning they ended the protocol with the cold rather than turning the shower to hot water right after doing the cold water after 8 weeks of this the men in the study lost just over 1 cm off their waist and experienced a sign ific reduction in their visceral belly fat this is a dangerous belly fat deep within your organs the women however they didn't experience any significant effects and it's unclear what now although at least for men this sounds promising I decided to take a closer look in the study and I found some serious issues you see the authors only reported the result from the cold experimental group but to truly understand whether the results were caused by the cold you need to compare them against a control group for whatever reason the research seers decided not to do this even though they actually took the time to include a control group in the first place but if you do compare the two groups you'll find that there wasn't any significant difference between them this was just one of the many issues with this paper which is why a person wouldn't feel confident with any of his fining but now a far more effective and proven way to lose fat is to use a well-designed nutrition and training plan and if you need help setting one up using the latest scies just head over to build with.com and take my 30second quiz to find the best program for you and your body so we talked about your mood and we talked about fat loss but what about Muscle Recovery and growth how does cold exposure affect that well this is where things get really interesting so ice bats have long been used as a recovery method for top level athletes and for good reason they've been showing in multiple studies to speed up recovery by reducing muscle soreness fatigue and inflammation after a training session this is great for athletes who need to recover quickly between events but if you're looking to build muscle and strength this may actually be a problem you see after workout your muscles temporarily become damaged and inflamed it's part of their recovery process to grow bigger and stronger taking ice baths immediately after your workout can interfere with this process by reducing the inflammation this is one of the possible reasons why three Studies have now shown that posttraining cold water immersion significantly decreases muscle growth so if you want to maximize growth growth and strength you definitely want to avoid ice baths immediately after workout either do it before the workout at least 4 to 6 hours after your workout or on a separate day altogether for example I personally do them on my rest day and several hours after my leg day to take advantage of the recovery and soreness benefits without impairing my gains as for cold showers the studies I mentioned they all used ice baths where subjects stayed immersed in the water for anywhere between 10 to 20 minutes so pretty intense protocols based on that I would speculate that a quick cold shower after workout probably wouldn't have any negative effects on muscle growth and isn't really something to worry about but it also probably wouldn't do anything meaningful for your recovery so it might not be worth the potential downside all right so we've talked about mental benefits we've talked about bat loss and we've talked about Muscle Recovery and growth but there's one more benefit you should know about it's actually the main reason why I personally make the effort to incorporate cold showers and FS into my routine forcing yourself to mentally withstand a stressor like the cold is an incredible way to strengthen your mind one of the ways it does this is by activating an area of your brain that suppresses impulsivity this can help you remain calm and not overreact whenever stressors come into your life but this also helps build tremendous resilience and grit that can positively transfer into other areas of your life for example during a tough leg workout just like I do with a cold I simply view the pain as a sensation a sensation that I can overcome with my mind to push my body past my mental limits now for those interested this is a protocol I'm currently following I'd recommend start with cold showers work your way up to 30 seconds to a minute and then over time try to stay in there for even longer or if possible make the water even colder and to further intensify the benefits consider investing in the cold tub which will also give you some of the recovery benefits that showers just don't seem to provide now although all this probably won't do much for f loss you can click here for a video on what I believe is the most underrated exercise you could start doing today to lose fat faster thanks for watching and I'll see you next time"

    "title": "Does Muscle Soreness Mean Muscle Growth? (&quot;DOMS&quot; Explained)",
    "published_at": "2018-03-04T15:09:23Z",
    "transcript": "[Music] [Applause] it's a common belief among lifters that the more muscle soreness you experience after your workout the more your muscles will grow and it helps indicate the effectiveness of your workout this often leaves people disheartened when they don't experience muscle soreness after their workout and convinces them to do anything they can in order to achieve the muscle soreness that they once felt but does muscle soreness actually matter in terms of muscle growth well to answer this let's first take a look at what exactly muscle soreness means and what causes it muscle soreness also known as delayed onset muscle soreness or Dom's is the feeling you get in response to the microscopic tears in your muscle fibres that occur from resistance training or just a novel stimulus in general now muscle soreness is viewed as important for muscle growth because as shown in Brad Shawn fells 2010 study muscle damage is one of the three main mechanisms of muscle growth and this doesn't necessarily mean that muscle damage is required for muscle growth but it may provide an additive or synergistic effect to the other mechanisms and since studies show that muscle soreness is definitely an indication of whether muscle damage took place one would assume that more muscle soreness leads to more muscle growth however the correlation between the two factors is poor for instance one anecdotal example and something that is supported by the literature is that some muscle groups like the shoulders don't experience muscle soreness to the same degree as other muscle groups like the legs or the biceps for example but since these muscles that are less prone to soreness still experience growth it indicates that soreness is not necessary for muscle growth another good example is that studies have shown the presence of muscle soreness after a long-distance running which many of you can probably relate to but since running is not associated with significant muscle growth it once again indicates that muscle soreness is not really suggestive of muscle growth in addition too much soreness can be a bad thing if it carries over into your next workouts many studies have actually shown that training a muscle while it's still sore can reduce the activation of the desired muscle reduce a force capacity of the muscle by up to 50% negatively interfere with a recovery process so for example if you were running an upper lower split and the soreness of your upper body workout carried over into your next upper-body workout this could potentially hinder your muscle growth in the long run for the reasons previously discussed so in this case you can see how too much muscle soreness can be detrimental but with that being said one thing I do like about muscle soreness is that it's a good indicator of if you activated the right muscles or not you're in your workout for example let's say you were doing a chest workout and the next day you really felt the majority of your soreness in your upper traps and front delts as opposed to your chest so this would help indicate that for your next workout you might need to work on your form regarding the chest exercises and focus on establishing a solid mind to muscle connection with your chest so just pay attention to where the majority of your soreness is after your workouts as it can really help indicate if the right muscles were activated so to conclude what you should take away from this video is that muscle soreness does not indicate muscle growth but with that being said there may be an optimal level of soreness that indicates muscle damage took place yet doesn't compromise recovery or interfere with your next workout so if you're getting too sore try initially lowering the volume or intensity of your workouts and easier way into them over time and on the other hand if you're not getting sore at all it's not a big deal if you're still progressing with your exercises throughout the weeks since this progression is what's really going to guarantee hypertrophy and increase muscle damage over time regardless of if soreness takes place or not but with that being said you can potentially induce more muscle damage by changing up some of your exercises or consider incorporating eccentric training into your regimen you can do this by simply adding in one or two eccentric sets per muscle group with a heavier weight than you'd usually use but regardless the goal is to find a sweet spot in which you're drawing on all three mechanisms of muscle growth while not getting too sore and the way to best achieve this will differ for everyone so you really just have to experiment and see how your body responds thanks so much for watching guys I hope you enjoyed

    "title": "Why 90% of People NEVER Get Lean (Do This Instead)",
    "published_at": "2025-01-27T10:30:11Z",
    "transcript": "for every 10 people who try to get lean only two will actually succeed but here's the crazy part only one of them will be able to keep the fat off for good so what's this guy's secret most people rely on quick fixes that eventually fall apart but after studying the research learning from Top coaches and analyzing the leanest people on the planet the secret comes down to just five simple daily Habits by mastering these strategies myself I recently got down to 11 % body fat and it felt almost automatic in this video I'll show you how to do the same no gimmicks no fluff starting with habit number one increasing your energy flux so you've probably heard this advice before if you want to lose fat you just got to eat less but what if I told you the leanest people in the world often eat more calories while maintaining less body fat it sounds impossible but that's exactly what this habit does so back in 2016 scientists conducted a study where they tracks three groups people eating fewer calories but not moving much people eating moderately and staying somewhat active and people eating over 3,000 calories a day that exercising a lot known as the high energy flux group can you guess which group saw the best results so despite eating the most calories the high energy flux group was the only one to lose fat dropping their body fat from almost 20% to a lean 16% and and maintained it for years afterwards so what exactly is going on here well to find out I wanted more evidence so I called in Dr Eric Trexler a researcher at Duke University and the science adviser for our built with science Plus app using what's known as the enhs database which is just a massive study of the health and habits of Americans he ran a statistical analysis comparing the calorie intakes of the leanest individuals with an average body fat percentage of 19% to the least lean individuals with an average body fat percentage of 35% theoretically you would expect that larger people with higher body fats probably eat more calories per day in reality we found a gap of roughly 300 calories where the leaner people actually reported eating more on a daily basis a lot of times people with higher body fat they either have uh less experience with self-monitoring their food intake so they have more errors in their reporting or they're just a little bit more shy about reporting everything that they ate but with en haanes you have an interviewer there who says are you sure it was only 3/4 of a cup or did it look more like this which is actually a cup and a half and I noticed you didn't you didn't include any milk did you really eat dry cereal or did you have 2% or whole milk with that it raises a really fascinating question of you know is it possible that these Lear folks actually were eating like 300 more calories per day while maintaining a lanar physique now Eric's analysis not only show that leaner individuals tend to report eating more but they also engaged in considerably more exercise creating what scientists term a high energy flux lifestyle now of course other variables could be at play here like leaner individuals having more muscle mass which can boost their calorie burn and as Eric mentioned the possibility of Under reporting calories but these findings align with what I've consistently observe to my own clients in fact Dr Mike isrel PhD researcher and competitive bodybuilder has noticed the exact same thing what many people find is that if they have pegged their daily activity to a moderate high level again 8 to 12,000 steps is a rough estimate for many people kind of get you in that General range it kind of just keeps the machine humming along and allows you to eat a bit more food while simultaneously losing the same or having the same uh size calorie sink and that ends up supporting your training better supporting your cognition better it supports your mood better you're not as crazy hungry and and crav any anymore at the same time you're losing tons of weight but a highly active lifestyle doesn't mean you're just doing a bunch of crazy cardio every day in fact all the experts I spoke to emphasize the power of plain old walking and just getting enough daily steps in even Pro natural bodybuilder and the lead coach Alberto Nunes who is known for getting to insane levels of leanness focuses on this more sustainable approach it could be something as simple as like hey no more than 90 minutes sitting in front of your desk like go take a little walk or something or you start off the day with a walk uh or sometimes even like some people who have big enough gyms it's like hey in between sets don't bring a water bottle walk to the water fountain and come back right so you you get to be creative with it and what I like to look forward is like the path of least resistance and for most people no matter how chaotic or spontaneous your life might be there is a way to fit in some extra movement so here's what I personally do to ply this habit I already lift weights four to five times a week but I also make sure I'm taking at least 8,000 to 10,000 steps a day and to help with this after every workout I do 10 minutes of cardio doesn't matter what I just pick whatever I feel like doing that day and at some point later on in the day I'll also take at least one long 30 to 60 Minute walk and if it's raining out I'll just hop on my under desk treadmill and lastly I try to incorporate an exercise snack after every couple hours of sitting whether it's up and down a flight of stairs walk into the furthest bathroom anything that gets me up even if it's just for a minute so I want you to start small pick one of these tips and just build from there and if you found any creative ways to stay active I would love to hear them so drop them in the comments below but for the best results you also need to pair this with habit number two and let me ask you something if you were trying to save money would you do it without ever checking your bank account probably not cuz you'd have no idea how much you're spending you're saving but that is exactly what you're doing when you try to transform your body without keeping track of anything in fact there's a really interesting study by Thomas at all where researchers analyze members of the national weight control registry now this group is like the VIP Club of successful weight loss everyone in it has lost at least 30 lbs and kept it off for a full year or more so we're talking about the top 20% of people who actually succeed in getting lean and staying lean so what's their secret well there was one top habit most of them had in common self-monitoring they track their progress daily whether that was body weight food intake or activity levels but with so many things that you could track how do you know what's actually worth paying attention to here's how the experts rank then rank one by a long shot is body weight because if you're consuming decent amount of protein and you're losing weight it kind of doesn't matter what you're consuming because it's clearly working if you're not monitoring your body weight you're you're completely in the dark I know people who have very meticulous step tracking very meticulous macros that they don't keep tabs on their body weight and they're like I don't know if the diet's working how how could you possibly know if the diet's working the second most important thing is macros because your Macros protein carbs fats and then obviously calories derived from that are like the real big working Gears of your diet and they're going to have a huge effect on your results I think the first seven eight years of my training all I did was kind of just eat clean and and train really hard and while I was able to do some good things with my physique I was never able to get as lean as I wanted it was so eye opening to me the first few times I I tracked my food the first few weeks I was like wow I had no idea just in general I was prone to overeating that much and then rank three is steps someone's kind of sitting on the couch a lot and their diets really stalling then yeah step tracking and more than that increasing the step count is a really big deal Dr Eric trixler also recommends one more thing to look out for just the way your clothing fits the scale is not moving but my shirts are loose around my belly they're tight around my arms they're tight around my chest like good things are happening here so especially with someone who can stand to actually gain a lot of muscle while losing fat for them tracking that clothing fit or circumferences also becomes really critical but to avoid overwhelming yourself start simple begin with just one habit tracking your body weight aim for at least three to four WS per week preferably in the morning before eating or drinking but after using the bathroom just to keep things consistent only once you've got that down move on to tracking your nutrition now you don't have to do this every single day nor do you have to do it forever but knowing how much you're actually eating is crucial and I know I know tracking can be a hassle so I've tried to help make this as easy as possible for you with our new built with science Plus app which I'll talk more about later but basically you just snap a photo of your meal and it'll estimate the calories for you logging everything right into the app and it even keeps track of your daily steps and body weight so all the data you need is in one place but as powerful as these first two habits are you're just not going to see the results you're after if you neglect habit number three the results are cataclysmically bad we're talking about losing pounds and pounds of weights on a caloric deficit and losing only muscle we're talking about if you're gaining weight that you're gaining pure fat and zero muscle at the same time even if you're training hard sleep is such a critical component of keeping muscle on your body and getting the fat off that it is what I call it absolute non-negotiable and it's not just about muscle and fat Dr Eric Trexler explains how poor sleep creates a horrible ripple effect everywhere we find that folks who are underslept they are really susceptible to excessive hunger they're really susceptible to exaggerated stress responses um and so you know they're hungry they get stressed out more easily and so they're eating due to hunger but they're also eating due to stress and there's this kind of like multi-directional relationship and you might think the solution is as simple as get 8 hours of sleep every night but here's the surprising part Eric's analysis revealed it's not just about quantity I was thinking that people with higher body fat would report less sleep per night and I was completely wrong about that so they were like virtually identical at 7.5 hours of sleep on average per night and so I was like okay I was wrong but then it got a little more interesting because I dug into there's a questionnaire kind of question in a survey how often do you just kind of feel tired and sluggish and sleepy throughout the day and that was where we found a difference despite the fact that hours of sleep per night were equivalent the leaner folks reported that they were were less frequently feeling tired and sluggish and sleepy throughout the day uh so that that leads to a really fascinating question which is you know perhaps there's a discrepancy in Sleep Quality between the two groups so how do you improve both the quantity and quality of your sleep well the good news is that it's relatively simple even if your lifestyle makes it challenging to get enough hours in here's what I'd recommend first try to stick to a consistent sleep schedule even on weekends so if you do have a late night resist the urge to sleep in too late the next day just to avoid messing with your sleep patterns next watch your caffeine intake especially in the afternoon and evening as this can negatively affect your sleep even if you have it up to 14 hours before bed so this means if you work out later in the day just try not to have coffee or pre-work up before personally for me even something as small as a dieet Coke after 2: p.m. completely messes with my sleep so pay attention to what works and doesn't work for you next While most adults need 7 to 8 hours of sleep some people fall into what's called a short sleep phenotype it's rare but fascinating my mom for example she thrives on just 5 hours of sleep per night and she actually feels worse with anymore but if you want to figure out how much sleep your body actually needs spend one to two months being consistent with your bedtime and then let yourself wake up naturally without an alarm pay attention to when you wake up and also how refreshed you feel that'll help you find your ideal sleep duration and lastly if your lifestyle makes it hard to get enough sleep at night naps can be a GameChanger pro athletes like Cristiano Ronaldo and LeBron James swear by them whatever you can do can never ever substitute for sleep that is the greatest recovery for an athlete like myself for athletes all over the world and research backs this up even a 30 to 45 minute nap can drastically improve gym performance especially if you're underslept but if these naps actually end up making it harder for you to fall asleep at night try shifting them earlier or keeping them shorter but even with enough sleep it's going to feel nearly impossible to get lean if you're not eating the right foods and this is where habit number four comes in building high quality meals let's first take a look at what the experts eat and I want to see if you can spot any patterns yeah so like for for my breakfast like it'll literally just be like Greek yogurt peanut butter powder whey protein powder and then um like a fiber one kind of cereal that's basically just like pure insoluble fiber then later on in the day I might do my workout uh sometime in the afternoon and I'll often have a protein shake I'll finish that shake uh towards the end of my workout or just before I hit the shower then I get out of the shower and you know what I do is I just clean my body and touch everything right in front of the mirror and for just a very few dollars per month you can have access to my bathroom I'm s not back on top my my my my apolog different different video different video uh and then so um after showering I'll typically get um you know some kind of meal that fits all of my needs there this is just like that meat and veggies and I put that in the microwave when the meat and veggies are nice and warm I get that out the rice cooker always has warm rice I put that in for fat needs I often put in either canola oil olive oil or avocado oil as measure to me and mix that all together like an animal um and eat it while I'm downstairs here in this basement working so dinner for me is like the one time in the day where I get to enjoy something that's like cooked and hot so usually it'll be some sort of animal protein uh usually it's either salmon or or beef and surrounding that that's why I try to get my vegetables as well because again I'm at ease to I get ta vegetables take forever to eat that's one of the reasons that they're so great for fat loss so I try to have them during that meal as well um and then um some added starch it could be a sweet potato it can be a potato we could have a few slices of uh of of sour dough bread did you notice anything you may not see it quite yet but they all take the exact same approach when building their meals I'm sure you've kind of seen this before and yourself and Friends where you like look at what quote unquote regular people are eating and you're like holy you think that's a meal my God and then they tell you they're like oh I can't seem to lose weight you're like listen I can tell you why like how do you build your meals it's it's kind of ridiculous so what separates a high quality meal from the average plate well it's surprisingly simple and it all comes down to three key principles start with a high quality protein Source this is non-negotiable think eggs fish yogurt or chicken roughly the size of your palm for us Fitness folks a meal just isn't considered a meal without this next in most of your meals add one to two servings of fruits or veggies these fiber nutrient-rich foods will prevent you from getting hungry shortly after eating and lastly complete your plate with whole grains like potatoes brown rice oats Andor healthy fats like avocados or nuts now if these meals don't look quite as appetizing as your favorite take out that's completely normal stick to it long enough and your perception will actually start to change yeah they're not as tasty as I don't know Takis or a hot dog or whatever it is that you like but there is a level of gratification that comes from it that is much steeper that is beyond the surface and that's when start things really start to like pick for people once they see their spinach salad is not just something they have to do to get where they want to be but they generally see that hey you know what this doesn't taste so bad like anymore I almost rather eatat this than I don't know like the cheeseburger or slice of pizza from across the street because it fulfilled me in so much so many other ways outside of that like just initial thing of like wow this is tasty but that's kind of it but one thing you may have noticed about the experts I spoke to is they didn't hesitate when I asked about their meals they didn't say oh sometimes a grab take out or I just heat up Us in the fridge no their meals were deliberate structured and aligned with their goals and that is where the final habit comes in and it's the one that ties everything together setting goals that drive the right daily actions most people say Goals that are either too vague or hyperfocused on the outcome like reaching a specific number on the scale even worse they focus on restriction like cut out sugar or avoid junk food but goals like this just keep you fixated on what you can't have and don't actually give you a road map for what to actually do and instead there's a powerful research back method that makes achieving your goals far more likely creating a goal hierarchy think of it like building a pyramid with three layers that guide you from your overarching purpose down to the exact steps you'll take each day the first layer starts with your y this is your big picture goal the thing that gets you out of the bed in the morning it's not just about numbers on a scale or benching 225 it's about who you want to become for example I want to be a fit healthy person who feels confident and energetic a goal like this gives you a deeper connection to your journey it's no longer just about doing it's about who you're becoming but before we move on I want you to comment below what is your why for this year for example do you want to be a healthy role model for your kids or do you want to feel more confident in your body or maybe you just know that you're capable of more and you want to realize your full potential Whatever It Is Write it in the comments studies show that simply sharing your goal significantly increases the likelihood of you achieving it but now that you've defined your Why move on to the what and think of these like the categories that make up your transformation for example eating healthier sleeping better self-monitoring exercising consistently these goals they give you Direction but still leave room for flexibility and then lastly map out the how so this this is where you get super specific applying the habits we went through earlier to lay out your daily routine to achieve your big picture goal here's an example weigh yourself every morning while brushing your teeth meal prep every Sunday and Wednesday to make high quality meals get 7 to 8 hours of sleep by going to bed at 1: p.m. resistance training for 45 minutes on Monday Wednesday and Friday before work and go for a 10-minute walk after every meal now maybe you just start with one of these but by breaking down your goals like this you shift your focus away from the out outcome like losing 20 lbs of fat to the Daily process that will inevitably get you that result now if you're serious about making a change but you just feel overwhelmed or just unsure where to start our new build with size Plus app was designed for you it simplifies the entire process helping Define your goals laying out your daily checklist and easily tracks everything from your workouts steps and body weight to even your meals with just a snap of a

    "title": "Barbells vs Dumbbells for Muscle Growth",
    "published_at": "2018-07-08T14:06:39Z",
    "transcript": "when it comes to maximizing muscle growth there's no question that you need to prioritize free weights exercises in your routine but when it comes to your choice of free weight exercises you're left with two options barbells and dumbbells now although it's clear that both are effective options to build muscle it's less clear is whether one is better than the other in terms of maximizing growth and to find out we need to weigh out the pros and cons of each to start let's take a look at barbells so for those who are unaware as brought to attention by a 2010 meta-analysis by Schoenfeld and colleagues there's thought to be three main mechanisms of muscle growth with mechanical tension being suggested as the primary driver of growth and the stated by the researchers in order to maximize mechanical tension you need to be performing heavy compound movements and get stronger with them over time which now leads me to the main benefit of incorporating barbell exercises which is they generally enable you to maximize mechanical tension to a larger degree than dumbbells can and this is due to two reasons reason number one is because you're able to lift heavier weight with barbells compared to dumbbells for example this 2011 study from the Journal of Sports Science showed that subjects could lift close to 20 percent more weight with the barbell bench press as opposed to the dumbbell press similarly this 2013 study from the journal strength and conditioning research found that subjects could lift close to 10 percent more weight with the standing shoulder press when a barbell was used as opposed to dumbbells which is probably because barbell movements require less stabilization as you press when compared to dumbbells now the second reason why barbells better maximize mechanical tension is because they enable you to more effectively progressive overload when compared to their dumbbell counterparts since barbell exercises are easier to get into position which minimizes wasted energy and can be overloaded with just 2.5 pound increments on each side as opposed to the common 5 pound jumps 4 dumbbells this enables you to progress faster and more efficiently with barbells compared to dumbbells and thus over time leads to more mechanical tension and theer radically more growth but with that being said this doesn't mean that you should exclusively stick to barbell since dumbbells do have their advantages as well the first and one of their most significant advantages in terms of muscle growth is that they tend to elicit higher muscle activation when compared to their barbell counterparts for example this 2016 paper from the journal strength and conditioning research found that the dumbbell press consistently elicited significantly higher pectoralis major activation in the barbell bench press this finding has also been replicated in the past in an extensive EMG analysis by Brett Contreras which found that both the flat and incline dumbbell press elicited greater chest activation when compared to flat and incline barbell presses and as for other muscle groups this 2013 paper found that utilizing dumbbells allowed for more activation of the anterior deltoids when compared to barbells during both the seated and standing press therefore this increased activation with dumbbells is something that would probably hold true for most other muscle groups as well and the reasoning behind it is likely because utilizing dumbbells enables you to achieve a slightly greater range of motion than barbells since for example at the top of a dumbbell press you're able to perform slightly more horizontal adduction than you can when compared to having your hands fixed on a bar it also enables you to move the dumbbells in a more natural path that best suits your individual body structure rather than being stuck in a relatively fixed path with the bar thus leading to better activation of your target muscle and also often providing a more comfortable press if you tend to experience aches and pains with the barbell and muscle activation aside another major benefit of dumbbells that you're probably aware of is that it can help minimize muscle imbalances since each arm is working independently your body can't subconsciously favor one side when pressing or curling therefore leading to more balance development in the long run if that's something you struggle with so as you can see both dumbbells and barbells have their drawbacks but they both have their positives as well and completely avoid in one in favor of the other means you'll always miss out on ones set of positives so instead use a combination of both as this will likely be optimal for muscle growth while minimizing potential imbalances and injury what I recommend is Center your program around lifting heavy with the big compound movements which are most effectively done with barbells in order to maximize mechanical tension this is especially true when a lower rep range of 4 to 6 reps for example is employed since doing so with dumbbells becomes challenging to balance and stabilize the weight and thus less efficient but in addition to these main barbell movements you should also incorporate dumbbell exercises particularly for upper body exercises and particularly with a higher rep range as this will help to both maximize metabolic stress and muscle activation and will help minimize potential muscle imbalances and/or injury in the long run for example for a chest or push workout starting with a barbell bench press in a lower rep range and then moving on to an incline dumbbell press with a slightly higher rep range would be a good way to go about incorporating both and the same methodology can be applied to other muscle groups as well in order to ensure that you get the best of both worlds thanks so much for watching guys I hope you enjoyed the video and found it useful I do have an important announcement for those who are

    "title": "Short vs Long Rest Periods for Muscle Growth",
    "published_at": "2018-05-27T14:07:43Z",
    "transcript": "as mentioned in many of my other videos when it comes to optimizing your training program there's a lot of variables that need to be considered how much time you rest between sets is one of the more important variables yet is often something that's overlooked on one end of the spectrum are those who keep their rest periods as short as possible in order to sweat more achieve a better pump and experience more general satisfaction after their workout and on the other end you have those who take their time with all of their sets and seem to barely break a sweat but which one is better for muscle growth well let's start by taking a look at the pros and cons of each approach the main reason why shorter rest periods of a minute or less are believed by some to be superior is due to the increased metabolic stress or the burning sensation that your muscles experience and since metabolic stress was shown in Brad Schoenfeld 2010 meta-analysis to be one of the main drivers of muscle growth it makes sense that it would be the better option over longer rest periods but with that being said short rest periods come with a price with a short rest period you're not going to be able to lift as heavy of a weight or perform as many reps as you would be able to after a longer rest period this means that with longer rest periods you're able to achieve more total volume in your workout since you're better rested for each of your sets and able to lift heavier or perform more reps during those sets so as you can see it's essentially a competition between more total volume with longer rest periods versus more metabolic stress with the shorter rest periods but which one wins well luckily for us researcher Brad Schoenfeld has recently published a study on that exact topic in this study they took 21 young resistance trained men and assigned them to either a group that performed their resistance training program with one-minute rest intervals or with three-minute rest intervals with all of the exercises being performed within the 8 to 12 rep range the result after eight weeks the long rest period group saw better muscle growth and strength gains in the short period group and was likely because the long rest period group was able to achieve slightly more volume during their workout since they were better rested for each set therefore proving that total workout volume is a more important driver for muscle growth than metabolic stress which is a finding that was then replicated in multiple other studies that looked at rest periods now with that being said theoretically you could just perform more sets with shorter rest periods to achieve the same amount of volume however this is generally unenjoyable likely takes even longer and as previously noted will negatively impact your strength gains so for these reasons longer rest periods are likely the better option but exactly how long should you rest for well this does depend on several factors but mainly the type of exercise that you're performing for example 1 2016 study from the Journal of strength and conditioning research examine the effect of varied rest periods on different exercises the researchers found that at least two minutes of rest was sufficient for single joint exercises where as subjects responded best to at least 3 minutes of rest for heavy compound movements which is an agreement with Brad Schoenfeld study mentioned earlier so for your main comp at movements like the bench press overhead press squat and deadlift it would likely be best to stick to at least 3 minutes of rest between sets and when using very heavy weight for lower reps increasing your rest period - even more than 3 minutes might be ideal whereas for your isolation movements sticking to roughly 2 minutes of rest between sets or a slightly shorter seems to be the best option I should also note that so far no study has found any downsides associated with longer rest periods besides the fact that your workout will take longer to complete meaning that if there's a day where you feel fatigued and need a little bit more rest than usual you can do so without being concerned about it negatively impacting your growth but does this mean that shorter rest periods of a minute or less don't have any place in your routine well right now it's relatively unclear but in my opinion they should mainly be incorporated for exercises that are relatively easy to recover from and reserved for later on in your workout this will just help induce more metabolic stress which might be beneficial and as always experimentation and trying things out to see what works best for you is key but for example this is how you could properly implement rest periods in the following chest and triceps workout as you can see longer rest periods are used for the main compound movements especially when a lower rep range is used as in the benchpress whereas the isolation movements have shorter yet still adequate rest periods and the very last exercise utilizes very short rest periods for added metabolic stress hopefully this example provides you with some insight as to how to incorporate rest periods into your own routine just keep in mind that although longer rest periods will provide less of a pump less of a burn in your muscles and make you sweat less and shorter rest periods will this should not be your basis as to whether the workout was effective or not muscle growth is very difficult to observe but we do know that the most effective way to achieve it is by progressively overloading our muscles over time which as I discussed is best done with adequate rest periods thanks so much for watching guys I hope you enjoyed the video and found it useful I also just wanted to add that I'd highly recommend that you time your rests in between your sets it's very easy to do yet it ensures that you're taking enough rest in between your sets and hold you accountable to start your next set anyways as always you can find the written summary of this video on my website built with science calm and I'll also leave a link to it in the description box down below I'd also really appreciate it especially those who are new to my channel to give me a follow on Instagram and Facebook as well or try to post informative content on a more regular basis it would really help me out and I'd really appreciate it anyways that's it for this video guys thank you so much for watching if you enjoyed it please don't forget to give it a like leave a comment down below and subscribe to my channel and turn on all notifications for my channel as well as this all really helps me out thank you so much guys I'll see you next time [Music]"

    "title": "How to PROPERLY Bench Press for Growth (5 Easy Steps)",
    "published_at": "2023-02-19T14:00:03Z",
    "transcript": "[Music] the bench press is the goat of upper body exercises do this right and you'll see massive gains in your chest as well as your shoulders and arms but do this wrong and even if it doesn't happen right away you risk seriously injuring your shoulders and elbows to the point where you may never be able to bench again the most important part is with step one setup the bench press involves a fixed back position against the bench and a fixed hand position on the bar this can force your joints into positions they shouldn't be in preventing this starts with your grip width now the closer you grip the more your triceps will be involved while this can be a helpful bench variation to grow bigger arms we want to maximize chest growth to do so you'll want to use a relatively wider grip which research suggests can also make your bench A Little Bit Stronger but you don't want to go too wide as this reduces the range of motion your chest goes through and may also increase the risk of shoulder injury to find the perfect grip width for you lay down on the bench with your arms straight in front of you pull your elbows back until they make a 90 degree angle then bring your elbows in towards your sides until your thumbs line up with your lower chest the space between your hands is your ideal grip distance on the bar after you find the right grip width for a smooth unwracking in The Next Step position your body such that your eyes are directly under the bar and when you grab the bar make sure your thumb isn't on the same side as your fingers this is known as a suicide grip and for a reason instead for the most secure grip I'd recommend keeping your thumb around the bar finally walk your feet back under your knees and plant them firmly into the ground you're ready for step two whole body tension before you even consider unwracking the bar you need to activate various muscles that will help unlock your strength and keep you stable as you lift let's start with the lower body use your quads to push your feet down into the ground and use your glutes to drag your knees out then activate your thoughts by bringing your armpits down to your hips you can imagine there was a band attached to the bar pulling it back as you try to pull it forward next we want to create an arch in your upper back some competitive power lifters take this to the extreme to help them reduce the range of motion so they can lift more weight but this may not be the best for growth and it does require a lot of upper back Mobility a slight Arch however is something I'd recommend as it can help make the bench press feel a little more comfortable on your shoulders and may help you recruit more of your chest fibers especially if you sit all day in a hunched over posture but to create it you are not just arching at your lower back and sticking your ribs out instead simply think about opening up and extending your chest this should create a little bit of space between your back and the bench as a result once you've set your arch straighten your wrist by pointing your knuckles to the ceiling then through your nose take a d360 breath into your abdomen and Brace your core as if someone were about to punch your stomach you're ready for step three unracking this is where most people lose all their tension and mess up their bench press before they even start it to avoid this maintain your arch and stay tight then push the bar up to get it off the rack from there you want to use your lats to pull the bar into the starting position right above your shoulders then re-engage your lats by thinking about bending the bar in half you're ready for step four descent the most common mistake people make here has to do with the bar path unlike the squat and the deadlift during a proper bench press the bar should not travel straight up and down this form can aggravate the shoulders by placing them in a compromised position and it also won't be the best form to activate your chest in fact one well executed study compared the bar path of novice benchers who could bench 225 pounds to Elite benchers who were lifting well over 400 pounds as you can see in both cases they don't bring the bar straight down they bring it down and slightly forwards but it's important you do this properly first avoid letting gravity just drop the weight instead actively pull the bar down by using your back muscles to squeeze your shoulder blades together focus on pulling the bar down towards your lower chest right around the level of your nipples now as you do this your elbows will have to bend but you want to avoid tucking your elbows Too Close into the body and also avoid the more common mistake of flaring them out to the sides instead to maximize chest activation and minimize shoulder discomfort keep them tucked at about a 45 to 70 degree angle away from your body think Arrow shape instead of t-shape now as for how deep to go to maximize growth you ideally want to touch your chest with the bar but some people especially if they're locked into a rounded posture don't have the required Mobility to do this their shoulders will roll forward at the bottom which can cause discomfort and potential injury in this case stop an inch or two above your chest or whatever is most comfortable for you but once you do reach the bottom position your forearms should not be bent inward or outward if they are to minimize discomfort in your joints try narrowing or widening your grip to get your elbows stacked directly under your wrist so by this point the bar should have traveled down and forwards and now be sitting just above or on your lower chest you're now ready for step five Ascent but guys if you want to maximize growth and minimize injury I'm sure you can now see the importance of finding the right form for you and your individual structure and if you need a step-by-step plan that takes care of all the guests before you after this video head on over to buildtooth science.com and take our analysis quiz to find the best program for you and your body but for now step five quite a bit of recent research has highlighted the importance of a stretch position of an exercise in the case of the bench press the bottom position when the chest is fully stretched is likely the most important part for growth but it's also the hardest part most people lose out on chess gains by letting the bar bounce off their chest instead force your chest to work even harder by pausing here for half a second but as you do this do not completely relax and let the bar simply sit on top of you keep the tension in your legs and upper back and feel your chest working to keep the bar stable after the slight pause use your quads to push your feet forward against the ground as if you were doing a leg extension and then drive the bar up off your chest but as we talked about earlier don't push the bar straight up if we take a look back at the study I mentioned earlier novice lifters tend to drive the bar straight up off the chest whereas Elite lifters Drive the bar up and backwards off the chest so although it might feel a little bit weird at first try to drive the bar back up towards your head so that from the side view the bar travels in a slight Arc and as you do this to boost chest activation don't think about just pushing the weight up try thinking about pulling your biceps in as if you were trying to touch them together but as you get to the top avoid letting your shoulders steal gains from your chest by collapsing your upper body and rounding your shoulders forward instead keep your chest up by maintaining the arch in your upper back and squeeze your biceps into your armpits until your arms fully straighten over your shoulders exhale through tight lips as you come to the top take another deep breath in your stomach brace and then control the weight back down for another rep congrats you have just done the perfect bench press you can give these videos a wash next to fix your Squat and deadlift and I'll see you next time"

    "title": "The Worst Bench Press Mistakes Everyone Makes (Avoid These)",
    "published_at": "2023-12-17T14:00:11Z",
    "transcript": "do you ever feel pinching or pain in your shoulder when you bench or maybe you notice your shoulders and arms are working more than your chest is or maybe every time you start going heavy you end up hurting yourself this isn't because the bench press is a bad exercise it's just that most people do it wrong there's five mistakes almost everyone makes fix these and I guarantee your shoulders will thank you and you'll start to actually feel your chest activating like never before so the first mistake has to do with your elbow angle raise your elbows to shoulder height and then try to bring them back as far as you can as if you re bench it do the same thing again but this time with your elbows angled in into an arrow shape notice how much further back you can get so when you're benching if you use too wide of an elbow angle you're going to have a very hard time bringing the bar all the way down to your chest and doing so can create a lot of strain on the shoulders a tucked elbow angle will not only help you get deeper but should also help you better activate your chest since it usually aligns with the direction that most people's chest fibers run whereas once you get too wide the tension shift from the chest towards other muscles in the shoulder however the perfect elbow angle will vary for everyone some of you might do better with around 60\u00b0 whereas others will feel better a bit more flared out but rather than whipping out your protractor the next time you B just focus on your bar path if you used too wide of an elbow angle the bar would travel pretty much straight up and down right over your upper chest but with your elbows tucked you're forc to move the bar slightly forwards on the way down and slightly backwards on the way up so if you simply Focus Fus on touching your lower chest or your nipple area with the bar on the way down then your elbows should naturally end up in the right place however what if you use a Smith machine how does this apply there well generally there's two types of Smith machines the first are angled Smith machines in this case you want to face in the same direction that the Smith machine path is angled at so that the bar moves down and slightly forwards on the way down then simply position yourself on the bench such that at the bottom position the bar t touches the level of your lower chest right around your sternal on the other hand if you're using a Smith machine that goes straight up and down you won't be able to get an angled bar path so in this case I'd recommend positioning yourself such that the bar ends up a little bit higher right around the level of your mid chest now in order to properly apply the previous tip you need to First fix your grip most people just use the same grip as their friend or they'll follow the markers on the bar but the right grip depends on your body for example let's take a look at quite an interesting 20 22 study they had 27 trained subjects perform the bench prast and analyze the activation of their chest shoulders and triceps now even though all the subjects use the exact same grip width some of them experienced the highest activation in their chest some saw the highest activation in their shoulders and others saw the highest activation in their triceps suggesting that a grip that works well for somebody else may not work quite the same way for you but finding the right grip for your body is actually quite simple next time you're on the bench rest the bar in your lower chest the target touch point we covered back in the previous step if at this point your forearms are angled in your grip is probably too narrow and will lead to more triceps involvement whereas if your forearms are angled out it's probably a bit too wide although this grip is often used by powerlifter since it can help boost your strength in my experience it often leads to less chest involvement and some research shows it may lead to a higher risk of shoulder injury instead to get more chest with less stress in your joints at this bottom position your wrist forearms and elbows should ideally be straight up and down stacked directly under the bar however far away your hands need to be to accomplish that is your ideal grip width okay so you're using the right grip and you're not flaring your elbows out too much on the way down but there's a common mistake you want to avoid on the way up you see if your shoulders are relatively stronger compared to your chest you'll tend to let your chest cave in and your shoulders roll forward and take over this is usually why people feel their front delts get sore after benching instead of the chest now although it is unclear as to how well muscle activation correlates to actual growth I did want to see if my EMG machine would tell the same story so on both on myself and my friend Max I measured the activation of the chest and shoulders when using the improper form compared to using the correct form I'm about to show you using the same relative load in both conditions now on both of us especially Max the correct form led to more chest activation and less front Delta activation now as for how to actually execute the correct form start by creating a proud chest by sticking your chest up towards the ceiling then on the way down use your back muscles to pull the bar down to your chest as if you were doing a row squeezing your shoulder blades together and keeping your chest up and proud wly touch the bar with your chest and then on the way up don't just think about pushing the weight up the main function of the chest is horizontal adduction or bringing your arms together so keep your chest up and think about squeezing your Bice BS into the sides of your chest as if you're trying to touch your biceps together it's less of a punching motion and more of a squeezing motion now you may have to lighten the weight to do this properly but it'll help ensure that your chest is doing the work rather than your shoulders the next fix has to do with your setup most people look like this when they bench their feet are tapping all over the place and their body is very loose but notice how powerlifters often take their time setting up before their big squat deadlift or even bed you may not be able to see it but they're tensing their back core and several other muscles to make their body as stable as possible when they lift this not only gives them more strength and power but it also reduces the risk of potential injury or compensations in their form think about how easy it is to smash an empty can compared to when it's unopened and full of pressure that's the stability and rigidness you want to create every time you bench and here's how to do it let's start with a lower body use a wide stance with your feet planted under your knees push your knees out and lightly drive your feet forwards to activate your quads and glutes for the upper body activate your lats by bringing your armpits down towards your hips then after you unrack the bar squeeze the bar hard and think about twisting your hands outwards as if you're trying to bend the bar into a u shape towards your feet and lastly take a deep breath into your stomach and Brace your core as if you just coughed really hard by creating this whole body tension before you press you'll be able to then transfer energy just like a bow and arrow so the last B may not be what you're expeced I want to highlight a recent 2023 meta analysis which is basically a massive study of studies the researchers tried to see if doing free weights like the bench press led to more growth compared to using machines like the Smith machine they found no significant differences another 2023 study found the exact same thing so if you apply all the fixes I mentioned in this video yet you're still having trouble with the bench press then your body honestly just may not be well suited to bench press but unless you're competitive power you shouldn't feel like you have to bench you can still make just as good of games with chest machines or even dumbbells where your joints can move a lot more freely and you can also consider playing with the range of motion if you draw a line between the two handles when using dumbbells you'd be surprised with just how deep you actually have to go in order to mimic touching your chest during the bench press so if going all the way down when benching is what aggravates your shoulder or you just don't yet have the mobility for that stop an inch or Too Short just don't be stubborn if your body is telling you it doesn't like the way that something feels then you need to listen to it however that said regardless of what exercise you choose to do or not do you always need to make sure that you're using the proper form poor technique is the single biggest reason why many people end up hurting themselves in the gym or just don't see very good results from their workouts and for

    "title": "STOP Doing Bicep Curls Like This (5 Mistakes Slowing Your Gains)",
    "published_at": "2022-10-09T16:36:07Z",
    "transcript": "biceps training is not complicated although there are tons of different exercises they pretty much all boil down to one movement curls hold the weight Flex the arm simple right not really there's five common mistakes almost everyone makes fix these and your curls will instantly become far more effective at growing your biceps mistake number one you might have already noticed that as you curl a weight up it gets harder and harder and becomes the most difficult Midway when your elbow is at 90 degrees after this point it actually gets easier and your body can sense this and it finds ways for you to cheat through this difficult bottom half of the movement without you even realizing one way it does that is by initiating each rep with a slight swing I'm sure we've all seen guys in the gym who take this to the extreme but even just a slight swing at this bottom position can make the exercise much easier and enable you to use heavier weights the problem with that however is although you're able to use heavier weight it doesn't result in more tension to your bicep that additional load goes straight to your lower back which is now helping you get the weight up by using momentum in fact next time you're in the gym try doing a standard set of curls with your regular form then stand with your back against the wall to prevent your body from swinging at all if you had to drop the weight considerably then it means that you've likely been incorporating too much momentum into your regular curls although I wouldn't recommend doing all your curls against the wall you'll see far better biceps growth and reduce your risk of injury if you simply lighten the weight and minimize the amount of Swing you use especially towards the end of your set when the Reps start to get really tough for the next mistake I want you to take a look at two really interesting studies one study published just last year had subjects perform the preacher curl but under two different conditions one group performed only the bottom half of the curl and the other group performed only the top half of the curl using a weight that matched their strength level in each position the biceps of each subjects were measured at three points after five weeks here's what happened the group that formed only the bottom half experienced roughly 2.6 times more biceps growth when average across the measurement sites however what's interesting is that most of this growth occurred at the third measurement site located towards the bottom of the biceps now what makes this really interesting is that another study also published just last year replicated an almost identical design not on the biceps but this time on the leg muscles they had subjects perform the bottom versus the top half of leg extensions and one more group who did the full range of motion they measured the growth of the Quad muscles at four different sites after 12 weeks here's what they found for the measurement site closest to the top of the quads growth was similar across the groups however as you got further and further down the quads growth became significantly greater for the group who only performed the bottom half of the leg extension even greater than the group who performed full range of motion groups so what does this all mean well I wouldn't recommend doing only partial rest from now on but it does seem that the bottom part of an exercise when the muscle is fully stretched provides a powerful stimulus for growth especially in the distal regions of a muscle like the bottom part of your biceps so whenever you do your curls avoid cutting the range of motion short at the bottom position instead extend your arm fully by flexing your triceps at that bottom position before you go into your next rep to ensure your biceps get fully stretched I remember for the longest time whenever I would do curls I'd end up feeling it way more on my forearms than in my biceps in some cases I'd even have to stop my sets not because my biceps failed but because my forearms just couldn't handle holding the weight any longer the reason for this had to do with my wrist position the function of the inside forearm muscles is to flex the wrist many people in the curl they subconsciously Flex their wrist when trying to get the weight up this can lead to the forearms working harder than they have to be and eventually lead to fatigue and cramping instead next time you do a curl first bend your wrist back so that it's aligned with your forearm and then keep it that way as you curl when done properly you'll notice your forearms are now far less involved and your biceps are activating a lot more than they used to next let's talk about the elbows the primary function of the biceps is to flex the elbow but whenever you curl with a weight that's too heavy for your biceps to lift your front delts will start to help out by swinging your elbow forward now some argue that this elbow forward movement called shoulder flexion is actually beneficial to do when you curl because it's one of the functions of the biceps this is true but it's only a secondary function of the biceps the front delts are far better at performing this movement and in fact a biomechanics expert coach casim tested this and found that along with the elbows to success will be sway forward are in the curl led to less biceps activation and more front Delta activation the opposite of what you'd want so instead keep your elbow locked and focus on the primary function of the biceps flexing the arm a little bit of elbow movement is perfectly fine and hard to avoid but anything more than what's shown here will likely lead to more of your front delts taken over instead of your biceps so if you take a look at my form now you'll notice I've corrected all the mistakes I've previously went through but there's something else not visible to the eye that could potentially slow your gains to explain this let's refer to a 2018 paper that some bikiniers might remember from some of my past videos within it researchers had one group of subjects perform the biceps curl while really focusing on squeezing the biceps and feeling the muscle work the other group was instructed to Simply lift the weight after eight weeks of this the group that focused on feeling their biceps working experienced almost double the biceps gains now although proper form will help you maximally activate your biceps already some of you even with proper form may have a hard time actually feeling your biceps if that's the case then try the soap with your arms by your side flex your biceps as hard as you can then bring your arm up in front of your face and again Flex hard you should feel a very strong biceps contraction when your arm is in that position almost to the point where your biceps are cramping you don't want to do curls in that position but you can do this to actually feel what a strong biceps contraction is like and then when you go into your curls here's some additional tips first rather than thinking about simply lifting the weight up think about pulling the bar or dumbbell into your body and as you curl the weight out focus on driving your pinkies up towards the ceiling as if you are trying to rotate your hands outwards this emphasizes another function of the biceps supination which can help you get an even stronger contraction to get the most out of every single rep if you want to speed up your results then there's some important that you're aware of all the little details when it comes to your exercise form not just for your biceps but for all of your muscles for step by step science-based program that takes care of all the guesswork for you just head over to builtwithscience.com and take my analysis quiz to find the best program for you and your body it's worked for countless others and it will work for you I'd also highly suggest that you give this video a watch next for some

    "title": "How Often Should You Train Each Muscle To Maximize Growth?",
    "published_at": "2018-08-29T15:36:13Z",
    "transcript": "one of the most hotly debated topics within the fitness industry is training frequency more specifically how often you should train each muscle group per week on one end of the spectrum you have those who advocate a training frequency of just one time per week whereas others favor a higher frequency approach for example a 2013 survey of 127 competitive body builders found that 69 percent of respondents trained each muscle group once per week while the remaining 31 percent trained muscles twice or more weekly so while it's evident that you will see results regardless of what training frequency you use the question now though is what's optimal and to figure that out we need to look at the research luckily researcher Brad Schoenfeld recently published a 2016 meta-analysis on this exact topic they collected ten different studies and compared training each muscle one time per week versus training each muscle with higher frequencies of two or three times per week and analyzed the effect it had on muscle growth the result is shown here every single study showed a benefit to training with higher frequencies in fact training each muscle two or three times per week resulted in 3.1 percent greater muscle growth than training each muscle just once per week since total work of volume exercises and rest times were equated for all the studies included in this analysis it's very likely that the difference in training frequency is indeed what caused that extra three point one percent muscle growth which just to put this three point one percent number in perspective could result in roughly an extra pound of muscle gain for a beginner after their first year of training which may not sound like a lot but definitely would be a noticeable difference so based on this we know at the very least that training each muscle a minimum of two days a week is needed to maximize muscle growth as for whether or not frequencies higher than this would be beneficial it's relatively unclear at the moment however it does seem as if more may not be better for example this recent 2017 paper compared training each muscle two days per week versus four days per week with weekly volume being equated between groups the researchers found that after just six weeks the two times per week training frequency group experienced greater upper body gains than the four times per week group therefore indicating that sticking to training each muscle group around two times per week is probably your best bet I was for the reasoning behind this it likely has to do with something called muscle protein synthesis which is essentially the process your muscle goes through after a workout in order to build additional muscle mass and based on the literature we know that after a resistance training workout protein synthesis remains elevated for roughly 36 to 48 hours in most individuals so if you were to train each muscle group just one time per week you can see how you wouldn't be optimizing the protein synthesis response by not stimulating the growth process as frequently as you could be throughout the week whereas if you were to train each muscle group too frequently you would be interfering with a recovery process so if I stick in to training each muscle group two to three times per week for example you're able to maximize the protein synthesis response throughout the week while avoiding any interference with recovery given that your volume per session is not excessive but even with this theory and as with many things within this field there are also a lot of unknowns that research is yet to iron out for instance this very recent 2018 study by gentle and colleagues actually found that when trained subjects who were previously using a two times per week muscle training frequency for at least four months switched over to a one time per week bro split protocol they actually saw significantly greater muscle growth over ten weeks when compared to another group that simply stayed with the two times per week muscle training frequency throughout the study to be honest this wasn't the best design study and is yet to be replicated but nonetheless it does provide the notion that for well-trained lifters at least switching it up every now and then might provide a beneficial response and is something to keep in mind and possibly experiment with however for most of you I think it's best to stick with the following recommendations since they're based on a solid amount of research we know that training their muscle group two to three times a week is superior to one times per week and we know that training at frequencies greater than this doesn't seem to provide an added benefit unless you're aiming to improve a specific lift for example therefore for the majority you'd ideally want to use a workout split that accomplishes a two or three times per week training frequency while enabling you to get in the adequate volume of 10 Plus weekly sets per muscle group as discussed in my interview with the researcher Brad Schoenfeld and you can do so with a variety of workout splits but here's a three day four day five day and six day split that are all good options to do so but with all of that being said it's total weekly volume and adherence to your routine that are the more important factors when it comes to long-term progress so if you find that a one-time from week training split or something other than what was discussed is more enjoyable for you and it's something you'll be more consistent with then that's what I'd stick with but overall for the majority is sticking to the recommendations outlined earlier would likely be the best approach thanks for watching everyone I hope you enjoyed the video I just

    "title": "Intermittent Fasting: How to Best Use it for Fat Loss (5 Things You Need to Know)",
    "published_at": "2018-12-09T17:06:38Z",
    "transcript": "at first glance intermittent fasting seems pretty counterintuitive when it comes to improving body composition the idea of skipping breakfast consuming zero calories for several hours on end and then feasting within a designated time period goes against much of what's typically believed to be optimal for fat loss and muscle retention however the truth is when done properly intermittent fasting can be a great tool to help you lose fat faster and for good all without sacrificing tons of muscle mass in the process and in this video i'll show you exactly how to do so by taking a look at the following points but before we get into that it's important that you first understand that intermittent fasting is by no means anything magical when it comes to fat loss in fact the largest systematic review covering 40 studies on the topic found that when calories are equated although intermittent fasting may provide various physiological and psychological health benefits it does not provide any direct benefit for increased fat loss or muscle gain when compared to traditional dieting simply meaning that at the end of the day the calorie deficit is what ultimately produces fat loss when fasting rather than the act of fasting itself however the great thing about fasting and why i personally implement it for fat loss and recommend that you at least try it is that it makes sticking to your calorie deficit much easier to do not only does research show that it suppresses your appetite better than traditional dieting but by ingesting all of your calories within a shorter time period you're able to incorporate larger more satisfying meals that help you stay full despite being in a calorie deficit therefore likely leading to better adherence and more fat loss for you in the long run so with that being said let's start with how long you should fast for although there's several different types of fasting if your main goal is to draw body fat while minimizing muscle loss i'd recommend sticking to the 16 8 protocol popularized by martin burkhand this simply involves fasting for 16 hours and then eating within an 8 hour feeding window for example only eating between 12 to 8 pm and fasting outside of these hours it's as simple as skipping breakfast but if you struggle with this you can gradually build up to 16 hours of fasting over time and or gradually increase the number of days you fast for per week the time of day of your fasting and feeding windows are of little significance the key though is to be consistent with when they take place because it's emphasized in this 2009 paper on circadian rhythms this will best enable your body to adapt by suppressing your hunger hormone during the time of your fast it does often take around two to three weeks for your body to adapt but trust me it will become much easier over time also worth noting is that at least in rats research shows that females may have slightly more adverse reactions to fasting than men meaning that it's a good idea for females to start with a 14 10 protocol for example and then build up to the 16-8 over time when you feel you're ready now as for what exactly to consume during your fasting and feeding windows it's actually quite simple during the fasting period you don't ingest any calories or anything that spikes your insulin i would however suggest drinking a lot of water as well as black coffee green tea and or sparkling water while staying busy in order to help suppress your appetite during this time as for calorie-free natural and artificial sweeteners a 2010 literature review found that most calorie-free sweeteners don't have an appreciable effect on insulin and are therefore fine to have during your fasting period if you enjoy in your coffee or tea for example as for your feeding window the actual foods you should be eating are no different than the foods you should be eating with any fat loss diet a good rule of thumb is to stick to eighty percent of your foods coming from whole unprocessed sources with the remaining twenty percent being foods considered not as healthy so to speak a good example of this with various meal ideas is my science-based diet for fat loss video which i'll link in the description box down below now for exactly how much to eat during your feeding window as i mentioned before there's no strong evidence that intermittent fasting will help you lose fat without also being in a calorie deficit therefore i'd suggest taking the advice from this 2014 paper by eric helms and colleagues and simply multiplying your body weight in pounds by 13. this will provide you with roughly the amount of calories you need to ingest daily in order to be in a calorie deficit such that you're able to lose around a pound a week and in addition to this your protein intake will also be vital to maintain your muscle mass as you lean down so amunet intake roughly 0.73 to 1 gram of protein per pound of body weight would be ideal and in agreement with the literature so for example a pound individual utilizing intermittent fasting should place a priority on hitting these two main goals during their feeding window as for the optimal number of meals to eat during your feeding window i think the best and most convenient option is to stick with three protein rich meals this not only enables you to have larger more satisfying meals as your dieting but is shown in this 2010 paper by lady and colleagues that compared ingesting three large meals versus six smaller meals throughout the day three meals seems to be the better option for hunger control although this will likely vary individually in addition contrary to popular belief as shown in this paper from the journal of nutrition when compared to eating more frequently a lower meal frequency doesn't cause a reduction in your metabolism as it's your total calorie content and composition of your meals that governs this rather than the actual frequency at which you eat do note however that research indicates that there may be a slight advantage to spacing out protein over four meals rather than three in terms of maximizing protein synthesis meaning that if your main goal is instead to build muscle fasting may actually be sub-optimal for this reason but this is likely of little significance if you're still consuming adequate protein with your three meals which is the more crucial factor regardless though experiment with it and stick to a meal frequency that best suits your lifestyle now as for when to train although there are various potential benefits to facet training and various benefits to training in a fed state the best option for you will ultimately depend on your schedule and also what enables you to perform the best in your workout but in either case there are a few things to keep in mind in the event that you have to wait train fasted in the morning as shown in this 2014 paper from helms and colleagues this is where the timing of your post-workout meal becomes of greater importance in order to minimize any potential muscle breakdown meaning that you want to time your first meal such that you're able to ingest it shortly after your workout and it should ideally be rich in protein and carbs but if you're unable to do this based on your schedule and feeding window a good alternative is to simply ingest essential amino acids during your workout and or a whey protein shake afterwards although this will technically spike your insulin and break your fast you still get the benefit of pushing your calories later on in the day which is ultimately what makes fasting such a powerful tool for fat loss whereas in the event that you train within your feeding window for example after work you'd want to time it such that you're able to get in a meal or two with adequate protein and carbs before your workout and have a meal sometime post-workout as well although the timing now is not as important as it was with fasted training but again experiment with it and see what works best for you and what you'll be most consistent with so to conclude the video here are the main points just again keep in mind that fasting is nothing magical in terms of fat loss but for many it does make sticking to a calorie deficit that much easier to do which is why it can be such a powerful tool for fat loss

    "title": "How I Built Muscle FAST (5 Science-Based Tips)",
    "published_at": "2023-05-21T13:00:20Z",
    "transcript": "is it possible to build muscle fast it took me years to gain some size and eventually my gain stopped alog together instead of hopping on this I recently implemented a handful of new research back techniques and managed to gain a mean 20 lb in 16 months and there's five things I did number one has to do with my training there's a really exciting new area of research called stretch mediated hypertrophy this is something I've covered in depth in the past video but basically some muscles seem to grow faster from exercises that challenge them the most when they're in a stretch position this has now been shown with the biceps triceps quads and hamstrings and to be honest it seems like it will be true for most or even all of our muscles to take advantage of this there's two things I did first exercise selection let's take the biceps for example a recent 2022 study compared two exercises preacher curls and incline curls preacher curls are most difficult right around here when the biceps are almost fully stretched whereas incline curls based on the incline angle used in the study are most difficult a little bit higher up when the biceps are almost fully contracted after 9 weeks of testing the two the preacher curl led to around 150% more growth other recent studies on the biceps have found similar results but there seems to be a similar effect with the triceps too one study had subjects do overhead extensions with one arm and your normal triceps push down with the other arm likely because of the greater stretch on the triceps the overhead exercise led to significantly more growth so to apply this in my weekly routine I made sure I was doing at least one exercise that really challenged each muscle in a stretch position and aside from the ones I just shared with you I also did behind the body curls for biceps behind the body cable lateral raises for shoulders seated leg curls for hamstrings and Bulgarian split squats for glutes but there's one more thing I did to focus on the stretch position even more and honestly I think this is what really made the difference so I've always been obsessed with Progressive overload and just lifting more weight and doing more reps every workout while important it's easy to get carried away you start lifting heavier but it comes at the expense of form you don't go quite as deep or you start using just a bit more momentum these little compensations decrease the challenge you put on your muscles in that stretch position so although I was lifting heavier over time I wasn't actually seeing very good results so I decided to First lighten the weight on almost all my movements by about 10 to 20% I then tried to go as deep as I could with good form and for some exercises like presses and squats I even added a half-second pause at the bottom although I wasn't lifting this heavy my muscles were challenged so much more especially during that deep stretch and they responded extremely well to this your goal isn't to lift as much weight as possible it's to use that weight to challenge your muscles as much as possible knowing that will completely change the way you train and save you from a lot of injury down the road now even if you do all the best exercises and use the right form form if you're not applying this next step you're not going to grow it wasn't until I fixed this that I realized how much it was holding me back so in order to maximize growth you need to get close enough to failure during each of your sets research suggests that at least within three reps of failure is the threshold the more experience to get the more important this becomes now even though I was aware of this I'll be honest after I built up a decent amount of muscle I just got comfortable I wasn't training as hard as I could have been and was just going through the motions it wasn't until I started really pushing myself close enough to True failure that I started really seeing my growth take off and let me tell you it's very easy to think you're pushing hard enough when in reality you still have more to get a recent meta analysis released just last year found that in weightlifting studies subjects would on average stop their sets almost 10 reps before they reached failure and even well-trained lifters have been shown to underestimate their Max effort by around 1 to two reps on average believe me the difference between stopping a set three plus reps short of failure compared to pushing through to just one to two reps short of failure is a whole other level of pain this won't be comfortable and it never gets easier but there are a few things I did that help first I changed my mindset towards the pain I simply view it as a sensation and I now link that feeling of pain with growth so now it's almost like my brain is looking forward to and seeking that pain because I know it's going to result in future growth and second I always take at least a few seconds to just close my eyes and mentally prepare myself in the next set it's so easy to let your mind get distracted when you're working out and start scrolling through social media but to push to the levels required to truly force your muscles to grow you need to get locked in and that happens before you've even started your set and lastly there's no way you're going to be able to do a crazy amount of volume every your workout once you start training with this level of effort that's why it's essential that you implement Point number three recovery so your workouts are what provide the stimulus for your muscles to grow but the actual growth happens when they're resting and recovering thing is most people think that recovery only has to do with your rest days but the most important part of managing your recovery actually has to do with your workout program you see for years I would always train at least six and sometimes even s days a week when I was younger I could do this no problem but over time especially after applying the last tip it just became too much I stopped looking forward to my workouts I had low energy and my muscles just didn't recover very well so I cut down my workouts to just five per week I recently cut it down even more to just four slightly longer workouts per week with the occasional accessory date almost instantly after making the switch I felt much better day today and a lot more energized going into my workouts and I definitely noticed my muscles recovered and grew a lot better as a result don't get me wrong you still need to train hard and you still need to do enough weekly volume to grow research suggests at least 8 to 10 sets per muscle per week but more isn't always better and what someone else can recover from might end up being too much for you keep in mind that your workouts aren't the only stress your body has to recover from your work your life and your relationships can all be added stressors and your body and mind just may not have the recovery capacity to commit to 5 plus days a week in the gym so don't force it and listen to the signs your body has giving you all right so far we've talked a lot about training but all that training wouldn't have done much if I didn't modify my diet you see to maximize growth research suggests you probably need to be eating in a calorie Surplus also commonly referred to as a bulk but just like with workout volume more calories isn't always better one study compared the effects of a fast bulk versus a slow bulk both groups were in a calorie Surplus but the fast group ate on average about 600 calories more than the slow Group after 10 weeks the fast group gained more than twice as much weight about five times as much fat and only a tiny bit more muscle than the slow Group which actually didn't reach statistical significance so what I did was a lean bulk this is when you purposefully overfeed your body with just a bit more calories than it needs typically around 10 to 15% above your maintenance calories for me this started at about 2900 calories and ended up at a little bit over 3,000 calories by the end of the bul and if you need some help figuring out the right amount of lean bulk calories for you you can check out my calculator over at builtwith size.com calulator however even with a lean bulk you probably will gain some fat the 20 lbs I gained definitely was not all muscle and this can be tough to accept it's hard seeing your abs and muscle definition slowly fade away especially during summertime and in my case it was really hard mentally especially with all the pressure to constantly be shredded for YouTube and social media in the past I'd always go back to dieting whenever I saw just a bit of fat gain and so I never really progress this time I decided to stick through it and I'm telling you it paid off tremendously so shift your mindset and think of it as a long-term investment you have plenty of Summers to get shredded in the future and your body is only going to look even better with more muscle on your frame so tip number five was probably the hardest thing to implement you see a fat loss is a relatively fast process you can easily lose one to two lounds of pure fat per week but in comparison once you pass the beginner stage of training it can take several months to gain even just one L pound of muscle I mean I gained 20 lbs but not all of that was muscle and it took me almost a year and a half to do but don't let this discourage you the small games you make week to week will overtime amount to Big noticeable changes our built with science members here are a perfect example of this and show what's possible if you trust the process I mean you can see the incredible difference that adding even just 10 to 15 PBS of muscle to your body can make so be patient don't try to rush it and if you want a stepbystep training and nutrition plan that takes care of all the guess work for you just head to buildwi science.com and take take our quiz to find the best science back plan for you and your body give this video watch next to learn more about the muscle stretch research I covered earlier and how to use

    "transcript": "the soreness you feel a day or two after a workout is something you're all probably familiar with this feeling known as delayed onset muscle soreness or Dom's is thought to be caused by microscopic tears in your muscle fibers that occur from resistance training or just a novel stimulus in general and aside from just being generally uncomfortable particularly with leg soreness too much soreness can also negatively impact your training if it carries over into your next workouts studies show that training a muscle while it's still sore can reduce the activation of the desired muscle reduce the force capacity of the muscle by up to 50% and negatively interfere with a recovery process therefore it's vital that you take the necessary steps in order to minimize post workout soreness and speed up the muscle recovery process and although two common suggestions are to take ice baths or stretch after your workout this actually isn't the best advice to take although ice baths may slightly help with muscle soreness they've also been shown to hinder muscle growth and strength by interfering with a muscle recovery process and as for static stretching multiple studies from the Journal of Sports Medicine have indicated that it actually doesn't help with muscle soreness and may interfere with the recovery process as well therefore both of these wouldn't be the ideal solution for those who want to prioritize muscle growth and strength so what exactly can you do well aside from the general recommendations of been taking adequate protein and getting enough sleep there's a few extra steps you can take which is exactly what I'll cover in this video self myofascial release most commonly done in the form of foam rolling has become increasingly popular in recent years aside from its positive effect on improving mobility it seems to also be an effective way of reducing muscle soreness and although research is still lacking of the four available studies that have directly analysed the effect of formal and on muscle soreness three of them showed a positive effect on reducing muscle soreness and enhancing muscle recovery and this reduction in muscle soreness seemed to enhance the workout performance of the subjects in their next workouts so how exactly can you apply this well I'd suggest foam rolling after your workout for around 10 minutes or so and stick the muscles you work that day especially the ones that tend to experience the most soreness you can also do the foam roll in a few hours after your workout if that's more convenient for you as for how to properly for morale I'll save that topic for another video for now just focus on not going over a muscle too quickly and for really tight areas keep the pressure on it until you feel it release and if you're looking to purchase a foam roller I'll leave a few links to some of my personal suggestions in the description box down below another thing you can do to reduce muscle soreness is incorporate active recovery which includes cooldowns low intensity exercise and so on again not many studies have looked into this but the few studies that have found that active recovery either performed immediately after a workout or within the days following the workout reduced muscle soreness more than when no active recovery was used so in order to implement this I suggest performing 5 to 10 minutes of active recovery or cool down after your workout especially for leg workouts this can be done after your formal and if you're going to do that as well but the most important part when it comes to active recovery is to use a low intensity exercise that involves the muscles you worked for example low intensity cycling would be ideal after a leg day whereas something like rowing or swimming would be ideal after an upper body day or arm day now although there's several supplements out there that claim to enhance muscle recovery and reduce muscle soreness the truth is research is relatively inconclusive when it comes to this however the research behind Omega threes is promising now only have Omega 3 has been recently shown to improve anabolic signaling which may improve muscle repair and growth but multiple other studies have shown that supplementation of around 1 to 3 grams per day of Omega 3s significantly reduces muscle soreness following resistance training exercise so taking a few high quality Omega 3 fish oil pills daily and increasing your fish intake can be another viable way of reducing muscle soreness and improving overall recovery and as for other supplements ingesting caffeine prior to your workout has been and two recent studies to significantly reduce post-workout muscle soreness however the catch is that both studies used a dosage of around 400 milligrams of caffeine which is the equivalent of around four cups of coffee simply meaning that's just not feasible for someone to implement this protocol on a daily basis but with that being said some other supplements that have for the most part shown a positive effect on muscle soreness and may be of interest to some of you our taurine l-citrulline and l-glutamine as I've mentioned in my other muscle soreness video using your way into a program is the one thing you can do that will have the biggest effect on reducing your muscle soreness if you're a beginner or D trained or just starting a new exercise routine the best thing for you to do is to take a few weeks to ease into your program meaning that you should work at volumes and intensities that are lower than you normally would in order to prevent excessive soreness from occurring so to some of the video in order to minimize muscle soreness and enhance muscle recovery foam well after your workout for 10 minutes or so with a focus on the muscles you work that day perform active recovery after your foam rolling as well or the day after your workout again with a focus being on the muscles that you worked increase your omega-3 intake to roughly 1 to 3 grams per day from high-quality sources and finally ease into your program by gradually building up the volume and intensity of your workouts that's pretty much it for the video guys thank you so much for watching I hope you enjoyed it and found it useful as always I've posted a written summary of this video on my website built with science comm so for those interested in reading it I'll leave a link to it in the description box down below I'd also really appreciate it if you guys gave me a follow on Instagram and Facebook as well where I try to post a lot of informative content on a more regular basis so I'll leave links to both of those in the description box down below as well and I'm currently trying to plan my videos for the next couple months so let me know in the comments what kind of content you'd like to see going forward I'm definitely gonna cover some science-based nutrition videos for muscle growth and fat loss but let me know if there's anything else you think the majority of you would find interesting I think maybe so doing a science-based bodyweight workout series would be pretty interesting but let me know if that's something you guys would find useful anyways as always surety support for this video by giving it a like leaving a comment down below and subscribe to my channel if you

    "title": "How Many Sets Do You Really Need to Build Muscle?",
    "published_at": "2023-10-22T13:00:30Z",
    "transcript": "how many sets do you really need to build muscle some say just one set taken to all o failure is best whereas others preach high volume doing four to five sets per exercise and taking over 3 hours to complete a single workout who's right and more importantly how many sets should you do especially as a natural well the answer might surprise you and is probably a lot less than you're currently doing the first major analysis on how the number of sets you do affects muscle growth was done in 2017 led by researcher Brad shenfeld they compared 1 to 5 5 to9 and 10 plus sets per muscle per week so for example six weekly sets for the chest could be three sets of bench and three sets of flies now what they discovered is a dose response relationship between muscle growth and the number of sets per form with 10 plus sets per muscle per week resulting in the most growth after this met analysis was published pretty much all of us Fitness nerds were under the impression that more volume was better almost instantly I bumped pumped out the number of sets on all my exercises unfortunately it didn't end up skyrocketing my gains the way I hoped it would it wasn't until more research came out that I realized the mistake I made you see while this analysis did suggest that more was better it didn't let us know just how far we could push it while still continuing to see better gains fortunately 6 years later a new group of researchers decided to perform a similar analysis this time they compared lower volumes of less than 12 sets moderate volumes of 12 to 20 sets and high volumes of more than 20 sets per muscle per week they also standardize the data by only looking at sets performed within 6 to 20 reps the result well although moderate and high volumes led to more growth compared to low volumes in almost all the muscles measured there were no significant differences between the two the one exception was the triceps which responded better to higher volumes but we'll talk more about what this means later on but overall this analysis suggests there may be some kind of upper limit we to much much volume doesn't lead to more growth and in some cases might even hinder growth because of recovery issues The Sweet Spot seems to be somewhere within the range of 10 to 20 sets per muscle per week but this is still a very wide range 20 sets is double the time and work compared to 10 sets to find where exactly within this range is best for you there's five other factors you need to consider the first of which is your individual response so the studies we covered earlier while they do provide us with great insight they look at averages to see what the best General recommendation is but in the case of volume it seems to be highly individual illustrating this is a 2019 study from the Journal of sports science where they had 19 participants train one leg with 6 to9 sets per week and their other leg with 15 sets per week after 8 weeks roughly a third of the participants had a leg that responded better from low volume a third had a leg which responded better from high volumes and a third had a similar response in both legs suggesting that what one person can recover well and grow from may end up being too much for someone else now later in this video I'll show you guys how to determine if what you're currently doing is too much or too little for you but one thing that will play a big role in that is exercise execution Max UC a 22-year-old natural bodybuilder experienced this firsthand it was probably 30 30 to 40 sets per muscle group per week for example you know a chest day I was doing every chest movement I could think of you know upper chest flies incline bench press flat bench press all these sets were sloppy and you know my I wasn't actually taking the muscles to failure know I tell myself all right 30 reps of bicep curls and I'll stop once I hit 30 and then my last 15 I was I was just swinging up and down it was a mess I mean eventually I got to a point where months down the line I just wasn't seeing any progress in terms of you know my lips weren't going up I wasn't putting on any muscle so now I'm doing anywhere from 7 to 12 sets per week per muscle group as as opposed to you know 30 plus I've definitely seen the most growth I've ever seen in terms of you know raining quote unquote a lower volume than normal and you know the the thing that really helped me do that is you know training very close to failure because when you're training very close to failure uh your muscles just won't need that many sets but you know when that set gets hard you need to maintain good form if your form is breaking down to where you know you're using momentum and your reps are getting super sloppy then you know you're not taking your muscles to failure so the last thing I did when it comes to you know lowering my volume that really helped was taking longer rest periods because obviously you know when you're training very hard and very intensely your muscles just need to require more rest I think when you maintain proper technique and you take your muscles to failure then hair that with a lower volume approach you're you're doing everything that you need to do without going overboard and creating all of this fatigue and creating all this muscle damage that needs to be recovered from this allign with my own experience as well actually push yourself close to failure on all your sets while maintaining good form and you'll get way more out of less but Max also mentioned he ended up taking longer rest periods between a sets which is another factor that will affect how much volume you need to grow if you take shorter rest between sets such as less than 2 minutes research suggests you'll need to do more sets to get the same amount of growth as you would from taking longer rest and unfortunately the research I covered earlier that helped us come up with that 10 to 20 set range use studies where the rest periods different some studies use shorter rests whereas other studies use longer rests so if you usually take longer rest periods I personally recommend at least 2 minutes between most of your sets it's likely that the lower end of this 10 to 20 range will be best whereas the higher end of this range would likely be necessary if you mostly use shorter rest periods but this also depends on the next Factor how you cter sets so remember how in the meta analysis we covered earlier none of the muscles responded better to really high volume voles except for the triceps well it's important to consider how they counted their SCS generally researchers still count muscles that are indirectly worked with an exercise as one full set for that muscle so for example during the bench press they'll count that as one set for the chest and also one set for the triceps now whether or not this should truly count as one set for the secondary muscle is Up For Debate but it does affect the volume recommendations for example even though the study showed that triceps responded really well to 20 plus sets per week if you look at the average person's workout routine this would only be about six direct sets for triceps if you also counted all the pressing movements they're already doing now the front side and rear delts as well as the biceps probably fall under this category as well unless you want to prioritize them they don't need quite as many direct sets because of how often they're indirectly worked this also applies for Regions within a muscle the chest for example doesn't need 10 sets each for the upper middle and lower portions rather the chest in general would require around 10 weekly sets and you'd ideally split those sets up by using exercises that emphasize the different regions and I also think this discrepancy in how people count their sets is why high-intensity training where you usually do just one step per exercise can work and has worked for many people you see in the research we covered subjects would stop each set once they reach failure or close enough to it but Dorian Yates six time Mr Olympia who is popularized high-intensity training describes his set as one all out set extended Beyond failure with Force reps rest pause reps or dropsite reps a set is properly finished only when additional movement is utterly impossible so as you can imagine one set performed in this fashion can very likely be the same time under tension and stimulus that two to three normal sets would provide lastly and probably most importantly not everyone should be doing what's optimal although somewhere within the 10 to 20 weekly set range is probably what will maximize growth you'd be surprised with just how little volume you need to still get really great results 10 sets doesn't give you double the growth as five sets each additional set you do only gets you marginally better gains and if we look back at the 2017 man analysis we covered earlier even though 10 or more weekly sets led to the most growth 5 to 9 weekly sets still gave about 80% of the max growth so for example for chest this could be as little as three sets of bench and three sets of flies every week which could pretty much cut your workout times in half in fact in some cases even in trained individuals just three sets per muscle per week has been shown to build some muscle so if you're having trouble just being consistent in the first place don't chase optimal do what you can and realize you can still get great results with far less than you think and at the end of the video I am going to provide you guys with a free minimalist and optimal workout routine you can use with all the science and the sets they can care of for you but first we need to discuss how exactly to start applying all the research we've covered first off I'd recommend starting off at the low end of the 10 to 20 weekly set range especially if you're a beginner you don't want to do higher volumes than your body can currently handle 10 weekly sets for chest for example could look like this if you trained all your muscles twice a week which is generally how I would recommend splitting your volume up now even if you're past the beginner stage dial in your form make sure you're pushing hard enough take longer rest periods and it's very likely you'll start seeing better results despite doing far less than you were before but eventually as you get more experience you may reach a point where your gains have completely stalled and your body is actually ready for more volume but before you make any changes I'd recommend going through this flowchart from the muscle and strength pyramids book written by researcher Eric CS for example if you're sleeping well pushing hard with good form and eating it enough yet you're still not seeing gains then you might actually need more volume in this case add about two more weekly sets especially on muscles that are lagging behind and see how you progress otherwise you might actually be doing more than you can recover from and might need to take a break or decrease your weekly volume now since you stuck around for this long I thought I'd leave you with a gift I've created three different weekly workout plans a quick 3-day per week minimalist routine with around six sets per muscle a 4day per week routine with 10 sets per muscle to potentially maximize gains and a 5-day per week routine with around 14 sets per muscle for those who might need a little higher volume they're completely free and you can grab these routines over at buwis si.com slf freework workouts but for those who want some more help and are looking for a fully customized done for you plan just take our quiz over at builtwith science.com to discover the best program for you and your body also give this video watch next for a new science-based training technique you can apply to all your sets to potentially get almost double the muscle growth thank you so much for watching I'll see you next time"

    "title": "How to Lose Fat AND Gain Muscle At The Same Time (Step By Step)",
    "published_at": "2023-07-02T13:00:30Z",
    "transcript": "build muscle lose fat pick what well what if I want to do both at the same time known as body recomposition many people believe this is impossible or only reserved for a small percentage of people but that's not entirely true most people definitely can build muscle and lose fat at the same time in fact it happens all the time in research and not just in beginners this study found positive body recomposition in pro football players already squatting over 382 pounds and benching over 289 pounds and even some women at extreme levels of leanness preparing for a bodybuilding show have been found to gain a bit of muscle during this process so what's the secret well the major problem with trying to build muscle and lose fat at the same time is their two opposing goals to typically you need to be in a calorie deficit to lose fat but because muscle building is such an energy demanding process this usually prevents you from building muscle however the energy your muscles need to grow doesn't just have to come from your diet with the right nutrition and training plan you can actually signal your body to use its existing fat stores as energy towards building muscle and as a result build muscle and lose fat simultaneously so how do we do it well there's three steps to this starting with nutrition now the most important part of your nutrition is your calorie intake and although you want to be in a calorie deficit to stimulate fat loss it shouldn't be as aggressive as it is during a typical diet and phase as for what that sweet spot is let's take a look at this 2021 meta-analysis researchers pull together 59 fat loss studies to try to find at what point a calorie deficit becomes too low for building muscle to be possible here is the graph of the results notice how many people were able able to build muscle when the deficit was small but as soon as it surpassed a deficit of around 300 calories muscle growth came to a halt and even began to decrease as soon as the deficit grew larger than 500 calories now keep in mind this data is from subjects following standard fitness programs employed in research studies which usually aren't the most ideal programs for building muscle so with the optimized training plan I'll show you later on in this video it's very possible you'll still be able to build muscle even in a 500 calorie deficit and Beyond however based on this data if you want to maximize your odds of being able to recop it's likely that a slight deficit of around 200 to 300 calories is best and if you do want some help calculating this you can head over to billtoscience.com calculator okay so we have calories figured out but what seems to be just as important is your protein intake you see a calorie deficit reduces your rates of muscle protein synthesis so less of the protein you eat will be used as a building block for building muscle E2 little protein and your body will start to look for it elsewhere such as your existing muscle mass as for how much to eat to counteract this let's take a look at three studies each of them had subjects eat in a calorie deficit but assigned them to either a low or high daily protein intake of different amounts every single study found Superior muscle growth in the high protein group and since subjects were still in a calorie deficit they managed to lose fat at the same time now unfortunately we don't yet have a study that compares protein intakes that are both relatively High during a calorie deficit such as 0.8 versus 1.2 grams per pound of body weight however I think it's pretty safe to say that you'll be pretty much close to maximizing your growth at about 0.8 grams per pound and if you really want to be on the safe side bump it up to one gram per pound so the next step is to pair your nutrition plan with a training plan designed to force your muscles to grow and there's a few relevant studies that can help us determine what the best approach might be one of them is a study published just last year where research just took 130 subjects with at least six months trading experience and compared the effects of having them trained with heavy weights versus lighter weights while in a calorie deficit a common belief is that lighter waste for High Reps is better for fat loss whereas heavier weights for Less reps is best for building muscle but in this case both approaches resulted in a similar amount of fat loss as well as a little bit of muscle gain but this does heavily depend on one factor effort and this is honestly where I believe most of you guys are falling short you see in order to maximize growth you need to take each of your sets at least within three reps short of failure and in fact based on the new pre-print study it might be advantageous to take each set even closer to failure than this thing is most people don't train anywhere close to hard enough to reach this no you got more come on come on come on you have at least three more go and this brings me to an important point I want to make there really isn't a special body composition position training plan it's about doing the basics but doing the well polish hard enough during your sets train with enough volume work each muscle at least twice per week and most importantly stay consistent even if you're an experienced lifter fixing any one of these variables can very well be the stimulus your body needs to continue building muscle despite being in a deficit but before I cover who exactly body recomposition is best suited for there is one more variable you need to make sure you don't overlook sleep okay so the most relevant study we have regarding sleep and body recomposition was published back in 2020 researchers took untrained men and randomly assigned them to either a worker program consisting of two full body workouts per week or that same workout program plus a sleep education program designed to improve both the quantity and the quality of their sleep after 10 weeks both groups had similar increases of muscle with a trend favorite in the Sleep group when it came to Fat Loss however the Sleep group actually he ended up losing a significant amount of fat while the workout only group ended up gaining a little bit of fat other Studies have shown similar effects as well where sleep deprivation negatively affects both muscle gains and fat loss so to make sure you don't sabotage all the work you put into your nutrition and training try to get at least seven hours of sleep per night alright so now that we've covered how to recap let's discuss the most important part who body recomposition is best suited for and whether or not it's actually worth your time pursuing so first off the higher your potential for growth the more likely you'll be able to recall and there's three main groups of people who satisfy this criteria the first group are beginners who can basically touch a weight and end up growing the second group has to do with the fact that muscle regrows far easier than it took to initially grow it Lawrence one of our bill of science members is a good example of this he took some time off training and in his first two months back although his body weight didn't change very much he was able to build some muscle while losing a good amount of fat but the third group is where I think most people fall under and Nick another one of our build science members is a perfect example of this although he had been training for several years he was pretty much just going through the motions he never properly applied Progressive overload and had plenty of other areas where his training could improve I also just didn't know how to approach his nutrition after we helped optimize his plan he quickly saw results and experienced incredible body recomposition over the course of several months although his actual body weight didn't change too much he clearly built a good amount of muscle while losing a ton of fat in the process that said even if they do fall into one of these three groups there's still one more condition you should satisfy and the importance of this is highlighted in a recent 2023 case study researchers analyzed a group of professional bodybuilders during the contest prep and found that as they got leaner building muscle became far less likely and eventually muscle loss became inevitable once they surpassed a certain level of leanness it is interesting however that a few of the female subjects were still able to build a little bit of muscle and another study has actually shown similar results it suggests that body recomposition may be more likely to occur in females even when relatively but we definitely need more research but overall although the exact minimum level of body fat required to recomb isn't entirely clear yet I'd say around 15 body fat for males and at least 22 percent for females is a good minimum but now it's time for the million dollar question is body recomposition even worth your time well first off if you're someone who's pretty lean or has been trained both hard and consistently for at least six months then you're probably gonna have a hard time trying to recall secondly even if you are likely to recall you should also consider what your main goal is right now I know you want to do both but what's truly more important to you right now building muscle or losing fat for example while you might end up building a little bit of muscle during a recomp most research suggests that a surplus or lean ball book is likely Superior whereas if your main goal is to lose fat then a slightly more aggressive deficit would definitely lead to more fat loss with the possibility that you'll still be able to gain a little bit of muscle it's also likely no coincidence that no bodybuilder on the planet at least that I'm aware of natural or enhanced tries to recomp their way to muscle growth they use Balkan and cutting cycles and end up looking better year after year and perhaps just as important we as humans like to see things go in the right direction during a recomp results can be slow and your body weight doesn't really help indicate whether things are going in the right direction so you have to rely on other metrics like small differences in progress photos strengthen the gym have your clothes are fitting and tracking your waist circumference over time without proper guidance this can be a lot more difficult to navigate than a traditional bulker cut where the scale and quicker body changes can lead the way that said I do think for some people it is worth a shot and at the very least it's helpful to be mindful of when dieting in the event that your weight is stuck and you think you're not making progress but you're really just building muscle and losing fat simultaneously and as a recap here's who is best suited for here's how to execute it and here's what to expect and how long it typically lasts and if you need some help optimizing your plan then head to buildtoothscience.com and take our 30 second quiz to find the best step-by-step training and nutrition plan for you and your body I highly recommend

    "published_at": "2024-03-18T19:00:25Z",
    "transcript": "scientifically there's only four ways to speed up the painfully slow process of building muscle and no I'm not going to give you the typical gim BR advice or secret tips just four ways that are simple easy to do and proven to work okay so here's the first thing you need to do steroids just kidding don't do that but I will definitely speak about it later on now most people think that your muscles grow in the gym but that's not entirely true working out damages your muscles and gives them a reason to get biger but the actual growth happens when you're resed which is why improving your recovery is one of the easiest yet most overlooked ways to build muscle faster and there's three main areas of recovery you should focus on the first is your diet your body needs enough energy to perform well in the gem but it also needs the resources to grow bigger and stronger afterwards now you can definitely build muscle while losing weight but if you want to maximize growth the research is clear that eating enough to at least maintain your weight or even slowly gain about 1 to 3 lbs a month is what's ideal now to get a very rough idea of how many calories you'll need to eat every day to achieve that you can take your current body weight in pounds and multiply it by anywhere between 16 to 18 depending on how active you are but what you eat every day is also important the building block of your muscles is protein so you need to make sure you're eating enough of it in fact a recent met analysis by nunz and colleagues had subjects consume either a high protein diet or a low protein diet over over the course of 12 weeks the high protein group gained 1.5 lb more muscle over those 12 weeks now that may not sound like much but 1.5 lbs of additional pure muscle is huge especially if you can get that just from eating more protein and as for how much protein to aim for based on the current research I personally take my body weight in pounds and multiply it by 0.8 that number is the minimum Target I aim for every day and to easily hit that I'll eat a protein Source in every single meal Plus at least one scoop of my own brand of protein powder which gets me a whopping 29 g of protein alone that said as important as nutrition is another crucial part of your recovery is sleep if I had to choose between extra workouts or extra sleep for faster muscle growth I'd pick sleep every time one study published back in 2010 found that dieters sleeping just 5 hours per night lost 55% less fat and 60% more muscle compared to those getting 8 hours of sleep so instead of slimming down their bodies were essentially cannibalizing more muscle for energy and Sleep Quality seems to be just as important as well a recent 2020 study had two groups do the same full body workout routine and the only difference was that one of the groups also got lessons on how to sleep better after 10 weeks the Sleep group gained muscle about 30% faster so for me personally even if this means sacrificing some of my workouts or cutting out my late night TV binges I always prioritize getting at least 7 to 9 hours of quality uninterrupted sleep per night now the final way to boost your recovery has to do with your stress levels this is the one area that I personally noticed has really held me back I work a lot and as much as I love what I do being on YouTube is stressful and honestly a lot of pressure so I've noticed that when I'm super stressed out I just can't recover very well and my workouts just aren't very good now this is still a work in progress for me but I have noticed a huge benefit just from every single day prioritizing time to de-stress whether it's with video games meditation or spending time with my loved ones now while you might be recovering well you still need to work out to provide your muscles with a reason to grow but instead of just working out more a much easier way to build muscle faster is to work smarter and there's two ways of doing this the first has to do with your training technique there was a recent paper published with the goal of figuring out the best way to perform your reps to build muscle they found that to maximize muscle growth in each set you should control the weight taking around 2 to 8 seconds to perform each rep and use a full range of motion but specifically during the stretch part of each exercise so for example it's fine not to go all the way up during the dumball Press but you should go as far down as you can to fully stretch your chest and the same applies to things like squats and bicep curls but on top of this you can make even faster gains by choosing the right exercises according to a bunch of new research exercises that challenge your muscles more in their stretch position I tend to lead to more growth so far there's been studies on the quads hamstrings biceps and triceps and while we don't have the data on all the muscle groups quite yet it does seem likely that this trend would be true for most of them for example to get a better stretch on my shoulders I've been doing behind the body cable lateral raises rather than just standard dumbbell lateral raises and my side delts have blown up now here's a list of all the exercises that do a great job of really working your muscle in that stretch position and if you're un as to how to properly apply this to your own training or if you're just looking for something that takes care of all the guests work for you then you can check out our custom works over at builtwith size.com so we've covered recovery and working smarter but the third way to grow your muscles faster is with Brute Force by working harder and there's two ways of doing this first you can increase volume highlighting the effectiveness of this method is a 2017 met analysis by Dr Brad shenfeld he found there was about 30% faster growth when doing more than 10 weekly sets per muscle compared to doing only 5 to n weekly sets so for example if you're currently only doing about 10 sets or less for your chest per week then consider slowly working your way up to 16 sets per week to start forcing more growth however this only seems to work up to a certain point until it becomes counterproductive or at the very least a waste of time for example a later study published in 2022 found that once you start doing more than about 20 weekly sets for a given muscle it becomes less likely that you'll be able to further speed up your gains so what I'd recommend is start out with around 10 sets per muscle per week and see how your body responds then if certain muscles aren't growing as quickly as others you can bump up the number of sets for those muscles my chest has always been a stubborn muscle for me but it finally started growing once I reduced my volume from my other muscles and then bumped up my chest volume to about 16 to 20 sets per week but aside from just doing more volume there is one more way to force your muscles to work harder So based on a recent meta analysis stopping your sets around five reps short of failure gets you about 75% of your maximum growth potential but if you push past that every additional rep you do would get you about 5% more growth so for example when I first met my na fiance T she didn't like being in the gym for very long and doing a crazy amount of sets so I told her to train with fewer sets but take them to All Out failure or at least very close to that point to get the same results but now may be wondering what if I increase both my trainum volume and intensity surely that would lead to the most growth right well theoretically yes but it depends on how much you can recover from I've personally tried out high volume workouts plus taking most of my sets to All Out failure but after just a few weeks of this my body quickly broke down and I just couldn't recover from it so experiment with both options and see what works best for you just don't overdo it so what could possibly be more powerful than improving your recovery work fre can0 smarter and harder well it's not something I recommend but it is the fourth way of building muscle faster steroids steroids are truly the quickest and most effective way of gaining muscle one really interesting study found that individuals taking steroids and not exercising ended up gaining more muscle than those who were exercising but didn't take any steroids however they do come with plenty of health risks and side effects especially at higher doses so in my honest opinion the risks don't outweigh the benefit for most people unless you're planning to make bodybuilding and competing your professional career building muscle naturally will be slower but it is extremely rewarding and you can drastically speed up the process by using the three natural methods we talked about earlier that said remember how earlier on I mentioned the importance of working smarter while I recently collaborated with seven industry experts to find the smartest way to build muscle they'll cover some highly effective strategies that I just didn't get the chance to fully cover in this video so click here to give that video watch next and if

    "title": "The Smartest Way To Quickly Lose Fat (Mini-Cuts Explained)",
    "published_at": "2021-10-10T15:49:37Z",
    "transcript": "in six weeks i was able to go from this to this to this this was possible with something called a mini cut in this video i'll explain the science behind why they are so effective yet difficult for people to stick to how i modified my own diet and training to make it easier and what i did afterwards to maintain my results by the end of this video you'll know exactly how you can implement them to lose fat quickly and keep it off alright so let's start by breaking down what a mini cut is and how effectively it works so the typical approach to dieting is to take it slow to lose fat at a sustainable pace mini cuts are quite the opposite of this and there's two things in particular that make it different the first thing is speed which refers to the short period of time you'll be dieting for typically no more than about four to six weeks the second thing is aggression yes you might be a little bit more grumpy than usual through it but aggression in this case relates to how big of a calorie deficit you'll be on and how much weight you'll aim to lose every week typically you'd want to aim for a rate of fat loss of above 0.5 to a maximum of one percent of your body weight per week with many cuts you aim to lose around one to even 1.25 of your body weight per week so for most people this is somewhere between 1.5 to 3 pounds per week the idea with this fast yet aggressive diet is that you're able to quickly lose fat without the muscle loss and fatigue that would occur if you had extended it any longer they're most effectively used during the bulk to quickly reduce your body fat percentage before returning back to a bulk or as a way to quickly lean down before an event like a wedding notification but how effectively does it work well a recent study run by one of our researchers here at build with science alex provides some insight they took a group of resistance trained males and females and attempted to see the maximum amount of fat they could lose in just two weeks to do so the test group reduced their calorie intake by almost 40 percent while continuing to train and eating a high protein diet after the two weeks they lost a total of almost four pounds some of this weight loss was water weight but the rest of it was pure fat with virtually no muscle loss so at this point you're probably thinking this sounds great and you're eager to give this a shot but the problem with mini cuts is that they're very hard to stick to and even if you do manage to stick through it because of the changes your body experiences during the mini cut it makes it very easy to regain all the fat that you lost as soon as you're done i'm going to show you the exact diet and workout tweaks that i made to make the mini cut easier to stick to and what i did afterwards to ensure the fat that i lost stayed off so that you can do the same let's start with workouts i've broken this down into my weight training workouts and cardio since there were important tweaks that i made with both so for weights prior to the mini cut i was lifting five times a week using the five day workout split from a build science intermediate program however an aggressive calorie deficit now means that i have much less fuel to energize my workouts and support my recovery this can quickly lead to excessive fatigue and strength loss to avoid this i made a few tweaks based on the findings of a 2011 study the researchers took 70 trained males and had them lift weights three times per week for four months while tracking their gains after the four months the researchers then tested to see the minimum amount of workout volume needed for them to maintain their new gains what they found is that just one workout per week so a third of the volume they were doing previously was all that was needed now don't get me wrong i love lifting weights but implementing these findings into my routine was game changing for managing fatigue throughout my mini cup to do so i switched to a four day workout split and removed one set from every single exercise in the routine this essentially cut the total work of volume i was doing in half which was more than enough for me to maintain my gains now as for cardio prior to the mini cut i was on average taking 10 000 steps a day and doing two 20 minute hit sessions per week my approach during the mini cut was to further increase my overall activity so that i could burn more calories every day rather than have to rely solely on eating less calories to achieve my goal deficit those of you who are more sedentary will benefit a lot from doing this however i had to make sure to add in the right type of cardio cardio that was easy to recover from and something i could actually stick to throughout the six weeks despite my lower energy levels i decided to do two things first by taking more walks throughout the day and making frequent use of this under desk treadmill at my office i quite easily increased my daily step down to 15 000 steps a day on average second i replaced my two 20 minute hit sessions with something much easier to recover from light cycling for 30 minutes three to four times a week and i did this either indoor or outdoor on a road bike depending on how the weather was now my body responded really well to this routine i recovered quickly my energy levels during my workouts remained high and it was something i could fairly easily stick to every day however these workout changes would not have been nearly as effective without the specific changes i made with my diet the tweaks i made there are what enabled me to maintain my muscle strength keep my energy levels high during my workouts and keep my hunger and cravings at bay all right so now let's shift focus and talk about those dietary tweaks so at the time my body needed about 2 600 calories to maintain its weight during the mini cut i dropped this by 25 this drastic drop in calories created two problems that i had to solve first i had to find a way to save most of my energy from my weight workouts so that i didn't end up losing a ton of strength and muscle second i had to find a way to manage my hunger levels and cravings to solve problem one i was strategic and what specific foods i'd be eating less of the minimal amounts of fat that you should eat per day for your health is around 0.2 grams per pound of your body weight so to cut calories from my diet while ensuring i still had enough carbs for energy and enough protein to maintain my muscle i reduced my fat intake close to that minimum amount rather than considerably dropping my carb and protein intake in addition to this i strategically timed the ingestion of my carbs to best fuel my performance of recovery this was done by saving most of my daily carb intake for my pre-workout meal to give me energy for my workout and my post-workout meal to help with recovery the rest of my meals were relatively lower in carbs now to solve problem two hungering cravings i made simple food swaps that kept me full and enabled me to pretty much eat the same meal as i was before the menu cut but now with far less calories for example before the mini cut here's what a typical breakfast would look like in comparison here's what a typical breakfast would look like during my mini cup by swapping out some of the whole eggs for egg whites swapping the bagel with avocado for lower calorie bread instead and adding more greens i was able to save several hundreds of calories without decreasing the actual volume of food same with lunch i kept the ingredients pretty much the same but instead of using a 300 calorie tortilla i used a low calorie wrap and again with dinner i was able to drop the calorie count of this meal by over 300 calories just by swapping some of the white rice for cauliflower rice and reducing the fat content by not including eggs in the rice and by the way guys i post many of these meals on my instagram stories and grids so give me a follow there for a ton of meal ideas and to follow what i eat now in addition to these food swaps to help me resist temptations during the day and curb my cravings at night i always always made sure that i had some kind of tasty yet low calorie dessert banana nice cream apple fritters frozen yogurt just something sweet at night that i could look forward to during the day to help me keep on track many of these meals we include into our build with science programs because we know how frequently cravings can totally derail progress however although these dietary changes were key to helping me quickly and sustainably lose fat throughout the six weeks it's what i did afterwards that helped me keep that fat off and is where most people mess up so after a mini cut or any diet in phase there's two factors that cause rapid fat regain the first has to do with your metabolism as a result of weighing less and the effects of dieting my metabolism is slightly lower now than it was previously in addition to this drastically reducing my activity or cutting it out altogether after the mini cut would not only mean that i'm burning even less calories every day but there's also data to suggest and i can definitely attest to this that lower levels of activity make regulating hunger more difficult this is what causes people to unknowingly overeat after their diet is over to avoid this members of my ability science programs use our nutrition software to pinpoint exactly how their metabolism changes but for those who aren't on my programs expect that your new maintenance calories may be slightly lower by one or two hundred calories remain active by doing things you enjoy and can sustain and just keep a close eye on your body weight your weight will initially increase by a pound or two mostly from water due to the increase in food that you're eating but it should stabilize shortly after and it's an indication that you found the right balance now guys just keep in mind that mini cuts are exactly what their name implies many they are not a long-term sustainable solution it's short and aggressive for a reason as they quickly become unsustainable if continued for too long but when used properly they are effective and for those who need more guidance on exactly how to train how to eat and how to execute a sustainable plan to transform your body just head over

    "title": "How To Bench Press Without Shoulder Pain (4 Mistakes You\u2019re Probably Making)",
    "published_at": "2019-03-17T16:20:03Z",
    "transcript": "the benchpress is one of the most effective exercises for developing and strengthening the upper body primarily the chest and triceps however despite its effectiveness it's also the one exercise that lifters seem to have the most trouble with primarily due to shoulder pain during or after the movement and in many cases this is simply a result of various tweaks that need to be made in your bench pressing form in this video I'll go through exactly what those tweaks are so that you can minimize your risk of injury over time and get back to pain-free bench pressing as soon as possible the first mistake is something that most people are aware of yet tend to have trouble properly implementing whenever we're benching we want to have our shoulder blades retracted or pinched together as if you were going to pinch a pencil between those blades this both enables the head of our humerus to properly track throughout the press and it enables us to better activate the chest by minimizing the involvement of the front delts if we don't have the shoulder blades retracted what actually tends to happen is the upper arm will round forward which can irritate some other rotator cuff tissues in the front of the shoulder so what you want to do is before you press depress your upper traps by bringing your shoulders down and away from your ears and then pinch your shoulder blades together then maintain this tightness by actively squeezing your shoulder blades together as you perform the movement and avoid the mistake of opening up the shoulder blades and losing tightness at the bottom or as you push up if you struggle with this I suggest trying to so raise your hands with your thumbs pointed out like so then rotate your arms outwards while squeezing your shoulder blades together and focus on really feeling the squeeze and your rhomboids right in the middle of your back the feeling you get here is the exact feeling you want to achieve while performing the bench press so what you can do is perform that exercise immediately before setting up for the breasts and then practice maintaining this feeling what benching by using later weight and then building up towards your working weight another common bench take that can cause shoulder pain is pressing with a completely flat back although most people won't need an exaggerated arch has seen with power lifters you do want to ensure that there's some arch present in your upper back and the reason for this is similar to what we saw with retracting your shoulder blades as a slight arch in the upper back places the glenohumeral joint in an externally rotated safer position meaning that it effectively avoids putting your shoulders in a dangerous internally rotated position at the bottom of the press which commonly occurs when pressing with a completely flat back but to properly implement this while avoiding injury note that you're not simply arching your lower back what you want to do instead is arch your upper back by retracting your shoulder blades as we previously discussed and then raise your chest up towards the ceiling which will naturally create space between your back and the bench which you then want to maintain as a solid base of support for your press one of the most common mistakes people make with the bench press is touching the bar too high on their chest at the bottom position which is usually done as a result of excessively flaring the elbows out at a 90 degree angle while pressing the bar straight up and down this is detrimental because as shown in this 2016 paper that analyze shoulder pain in the bench press touching the bar too high on the chest with the elbows flare actually increases the compressive forces at the clavicle and increases the net torque placed on the shoulder and therefore it increases the likelihood of shoulder injury over time so what you want to do is instead realize that the bar path of your benchpress shouldn't it be straight up and down it should actually start above your shoulder come down to around the level of your sternum or nipple height and then curve diagonally back towards the starting point and to achieve this without harming your shoulders you need to tuck your elbows to roughly eight seventy five degree angle such that your elbows remain closer to the body and more or less directly under the bar throughout each rep this will not only lead to a safer press but a straw one as well it harder to catch a very common mistake is not properly aligning the elbows during the press meaning that the elbows are not in line with the hand and not stacked under the bar which creates unnecessary torque on both the elbow and the shoulder joint and affixes there's two things you need to do if your elbows are unaligned when viewed from the front or back and the problem is likely with your grip with for instance gripping the bar too wide as shown here will cause the forearms to be misaligned and as stated in this review paper analyzing the shoulder joint is problematic since it increases the demand placed on the rotator cuff and on the other hand gripping the bar too narrow will also cause the forearms to be misaligned that will turn it more into a triceps dominant movement thus you want to play around with your grip width until you find the width that feels best and enables your elbows to remain stacked under the bar now if your elbows are unaligned when viewed from the side then it's likely that you're over tucking your elbows too close to your sides with your press so to fix this you simply want to adjust the angle of your elbows during the Press by flaring them out a little more such that they remain relatively underneath the bar so as you can see the benchpress is a lot more technical than it may appear but videotaping yourself performing the benchpress from the side and from the back can help you visually see these small areas and correct them and it's something I'd highly recommend you do but regardless try implementing the tips I mentioned as they lead to not only a safer breast but a stronger one as well so some of the video up here are the main points to keep in mind as I always try to emphasize it's absolutely vital that you pay close attention to how you're performing each of your exercises in order to both prevent injuries over time and to progress faster and if you're looking for an all-in-one evidence-based program that's fully equipped with in-depth tutorials for each and every exercise such that you can maximize your efforts in the gym the way you can do is simply head on over to built with science comm and take the free analysis quiz I have up and order to discover what program and what approach is best for your starting point anyways

think a lot of you will find useful and as always if you enjoyed this video then please don't forget to give it a like leave a comment down below and subscribe to my channel and turn on notifications

    "title": "How to PROPERLY Squat for Growth (4 Easy Steps)",
    "published_at": "2023-02-05T14:00:19Z",
    "transcript": "squats are the king of poorly performed exercises do them wrong and instead of growing nice quads and glutes you'll feel aches and pains in your knees your hips and even your shoulders but follow these four easy steps and I guarantee your squats will feel better and grow your muscles far better than they ever have before step one setup your Anatomy will determine what your perfect squat looks like so it's important to find the right setup for you and your body before you even get under the bar let's start with your footsteps hold the light weight at your chest set your feet hip width apart and squat down see how that feels and make note of how low you should get then widen it by an inch or two and compare even the slightest modification can make a world of difference for knee and hip pain so keep going until you find what feels best and enables you to squat the lowest as for your foot angle most people's joints will feel better with their toes pointed out slightly so don't force yourself to keep them straight and The Wider The Stance you use the more your toes will have to turn out once you've found the right stance hello there it's time to grab the bar set your feet under the bar bend your knees to get under it and then place the bar on your upper back but avoid placing it too high on the little bony bump at the base of your neck it should be placed right onto the meat of your traps next grip the bar with your hands as narrow as you can without feeling pain in your wrists shoulders or elbows the narrower they are the more upper back tightness and stability you'll have when you squat but if you have really tight shoulders or chest muscles you may have to widen this once you grab the bar Walk It Out by extending your legs to lift it out of the rack and then taking three careful steps take a little step back with one foot a little step back with your second foot and then use the third step to widen or adjust your feet to your ideal squat stance lastly to keep you balanced as you squat spread your weight evenly over your foot by making sure each foot has three solid points of contact with the ground your big toe your pinky toe and your heel you're now ready for step two creating whole body tension now at this point you do not want to just squat down you need to First activate several key muscles that will protect your back and keep you strong as you squat down failure to do this is why so many people have a really strong leg press but I have a much weaker and unstable squat what start with the lower body screw your feet into the ground as if you were trying to touch your heels together then level your pelvis with the floor by tilting it back as if it was a bowl of water and you were trying to prevent it from spilling once adjusted lock this in by squeezing your inner thighs glutes and quads for the upper body avoid pointing your elbows back and losing tightness in your upper back instead pull your elbows forward under the bar and pull the bar down into your media upper traps as if you're trying to bend the bar in half this helps activate your lats and keeps your upper back stable finally take a deep 360 breath into your waist as if you're trying to expand all sides of a weight belt and then brace your core as if you just coughed really hard at this point you should feel your legs core and lats all working you're ready for step three The Descent pull yourself down into the squat using your hamstrings let your butt drop down between your heels and push your knees out in the same direction as your toes keep your upper back tight by pulling the bar down and continue lowering as deep as you comfortably can as for how deep you should go a 2019 study assigned one group of subjects to half squats and another group to deep squats twice a week for 10 weeks although both groups had similar growth in the quads the glutes and abductors grew significantly more in the Deep squat group so your goal should be to squat down to at least somewhere close to parallel if you use a narrower stance you should be able to get a little bit deeper if you use a wider stance it'll be closer to parallel but if towards the bottom of your squat your upper body falls forward or your heels come off the ground or your lower back rounds excessively into Butt Wink these are all signs that you're not yet ready to go that deep and there's two main reasons for this the most common reason is the limited ankle mobility in this case try elevating your heels onto weight plates and see if that helps the other reason is a weak core and glutes in this case you can try out a more stable exercise like Smith machine squats before progressing to the barbell but once you can get deep enough you may notice that your knees end up over your toes this is commonly believed to be harmful on the knees one study tested this by using a wooden barrier to prevent the knees from going over the toes while there was a bit less pressure on the knees when compared to letting them travel over the toes the stress on the hips and lower back significantly increased so as long as your knees don't cave in or out and instead push out in the same direction as your toes letting your knees go over your toes is perfectly fine now once you reach that bottom position do not just let gravity drop you into that last introduce research suggests this is the most important part of the movement for growth so force your muscles to work by controlling the weight down and pausing at that bottom position for half a second before moving on to step four the ascent but first just keep in mind that everyone's bodies are different to maximize growth and prevent injury it's important that you find the right exercises and the right form for your individual structure and for step-by-step plan that takes care of all the guesswork for you after this video just head on over to builtwithscience.com and take our free analysis quiz to find the best program for you and your body but for now let's move on to step four the ascent the most common mistake people make here is shooting their hips back and letting their upper body fall forward this puts a lot of pressure on the lower back we want the chest and hips to rise at the same rate to do this drive up out of the Bottom by pushing the floor away and thinking about driving your traps up against the bar keep your glutes engaged by keeping your knees in line with your toes rather than keeping them in continue pushing down against the floor and getting tall until your legs are fully extended but as you come to the top avoid letting out a big exhale instead we want to maximize the pressure in your abdomen to protect your back and you can do this by keeping your lips held tighter together as you breathe out to gradually let air out once you've let all the air out take another deep 360 breath in brace and repeat for another rep congrats my friend you have just done the perfect squat you can give this video a watch next to learn how to properly deadlift without hurting your back and I'll see you next time"

    "title": "The Only Fitness Supplements You ACTUALLY Need",
    "published_at": "2024-07-07T13:30:07Z",
    "transcript": "the supplements industry has exploded in growth reaching almost $400 billion just last year but how much of this is a scam today I'm testing the most popular supplements comparing their claims against Real scientific data I'll show you what scams to avoid and what research says you should use instead starting with one that may be controversial creatine creatine use has blown up in popularity Americans alone consume well over 4 million kg each year but many companies have been taking advantage of this Rising Trend let me explain first off I've never seen a company actually mention this but up to 30% of people naturally have high levels of creatine which is why about 1 in four don't see any performance benefits from it so if you don't notice any big body weight or strength changes after starting or even stopping Creatine you might be naturally blessed but that's only part of the story just wait until you find out the real creatine scam companies are running so back in 202 2 a group of researchers analyzed 175 of the most expensive creating supplements on Amazon shockingly they found that 88% had either very little or absolutely no evidence supporting the wild claims they were making here's an example this is a tub of creatine ethyl Esther from Walmart according to the sales copy this is an exceptionally soluble type of creatine resulting in advanced absorption increased bioavailability and increased stability did you catch all that probably not and that that's the point often supplement companies use complex terms like this to impress or even confuse buyers and make their products seem a lot better than they actually are then they bump up the price and people think it must be better without question and yep I fell for this one too I used to buy the most expensive creatin I could find thinking it would lead to better results but this one from Walmart it goes beyond just confusing words it's full of outright lies they go on to say that unlike other forms of creatine most users will notice a difference in their first dose but this isn't even how creatin works it takes at least 1 to 4 weeks to build up in your muscles but they take it even further claiming that their supplement directly penetrates the muscle resulting in 30 to 40 times more functional creatine now that is a pretty bold claim and when I dug into the research I found a 2008 study comparing this exact type of creatine with standard creatin monohydrate and guess what I found it was less effective the problem is these companies aren't legally required to conduct studies to prove any of the claims they're making and a lot of the times they aren't tested for safety either in fact in that same Amazon study only 8% of the expensive creatine supplements were tested by third party labs for quality but what's even more alarming is another study analyzed over 3,000 supplements on the market and a whopping 28% of them had hidden substances including in some cases bad substances and even even steroid precursors which are chemicals that act like steroids in the body so what does this all mean should you stop taking creating not necessarily but to avoid the scams you've got to make sure that you're picking the right kind now there is a creatine precursor called GAA which may actually be more effective than your basic form of creatin but while the research is promising it's still too early to tell if it really is superior for now research has consistently shown that just plain old creative monohydrate is not only the safest and most effective it's also the cheapest just try to get one that's been third party lab tested so you can actually be sure of what you're consuming now the good news is if you use it properly creatin monohydrate does provide a ton of benefits but the same can't be said for this next supplement on the list in fact this one may be one of the oldest scams in bodybuilding imagine this a supplement marketed as essential for boosting muscle growth and recovery but actually does the opposite well that's exactly what some resar archers found back in 1990 researchers wanted to find out how effective BCAAs or Branch chain amino acids actually were specifically they wanted to see whether bcas could enhance something called muscle protein synthesis which is basically just the process your body uses to repair and build muscle after exercise crazy thing is they found it did the opposite see amino acids are just a fancy word to describe the building blocks of protein you get them naturally from eating things like meat meat eggs dairy beans and nuts but there's 20 different types of them bcas only contain three Lucine isol leucine and veiling so what the researchers found is that providing your body with too many BCAAs might actually block other amino acids from being used potentially hurting Muscle Recovery and growth yet still to this day BCAAs are advertised as supplements to increase muscle growth and prevent muscle loss so each year people Fork out their hard earn cash to pay for what is basically just flavored water and don't get me wrong I was one of them I used to take bcas religiously but now I know there are much better ways to spend my money for better results in the gym aside from the alternative supplement I'll mention in just a second proper nutrition and expert coaching is hands down what's made the biggest difference for me but I know diets can be hard and not everyone can afford to work with the best coaches and that's exactly why my team and I have worked extremely hard to build affordable science-backed workout nutrition programs over at builtwith science.com I promise if you want to take your health and fitness to the next level you'll get so much more from our combined multi- decades worth of experience than from any supplement promising a quick fix but I know some of you might be wondering if the research on BCAAs is over 10 years old then why do top brands still sell them well that's exactly why because they sell BCAAs have been a staple in the bodybuilding Community for a long time and if a product is set selling well there's very little incentive to change it that's it here's a pro tip if you do want to supplement amino acids then eaas or essential amino acids are a much better option these include nine of the most important amino acids rather than just three and they can be especially useful for vegetarians or those who like to work out facet but here's how I see it if you eat well and you get enough protein neither BCAAs or eaas are very likely to help much which brings us to the last am to watch out for the latest supplement CRA taking over the Internet greens powder so we all know we should eat our fruits and vegetables right but what if there was an easier way well that's the idea behind green supplements there's supposedly an easy way to get your fruits and veggies in without having to chop Blend or cook anything but do they really work well to answer that question let's take a look at one of the most popular and expensive greens powders on the market athletic greens according to the ads one scoop a day can give you more energy boost your immune system and improve digestion but in reality there's been very little to know evidence suggesting that greens powders can do any of these things now I do know that athletic greens has run a study showing that participants who drank their product felt less bloating and more energetic while I applaud them for putting some funding towards research the study had no control group and the results were all from subjective survey responses basically people reported feeling better after drinking a green liquid they were told would make them feel better that's said if you take a look at their nutrition label you will find a pretty impressive list of antioxidants digestive enzymes and even superfoods sounds nice but not only is superfoods an unregulated madeup term most of these ingredients have very little to know actual research supporting their benefits and there's another deceptive trick I Noti about their label notice how they list a bunch of ingredients together with the total amount at the top this is common practice amongst most greens powders and it's a sneaky way of cutting cost and hiding the truth you see by labeling the ingredients in this way you can't actually tell how much of each ingredient is included meaning you have no way of telling if you're getting the clinically effective dose of that ingredient in order for it to actually be effective chances are you're not that's it if we shift focus and look over at their vitamins and minerals list they do actually list out how much of each you're get in and some of them actually seem quite impressive for example you get 467 of the daily recommended value of vitamin C and over 1,000% of vitamin b7s thing is both of these vitamins are water soluble consume more than your body needs and you just pee them out giving you no benefit aside from increasing the financial value of your urine so far this isn't looking too promising however one of the big selling points of greens patter like athletic greens is they're apparently more effective than a multivitamin but is this really the case well here's the vitamin and mineral breakdown of a $5 per month multivitamin I found on Amazon and here's the vitamin and mineral breakdown from athletic greens now while athletic greens does score much higher on certain vitamins it also falls short on several important ones such as calcium and magnesium the multivitamin also contains several important ingredients not found in athletic greens at all so for a lot less money a standard multivitamin gives you a more balanced mix of nutrients but I know some of you might be thinking in greent supplements are better because they're sourced from Whole Foods and while that is true research has yet to show this makes any difference and even if you extract the nutrients from Whole Foods you still lose a lot of what makes them so good for you in the first place in fact because of this as of 2018 the public health of England declared that greens powders do not count towards your five servants a day of fruits and veggies and that's part of the problem because of how greens powders are marketed many people think they can rely on these supplements instead of eating real food whereas eating enough servings of fruits and vegetables a day has tons of strong evidence showing it improves Health body composition gut health digestion longevity and pretty much everything else you can think of so while it's possible green powder May provide a small benefit for those who eat very little fruits and vegetables it's not a replacement and it's definitely a lot more pricey than a simple multivitamin that said a common complaint I hear is that it's either too expensive or too difficult to eat healthy that's exactly why I've created an easy healthy fat loss meal plan that will cost you just $5 a day and another budget friendly one but focus on building muscle and you can click here to give any one

    "published_at": "2019-04-28T16:41:19Z",
    "transcript": "[Music] let's face it building muscle is no easy feat and requires you to consistently push yourself harder and harder in the gym week after week because generally the more effort you put into your workouts the more you get out of it but there is one often overlooked aspect of training that can enable you to gain more size and strength more effectively all with less effort than you currently put him in how exactly is this possible well it's with something called d load weeks and if you've never heard of them and/or currently aren't implementing them then it's likely time that you do so so what exactly is a d load week and how can they help you well a dealer week is basically a week where you take it easier on your training by significantly decreasing your workload in order to allow your body to fully recover and come back bigger and stronger I'll provide specific details and a protocol for you to use later on in this video but for now just think of it as an easy week and the reasoning behind this is based on research of how the body deals with and recovers from the physical stress of our workouts basically we provide physical stress to our muscles during our workouts which breaks down portions of our muscle and as a result temporarily decreases our fitness like our strength for example and then as we recover by using rest days and D load weeks the body adapts and comes back bigger and stronger for the next session which is a phenomenon commonly known as super compensation but on the contrary what happens when we push too hard for too long without proper recovery in place is that we eventually burn out and experience symptoms like joint aches and pains fatigue and little motivation to Train this then often results in the plateau or even a decrease in your strength which then obviously hinders your ability to build muscle fortunately though if you've reached this point that a solution is more often than not simply taking a deal old weak and although there's not much formal research out there on how exactly dealers affect muscle growth a 2013 paper from the University of Tokyo does provide some insight the researchers took two groups of subjects and had one trained six weeks on with three weeks off versus continuously training throughout the 24 weeks surprisingly they found that both groups gained virtually the same amount of muscle by the end of the 24 weeks but as shown in the following graph the intermittent group experienced rapid growth to catch up every time they returned from their three weeks off thus hinting at the fact that if we better optimize rest or the use of one week d load weeks instead of three complete weeks off we likely be able to grow at an even faster rate by better managing recovery while maintaining our strength and size during the time off in fact two papers that analyzed the effectiveness of D loads both showed a slight increase in strength after subjects return from their easier period of training however in order to successfully reap the benefits of D load weeks you need to ensure that you're properly implemented them and how you do so will mainly depend on your training experience if you're a beginner just starting out in the gym or someone who just goes through the motions with a training and doesn't really push their body or train hard enough during their workouts then in these cases a D load week is actually less applicable since you have yet to accumulate much fatigue instead what you'll want to do is simply track your workouts and focus on getting stronger week to week while stayin at least a couple reps away from failure in order to prevent excessive fatigue then once you reach a plateau and can't seem to further progress in a certain left you can apply a similar concept as a deal owed in the next session by slightly decreasing the weight for that lift by 10% for example before retrying the weight that you were stuck on this will just help to dissipate fatigue and often enables you to come back stronger in the following workout on the other hand if you're a more experienced lifter who's consistently progressing in the gym then in this case you'll want to schedule a D load week into your routine every four to eight weeks or so depending on your age and training history or just when you recognize the need for a D load based on the symptoms I described earlier that was for what your deal old week entails will use the guidelines of multiple papers on the topic which suggests the following one you still want to go to the gym and perform your usual workouts rather than taking a week off to rest as that may negatively impact your strength when you return to during this week reducing your training volume is more important than reducing the way you live thus you should a reduce your work of volume by 50% or more which can be done by simply performing half the number of sets you usually do in your workouts and doing less reps per set the reduce the weight you lift for each of your exercises by roughly 10% this way you'll be able to effectively dissipate fatigue and enhance your recovery for the following week while preventing any strength loss and excessive muscle damage from occurring when you get back to your usual workouts now as for your nutrition and your cardio during this week it's quite simple you'll want to eat at roughly maintenance calories in order to provide your body with adequate energy and nutrients to fully recover this is true even if you're cutting and have been previously eating at a deficit and as for your cardio you'll want to avoid too much high-intensity cardio as a goal of this week is to reduce the stress placed on your body and essential nervous system instead if you're going to do some stick with light intensity activities such as walking and keep the more intense forms of cardio to a minimum and that's pretty much it although deload weeks can be boring and feel counterproductive in your pursuit of gains just trust me when I say it's absolutely vital for your long-term progression in the gym and will be the key to consistently getting bigger and stronger over time while minimizing injury so some of the video up here are the main points you want to keep in mind if you want to see the best results then this vital that you know only push yourself hard enough in the gym socially you can actually make progress but that you also implement the right recovery strategies as this is what's going to enable you to progress even faster in the long run while avoiding injury in the process and if you're looking for an all-in-one evidence-based program that does just that for you especially you can build muscle and lose fat as quickly as possible now what you can do is simply head on over to built with science calm and take my body type analysis quiz which is just going to determine what program and what approach is best for you anyways if you haven't

    "title": "What is The BEST Type of Deadlift? (CHOOSE WISELY!)",
    "published_at": "2019-02-10T16:32:11Z",
    "transcript": "[Music] the deadlift can be argued as the single best exercise for strengthening and developing the posterior chain and although the conventional deadlift is typically what pops into most people's minds when they think of the deadlift it's important to be aware that there's other variations that exist such as the sumo deadlift and the trap bar deadlift these alternatives not only slightly vary in the muscles they work and the training adaptations that they elicit but may actually be the better option for you based on your specific anthropometry history of injury and mobility restrictions but how exactly do you tell which one is best for you well let's start by briefly going over how each deadlift is performed and then dive into what the differences are between them the conventional deadlift which is the most popular option is characterized by a narrow foot stance with the hands placed just outside of the knees this causes the conventional deadlift to have a more horizontal trunk angle during the setup the sumo deadlift a popular alternative is characterized by a wider foot stance with the hands placed inside the knees at about shoulder-width apart this causes the sumo deadlift to have a more vertical trunk angle and therefore resembles more of a squat movement pattern than the other forms of the deadlift do and finally the trap bar or hex bar deadlift uses a different type of bar such that you grip the bar at your sides rather than in front of you as a result the trunk angle is slightly more vertical than the conventional deadlift but more horizontal than the sumo deadlift now these slight variations with each type of deadlift simply mean that one may be better suited for you depending on a variety of factors to figure this out let's first take a look at the differences in the muscles worked given that each of these variations are still a deadlift the main muscles worked will be quite similar primarily the several muscles that make up the posterior chain however as made evident in the literature each deadlift variation will emphasize certain muscles over others the overall hamstrings and glute activation is actually quite similar between the three variations but since sumo and trap bar deadlifts are more squat-like than the conventional deadlift they will actually emphasize the quadriceps a little more as a result and this was tested and confirmed in two emg analyses which found that these deadlift variations resulted in roughly 20 percent greater quadriceps activation when compared to the conventional deadlift on the other hand since the conventional deadlift exhibits more of a hinge pattern than the other variations do it's going to place more emphasis on your lower back muscles since they have to work harder to keep the back extended as the bar lifts off the floor in fact a biomechanical analysis by troll wiki and colleagues has shown that spinal extension demands are roughly 10 percent higher in the conventional deadlift as a result so what does this mean for you it means that one way to pick the best deadlift is by choosing which will best work your weak points for instance if your squat and or quadriceps in general are relatively weak then the trap bar or sumo deadlift may be the better option conversely if your lower back muscles are relatively weak or you just like to develop them a little more then the conventional deadlift might be the better option instead but before making your decision based on that you should first consider the lower back and mobility demands that each variation requires the conventional deadlift will generally require the greatest mobility requirements to get into the right setup position in addition it will also place the most strain on the lower back in fact the emg analysis i mentioned earlier found that the conventional deadlift elicits roughly eight percent more sheer force on the lumbar spine when compared to the sumo deadlift mainly because the starting position is more horizontal now although this isn't necessarily a bad thing it does mean that if you've had past lower back injuries or you have trouble getting into position with the conventional deadlift then the sumo deadlift would likely be the better option perhaps being the best option in this case though is a trap bar deadlift this is because the handles on the bar used for this deadlift are typically slightly higher from the floor than a normal barbell would be this slightly decreases the range of motion of the exercise and often makes it much easier for beginners or taller individuals to set up and execute properly and the fact that it enables you to grip the bar from the sides and not from the front enables the low to now be closer to your center of mass translating into less sheer force on the lumbar spine and making it easier for you to keep a neutral back throughout the lift meaning that if mobility restrictions and or past lower back injuries are a concern for you then the trap bar deadlift is likely your best bet but before making a final decision let's take a look at the last factor your training goals your training goals are also something you want to consider when determining which deadlift variation will best suit you for instance if your main goal is to build more size and overall strength then all three deadlift variations are viable options to do so do note that research shows that the conventional deadlift has a 20 to 25 percent greater range of motion than the sumo deadlift and is greater than the trap bar deadlift as well which may imply that it's better for growth given the positive association between range of motion and hypertrophy but in my opinion this fact alone wouldn't be enough to say that it's superior than the other variations for muscle size if your main goal is to improve your athleticism and to enhance your sport's performance however then in this case i'd say that the trap bar deadlifts is the best option this is because three studies have now shown that this deadlift variation involves greater force bar speed and peak power than the other variations therefore making it the ideal option for athletes who often require high velocity strength and explosive power so to conclude here are the various factors you want to consider when choosing which deadlift is best for you i do want to also say that it's perfectly fine to alternate between the variations or incorporate more than one of them into your training which for some may even be the best approach but at the same time it's also vital that you actually try out these different variations and just find which feels most comfortable for you your individual anthropometry especially your hip structure will ultimately determine which type of deadlift best suits your body and the only way to find this out is to get out there and experiment with it and that's pretty much it for this video i hope you enjoyed it i just wanted to really quickly reiterate that like with most exercises there's typically not one variation that's best for everyone instead it's vital that you choose the right variation based on your specific goals and also what best suits your body and your history of injury and if you're looking for an all-in-one evidence-based program that does exactly that such that you can see the fastest results possible but in a safe and detailed manner then simply head on over to builtwithscience.com and take my start important quiz i have up in order to discover which program and which approach is best for you and

    "title": "Why You Feel WEAKER Some Days (And How to Fix It!)",
    "published_at": "2019-02-03T16:52:23Z",
    "transcript": "[Music] we all have days where our workouts feel great where the weights feel light and you're able to lift more weight and do more reps than usual on the contrary though I think we can all relate to workout days where the weights just feel heavier than normal making it a struggle to hit the numbers that you normally do but rather than just dismissing it as a bad workout or assuming that you've lost muscle mass you need to realize that there's a few reasons that research is indicated can help explain why the work that you've been doing suddenly felt harder and by acknowledging these factors you'll be able to consistently have better workouts and therefore make better progress so without being said let's start with the first factor hydration ensuring that your body is adequately hydrated before and during your workout is essential in order to maximize your performance research has shown that decrements of physical performance including reduced motivation and increased perceived effort have been observed with dehydration as little as 2% in fact this 2001 paper from the journal strength and conditioning research illustrates the significance of this quite well the researchers took weight trade males and had them performed their one rep max of the benchpress while that were hydrated they then had subjects repeat this while in a mildly dehydrated state which caused the resulting 1 rep max to decrease by 7 kilograms then they rehydrated the subjects and they were now able to more or less perform what they could initially simply meaning that hydration plays a vital role on how well your body is able to perform and how difficult your workout feels and although the amount of water you should drink daily depends on a variety of factors for a baseline number I'd stick with the institute of medicine's recommendation of roughly a gallon of water of day for men and three quarters of a gallon for a woman more importantly though you want to intake a good portion of this before and during your workout what I personally do and recommend is simply drink a liter of water prior to your workout and another leader throughout your workout regardless of how much you've already had throughout the day as doing so will just help ensure that your body is adequately hydrated for your workout next you want to ensure that you're getting adequate sleep if you want your body to perform at its best similar to the effects of dehydration multiple studies have found that being sleep-deprived causes the body to give up when it would otherwise normally be physically capable of pushing further resulting in a decrease in the number of sets and reps you're able to perform at a training session especially with compound movements which might explain why your workout felt tougher if you've been running on little sleep but if you're unable to get the recommended seven to nine or so hours of sleep a night then you do have a couple options one option is to avoid working out after an extended wake time what I mean by this is that if you're going to be running on little sleep and waking up at 5:00 in the morning for example then research has indicated that working out in the evening when you've already been awake for over 12 hours will likely lead to decrements and performance therefore if possible you want to try to work out before your wake time extends considerably another option which you may or may not already do is to simply ingest caffeine prior to your workout which as I've explained that other videos has been proven to restore your worker performance when you're in a sleep-deprived state and next if you've had a few days where you just haven't been eating enough food especially carbs then your workouts are likely going to suffer due to the lack of glycogen in your muscles for instance a study from the journal strength and conditioning research had subjects perform the squat and a glycogen depleted State by limiting the carb intake for two days prior to testing they found that there was a significant decrease in the average total number of repetitions they could complete during the squat when compared to their normal performance obviously to prevent this you'll want to be more consistent with ingesting adequate carbs and enough food in general in order to fuel your workouts the ideal amount will depend on your goals and various other factors but if you're struggling with this I'd highly suggest heading over to my science based diet videos which will guide you through exactly how does nutrition with various examples and I'll link both those videos in the description box down below and although there are many other possible factors that can affect your workout these three typically have the biggest impact and are therefore vital you acknowledge in order to prevent them from hindering your performance doing so is going to enable you to have more good workouts and therefore speed up your overall progress it's pretty much it for this video everyone I hope you enjoyed it just do keep in mind that progress in general will always have its various ups and downs and you can't expect to make consistent progress every single day indefinitely which is why it's vital that you not only consider what I mentioned in this video but also properly manage your recovery and incorporate the right training strategies to avoid burning out and if you're looking for an all-in-one evidence-based program that shows you exactly how to do so and optimizes both your training and your nutrition so that you can progress as quickly as possible then simply head on over to built with science comm and take my start and point quiz I have up in order to discover which program and which approach is

    "title": "How Many Steps Should You Take To Lose Fat? (HIT THIS NUMBER!)",
    "published_at": "2020-04-26T16:19:40Z",
    "transcript": "walking is hands-down one of the most effective yet underrated forms of activity that you can do to burn off fat I mean just speaking from my own experience I personally tried it all for fat loss fake cardio steady-state cardio circuit training everything what I found is that by simply doing the majority of my cardio in the form of walking and just even again more steps every day was by far the easiest and most effective way for me to consistently burn more calories and lean down without leaving my body destroyed and without sparking my appetite like the other forms of cardio would do not only that though but the beauty belt walking is that it can literally be done anywhere and as you see later on in this video drastically increasing your step count can easily be done even in the comfort of your own home by just implementing a few simple tips but before we dive into that let's first attempt to answer how many steps you should be taken to lose fat in the first place and typically the number that pops into most people's heads is 10,000 steps a day as usually used as the ideal benchmark to aim for but this idea of 10,000 steps a day was actually just simply a marketing tool that was used for the sales of the first developed pedometers in Japan it actually didn't have any scientific backing behind it at that time but research now shows that actually does have some validity to it for instance in order to hit the public health recommendation of getting in 30 minutes of moderate physical activity a day it's been shown that this translates to roughly 8,000 steps a day and in terms of weight loss when we again convert activity recommendations to steps it's been shown that bumping your steps up to around 10,000 steps per day is most effective for not only losing fat but also keeping that fat off in the long term meaning that 10,000 steps a day seems to actually be a good general number to strive for in terms of overall health and long-term weight management however with that being said for fat loss the truth is that the ideal number of steps for you and what's going to enable you to drop that and stay lean ultimately depends on your diet and where your average step count is right now for example without going over it in depth and boring you the math when you crunch the numbers you'll find that an average 180 pound individual can expect to burn roughly 60 calories per thousand steps when walking at a moderate pace so if you're currently maintaining your weight with an average step count of let's say 6,000 steps a day then for every 1,000 additional steps you took per day you'd be able to bump up your calorie expenditure by around 60 calories and given that there's roughly 3,500 calories in a pound of fat if you kept your diet and everything else the same then by simply going from 6,000 steps a day to 8,000 steps a day you theoretically be able to burn off an extra pound of fat a month just by making that subtle change and going from 6,000 steps a day to 10,000 steps a day you theoretically be able to double that and burn off an extra two pounds of fat a month and research is actually in line with us for instance 1 2017 paper from a journal of nutrition randomly assigned subjects to either just a low-calorie diet or the same low-calorie diet plus brisk walking the walking consisted of a total of 3 hours have added walking per week or in other words and added 25 minutes of walking a day which would equate to roughly 2,000 to 3,000 added steps per day after 12 weeks the walking group lost around 3 pounds more fat than the non walking group which doesn't sound like much but it's such an easy thing to implement into your routine they can both kick start and considerably speed up the fat loss process for you whoever just keep in mind guys that this does go both ways because research has shown that when lean active individuals who were likely taking an excess of 10,000 steps a day we're then transitioned into a more sedentary lifestyle of below 5,000 steps a day they ended up burning roughly 700 calories less per day as a result and since the subjects did not adjust their diet for this and instead just ate as much as they were previously when they were more active they obviously began to gain significantly more weight with most of that weight being stored as fat it's simply indicating that's a number of steps that you take per day is a lot more powerful in terms of our body composition that we perceive it to be and therefore should be closely - not only kickstart and speed up the fat loss process but to also keep that fat off once we've lost it so to sum all the previous points up for you here's what I recommend if you're currently not very active at the moment and struggling to lean down then set a realistic goal number of steps you can hit every day in order to help create and maintain a calorie deficit while ensuring that you don't then compensate by simply eating more as you do so and aiming for at least 8000 or even 10,000 steps a day are honestly good targets to aim for if you're currently below that not only for increase in the calories you burn every day but also because research has shown that active individuals who burn more calories throughout the day whether it be from walking or any other exercise are able to better control their appetite and food intake due to various physiological changes that start to happen in the body once you become more active meaning that the benefits of getting 10,000 or more steps a day go beyond just calories burn and can start to affect the calories inside of the equation which can therefore speed up your fat loss process to an even greater degree now although 10,000 or even 8000 steps a day for many of you may seem daunting and out of reach especially if you're at home most of the day or just sitting at the office as you're about to see this really isn't the case and has made so much easier by simply tying it into existing habits that are already part of your daily routine for example after every one of your meals for the day so let's say breakfast lunch and dinner make it a habit to go for a 10 minute walk immediately after this alone if done for three meals a day will add on average a whopping 3,500 steps to your step count then tying it into another one of your habits which you hopefully do everyday rather than checking yourself out in the mirror is you brush your teeth walk around the house assuming that you brush your teeth twice a day for roughly two minutes at a time this alone can increase your step count by around 400 steps next keep yourself well hydrated and drink more water throughout the day I personally take more trips to the washroom than probably anyone I know and assuming it's not a bladder it's because I drink a ton of water but this also helps me get my steps in because I'm frequently having to get up off my chair to use a washroom and when I do I always make it habit to go to the furthest least convenient washroom available wherever I'm at and that may not sound like much but with for example three to five extra trips to the washroom throughout the day this can easily add up another four hundred steps or so to your step count even if you're just at home and lastly some of you may end up hating me for this but we can do is take a hallway or doorway in your home and set a rule so that every single time that you pass that hallway you immediately do 20 jumping jacks assuming that you don't forever avoid that Holloway and pass through it let's say five times a day that's easily another 200 steps if we assume an equivalent of two steps per jumping jack now if you tally all that up that's easily an additional forty five hundred steps added up to your step count and using our previous assumption of roughly 60 calories burned per thousand steps you've just managed to increase your metabolism in your daily energy expenditure by 270 calories a day which would then theoretically result in an additional half a pound of fat being burnt per week from those changes alone so yes while the goal of hitting something like 10,000 steps a day may seem intimidating and unrealistic at first it becomes a lot easier and in reach for you to hit when you apply the tips I went through I would also highly recommend that you actually purchase some kind of pedometer or use either the health app on iPhone or Google fit on Android and just get into the habit of monitoring your average steps as this will provide a ton of motivation and accountability to help you hit your goal steps and as a result of implementing all of that you'll be able to take advantage of the often underestimated power of walking and experience the many Fallows benefits that it has to offer but on that note guys just keep in mind that for the best results these additional steps you'll be taking me to be paired with a solid nutrition plan and

    "title": "What\u2019s the MOST Amount of Fat You Can Lose in a Week? (And How To Do It)",
    "published_at": "2019-08-04T14:09:15Z",
    "transcript": "when it comes to fat loss and even achieving a 6-pack most of us want results as fast as possible in our eyes the faster we can burn off our excess fat the better right well not really because what most people don't realize is there's actually an upper limit as to how much fat you can lose every week and if you try to push past this weekly limit by doing more cardio or eating even less for example then you'll now start to lose substantially more muscle instead of fat do this for months on end which many people unfortunately do and you'll eventually end up with a skinny fat physique with too little muscle and still too much fat so now the real question becomes what's the most amount of fat you can lose per week while minimizing muscle loss in the process as this is going to better enable you to attain the lean muscular physique you're after instead of just winding up skinny fat and to answer this question we'll use the findings of a 2005 paper by researcher dr. Alpert who analyzed several fat loss studies in an attempt to quantify the maximum amount of fat one can lose per day without excessive muscle loss what he found is that the body is capable of burning body fat to use for energy at a maximum rate of 31 calories per pound of body fat per day once you exceed this rate the body then has to tap into your muscle mass in order to make up for its energy needs and although the study is theoretical and does have its limitations when you crank out the numbers they actually align well with both past research on the topic and with my own experience as a coach as well but to put this theory into perspective for you let's use an example let's say John weighs 200 pounds and is that 20% body fat multiply these two numbers and we can determine that John has 40 pounds of body fat multiply this by the maximum rate I mentioned earlier of 31 calories per pound of body fat and we get 1240 calories this represents the maximum daily calorie deficit John should employ every day to maximize fat loss while minimizing muscle loss and to find out what this would equate to in terms of pounds of fat loss per week we can multiply this number by sin to represent a wheat and then divided by 3,500 since we know that this is roughly what one pound of fat is equivalent to and as you can see we end up with two point five pounds which represents the theoretical maximum amount of fat John could lose per week while minimizing muscle loss whereas on the contrary if you're a leaner individual like Jimi here who weighs 170 pounds and is that 15 percent body fat then in this case he'd only be carrying around 26 pounds of fat and therefore his theoretical maximum rate a weekly fat loss would be just one point six pounds per week so as you can see as you get leaner the maximum amount of fat your body is able to lose per week reduces which is something that other papers have found to be true as well so now that we've covered what the maximum rate of fat loss is per week how can you now go put this into practice well if you're truly seeking to lose fat as fast as humanly possible then here's what you do first find out what the maximum daily calorie deficit and weekly fat loss number would be for you using the process I outlined earlier and then to achieve this daily deficit you would use a combination of eating below your tdee or maintenance calories performing regular resistance training and throwing an additional cardio and then you simply monitor your body weight throughout the weeks and try to hit your target maximum weekly fat loss number then as you progress and your body fat continues to decrease you'd want to slow down your rate of fat loss to minimize muscle loss by again recalculating what your maximum weekly fat loss number would be at your new weight and your new body fat percentage so over time the rate at which you lose weight should slow down and basically that's all there is to it but with all that being said I do want to provide some precautions first of all keep in mind that this protocol is a very aggressive approach that employs a fairly large calorie deficit high activity and a fast rate of weight loss for some for more experience this may be completely doable but for most people especially those just starting out with their fat loss journey it's just unrealistic and very difficult to adhere to and you'd be much better taking a longer less aggressive approach that you'd be more likely to stick with second of all as researcher dr. Alpert points out even if you under this 31 calorie per pound limit I outlined earlier it doesn't mean that you won't lose muscle mass it simply represents a threshold value pass which the rate of muscle loss starts become exponentially large so if you truly seek in to maintain as much muscle mass as possible or even build muscle while losing fat then again a less aggressive deficit will be best but all in all if you get motivated by seeing results fast and can adhere to a tough protocol that by all means go for it otherwise taking a slow and steady approach and making positive long-lasting changes to your lifestyle is what I personally recommend is that's more often than not what's going to deliver you the best results in the long term I hope you all enjoyed the video but just remember guys that fat loss is often a long journey and the last thing you want to do is just rush into it aim lessly and sacrifice all your hard-earned muscle as a result that's exactly why I would thin my bill with science programs I'll show you exactly step by step how to train how much to eat and what to eat such that you can lose fat as fast as your specific body is capable of without sacrificing your muscle in the process to join a day simply head on over to built with science comm and take the starting point analysis quiz which will determine what program is best for you anyways I hope you enjoyed this one please don't forget to support me by giving the video a like even a comment down below as to what you'd like to see me cover next so it's grabbing to the channel and turning on notifications from my channel as well as this all really does helping out thank you so much everyone for you continue this report I really do appreciate it I'll see you next time you [Music]"

    "title": "Light Weights vs Heavy Weights for Muscle Growth",
    "published_at": "2018-01-21T15:13:21Z",
    "transcript": "anybody want to be a bodybuilder but don't nobody want to lift no heavy ass wait conventional wisdom has us convinced that high reps and light weights builds muscle endurance and makes little contribution to gains in muscle mass heavier weights in the low to moderate rep range on the other hand has long been accepted as the best way to maximize muscle growth in fact many of you are probably familiar with simplified charts like these showing that moderate to heavy loads leads to greater hypertrophy and strength whereas lighter loads leads to more muscular endurance with less contribution to hypertrophy so based on this it may seem that heavier loads is the way to go in terms of hypertrophy but to determine whether this is a valid perspective or not in this video we'll cover the research behind the use of heavy weights versus light weights and which is more optimal in terms of muscle growth so let's start by quickly covering the research behind it which is pretty clear cut a lot of the initial findings regarding this topic was done by stuart phillips and his colleagues in their 2012 study they gathered 18 male subjects to train their legs on the leg extension machine three times a week for 10 weeks with one group using 30 of their one rep max for thirty to forty reps and the other group using eighty percent of their one rep max for ten to twelve reps the result as seen in this graph quadriceps muscle growth was nearly identical in both the lightweight and heavyweight groups but although this was a novel finding at the time it attracted a lot of criticism most notably because it used untrained beginners as subjects who often grow no matter what they do so in response phillips and his team performed a similar study in 2016 but this time using 49 men with an average of four years lifting experience and a similar protocol as a previous study but this time using a whole body resistance training program but surprisingly once again the results showed that low did not dictate hypertrophy meaning that both light weights and heavy weights elicited equal amounts of muscle growth in addition both protocols led to similar increases in type 1 and type 2 fiber growth which are typically believed to be low dependent after this study several studies and a large meta-analysis have been done on the topic with all concluding the same result light weights and heavy weights lead to similar muscle growth when volume is equated for and sets are taken close to failure so based on this it might seem as if lifting light weights is equally as beneficial as heavy weights however there's a couple things to consider one when looking at strength this meta-analysis of eight relevant studies comparing heavy versus light weights show that the use of heavy weights tends to be better in terms of strength gains which in the long run i think would lead to better hypertrophy when compared to lighter weights and two keep in mind that these studies involve the use of pushing to near failure regardless of the weight used and training to failure in a higher rep range is a lot more uncomfortable than doing so with lower reps and heavier weight due to the increased metabolic stress in fact some of the subjects performing the lightweight protocols even ended up throwing up after high rep sets it it could happen i threw up many times while i was working out but it doesn't matter because it's all worth it so again in the long run unless you have arnold's mindset it's not really a viable option given that it's just generally unenjoyable to train to failure with higher reps especially on compound movements i know you might be a little confused now as to what to do with these findings so let's take a look at how you can apply this to your workout in order to maximize muscle growth two of the main mechanisms of muscle growth are mechanical tension and metabolic stress these two mechanisms are basically in a constant tug of war during your workout meaning more of one generally means less of the other when you lift heavier weights you induce more mechanical tension when you lift lighter weights but for more reps you can cause more metabolic stress this is probably why lighter weights and heavier weights leads to equivalent muscle growth when equated for volume since they each target separate mechanisms but leads to the same outcome of muscle growth so in order to maximize muscle growth it may be beneficial to target both mechanisms in your workout since heavy loads are more beneficial for strength gains and mechanical tension and are easier to take close to failure increasing strength on your heavy compound movements should be the foundation of your long-term training but in addition as stated by hypertrophy expert and researcher brad schoenfeld it is likely that exercise centered on achieving a pump via higher rep sets with low weights and short rest also provides a potent hypertrophic stimulus that is synergistic to heavy compound lifting therefore you should also consider utilizing higher reps with lower weights in your accessory movements after your heavier sets on compound movements are done as this will enable you to take advantage of the multiple pathways involved with muscle hypertrophy some ways to achieve this are through the use of drop sets reverse pyramid training or also including a couple sets of 25 to 40 reps to near failure towards the end of your workout but let's take a look at a more in-depth example of how you can apply this to your workout for example let's say you're doing the following chest workout the first two compound movements should utilize heavy weight in the moderate rep range and a focus should be placed on getting stronger with these movements this will cover the mechanical tension mechanism of muscle growth in this workout and then to cover the metabolic stress mechanism of muscle growth in this workout you can add a few drop sets into your last set of flat dumbbell press and you can also utilize a higher rep range with low weight and go to near failure on the accessory movements but keep in mind that there are several ways to incorporate both mechanisms of muscle growth this is just an easy to follow example for you guys to apply what's going on guys thank you so much for watching i hope you found the video

    "title": "How To STOP Cardio From Killing Your Gains (3 WORST Mistakes You\u2019re Making)",
    "published_at": "2019-06-23T15:59:38Z",
    "transcript": "when done properly cardio can be an excellent way to improve your health speed up fat loss and can even help you build muscle and recover faster but on the contrary when done improperly it does the opposite and negatively interferes with the gains you make in the gym in fact a 2012 meta-analysis illustrations point exactly and found that improperly combining cardio and lifting on average impairs muscle growth by roughly 31% and strength gains by 18% which is obviously detrimental to your quest for gains so the big question now is how exactly can you reap the various benefits of cardio without impairing your gains in the process and in this video that's exactly what I cover by going through four of the biggest gain killing mistakes that people make with their cardio routines one of the most common mistakes is doing cardio at the wrong time now for most people the most convenient time for them to do cardio is when they're already in the gym for a weights workout however when doing so it's best that you perform your cardio workout after your weights workout rather than before this is because when doing cardio before your weights you'll be more fatigued during your lifting exercises and your strength will likely suffer as a result in fact a 2016 paper found that subjects that did a 20-minute cardio session prior to their weights workout performed significantly less reps on their lifting exercises as a result which is an agreement with multiple other papers on the topic there for prioritizing your weights workout by moving your cardio to after your workout would be ideal for both strength and muscle gains an even better option though particularly if the cardio session you'll be doing is of moderate to high intensity and/or longer than 30 minutes or so is to perform your cardio and workout sessions completely separately supporting this idea is a 2017 paper from the journal sports science medicine which found that in untrained lifters performing a 30-minute moderate intensity cycling session 24 hours after a biceps workout as opposed to immediately after the workout it led to almost a two-fold increase in biceps growth which is theorized to be due to systemic factors actually interfering with muscle hypertrophy when cardio is performed after a muscle damaging workout now although the study does have its limitations and likely would not apply for shorter and or less intense forms of steady-state cardio other research is an agreement that when possible you should separate your lifting and cardio sessions by at least 6 hours apart in order to minimize any possible interference effects and build muscle faster when most people think of cardio they usually think of running but this may in fact be the worst option if your main goal is to build muscle and strength this is because running and other high-impact modalities like jump rope jumping jacks and high-intensity interval training Sprint's all have a significant eccentric component to them and as a result causes a lot of lower body muscle damage that you'll then need to recover from which can negatively affect your performance during your weights workouts especially your leg workouts for example [Music] whereas lower impact types of cardio don't require nearly as much recovery and therefore don't cause this issue in fact the meta-analysis I mentioned earlier found that performance cycling concurrently with weights led to significantly less of a decrease in lower body growth when compared to running therefore to minimize cardio's interference with your gains you'll ideally want the majority of your cardio to be done with lower impact modalities that have a minimal eccentric component to them such as cycling the elliptical and inclined walking for example and when you do choose to include more intense or high-impact forms of cardio - just be wary of the recovery that they'll require you wouldn't want to do a sporadic 30-minute intense battle rope session the day before shoulder workout for example as that would likely negatively affect your strength within that shoulders workout the last mistake people often make is just doing too much cardio in general this is detrimental mainly due to the principle specificity meaning that if your goal is to maximize muscle growth and strength then your focus and your priority needs to be on your weights workouts rather than cardio in fact we can see from a concurrent training meta-analysis of 21 studies that the more days per week you incorporate cardio and the longer the duration of your cardio sessions the more it interferes with your ability to build muscle and strength the researchers found that once your cardio sessions exceed three or more times per week and 20 to 30 minutes in duration is when they really start to slow down your gains now although I would not suggest necessarily using that as the upper limit of cardio you should be doing it does nonetheless provide a general guideline to follow and more importantly illustrates that doing too much too frequently will negatively affect your gains as a result one thing to realize though is that in almost all scenarios and the previous graphs gains were still made it's just that they were slowed down when additional cardio was added meaning that if your main goal is to drop fat while maintaining your muscle then exceeding the prior recommendations is perfectly fine and is something I'll even do when I'm cutting on the other hand if your main goal right now is to pack on muscle and build strength then you can see how too much cardio quickly becomes counterproductive now I don't want you to be completely scared away from performing any cardio after seeing this video but I do want you to realize that it does interfere with your gains when done improperly but by performing it at the right time it's taking the mostly low impact cardio and not overdoing it with volume and intensity then you shouldn't have to worry about it negatively affecting your gains and for an all-in-one step-by-step program that shows you exactly how to properly optimize your cardio and your weights routine especially you can build muscle and lose fat as efficiently as possible and simply head on over to built with science comm and take my starting point analysis quiz in order to discover what program approach is best for you anyways if you enjoyed this video then please don't forget to give it a like leave a comment down below as to what topic you like to see me cover next subscribe to the channel and turn on notifications for the channel as well as this all it truly does help me out thank you so much everyone I hope you enjoyed this one and I'll see you next time [Music]"

    "title": "How Many Calories Should You Eat To Lose Fat? (GET THIS RIGHT!)",
    "published_at": "2021-01-03T18:21:01Z",
    "transcript": "the fact that you've decided to click this video tells me that you know the importance of calories when it comes to dieting and lose fat regardless of how clean your diet may be and you likely also understand that in order for fat loss to occur you need to be eating the right amount of calories to force your body to start burning the stored fat that you have for energy now this sounds simple in theory but in practice people often screw this up and they screw it up by either eating too many calories to see any noticeable change or they'll eat too few calories and end up burning their hard-earned muscle off for energy instead of fat in today's video i'll clear up the confusion for you and show you how to pinpoint exactly how many calories your specific body needs a day in order to maximize your fat loss while minimizing muscle loss and any other negative effects the first step is to get a general estimate of the amount of calories you should be eating to start experiencing fat loss which we can then refine later on now to get this estimate there's an overwhelming number of different equations and calculators out there for us to choose from but keep in mind that even with the most accurate of the equations out there like the cash mercardo method for instance they are all estimates and are not going to be 100 accurate methods for pinpointing exactly what your calorie intake should be to lose fat instead they all require some fine tuning based on how you progress which is what we're gonna do in step two so for now just to avoid over complicating things what i'd recommend is to instead use a very simple calculation that for most people is going to put them into a calorie deficit and is a good starting point for us to then refine all you do is you take your body weight in pounds and you multiply that by anywhere from 10 to 13. if you're a younger leaner and or more active individual then go with the higher end of this range if you're an older less lean and or less active individual then go with the lower end of this range this will then give you a good estimate of the number of calories that you should start eating that per day in order to lose weight the next step is to determine what an appropriate rate of weight loss would be based on your specific body this is important for us to get right because if we eat too few calories and lose weight too quickly not only is this unsustainable for most of us in the long run but it also puts us at a greater risk for muscle loss and we want to avoid that from happening not only because it will take away from our physiques once we do lose a bunch of weight but also because of what happens after we diet for example recent 2020 research found that muscle osmotin is associated with an increased appetite and increased weight regained after the diet is over leading subjects to end up in a worse position than they were before they started their diets meaning that for the best chances of both short-term and long-term success maintaining your muscle mass as you die down needs to be a priority and we can do this by using an appropriate rate of weight loss and a good general guideline to stick to is one recommended by the work of dr hams and colleagues which is to aim for a rate of weight loss of no more than 0.5 to 1 of your body weight per week however taking this guideline one step further we know based on past research that the more body fat that you have to lose the faster you can lose fat without risking muscle loss which is why we see a range with dr helmsl's recommendation so what you can do to refine and personalize this guideline a little bit more is to use a simple calculation developed by greg knuckles which is to take your current estimated body fat percentage and divide that by 20. the number you get will be a more accurate percentage rate of weight loss that you'll want to aim for per week and it's going to enable you to maximize fat loss with minimal or no muscle loss so for example if you're currently at 20 body fat you can safely lose around one percent of your body weight per week for 190 pound individual this would equate to a rate of weight loss of roughly two pounds per week but in another case for a 180 pound individual at 15 body fat using the body fat percentage divided by 20 calculation they could safely lose around 0.75 percent of their body weight per week which is a slower rate of weight loss of around 1.5 pounds per week so just take a look at this body fat chart estimate your current body fat and use this simple calculation to determine what the appropriate rate of weight loss would be for you once you have this number down it's time to implement it and fine tune it with step three where you want to start adhering to and monitoring your daily calorie intake as well as tracking your morning body weight we're going to use this data to fine tune your calorie intake so it's no longer a rough estimation of what we should be eating that to lose fat but instead much more accurate and fine-tuned to you specifically to do so after about four weeks of tracking analyze the data week one we can often dismiss since most people will lose quite a bit of water weight during this initial period of dieting but in the following weeks we want to look a little bit more closely at the numbers more specifically how has your weight changed relative to your calorie intake for instance let's say steve at 15 body fat 160 pounds has a goal rate of weight loss of about one pound per week and is eating at 2 000 calories a day to try to achieve that but after implementing this from weeks two to four he found that his actual weight loss was slower than his target as he only lost on average about half a pound per week this is good but indicates that his estimated calorie intake was just a little bit too high so to adjust only if he felt he could do so he would simply drop his calories by another 10 or so to hit his target rate of weight loss a little bit more accurately on the other hand if steve was losing weight too quickly so for example two plus pounds per week then he'd actually want to do the opposite and increases calories slightly just to slow this down to minimize the risk of muscle loss and that's basically all there is to it you put your original estimate into practice and then fine-tune this number based on how your weight progresses throughout the weeks but also take into consideration how sustainable the calorie deficit you're adhering to is science aside if your recommended rate of weight loss is two pounds per week yet you just personally find this pretty difficult and too aggressive of a deficit then slow it down it's not a race stick with a rate of weight loss that's sustainable for you as that's ultimately what's most important for long-term success now with that being said there's one all too common mistake that people make with these three steps that you'll want to avoid which is attempting to eat back the calories that they burn from their workouts or from exercise in general and this is problematic for a couple reasons the first reason is because fitness trackers cardio machines and even us as humans are terrible at estimating the calories we burn through exercise and we almost always overestimate it by at least 20 percent in a typical weights workout for example you actually don't burn very many calories at all illustrating this is a 2019 paper which found that after a full body resistance training workout male subjects on average burned an additional 160 calories during the workout and females burn about half that at about 80 calories plus an additional yet insignificant 8 calories burned from that afterburn effect which is much at all and becomes problematic because after grueling leg day for example oftentimes we'll have a cheat meal or just eat everything in sight thinking that we'll easily offset it from the calories that we burn during the big workout which just isn't true cardio is a little bit better at burning calories but still people overestimate the calories that burn here just as bad and secondly the three-step method that i previously went through it already takes into account and averages your activity levels therefore the calories that you burn from physical activity and throughout the day are already accounted for and if you do end up losing weight too quickly because of your additional exercise then you would just adjust this by eating more as we discussed earlier so just keep it simple the only times when this would potentially apply is if you're an athlete and have a big sports event competition or two a day training session coming up where you would burn considerably more calories than you normally would in this case it would be advised and recommended to bump up your intake for that day mainly with carbs just to fuel your performance so to wrap everything up for you here is a step-by-step example of how you could start applying this right away first determine what your estimated calorie intake should be to lose fat based on the simple equation outlined in step one then determine what your optimal rate of weight loss should be based on the simple equation outlined in step two and finally implement this while monitoring how your weight progresses throughout the weeks and if needed adjust your calorie intake so that your actual rate of weight loss is closer to your target and that's pretty much all there is to it this does however assume that you're tracking accurately in the first place and being consistent with your activity levels so don't overlook those other variables as well as they are just as important and for a step-by-step program that shows you

    "title": "STOP Doing Dumbbell Press Like This (5 Mistakes Slowing Your Chest Gains)",
    "published_at": "2022-07-17T17:01:59Z",
    "transcript": "the dumbbell bench press is arguably the most effective choice for building your chest that said if you don't do it correctly rather than work in your chest you'll end up working more of your other muscles like the front of your shoulders and your triceps there's five mistakes that cause this to happen they're easy to fix but will make a massive difference in your chest curl let's start with mistake number one the first mistake has to do with your arm path typically people use a very wide arm path and press the dumbbells straight up and down this is so common because pressing with this form actually makes the movement feel easier and will enable you to use heavier weights but not only has this form been shown to have a greater risk for shoulder injury but it also just doesn't stimulate the chest very well to maximize chest activation you want your arm path to line up in the same direction that the chest fibers run a wide arm path with the elbows fled out doesn't accomplish this very well and instead lines up better with the front dels and a small muscle underneath the chest called the chical brachialis this is why many of you likely feel this movement more in the front of your shoulders rather than your chest so to align the arm path with the majority of the chest fibers you'll instead want to tuck your elbows to about a 45 to 60\u00b0 angle away from your body and allow your grip to turn in slightly with your elbows just keep in mind that when you apply this form the dumbbells will no longer move straight up and down but rather forwards on the way down towards your mid chest and then backwards on the way up towards your shoulders so once you fix your arm p path it's important that you don't then make the next mistake which has to do with your forearms I remember back in my first few years of lifting I got very strong with this exercise very quickly I take the 95 lb dumbbells and throw them around like they were nothing yeah buddy like wait but I noticed that although my arms definitely got bigger my chest just never really grew eventually I realized what I was doing wrong as the weights will get heavier I'd start bending my forearms inwards more and more without realizing it this is a compensation that very common especially among those who struggle with their chest development this is because by bending the forearms inwards you're actually shortening the lever which makes the movement Easier by taking some of the load off the chest it also gets the triceps more involved to take on some of the load as well and even the most subtle of a Bend can drastically decrease the load place on the chest in fact if we apply very basic physics to get a rough estimate if the forearms Bend such that the weights end up halfway between your shoulder and elbow you would end up reducing the load actually placed on the chest by about half although this can help you lift heavier weights you aren't getting any higher stimulus on your chest and are simply causing more strain to your joints lighten the weight keep your forearm vertical over your elbow throughout each rep and you'll feel the difference right away now even with your forearms fixed you may be guilty of making this next mistake which is the most common mistake I see given that many of us are already stuck in a hunched over posture we have the tendency to round our our shoulders forward whenever we press this is especially true for those with like in chest development because they'll often have stronger shoulders that will want to take over the movement this can lead to the front of the shoulders experiencing most of the growth rather than the chest to avoid this I'd first suggest that you open up your chest before you even do the dumble Press so that you're better able to activate it you can do this by extending your back over a foam roller and then performing over and backs and band pull parts with the band and I'll leave a link Down Below in the description box to the one I'm using here then when you actually go into the movement on the weight down I want you to think about as if you were using your back muscles to pull the weight down towards your chest by pinching your shoulder blades together and then on the way up just avoid letting your shoulders round forward and take over the movement and instead keep your chest up and think about squeezing your biceps into the sides of your chest focus on this every single rep and you'll immediately notice your chest rather than your shoulders now doing most of the work all right so we fixed the shoulders rounded forward at the top but it's important to avoid this next mistake at the top position as well the main function of the chest is horizontal eduction which is simply the act of bringing the arms together this is what makes the Dumbo press such an effective chest Builder since the arms are pulled together under low knowing this you might think that bringing your arms in as close as possible at the top would better engage the chest in fact some people even touch the dumbbells to get at the top however since we're using dumbbells the line of force is straight down because of gravity this means that once your arms are straight over your shoulders there's actually no more tension placed on the chest because there's no longer any Force pulling your arms apart going further than this doesn't stimulate the chest any further and is wasting energy that could otherwise be used towards your next reps so instead to keep constant tension on the chest stop each rep once your arms end up straight over your shoulders so the last mistake doesn't actually relate to form and instead has to do with the Ang angle of the bench the flat dumbbell press is great but most of the growth you get from this exercise will be in the middle portion of your chest which can lead to the upper and lower portions of the chest becoming underdeveloped in fact in a recent 2020 paper subjects that performed the incline bench press experience over double the growth in the upper portion of the chest when compared to subjects that only perform the flat bench press so in addition to doing just the flat dumbbell bench press I'd also recommend doing an incline dumball press once a week as well however when you do this exercise research has shown that just a very slight incline of about 15 to 30\u00b0 is optimal to Target the upper chest this is usually just one to two notches up from the bottom position of a bench for most individuals anything higher than that often causes the front delts to take over instead in fact for some of you even just a slight elevation by placing a weight plate under the end of a bench may be all you need to really Target the upper chest now as for the low lower portion of your chest for most people the flat dumbbell press will already hit this region quite well some studies however suggest that a slight decline can actually help activate this region even more effectively so in this case you can place a weight under the other end of the bench to create just a slight decline try that out see how it feels and feel free to add it to your weekly routine such that you're doing a pressing movement that buys the zeper chest a pressing movement that biases the mid chest and a pressing movement that biases the lower chest just remember that all the previous mistakes we went through appli to these dumball press variations as well now after you apply these various fixes you'll notice that you won't be able to lift nearly as much as you used to it might hurt the ego but realize that this is a good thing it means that your chest is now doing most of the work rather than your other muscle groups and you'll very quickly feel and see the difference this makes to your chest development just make sure that you don't fall back into your old habits as you try to increase the weight over time and guys it's important that you take the same detailed science-based approach to every single exercise that you do that way you can get results faster and without harming your joints for a step-by-step plan that

    "title": "Are You Making Gains? Check For This!",
    "published_at": "2021-06-20T15:30:03Z",
    "transcript": "are you making gains every week most people can't tell as a result they have no idea if what they're doing is actually working i'm going to show you four simple methods that will determine if you've put on more muscle or not one of if not the most accurate way to measure gains over time is by tracking what's known as your fat free mass so this is your body weight subtracted by how much fat you're currently carrying for this method however you will need to be able to track your body fat percentage over time and there are a couple ways to get this without having to do any fancy body fat tests the easiest way is to get yourself one of these an electronic scale now many claim that these scales aren't very accurate and while this may be the case in some circumstances accuracy is actually not what we're worried about what we are more concerned with is consistently tracking changes over time and newer scales have been shown to do just that for example your scale may read that you're at 20 body fat when in reality you're actually at 15 but if you were to lose or gain 5 then your scale would be able to accurately pick that change up which is all that we need and for those without a scale a good quality one like the one i have here it's not expensive at all in fact you can pick one up on amazon for less than 30 bucks and i'll leave the link in the description box down below to one that i'd highly recommend an alternative to this that is a little bit more cumbersome yet doesn't require scale is to estimate it based on circumference measurement formulas which have been shown to be accurate within one to three percent one of the most well known and accurate of these formulas is the u.s navy equation something that we incorporate into our build with science programs to use it for men this will require you to enter your height your weight your neck and your waist circumferences for women you need to enter the same information but also add in your hip circumference take these all relaxed without flexing and then it put these into the calculator that i've linked in the description box down below and it'll spit out a rough estimate of what your body fat percentage is based on your measurements now after you know your body fat percentage it's time to actually use it if you take your current body weight and multiply it by a body fat percentage this is going to tell you how many pounds of fat that you currently have if you take your body weight once again and subtract your fat mass that you calculated this will let you know your fat free mass tracking this number over time is a great way to see if you're actually building muscle because if you are staying consistent with how you weigh yourself then increases in factory mass are very strongly related to increases in muscle as for how fast this should be increasing as a point of reference research finds that on average participants gain about three to four pounds of fat free mass over a 12 week training program which breaks down to about one pound per month less trained individuals will obviously be able to gain more muscle at a much faster rate whereas more advanced individuals should expect to gain at a much lower rate another practical way for you to track progress is just to measure the circumference of your muscles in a 2020 study researchers measured the changes in the size of the biceps after 10 to 12 weeks of training using ultrasound or a much more practical method arm circumferences both methods did not significantly differ in tracking the percentage change in size so how can you practically apply this well the easiest way is to just pay close attention to how your clothes fit or the sleeves on your shirt tighter are your jeans fitting tighter than normal these are all good indications that you have indeed put on muscle an even better recommendation though is to actually measure and track the circumference of your bicep and your thigh over time this is going to give you good insights into the overall growth occurring in both your upper and your lower body to achieve the best measurement for the upper body flex your bicep and measure around the largest area of the muscle for the best results take three measurements and average them together for the lower body sit upright with your dominant leg propped up straight out in front of you flex your leg and take a measurement at the halfway point just like the bicep repeat this two more times and take an average you may want to also take a measurement at the largest part of your butt just to keep track of those booty gains as well as for how fast these measurements should be increasing eight to 12 weeks of training has been found to result in an approximate four to six percent increase in circumference in the arm and fat so about a two percent increase per month is what you can expect this means that someone with 15 inch arms could expect an increase of about half an inch to an inch over the course of two to three months the downside with this method though is that fat gain can actually start to complicate things which is where the next two methods can help fill in that gap by the way guys within our step-by-step programs abilityscience.com we've built in easy to use trackers that make monitoring your progress a breeze i'll talk more about these programs at the end of the video for now let's move on to method number three perhaps the most practical method is progress pictures when done properly this can help you visually see the added muscle and increase size that you've actually put on but it's not as simple as finding your closest mirror and snapping a pic whenever you think you look good ideally you'll want to take these in the morning before you've eaten anything in the same lighting conditions every single time for consistency although the post-workout pump picture can be great it's not good for comparison not if you compare one picture of yourself from early in the morning before you ate anything to another picture right after an arm workout and a few meals then you're likely going to be significantly misled our goal here is to limit as many variables as possible in addition when taking these photos try to take a few different angles flex and unflex take these every two to three weeks and assess the differences if you're newer to the gym then you'll notice significant changes pretty quickly in as little as four to six weeks and dramatic changes over time for example here's michael a bill with science member who went from 106 pounds to 130 pounds in his first eight months of training on the other hand for those who have been consistently training for over a year you should only expect to see minor differences every six to eight weeks and even then it will be quite subtle but this will add up to significant improvements over the course of several months now do note that while you are building muscle it's often inevitable that you will gain at least a small amount of fat as well as a point of reference even if your diet and training is on track weight gain typically occurs as 75 lean mass and 25 fat mass this means that if you put on five pounds of muscle it's very likely that this will be accompanied by a little over a pound of fat due to this based on pictures alone you might actually think that you're starting to look worse as you were building muscle since the added fat can hide your muscle definition and mask the added size that you're putting on in many cases you won't truly be able to visually see the added muscle that you put on until after you commit to a diet to shred off the excess fat adrian's nine month transformation from our build with science program showcases this process quite well so realize that while progress pictures may be easy and convenient compared to the other methods they can be very misleading in certain cases and there are a lot of variables that you need to control for during your first 12 weeks or so training the rapid increases in strength that you experience are mostly due to neurological changes as you get more skilled with your movements as opposed to actual muscle growth as you become more trained however the role that neurological factors play in strength decreases and the role that muscle growth plays increases so if you've been training for at least a few months and you're still getting stronger week after week or at least month over month then you can be pretty confident that you are in fact building muscle and making gains rather than relying on any one of these one methods exclusively use a combination of these different methods to provide you with an accurate indication of if you've made progress and to give you the assurance that what you're currently doing is actually working that's exactly why within our step-by-step programs we not only provide you with science-based workouts and diet plans but then show you how to ensure that you're making progress week after week whether your goal is to lose fat or build muscle to join today just head on over to buildwithscience.com take our analysis quiz and we'll show

    "title": "How Sleep Affects Your Gains (And How To Get More Of It!)",
    "published_at": "2019-04-21T15:34:08Z",
    "transcript": "if there's one aspect of building muscle and losing fat that's most underrated it's definitely sleep according to a recent poll by the National Sleep Foundation roughly 63 percent of Americans say they aren't getting sufficient sleep during the week and the impact this has on your gains is likely much worse than you think in fact sleep may be the exact reason why others seem to progress much faster than you are while you just aren't seeing the results you were hoping for and despite putting in the work the findings of a 2010 study by the American College of Physicians for example helps put this into perspective researchers split subjects into two groups one that slept eight and a half hours per night which is within the range of what most experts recommend and another group that slept only five and a half hours per night which has noted earlier is pretty common nowadays both groups were then put on a regulated calorie deficit for two weeks the result well as expected both groups lost the same amount of weight given that their calorie deficit was equated for but what's interesting is that of the weight they lost the sleep deprived group lost 60% more muscle mass and 55 percent less fat than the group that got adequate sleep therefore indicating that sleep seems to have a powerful effect on not only muscle recovery growth and retention but also fat loss now although the researchers didn't test why exactly this was the case other research does provide some insight for instance a recent 2018 paper from the Journal of science advances analyzed the effects of one night of no sleep on 15 young men after the sleepless night their muscles already showed signs of increased protein breakdown and their fat tissue on the other hand had elevated levels of proteins and metabolites that are involved in promoting fat storage which may explain the results we found in the previous study and to make matters worse it's also well known that sleep deprivation causes a decrease in anabolic hormones like testosterone in fact a 2015 paper found that day to day testosterone levels were significantly decreased by 10 to 15 percent in young men who underwent one week of sleep restriction to five hours per night add that to the fact that multiple papers have also found that being sleep-deprived negatively impacts worker performance since the body tends to give up when it would otherwise normally be physically capable of pushing further you can see just how much of an impact sleep has on your gains but just how much should you sleep in order to best support your muscle growth and fat loss efforts well although this will vary individually I suggest sticking with the American Academy of Sleep Medicine recommendation of getting roughly seven to nine hours of sleep per night with more active individuals requiring closer to the higher end or even slightly above this range so if you haven't been sleeping enough according to this I'd highly suggest that you make an effort to do so for the reasons previously discussed and although research does suggest that daytime naps may be beneficial to increase total sleep duration during periods where inadequate sleep is unavoidable they should not be used as a regular substitute for nighttime sleep since it just doesn't provide quite the same effect the next best thing you can do though which is beneficial regardless of if you can get enough sleep or not is to improve the quality of your sleep and in order to best do this there's a couple things that research suggests is optimal coming in on top is improving your sleep hygiene which a few papers have shown to be effective at reducing the time required to fall asleep and improve sleep quality some recommended strategies to implement this include avoiding any electronic use for at least 30 minutes before bed using your bedroom strictly for sleep and where the magic happens and have a consistent sleep-wake schedule every day aside from this another big thing you could do is avoid ingesting caffeine shortly before bed 1 2013 paper from the journal of clinical sleep medicine I actually found that moderate caffeine ingestion six hours before sleep reduced total sleep time at 41 minutes whereas moderate caffeine ingestion just three hours before sleep reduced total sleep time by 63 minutes meaning that for those working out later in the evening you'll probably want to avoid taking pre-workout or anything with a relatively high amount of caffeine but all-in-all the biggest takeaway from all of these studies is that nothing beats making sure your head is on your pillow for enough hours each night so although you may be getting by just fine on less and optimal sleep you're likely doing a disservice to your hard-earned gains in the gym that's pretty much it for the video I hope you enjoyed it and found it useful to sum everything up for you here are the main points you want to keep in mind it's the often overlooked factors like sleep that really are what make all the difference in terms of how fast you progress and how fast you can transform your body and if you're looking for an all-in-one evidence-based program that shows you exactly how to optimize these factors along with their training and nutrition associate you can build muscle and lose fat as quickly as possible then what you can do is simply head on over to built with science comm and take my starting point analysis quiz which will determine what program and what approach is best for you anyways as always if you haven't

    "title": "How To Get MORE Gains From Pull-Ups (4 Mistakes You Need To Fix)",
    "published_at": "2020-09-27T16:08:16Z",
    "transcript": "pull-ups are one of the oldest yet most widely used back exercises out there and for good reason they're convenient to do and very effective at growing and strengthening your mid and upper back muscles but despite how simple this exercise may seem the truth is that most lifters screw this movement up with a few common errors that take away from the effectiveness of this exercise and in this video i'm going to cover exactly what those errors are so you can instantly start experiencing better gains with this exercise the first mistake has to do with grip width most people overlook the importance of something as simple as a grip during a pull-up and fail to realize how this actually shifts the muscles that are being targeted on one end of the spectrum you have those who grip the bar way too wide with the train of thought that this is going to be more effective at hitting the lats but instead this makes pull-ups less effective for two reasons one is that it shortens the range of motion of the movement which may enable you to do more reps but can compromise growth due to the limited range of motion that your back muscles now experience each rep and second is that it puts your shoulders in a more compromised position in fact a 2016 observational study analyzed the risk of various pull-up grips and found that a wide grip pull-up due to the position that the shoulders placed in throughout the movement exhibited the highest risk of shoulder injury and impingement which can obviously be detrimental to your gains in the event that you do actually end up harming your shoulder however on the other end of the spectrum you also don't want to grip the bar too narrow what this will do is it increases the degree of pronation that your forearm experiences during the pull-up which then shifts more emphasis to the forearm muscles like the brachioradialis this can not only shift some of the tension away from your back muscles but it can also make your forearm muscles now become the limiting factor in your pull-up meaning that instead of stopping the step because your back muscles have fatigue you're forced to stop because your forearm muscles are fatigued so what you want to do instead is grip the bar not too wide and not too narrow and there does seem to be a sweet spot with this if we take a look at grip with research and lab pull down which is executed in a similar fashion as a pull-up we know that a medium grip of about 1.5 times shoulder width seems to be the best grip to not only maximize activation of the back muscles but also seems to be the grip width and which were the strongest so apply this to your pull-ups by using a grip that's slightly outside of shoulder width and you'll likely experience not only a stronger and safer pull-up but one that actually hits the muscles that you're trying to target the second mistake you're making is you're failing to properly engage your core muscles during the exercise muscle activation research on the pull-up has shown that when performed correctly your core will often be the highest activated muscle during the movement yet when most people perform their pull-ups they completely forget about their core and as a result their pull-ups will look something like this where the lower back arches the feet dangle loose and the ribs flare out now although this isn't necessarily bad it does create a great deal of instability and wasted energy during the pull-up which can negatively affect your strength in the movement so instead before you even go into your pull-ups start with your legs straight if possible and then crunch yourself into the c position by engaging your abs then from here keep your core engaged and maintain this position as you perform each rep this will not only instantly provide a ton more stability into your pull-ups but by setting your lower back into this more stable position it can also enable your lats to pull with more force because they attach into the low back so apply this tip and you'll very likely notice the resulting strength improvements right away the next mistake is losing form at the top of the pull-up most people will show pretty good form in the beginning of the pull-up but towards the end of the pull-up they'll fatigue and start compensating and usually they do so by letting the shoulders shrug up to the ears and roll forward as they struggle together above the bar this not only puts the shoulders in the compromised position but it also disengages the back muscles that we're trying to target instead we want to keep the shoulders back and externally rotated as we come up to the bar and to ensure that this happens we need to first make sure that we're starting to pull up correctly to begin with to do so before you initiate the pull first set your shoulders by pulling your shoulder blades down and back so that your shoulders move down and away from your ears this subtle movement will engage your back muscles and set up the rest of the pull-up to be back dominant and then as you're pulling simply think about pulling yourself up by leaning with your chest and trying to get your upper chest or your collarbone to the bar doing this is just going to help ensure that your shoulders remain in the proper position and that the back muscles remain engaged throughout each rep the last mistake you're making is you're simply not doing enough volume for your pull-ups most people who are stuck only able to do a few pull-ups or so or even let's just say under 10 strict pull-ups per set they attempt to improve this or compensate for this by just hammering away with more volume on lat pull-downs but research has shown that the strength correlation between these two exercises is actually very weak and that your strength on lat pull-downs are not highly related to the amount of reps that you can do with pull ups which is likely at least partly due to the difference in muscle activation patterns that we see with the two movements so instead what you want to do is you want to focus on doing more total pull up volume as this is gonna better transfer to your pulling strength and there's a variety of ways that you can achieve this even if you can't do very many pull-ups to begin with in fact a 2017 paper found that either doing five sets of pull-ups to failure five sets of pull-ups to failure with additional weight or five sets of pull-up negatives to failure over the course of 12 weeks they all led to similar pull-up improvements of about six additional reps over the course of the 12 weeks meaning that there's a variety of ways that you can improve your pull-ups and that sufficient volume and practice with the actual movement seems to be what matters most so if you're currently stuck then add in some additional sets of pull-up negatives after you fatigue yourself during your normal pull-up sets or if you can only do let's just say five or so pull-ups in a row then just perform more sets but with less reps per set ten sets of three pull-ups perform the proper form will be far more effective and will enable you to accumulate more total pull-up volume than something like three sets of five pull-ups to failure would by using this approach and by finding ways to fit in more actual pull-up volume instead of simply using alternatives you'll be able to improve your body's coordination and motor control during the pull-up and hence be able to very quickly improve your strength and the number of reps that you can perform so to sum the video up here is a quick recap of the main points first use a proper grip width of about 1.5 times shoulder width second keep your core engaged before and during the movement third don't lose form and roll your shoulders forward at the top and lastly ensure that you're doing enough pull-up volume as that is what's key to improving your strength with this movement so hopefully you were able to see that although choosing the right exercises is important executing these exercises in the right manner is really what's key to maximizing the growth that you're going to experience from them and for a step-by-step program that uses science to not only show you what to work out week after week but then shows you exactly how to perform each and every exercise for maximal activation and growth while pairing this with a nutrition plan to support your recovery and simply head on over to buildwithscience.com to determine which of our sciences programs is best for you and where your body is currently

    "title": "How to Build Muscle 2x Faster (Genius Strategy)",
    "published_at": "2024-08-04T13:30:21Z",
    "transcript": "we all know that guy who says he could do 30 pull-ups and then they look like this but what if he's on to something today I'll show you why new research suggests using bad form can help you put on muscle almost twice as fast and it's actually pretty simple it's all about the stretch taking your current training and focusing more on the stretch could take some of your lagging muscles to be a lot bigger and could take some of your currently pretty good muscles and take them to the next level that's Dr Milo Wolf the wor leading expert on this new area of research and how to use it to speed up muscle growth there seems to be something unique about training a muscle group in the stretch position there's about 10 to 12 studies and in many of these studies you see around double the growth by focusing on the stretch versus missing out on the stretch but here's the problem most people don't know how to Target the stretch properly and it's not just beginners who make this mistake often the stronger you get the easier it is to neglect it first we'll dive into how to fix this common mistake and later I'll show you some new stretch techniques that have been growing my muscles faster than anything I've tried in the past for many exercises like the bench press like the squat like the RL as well the renan deadlift if you're using more weight and therefore unable to get into that stretch position you will be limiting how much growth you see but why does more weight stop you from getting into the stretch position well it doesn't have to but just think about guys who stop half when squatting or don't touch their chest when doing the bench press assuming they have the mobility for it why why aren't they going all the way down that most commonly happens in exercise like you mentioned uh which are hardest in that stretch position right so like the bench press um the squat people typically they'll do half reps maybe 3/4 reps not going all the way down it's because the body wants to avoid the most painful part of the exercise but not going all the way down isn't the only mistake people tend to make yeah and I similarly see also with the tempo for example the bench press they'll take a few seconds at the top of each rep to kind of reset maybe rest for a little bit and then go for another R mhm but conversely they'll often be super quick in the stretch position if anything I would Ur towards the opposite I would control the load more in a lengthen position maybe even pause in a lengthen position and really try to be explosive out of that stretch position so lowering the weight to get deeper and controlling that bottom position is definitely one way to improve the stretch and get more growth from your workouts but there's more to it to get the best results you'll also want to add in two key techniques that most people have never even considered the first one is obvious choose exercises that stretch your muscles the most for example in the ble bench press you're often Limited in how much of a stretch you get on the PCS by when the barbell touches your chest if they then switched from a barbell bench press to a dumbell bench press you're able to get a bit deeper but then if you want to take the stretch even further you could do something like a deficit push-up where there is essentially no longer a restriction on when the ground touches your torso and so you can get as deep as you want for your PC and get a maximum stretch on them and probably build more muscle now before you change your whole routine there's something else you need to know there's a second way to use a stretch that's less obvious but might be even more effective let's use an example choosing an exercise for your biceps compare the preacher curl to a regular incline curl technically the incline curl stretches the biceps more than the preacher curl because the arm is positioned behind the body but there's one subtle difference incline curls are most challenging in the middle when the biceps are contracted whereas preacher curl CS are most challenging near the bottom when the biceps were more stretched this difference is thought to be the reason why in a 2023 study creature curls actually led to more growth than incline curls especially in the bottom of the biceps the main thing might be getting a decent stretch and making that stretch challenging so if I had to pick one right now like certain exercises kind of trade off one for the other I would pick resistance in the stretch position over just maximizing the stretch now aside from pature curls exercises that do a great job of challenging your muscle in the stretch include dumbbell flies for chest overhead extensions for triceps reverse cable flies for rear delts and behind the body lateral raises for shoulders but with the cable set at wrist height unfortunately there's no really good back or Cals exercise that challenges the stretch and we'll talk about the fix for this in a minute but basically anytime you try and exercise think about this if the stretch position feels really easy like you there's barely any weight there that's not going to be the best movement for hypertrophy if on the other hand the stretch position feels very difficult something like a dumbbell fly where it's really challenging in that stretch position that is going to be a better exercise in all likelihood for hypertrophy however although the research is very promising it's limited we don't yet know if all muscles benefit from this and we also don't know if the extra growth we see only happens in specific areas of a muscle but I personally become so fascinated with this area of research that I've decided to take matters into my own hands so starting in September I'll be funding and help run a unique study at the University of British Columbia to determine how much challenging your muscles in the stretch leads to growth and we're using three custom machines that by the switch of a pin can make each exercise either more difficult in the stretch or the contracted position we're also testing the shoulders glutes and chest these are three of the most understudied muscles due to the high cost of using MRI for proper measurement it's a big project to take on but it'll help shape the way we work out any exercises we choose to Max spice grow and honestly science has done so much for myself in my channel that getting involved and advaning the field is the least I can do to get back Milo and I have already plac our best on the outcome but I'll keep you guys updated and show your support by commenting four science down below but what I really want to focus on now is the counterintuitive lesson you can take away from all this stretch research how you can use bad form for faster muscle growth so remember this guy well he was actually on to something if you're doing the wrong type of half reps you're hurting your muscle building however we do have research on the opposite of that where you do half reps in the stretch position of a movement and the crawl around five studies now four Studies have found more muscle growth with half reps in the stretch position compared to a full range of motion in other words some reps that look bad might actually be good think about it when you train certain muscles like the back or calves where does it feel the hardest it's usually at the end of the movement when your muscles are fully contracted but it's really the beginning when the muscle is most stretched that seems to be most important for growth we have research for example on the calves and when we compared doing just the bottom half of the movement to doing a 4ange of motion we observed around twice the growth at both sides measured so for certain exercises which I'll list out in just a second replacing full reps with half reps has a potential to double your growth but there's another option that's also been shown to be extremely effective and it's quite simple after you can't do any more full range of motion reps keep pushing past Balor by doing as many half reps as you can in that stretch position as for what exercises benefit the most from these half rep methods it's any exercise that's hardest in the contractor position this includes pretty much all calves exercises most back exercises like lap pull downs and rows but also certain exercises like chest flies reverse flies dumbbell lateral raises and leg extensions as you can see there's various ways you can apply more stretch to your workouts but rather than trying to do it all

    "title": "Pre-Workout Supplements: How To PROPERLY Use It To Boost Performance (Avoid Side Effects!)",
    "published_at": "2018-11-11T16:52:08Z",
    "transcript": "pre-workouts are a popular go-to product when it comes to enhancing performance and giving you that extra boost you need during a tough workout it's also one of the most well researched supplements within the fitness industry with several studies backing its effectiveness in terms of increasing training volume and boosting muscular endurance while reducing your levels of perceived effort during your workout which all theoretically leads to better muscle growth in the long run however despite the growing popularity of pre-workouts there seems to be a lack of information out there regarding how exactly to use it to maximize its effectiveness while minimizing any potential side effects therefore in this video i'll discuss just that by taking a look at the following points but before we do so it's first important to understand what makes pre-workouts work in the first place and the truth is although there's a variety of common ingredients included in your typical pre-workout which each do have some evidence supporting their benefit and is something i'll likely cover in a separate video the main ingredient responsible for the majority of the positive effects of pre-workouts and the one ingredient you should be most concerned about is caffeine which is why the majority of this video will be directed towards caffeine so on that note let's start with how often you should take your pre-workout although the positive benefits and energy boost provided by pre-workouts may tempt you to take it before every single workout it's likely best that you don't this is because multiple studies have shown that habitual pre-workout intake can quickly cause you to be tolerant to the effects of caffeine meaning that the more often you take it the more you'll have to continuously increase the dose of your pre-workout in order to feel the acute benefits it provides during your workout and in fact research has found that eventually you'll even reach something called an insurmountable tolerance to caffeine which means that increasing the dose of your pre-workout will no longer enable you to overcome your tolerance to it simply meaning that when you've reached this point ingesting a pre-workout will essentially be useless aside from any placebo effect it may provide so what should you do instead well multiple studies examining the effect of pre-workouts on workout performance have actually found that it seems to provide a greater benefit for lower body workouts than upper body workouts which is likely because lower body exercises in general are just harder and require more perceived effort than upper body exercises and since pre-workouts reduce your perception of effort it gives you the extra boost needed during strenuous leg days which otherwise may not be as necessary during upper body days therefore to avoid quickly becoming tolerant to the effects of your pre-workout it would be wise to only use it during your lower body workouts where you feel you need the extra boost as doing so will help prevent the benefits of your pre-workout from diminishing throughout the weeks in addition if you've been relying on pre-workout for a while and have become noticeably tolerant to its effects then it would be wise to take at least a week or two off of any caffeine or gradually lower than increase your dose over time in order to re-sensitize your body to its acute effects now as for how much of your pre-workout to take in order to maximize its benefits this will depend mainly on two things your current body weight and your current habitual caffeine intake most of the research in support of caffeine's organic effect on performance use a dosage of roughly three to six milligrams of caffeine per kilogram of body weight and is therefore likely a good range to stay within for most people however research also indicates that the closer your habitual caffeine dose is to your pre-workout caffeine dose the less consistent the beneficial effects will become so for example if you already consume 200 milligrams of caffeine through various sources throughout the day then in taking 200 milligrams of caffeine as a pre-workout won't provide as great of an effect when compared to someone who's used to a lower daily consumption of caffeine meaning that you should first consider how much caffeine you already intake on a daily basis when figuring out the optimal dose of your pre-workout as you'll likely need a higher dose if you already consume quite a bit of caffeine regularly but regardless it's important that if you're not consuming any caffeine or anything close to six milligrams per kilogram per day or you find yourself sensitive to caffeine in general then it's wise not to triple or quadruple your caffeine consumption immediately just to hit the recommended dosage instead i'd suggest starting even below this range and building your way up as needed and decreasing the dosage if you experience any negative side effects for example one scoop of a typical pre-workout often contains around 200 milligrams or so of caffeine so initially starting out with three quarters of a scoop or even just half a scoop of your pre-workout and building your way up as needed would be an effective and safe way to find your sweet spot now as for when exactly to take your pre-workout taking it too early prior to your workout will cause its effects to diminish shortly after you start your workout whereas taking it too late means you won't feel its full effects until later on in your workout so given that most of the research out there indicates that taking it 30 to 45 minutes before your workout is best which is on average the time it takes for caffeine to reach a peak level in your bloodstream and is when you'll feel its effects the most i suggest sticking with that just make sure that you also consider the time it takes to get to your gym and any warm-up protocols you do before your workout as it's best to have the pre-workout fully kick in for your working sets rather than during your drive to the gym or during your warm-up in addition given that caffeine has a half-life of roughly three to five hours the time of day in which you take your pre-workout is something you should consider as well if you want to minimize any potential side effects for example one 2013 paper from the journal of clinical sleep medicine compared the effects of caffeine on sleep when ingested three hours or six hours before sleep the researchers found that when compared to a placebo moderate caffeine ingestion six hours before sleep reduced total sleep time by 41 minutes and caffeine ingestion three hours before sleep reduced total sleep time by 63 minutes and in both conditions it also took subjects more than double the time to fall asleep and significantly reduce their sleep quality simply meaning that if you don't want your pre-workout to affect your sleep which in itself is extremely important for muscle growth and recovery it would be best to refrain from taking it too close to your bedtime so the some of the video here are the main points just keep in mind though guys that using a pre-workout is by no means necessary and shouldn't become something that you have to rely on just to get your workouts done in fact personally during my first several years of training i never used any pre-workout and i only use it now when i need that extra little boost as i always try to emphasize although supplements can help they comprise a very small piece of the puzzle and the majority of your results will be seen with implementing a proper training and nutrition plan and if you're looking for a complete evidence-based plan that combines all the research i do into an easy to follow program designed to efficiently transform your body then simply head on over to build with science.com forward slash courses where you can view the four programs that have up and choose the

    "title": "The Best Diet To Get Shredded (3 MUST FOLLOW RULES)",
    "published_at": "2020-08-16T15:51:44Z",
    "transcript": "how many times have you heard that a certain diet is a new magical way to strip off fat i see headlines videos and posts all the time that promote a novel diet as the best way to lose fat and it frustrates me because of all the confusion and misinformation it causes i mean let's just take a quick look at a few diets out there there's keto there's intermittent fasting there's one meal a day and now there's even something called the carnivore diet which each have their own set of rules but the truth is although each of these diets do have various physiological benefits associated with them when you look strictly at body composition and more specifically fat loss not just weight loss research this time and time again shown that there's nothing special about any of these diets when calories and protein intake are equated but now you're probably wondering jeremy if that's the case then why exactly did these diets get popularized in the first place and why does it seem like so many people do seem to see success with these diets and to answer this question we have to look at the very problem with dieting and why most people fail with their diets which is hunger many people fail with their diet simply because they struggle to consistently eat less and stay at a calorie deficit due to their hunger levels and that's where each of these diets can come in handy keto for example it makes it easier for you to stay at a calorie deficit by simply eliminating a whole food group carbs so now that you're not allowed to eat any carbs most of the processed junk that you usually have is cut out of your diet immediately and you have to instead rely on protein sources and healthy fats which if you eat quite a bit of is going to keep you pretty full throughout the day and hence just make it easier for you to eat less and stay in a calorie deficit now let's look at intermittent fasting where you restrict yourself to a feeding window typically of about eight hours a day again all this does is it keeps you hungry at bay if you can only eat within eight hours a day then you're going to be able to control your hunger much better within those eight hours since you'll have more food to eat in a shorter amount of time and that's all that these magical diets do they simply make it easier for you to adhere to a calorie deficit now although these diets do work well for some individuals who are able to adhere to them in the long run this isn't the case for most individuals who will instead hop on these diets thinking that they do something magical see some results yet struggle to stick with it and sustain the results in the long term because of how unsustainable some of these approaches can be instead it's much simpler than this screw the next fat diet just listen to this think of your diet as a bank account when you're in a calorie deficit you only have a limited amount of calories to spend every day so you want to invest your calories into foods that are going to bring you the best bang for your buck in terms of keeping you full and satisfied with less calories as that's what will be a key in enabling you to stick to that calorie deficit with ease it really is that simple now as for the best diet to accomplish this here are three rules that you can stick to every day that'll enable you to get the most out of your limited amount of calories the first rule here is to offer low calorie density foods and the reason behind this is very simple several studies have indicated that feeling full is more likely to make a person stop eating then is the total calorie content of the food consumed so by simply opting for foods that have a low calorie amount relative to the weight you'll be able to eat more of that food for a given calorie intake this then causes a few favorable effects one is that you'll be in taking a higher volume of food for less calories which activates the stretch receptors in your gut to enhance the fullness response this alone is so beneficial when dieting because research indicates that we tend to eat to maintain a constant volume of food intake since your stomach actually gets used to the amount of stretch you provided with your diet so if you all of a sudden cut out food when you're on a diet your stomach gets stretched out less from your meals and then you experience more hunger as a result second a higher food volume also means that more chewing is required and longer meal times which both also enhance the fullness effect and finally low calorie density foods are often also quite high in fiber which also seems to have an added effect on fullness because it slows down digestion all providing you with the perfect formula for you to stay full on less calories in fact one study tested this effect by having 20 subjects eat as much as they wanted over a period of five days from a diet consisting of high calorie density foods then they swapped this for low calorie density foods and repeated the process what they found is that on the low calorie density diet the participants felt full with just over half the calories they needed to feel full on the high calorie density diet and eating time on the low calorie density diet was also significantly longer by an average of about 33 per day and in the long term this also seems to lead to significantly greater weight loss as a result with studies lasting longer than six months showing that weight loss was three times greater in individuals who ate a diet composed of low calorie density foods as opposed to high calorie density foods now as for the best low calorie density foods these are typically foods that are high in water and fiber since these both decrease calorie density for this reason and as shown in this brief list most fruits and vegetables are lowest in calorie density because of their high water and fiber content whereas more processed and fattier foods don't rank as well oats egg whites lean meats and fish greek yogurt boiled potatoes and air pop popcorn are also some great options as well so just make it a point to incorporate more of these foods into your diet and doing so really is quite simple for example adding more veggies into your dishes and replacing some of your carbs or fats with them is an easy way to bump up the volume and fullness that you experience from that dish while reducing the calorie content of that meal and get creative with it for example i could have this one pound bowl of fried rice which packs around 750 calories or i can have this cauliflower fried rice with the following ingredients instead which ends up being even more weight and volume yet would only pack around a third of the calories all while still tasting great and delivering way more protein and fiber as well here are some other easy swaps you can make as well you can apply this same concept to pretty much any dish or dessert out there if you just get creative with it and do some research and in addition to this when you're out grocery shopping pay attention to the nutrition labels i mean let's say you want to make some wraps i found these tortilla wraps which pack 240 calories for three tortillas whereas these coconut flour tortillas pack only 130 calories for three tortillas either the same size and even pack more fiber which will no doubt keep me just as full or even more full than the other ones while saving me quite a bit of calories so be mindful of this it's the little switches like this that you need to be aware of because they make all the difference next is you want to keep a close eye on your fat intake although we do want to intake a good amount of healthy fats in our diet studies have found that fats have the lowest impact on fullness when compared to carbs and protein since high fat foods are often smaller in weight and volume you pack over twice the amount of calories per gram as carbs or protein does which just makes them very easy to unknowingly overeat especially given that most people underestimate the calories of these healthy foods and to illustrate this let's do some hundred calorie comparisons of these foods so five walnuts is the calorie equivalent of about 25 strawberries one tablespoon of coconut oil equates to about five cups of air pop popcorn and a fourth of an avocado equates to about 30 baby carrots i mean you can clearly see that the ladder of each would quite obviously provide a much greater effect on your fullness so my recommendation is to aim to experiment with a relatively lower fat intake that's at least meeting the minimum recommended fat intake every day and then allocate the rest of your calories more towards carbs and protein since these do tend to have a much greater effect on your fullness do experiment with this though because it will vary individually and some of you will just enjoy having more fats in your diet which is perfectly fine but just make sure that for the fats that you do intake every day be mindful of them and measure them whenever possible since these calorie dense foods can very quickly take you out of a calorie deficit which at the end of the day is what matters most lastly is you want to limit your liquid calories and to help explain some of the reason behind this here is jackson pio's published researcher who has done a ton of research within the field of hunger management tactics so there was a really well designed study carried out in 2011 and essentially the researchers were comparing hunger ratings after eating a solid chicken breast versus drinking that same chicken breast but blended with water and the hunger and hunger scores and desire to eat were actually lower after the solid meal compared to the calorie matched and protein matched liquid version so what does this tell us well it tells us that solid meals are actually probably better for suppressing our appetite or our hunger compared to shakes or liquid calories is that something that's been replicated in other studies and is a common finding in the research comparing them yeah so in some of the systematic reviews and meta-analyses it's been shown that when people consume a higher proportion of their calories coming from liquids they actually consume overall more calories compared to people who consume a low proportion of their calories from liquids which tells us that the calories coming from liquids are having less of an effect on suppressing our appetite and our hunger hunger levels and actually leading to overeating interesting so i guess just to briefly summarize during a dieting phase it would be a good idea from a hunger management perspective to limit your intake of liquid calories overall so this could mean avoiding fruit juices smoothies and shakes and instead opting for their whole food counterparts instead since they'll have a greater impact on your fullness and then also just on that note i'd assume that you know post-workout shake is perfectly fine but it's just that if you're having additional protein shakes and or protein smoothies throughout the day then that's where this can become a little bit problematic in terms of managing your hunger i think it comes down to a little bit of the context of the individual if hunger is becoming an issue and it's causing you to binge or overeat or something like that i think people should look inwards and say okay am i having liquid calories in my program if i am maybe perhaps i'll try reduce them substitute them with sort of a calorie and protein match solid version and that's probably just going to make my appetite a little bit easier to manage so to sum this all up for you here are the key takeaways that you'll want to implement into your diet and for your convenience i've created a free fat loss meal plan for you that covers a full day's worth of meals with these tips already applied to them i'm sure that many of you will find dieting to be so much easier and so much more enjoyable with this plan compared to the meals that you're currently using so to grab a copy of this just simply head on over to builtwithscience.com forward slash meal plan and i'll send

    "title": "How Soon After A Workout Should You Eat To Build Muscle? (IT MATTERS!)",
    "published_at": "2020-05-10T17:13:46Z",
    "transcript": "one of the first tips you learn in the gym is the importance of post-workout nutrition with the idea being that if you didn't fuel your body with protein and carbs right after training then you miss a crucial opportunity to accelerate your muscle growth and recovery and your muscles would instead go catabolic and slowly waste away and this idea was enough for myself and probably many of you as well to obsess over this anabolic window and ensure that I had a shake or meal handy after every single workout without fail since then though although yes plenty of gains were made research methods have also drastically improved and we're now armed with better information with regards to the anabolic window and how important it really is for muscle growth before we dive into that research though let's first take a look at the theory behind why the anabolic windows thought to be so important in the first place so the anabolic window theory has to do with something called protein synthesis and protein breakdown which are simply two processes that are constantly occurring within your muscles as their names imply protein synthesis involves building your muscle and protein breakdown involves breaking down your muscle and the net effect of these two processes is muscle growth so as you can see the more protein synthesis and the less protein breakdown that occurs within your muscles the more it will grow whereas if your protein breakdown exceeds your protein synthesis and the opposite will happen and you'll end up losing muscle and it's what happens to these two processes after we work out where the anabolic window comes into the picture because research has shown that after a workout your muscles experience a significant spike in protein synthesis but they also experience an increase in protein breakdown as a result of the damage that you did to your muscles during the workout it's been shown that the longer you go without eating an adequate post-workout meal after your workout the more your protein breakdown rates will continue to increase and eventually reaching the point where they exceed your protein synthesis rates and hence create a catabolic state that promotes muscle loss instead of muscle growth so to prevent ever reaching this point and to instead stay in an anabolic State after workout to support muscle growth you can simply adjust a protein-rich post-workout meal or shake shortly after your workout as this has been shown to not only prevent muscle breakdown from increasing but it also increases your protein synthesis levels to a far greater degree since during this post-workout period your muscles become highly sensitized to uptake and use of protein for growth and to add to this after your workout your muscles are also now very highly sensitized to carbs as well with research showing that when carbs are consumed shortly post-workout you experience a super compensation of glycogen replenishment in your muscles whereas delaying this by just two hours reduces the rate of muscle glycogen resynthesis by as much as 50% which is obviously important given that we use some of this muscle glycogen for energy and our workout and now we want to replenish our muscles with glycogen as much as possible in order to improve our performance of the next workout and so you can see how this theoretically would all lead to more growth and better recovery and is why we've been led to believe in the importance of hitting that anabolic window after every single workout but it turns out that there is a catch as there's a few flaws in the above argument that was only brought about recently in new research the first flaw is that this theory was based on the findings of fasted training where subjects did not eat anything prior to the workout instead worked out first thing in the morning when you have a meal consisting of protein some time before your workout though things start to change first of all with regards to protein synthesis multiple papers have now shown that although your muscles are in theory more sensitized to protein after your workout if you have protein before your workout rather than after you're still able to boost protein synthesis to the same degree secondly with regards to protein breakdown research does indicate that protein breakdown increases rapidly after your workout and after around 3 hours it does actually eventually lead to catabolic state where muscles do start to break down however this is only the case if that worker was done fasted because in the event that you've ingested an adequate pre-workout meal before you work out then this no longer becomes a concern in fact a paper by powering colleagues found that a simple pre-workout meal consisting of just 45 grams of whey protein was enough to keep your body in an anabolic state and prevent protein breakdown from occurring for period of three hours and if you add carbs and fats to this meal you can extend this anabolic state to even four to six hours depending on the size of that meal and lastly with regards to glycogen replenishment although it is true that our muscles are highly sensitized to carbs after a workout researchers also shown that as long as you eat enough carbs throughout the day then your body will eventually fill its glycogen stores back up regardless of whether you had carbs in your post-workout meal or not meaning that ingesting carbs right after your workout seems to be only really beneficial if you have another workout later on that day and you need your muscles to be refueled sooner rather than later so in theory it seems that as long as you've had a properly constructed and times pre-workout meal the anabolic window becomes irrelevant and that ingesting a post-workout meal or shake immediately after workout wouldn't provide further growth or prevent muscle breakdown from occurring and research that has now actually taken a look at muscle growth as opposed to just protein synthesis is an agreement with this for instance a recent meta-analysis by Schoenfeld and colleagues took a look at a total of 23 nutrient timing studies and found that when protein intake is controlled for there doesn't seem to be any significant benefit on hypertrophy to have a post-workout Muller shake within one hour of your workout if an adequate pre-workout meal had already been consumed and if anything the benefit in growth would be minimal however with all that being said when diving even deeper into the research it's clear that the past studies have went through including this meta-analysis focus mostly on untrained individuals and what's really interesting is that if you take the time to between the lines research actually suggests that post worker timing and the anabolic window may become increasingly important as you gain more training experience illustrating this is a 2014 paper which compared the protein synthesis responses in untrained lifters versus train lifters with an average of six years of experience so they had both groups in just a pre-workout meal a few hours before the workout and then after the workout they delayed their post-workout meal for six hours and is shown in the following graphs what they found is that the protein synthesis response following a workout was significantly lower for the trained individuals immediately after the workout and six hours after the workout when compared to the untrained individuals meaning that theoretically for the trained lifters even though they already had a pre-workout meal few hours prior ingesting protein immediately post-workout would still be beneficial for growth as it would boost that diminished level of protein synthesis response that they seem to experience worse for the untrained lifters since they already experienced a near maximal protein synthesis response from their workout alone that lasts for several hours after the session ingesting protein immediately after the workout wouldn't be necessary it would provide little to no benefit for growth so long as they get enough protein throughout the day and this effect has also been shown in another study which had untrained subjects trained jiz one of their legs using a leg extension machine for a period of eight weeks and left the other leg untrained after the eight weeks they then had both legs undergo the same leg workout and what they found is that despite subjects being in a fed state during the workout the trained leg of the subjects now exhibited a significantly lower protein synthesis response after the workout when compared to the leg that they left untrained again suggesting that post-workout protein becomes increasingly important as you gain more experience now as for whether this will result in additional muscle growth for trained lifters though research is very limited in this regard but there is a well-designed recent 2017 paper that seems to support this theory the researchers took trained men with at least one year of experience in the gym and split them into two groups to determine whether or not post worker protein would make a difference in muscle growth to do so one group had a protein shake before the workout and then ain't nothing for at least three hours after the workout the other group ain't nothing for at least three hours before the workout instead have their protein shake immediately after the workout both groups followed the same controlled diet and total daily protein intake after ten weeks of working out three days a week the post-workout protein group managed to vary slightly but non significantly outperformed the pre-workout protein group in terms of strength and muscle growth at the various sites measured with their biceps growth showing the greatest increase and is stated by the researchers likely would have reached significance had the study lasted longer now although the benefits shown here were quite minimal and indicates that post-workout protein isn't as important as we once thought it does hint that it may become slightly more important for trained individuals as a result may in fact make a significant improvement in your rate of muscle growth and strength as you progress and gain more experience in the gym so I know I've covered a lot and gone through a bunch of theories in this video but here is a brief summary of how all this research applies to you although the timing of your post-workout meal isn't as important as we once thought in the various scenarios that I've outlined here it does become something that you should take seriously and may become increasingly important as you gain more experience in the gym and even if at the end of the day it provides just a slight benefit it's the little details like this that can all add up and end up making a significant difference in the rate against that you're making now for step by step program that optimizes all of these little variables for you by showing you exactly how to workout and when and what to eat week after week in order to build muscle as efficiently as possible with science then simply head on over to build with

    "title": "How To Squat Without Knee Pain (4 Mistakes You\u2019re Probably Making)",
    "published_at": "2019-06-09T15:18:24Z",
    "transcript": "[Music] squats are one of the most effective exercises for developing the lower body primarily the quads and glutes however despite this it's also labeled as one of the more quote unquote dangerous exercises due to the high prevalence of knee pain people experienced during or after perform the squat which often presents itself as pain or discomfort experienced either on and around the kneecap or pain above or below the kneecap at the attachment points of the quad and patellar tendons and the truth is although you may think you just have bad knees there's often just a few common mistakes that you're making during the squat that contributes to the pain that you feel and in this video I'll go through exactly what those mistakes are and how to fix them in order to prevent future injury and get back to pain-free squatting as soon as possible one of the most common mistakes people make with the squat is leaning forward and shifting the weight onto the toes while often raising the heels up in the process what this does is it transfers more of the load onto the knees as a result and can lead to the symptoms of knee pain that we discussed earlier especially around the kneecap so instead as you squat you need to ensure that the bar remains over your mid foot and travels vertically up and down during your trip as opposed to letting the bar shift forward over the toe and as you squat you should also be applying pressure into the ground with your entire foot rather than shifting most of the pressure towards the toes this is going to help you better distribute the load onto the ankle and hip joints to prevent excessively straining the knees but if you struggle to do this and the problem more often than not has to do with your ankle stiffness because when your ankles aren't mobile enough your body can't get enough bend at the ankle in order to properly execute the squat and instead compensates by creeping up on the toes and to find out if that really is a problem for you ice age has taken the following test which research indicates it's an excellent and reliable indicator of your ankle mobility to perform it simply kneel down by a wall without shoes and place your toes five inches from the base of it drive your knee forward over your toes attempting to touch the wall without letting your heel lift off the ground and if you end up failing this test then you uncovered a weak link in your ankle mobility that needs to be addressed which can be done by regularly performing ankle mobility drills and foam rolling the calves and shins especially right before you squat you can also experiment with a wider squat stance and/or pointing your toes out a little more and see if this helps as these two adjustments will decrease the level of ankle mobility needed to properly squat another common mistake people make is not actively engaging the hip flexors during the squat whenever you begin the squat you want to think about actively pulling yourself down into the bottom position as opposed to just letting gravity and the weight of the bar plop you down this as a result will engage the psoas muscle and the other hip flexors during the squad which will help with trunk stabilization and enable you to sit deeper into the squat with a more balanced center of gravity over your feet resulting in less pressure placed on the knee if you've never probably done this then you'll likely feel immediate relief in your knees when you do so so to properly apply it next time you squat try to visualize the hip flexor muscles shown here actively pulling your body down into the bottom position of the squat another tip to get this activation down is to perform the squat while holding on to a band attached above you as a counter resistance that applies will force you to actively use your hip flexors to pull you down into the bottom position another mistake that can contribute to knee pain is not properly aligning the knees with the toes during the squat and instead letting the knees collapse inwards something termed as knee valgus and this causes a lot of instability in the nature in the squat and over time creates imbalances and actually wears away at the knee cartilage eventually resulting in knee pain most commonly located around the knee cap and the main reason why this inward knee collapse occurs is due to poor coordination and an inability to activate the lateral glute muscles at the right time during the squat in order to prevent the knees from collapsing inwards and to improve this you want to start doing something called reactive neuromuscular training or RN T which has been shown to improve this much-needed coordination and activation of the lateral glutes one such exercise is the Orang T split squad where you place a resistance band around your forward leg and either have a friend pull the band inwards or attach it to a fixture to provide an inward resistance then as you perform the split squat try to maintain your knee in direct alignment with the direction of your foot the resistance from the band should stimulate your lateral glutes to kick on at the right time in order to keep the knee in a stable position add in two to three sets of 15 to 20 reps of this into your leg workouts is a great way to help teach your body to now properly activate the lateral glutes during your squat which will prevent knee valgus and mitigate any knee pain you may have been feeling and I'll leave a link in the description box down below to the resistance band I'm using here another mistake that even I've been guilty of is simply doing too much too soon in terms of squatting or just your lower body exercises in general and over time this can lead to tendinopathy in the tendon surrounding your knees which presents itself as pain located above or below the kneecap at the attachment points of the tendons so if you experience this type of pain and have recently increased the volume of your squats or leg work in general or you're coming back from time off from the gym and went right into your usual workout volume then this is likely what's causing it but the good news is that this is easily reversible if properly managed researchers support the idea that these overworked tendons have the potential to return to the normal pain-free self within just a few weeks if the training load is significantly reduced and to do this you'll want to play around with decreasing various aspects of your lower body workouts to find what provides the most relief for your knees while still enabling you to train as this will help the tendon heal and strengthen I recommend clicking one of the listed variables to change and see if that provides relief to your attendance in addition another thing you can do is start replacing your regular squats with other exercises that don't stress a knee as much one such example is a balk squad which is a great option for two reasons one if your knee pain has limited your ability to squat to full depth then using the box squat to control the amount of depth and settin and such that it's above the point that causes knee pain for you is an effective way to work around it reason number two biomechanical analysis of the bog squat have found that this exercise elicits a more vertical shin angle than the regular squat which as a result limits forward knee movement during the squat and therefore reduces the amount of stress placed on your knees simply meaning that a few struggling with knee pain during regular squats then box squats are a great alternative since you'll be better able to tolerate them and adjust it accordingly guys I always try to emphasize this absolutely vital that you pay close attention to how exactly you're performing your exercises in the gym in order to prevent injury over time and just progress faster in general I personally could have saved myself from a lot of injury and setbacks had I taken this seriously sooner and for a completely evidence-based program that's fully equipped with in-depth tutorials for each and every exercise in your program just so that you can ensure you're safely maximizing your efforts in the gym in order to build muscle and lose fat as quickly as possible then what you can do is simply head on over to built with science comm and take my starting point analysis quiz which will just determine what program is best for you anyways as always if you enjoyed this video please don't forget to give it a like leave a comment down below as to what other topics you'd like to see

    "transcript": "if you want to actually get lean this year the odds are stacked against you more than 80% of people who try end up failing but there's three simple science back steps that have helped me and several others beat the odds and get leaner than ever before I show you the first step your diet let's quickly create a realistic timeline for you take a look at the following photos pick the one that best matches your current body now to get to around 12% body fat with good ab definition this is roughly how long it would take where to get a little less lean around 15% this is how long it would take now this might be longer than you expected but most people highly underestimate just how much fat they have to lose and how long it takes to do so for example in these two photos I lost roughly 20 lb in about 14 weeks but I also followed the plan I'm about to share with you almost perfectly which just isn't realistic for most people so expect it to take longer than you think but as long as you keep trying and trusting the process I'm about to share with you you will succeed your diet is without a doubt what's going to drive most ofy results and it does this by forcing your body to use fat for energy but this can only be done by creating a caliber deficit where you're eating fewer calories than your body needs every day now to find the right calorie deficit for your body you can use the calculator we've made over at builtwith sicic calulator which I'll also link below but to actually hit this target you need to First fix your food environment presentable I personally just would not be able to walk past cookies at home every day and not end up eventually eating them so set yourself up for success by throwing away your trigger foods and taking advantage of your laziness by placing your high calorie snacks and Treats in hard to reach places this also applies to healthy snacks like nuts and granola anything you can easily overeat should be out of sight or hard to access also pay attention to what you're doing when you eat some research has shown that one of the strongest predictors of being overweight was eating meals in front of the TV so when you do eat try to shut everything down and just be present but after fixing your food environment what food should you actually include in your diet well let's start with what seems to be the most powerful food for fat loss protein by providing your body with enough protein you're protecting your muscles from being burned off for energy during the diet this forces your body to burn off more of your fat instead as for how much protein to eat research tip Al shows the greatest benefit when protein is increased to about 0.8 G per pound of your body weight per day so if you weigh 180 lbs you'd aim to eat around 140 g of protein per day now here's what 30 g of protein actually looks like from high quality sources pick one of these to have with each of your meals and you should be able to hit your daily Target now in addition to protein there's a handful of other foods that can have a powerful effect on your fat loss back in 1995 a team of research researchers rack 38 different foods based on how well they kept people full after a meal potatoes oats whole grains lean proteins apples and oranges all ranked extremely well whereas higher processed foods like white rice cereal chips candies and pastries all ranked poorly so what I'd suggest is 80% of the time try to eat more of these highly filling nutritious Foods eat plenty of vegetables as well since they'll fill you up for less calories and then 20% of the time allow yourself to eat treats and more processed foods that although won't fill you up as much will help you avoid an overly restrictive mindset and if you're wondering what this looks like is a full day of eating it could be something like protein pancakes for breakfast salmon and potatoes for lunch chicken and veggies for dinner and greef yogurt with fruit for dessert all of this comes up to just 2100 calories and at the end of the video I'll leave a link to this exact meal PT so incorporating what we've talked about so far should increase the odds that you're eating eating in a calorie deficit but many people still end up eating too many calories despite following a healthy diet so as a final note for your diet I'd highly recommend actually tracking your calories and seeing if you're on target even if it's just for a week it'll help you at least be aware of whether you need to adjust anything so we've got your diet covered but what are the best exercises to help you get leaner well luckily for us a recent meta analysis ranked several different fat loss protocols from most to least effective a calorie deficit plus lifting weights was the most effective method now the reason lifting weights is great for fat loss is similar to why eating more protein helps with fat loss lifting weights tells your body to keep your muscle and burn fat for energy instead so use your diet to do the hard work of creating most of your calorie deficit but lift weights three to five times per week to make sure you're losing fat not muscle but this doesn't mean you hit the gym and then sloth around the rest of the to day one of the reasons why people fail to get lean during a diet is because they subconsciously get lazier and reduce the number of steps they take as they get leaner and leaner to avoid this start tracking your daily steps try to build up to at least 7,000 steps per day and keep that consistent throughout your [Music] diet apply everything we went through so far and you should be able to lose about 1 to 2 lbs of fat per week repeat that for several weeks and eventually you'll be at your goal body fat percentage but we all know that's much easier said than done eating healthy tracking your calories doing your workouts and getting enough steps every single day can get overwhelming but there's three consistency hacks that I found make people far more likely to stick it through and succeed the first is what I like to call the power of 60% one study compared those who track their calories at least 60% of the time those who track less than 30% of the time and those who track inconsistently so maybe % on some weeks but less than 30% on other weeks can you guess which group lost the most fat yep the 60% group so instead of aiming for Perfection just aim to hit your goals at least 60% of the time and if you look at this on a weekly basis that's just 4 five days out of the week only once that becomes easy should you then aim for more now as for the second consistency hack let's say you were going on a road trip across the country what would happen if you tried to do the drive all in one go while you might start off strong eventually you'd burn out and run out of gas the same is true with di in as much as we want to get to the end destination as quickly as possible we need to take breaks every now and then to recharge in the Fitness World this is what's known as diet breaks it's a weak or two where you increase your calorie intake to around 500 calories more than when you were dieted while it's not a free pass to eat whatever you want it will give you more flexibility with your food choices and can help you recharge both mentally and physically before your next dieting phase as for how often to do them typically after every 8 to 12 weeks a consistent dieting is when I highly recommend considering one now the last consistency tip I have has to do with your belly fat most people if after 6 weeks of dieting they see no change in their belly they assume it's not working and they quit but your body Saves The Best For Last usually your body will start by losing fat around your chest shoulders arms back and even your face only once it's lost in enough fat from those areas will start to make its way down to your upper stomach area and then finally your lower belly fat unfortunately there's no way to specifically Target these areas the real secret is just sticking it out for longer here's an example from one of our built with science members Jesse who stuck to his plan for a year notice how there's not much difference in his belly in the first 3 months month 8 however is when you can really start to see some big changes in his belly now this wasn't from him changing anything it was from him simply trusting the process and stick into the planet here's another example from Archie who ran our program for 10 months his face chest and shoulders were all the first areas to improve but just imagine if he quit after month four because he wasn't seeing much progress in his belly fat here's another one from Tamara after just 8 months of Simply sticking to the plant remember you have a lot more fat to lose than you think so until you get lean enough to notice your belly fat coming off be proud of the fat loss progress you've made in your face arms chest and shoulders just don't quit right before the going gets good and if you want a science-based step-by-step plan that guides you every single week just like we did with Jesse Archie Tamara and Dylan just head over to buildwi size.com and take our quiz to find the best plan for you and your body it I hope you enjoy this one you can give this video a watch next for a daily walk-in routine to help with your fat loss or give this one a watch for a full fat lost meal plan thank you so much for watching and I'll see you next time"

    "title": "How to Lean Bulk PROPERLY in 5 Steps (Lean Bulking 101)",
    "published_at": "2017-09-03T16:47:21Z",
    "transcript": "what's going on guys today we're going to be covering a very important topic and it is how to lean bulk in order to gain muscle while staying relatively lean I'm sure most of you already know that the purpose of bulking is to gain muscle and put on more size and we can achieve this by eating at a caloric surplus how many times have you heard that you need to eat big to get big and if you're not gaining weight then you're probably not eating enough well although this does have some truth to it you don't necessarily need to eat big to get big you just need to eat enough for your body and this is where the Balkan comes in in my opinion lean bulking is the most effective way to put on size for several reasons it's much more effective than traditional methods of bulking where you get fat as hell trust me guys I have tried both methods and I can definitely say that I've made a lot more progress using the lean bulking method as opposed to traditional methods of walking like dirty bulking and the reason is more effective is mainly due to the hormonal changes and the changes in your insulin sensitivity that occur once you reach a high enough percentage body fat which you likely will reach when you're dirty bulking and I'm not going to go into too much detail as to the negative effects that traditional methods of balking causes as I'll be covering this in next week's video and I'll leave a link in the description box once it's done so you guys can check that out but just know that lean bulking for most people with exception to true hard gainers is the most effective way to gain muscle and put on sighs so in this video I'm going to go through exactly how to lean bulk in five easy steps and before we get started with the video as always please make sure that you hit that like button and hit the subscribe button and also turned my notifications on for my channel as this will really help me out especially with the recent changes in YouTube's algorithm anyways let's get started with the video so if you're a guy you're currently over 15% body fat then I highly suggest that you care your body fat down to around 10 to 11 percent before you start bulking and for girls if your body fat is currently over 25% then I said to get down to around 20 percent before you start the ball game and the reason you want to do this is because it helps preserve your insulin sensitivity when you're walking and it also allows you to bulk for a longer period of time before you have to reduce your body fat levels again which also saves you from long and grueling cuts to lower your body fat which does a lot of damage on your body both physiologically and psychologically and if you are currently struggling to lower your body fat enough to get to this level that I highly suggest you watch some of my videos that I made on the topic and I'll leave a few links to them in the description box below chloric intake is the single most important factor when it comes to building muscle and when liam bulking you want to maintain a very moderate surplus of around 5 to 10 percent which will allow you to maximize muscle growth while minimizing the amount of fat that you gain in the process so to calculate this what you first need to do is you need to find out what your total daily energy expenditure is or tdee and this is basically how many calories your body needs every day to maintain its current weight and to find that now you can use the equation that I've linked down below in the description box and then once you get that number you simply want to add 5 to 10 percent to that so for example if my tdee was 2500 calories I would add 5 to 10 percent of that which would equate to 2625 calories to two thousand seven hundred fifty calories so this calorie range would be what I would try to eat at everyday in order to gain a little bit of muscle every week and the surplus will equate to gaining around 0.5 pounds per week but this number is going to vary a lot depending on how advanced of the lifter you are if you're a beginner and you just started lifting weights and you can expect to gain even up to around 1 to 2 pounds per week whereas more advanced lifters like myself who have been lifting for several years anything around 0.25 to half a pound a week is more realistic more ideal and although this number may not seem like a lot guys over a year you're gonna see huge changes in your physique and the fact that you're lean bulking which means you're not gonna put on as much fat as traditional balking methods means that you're not gonna waste a lot of time with cutting and trying to lose fat which also loses muscle in the process so trust me on this guys slow and steady is definitely the way to go especially for natural lifters like ourselves so once you figure out your lean Bulacan calories you want to then figure out how many of these calories should come from protein fat or carbs there are so many different recommendations out there but what I like to do is stick to the research and stick to what scientific literature has shown to be most effective for protein to take you wanna stick between 0.8 to 1 gram per pound of your body weight I personally like to stick to the higher end and just go with 1 gram per pound of body weight because it's simple to use and it keeps me on the safe side of the protein intake so for example if you weigh a hundred and seventy pounds that you would want to intake 170 grams of protein daily which equates to 680 calories from protein since protein has four calories per gram as for fats around 25 percent of your total calories coming from fat is a good figure to start off with in order to optimize your testosterone levels and your overall health that contains nine calories per gram so all you have to do is multiply your lean bulking calories by 0.25 which will get you the number of fat calories you need to eat every day and then you want to divide this number by 9 which will get you how many grams of fat you need to eat every day now finally your cars will make up the rest of the calories that you have left over so what we want to do is add up the number of calories you already have from protein and fat and then subtract this number from the total bulking calories that you calculated earlier this will give me the total number of calories that need to be derived from carbohydrates and then you can divide this number by 4 in order to get how many grams of carbs you need to ingest every day that's basically all there is to it but don't be afraid to tweak your macros based on how your body performs I personally find that the higher carb and lower fat diet is best for my body but everyone's different so you use what I suggested as a starting point and then you can always adjust it in the future as you learn more about your body now I heard you to pay a lot of attention to the weight scale when you leave Vulcan because although you may have calculated your calories and you may be tracking your food perfectly every day you never really know if your caloric surplus is right for your body unless you're consistently monitoring your weight and seeing how your body responds what I recommend you do first is get yourself a really good weight scale that is accurate to at least 0.2 pounds I got mine from Amazon for like 20 bucks and it works perfectly if you guys need one I highly suggest you get this one it's cheap and it works really well I'll leave the link in the description box below if you guys are interested so you wanna wear yourself every single day when you wake up first thing in the morning and then every single week you want to take a 7-day average of your weight and then you compare this number for the following weeks and see how your weight changes if you aren't gaining enough then you want to increase your calories by a hundred and if you're gaining too much and you want to decrease your calories by a hundred and as your weight increases so should you strengthen the gym especially with compound lifts so when I attract the ways that you lift every single week to ensure that you're progressively overloading and getting stronger whether it be by adding five pounds to the bar or performing an extra rep or anything that shows that you've gotten stronger from the previous week will allow you to continuously progress and gain more muscle during your lean bolt so once you reach around 15% body fat for men and around 25% body fat for women we want to start reducing your body fat down to the levels that they were at before you started lean bulking and you want to reduce your body fat fairly quickly by using an aggressive mini cut ideally it should take you around two to three months of lean bulking to reach this high level of body fat and then around two to four weeks of pretty aggressive cutting to get rid of the body fat that you gained in the process so basically what you do is you juggle your books and cuts like this until you reach the size that you want which keep in mind will take you years of repeating this process and over in your list unless they see it guys it's not a complicated process a lot of it is just monitoring your progress and consistently trying to improve in the gym focus on hitting your caloric intake your macros and progressively overloading in the gym every week and trust me in a year you're gonna see a huge difference in your physique if you have any questions about the video then please feel free to leave a comment down below and also don't forget to like the video and subscribe to my channel it'll really help me out anyways I'll see you guys in next week's video where I'm going to be talking about dirty bulking and why exactly it's a waste of time so I'll see you next time"

    "title": "STOP Doing Deadlifts Like This (SAVE YOUR SPINE!) ft. Dr. Stuart McGill",
    "published_at": "2022-01-02T17:07:12Z",
    "transcript": "if you've ever hurt your back deadlifting or afraid to do them in fear that you will end up hurting yourself you're not alone there's five reasons why so many people injur themselves with this exercise I'll share what these are how to find the right deadlift for your body and how to perform it for safer stronger deadlift first let's discuss why deadlifts are perceived as such a dangerous exercise to begin with despite their many benefits and back strengthening properties the reason for this has to do with this hard to look at ego driven deadlift that I'm sure we've all seen at the gym or been guilty of doing at some point in our lifting careers now while rounding the back during the deadlift is actually a popular method that Elite powerlifters often use to lift more weight for The Not So Elite average lifter who isn't conditioned to lift that way the safest way to deadlift is with a neutral spine the problem with deadlifts though is that it's very easy to lose his neutral position in a bench press or a squat if you don't have enough strength to lift the weight you won't be able to complete the lift during the deadlift however rounding the spine actually makes the lift easier and given that you're not actively looking at your spine in the mirror it makes it very easy to do this without you even realizing it combine this with a heavy load the lack of back and core strength to support your spine in this position and just like the continual bending of a paperclip your back can eventually wear out and lead to injury this is further Complicated by the fact that the structure of some people's hip bones makes it it virtually impossible to maintain a neutral spine with traditional deadlift form so what can we do about it well today I brought in world-renowned back pain expert Dr Stuart Miguel who studied the science of back pain for over 30 years he's also personally trained and recovered Elite level athletes some of which have deadlifted over 1,000 lbs and performed other incredible Feats of Strength together we'll dive into the five causes of back injury during deadlifts and how you can avoid them the first reason has to do with your hip structure some individuals are born with deep hip sockets these individuals tend to have the most trouble getting into and pulling from the bottom position of a deadlift here's two demonstrating exactly why that happens when descending into the deadlift if the uh foot stance is too narrow you can see how in this particular person you will get a mechanical collision between the top of the hip sock and the leg bone and that creates Fai or Emeral acetabular impingement so in this case if they try to get deeper than their hip Anatomy allows they'll feel a pinching sensation in their hips that stops them from getting any deeper without rounding at the lower back and contrast other individuals are born with more shallow hip sockets the populations that have the highest rates of shallow hip sockets come from regions like Bulgaria Poland China and Ukraine and it's no coincidence that the top weightlifters are often born there as their shallow hip sockets make getting into and coming up from the bottom of a deadlifter squat much easier now this doesn't mean that those with deep hip sockets shouldn't de the solution would be to widen out the stance with this particular anatomy and you can see you can descend much deeper into the uh lifter's wedge setting up the uh deadlift Pole now to find the perfect foot stance for you and your hips there is a simple two-part test that we can do here's the first part of that test one of the best tests to uh link anatomy and deadlift style is the pelvic Rock back so I'm going to set my knees on the floor fairly narrow and then I'm going to adopt an all four position and I'm checking in the mirror to see the curve of my back I'm going to have my feet the same width as my knees and as I rock back I can now feel the iion in my hip and if I go any further and check that in the mirror I can see now that I'm stressing my back so the solution I'm going to try and find a more stressfree uh position I've now widened out my knees and my feet and I find spine neutral and rock back and there all of a sudden I'm matching my anatomy and finding a much lower descent Poss possible in the deadlift now I'm going to widen out a little bit further and I see that oh I've found a little bit of a compromise now so my optimal position is somewhere uh in the middle now the key is to translate that information onto the platform so the first part of the test is going to get you the right foot width to use one deadlifting the next part of the test is to play around with turning your feet further in or out and seeing what is most comfortable as you get into the bottom position and what enables your knees to remain in line with your toes in general those with deeper hip sockets find the most comfort with a fairly wider stance and the feet turned out Sumo deadlifts also tend to be a good option here as well however some individuals regardless of what stance they try they just won't be able to find that sweet spot position and will always have trouble getting into the bottom of a deadlift without compromising their lower back this is where the next cause of injury comes in when using standard 45lb weights on each side the bar sits 8.75 in above the floor this exact height was a manufacturing decision made long ago to protect Olympic weightlifters from crushing their skulls in the events of an overhead lift gone wrong while it was a smart design feature it forces you to have the required range of motion and the right body structure to be able to safely deadlift from that height and if you're using smaller weight plates the required range of motion increases even further so rather than forcing your body to pull from the ground Elevate the bar you can use blocks a power Rack or weight plates to shorten the range of motion to a level where you can now perform the deadlift comfortably with perfect form then after a month or so try lowering it slightly and see how that feels if that goes well great build from there and continue lowering if that however causes back pain or breaks down your form then go back to the higher plates and continue using that to comfortably deadlift only powerlifters are required to pull from the floor so don't risk forcing yourself to do the same if you're just not built for that regardless of your body structure and the type of deadlift you use you need to create what's called The lifter's Wedge before you pull popularized by Dr Stuart mcel it's a foolproof way to protect your back throughout the lift and unlock the power of your hips I'm setting the knee and foot width determined by the uh rockback test and I've got my turnout matched to my particular hip and knee hinge so I'm going to go down into what we call a short stop position to set up some of the alignment and then I'm going to descend out of that with my hands outside my knees and I push my hands into the bar establish the grip and I start to set or stiffen in lock in my low back and I do that by creating cting a bending Force into the bar activating my back lifting my chest just a tiny bit locking it in and then as I add the squeeze the bar starts to move so I've already got the most difficult part of the lift accomplished squeeze and then with my back locked I can then unleash full power out of the hips and pull through true now while this technique will help prevent you from lifting with your back it's often compromised by the next mistake people make perfecting your deadlift technique and strengthening your protective back and core muscles it takes time and repetition during this process many let their ego get in the way and try to lift lows that exceed their ability to maintain a neutral spine and stiffness throughout the pole if we follow the Russian philosophy you start by lifting a broomstick don't let your ego get in the way if you can lift the broomstick with perfect form you now are allowed to have an Olympic Bar if you lift that with perfect form you're now allowed to put half a cookie on either side you know a small weight and then as long as you keep good form you earn the right to have more weight now what if you've applied everything that we went through and are still experiencing low back pain well if it's not a sharp shooting pain then your lower back muscles may just be adapted to the exercise even though your back isn't actively moving it is heavily involved in stabilizing your body as you lift and considering that most of the general population sit at the desk or hunched over for the majority of the day being put into a neutral spine position and lifting weight with good form will turn these muscles on and work them like never before my advice pay attention to the level of soreness you get after your first few sessions if it's just a matter of your back muscles adapting then the soreness you experience after a session will decrease more and more over time if it doesn't or if one day you feel a lot more low back sorness than usual that's a good indication that you're breaking that neutral spine position and you need to focus on perfecting your form I hope you guys are able to see just how much The Details Matter for every exercise you do it not only keeps you healthy and injury free in the long run but it gets you results faster and if you're looking for a program that applies this methodology to transform your spefic specific body safely and effectively with science then head over to builtwith science.com and big thank you to Dr Stewart McGill for his help on this video this man's knowledge is truly incredible and for those interested in improving their powerlifting technique from a back Health perspective I'd highly recommend that you read these two books of his and I'll leave

    "title": "How To Overhead Press For Bigger Shoulders (5 Mistakes You&#39;re Probably Making)",
    "published_at": "2018-12-02T16:56:28Z",
    "transcript": "well developed rounded shoulders are one of many key features that dramatically improves and completes a powerful looking upper body and in order to best grow this muscle there's no doubt that the overhead press should be a staple in your routine as it not only enables you to effectively target the shoulders and the several other upper body muscles are shown here but it also enables you to easily overload and lift the most weight overhead when compared to other shoulder movements however despite the seemingly straightforward movement pattern of the overhead press if you want to maximize your shoulder development while reducing your risk of injury then there's a lot more that goes into it than simply lifting a bar overhead therefore in this video I'll cover the five most common errors people make with the overhead press and more importantly I'll show you how to easily fix them right away one common overhead pressing mistake is flaring the elbows out during the movement which from the front view looks like this where your elbows are pointed directly out to your sides throughout the press this is often mistakenly done by gripping the bar too wide which causes the forearms to be misaligned with your hands as shown here what you want to do instead is grip the bar such that your thumbs are positioned just outside of your shoulders enabling your forearms to be positioned directly under your hands like so leading to a stronger and safer press and in addition to this at the bottom position you need to be initiating the press and something called the scapular plane such that at the bottom position your elbows are pointed slightly forward or in other words at roughly a 30-degree angle from directly sideways then only as you press up should you naturally allow your elbows to turn out to the side and then return back to the scapular plane as you descend back to the bottom position this has been shown in multiple biomechanical analysis studies to not only be a safer and more comfortable position for the shoulder joint to be in but also more effective for overhead pressing which you likely immediately notice after implementing this fix in order to perform the overhead press most efficiently the barbell path needs to be as short as possible meaning that it needs to travel in almost a vertical line from start to finish rather than in a curved path around your head but to successfully accomplish this you need to create space for the bar as you press this is done by first very slightly leaning back by sticking your chest up and out before you initiate the press then you want to also pull your chin back such that the bar is able to travel straight up as you begin to press then as the bar passes the top of your head you pull your chin back forward into its neutral position such that at the top position the bar is positioned directly over your shoulders hips and feet in a straight line avoid excessively sticking your head forward when doing so and also avoid positioning the bar too far back at the top instead focus on moving the bar vertically as this will keep your center of gravity in an optimal position and enable you to lift the most weight possible keep in mind though that this mistake may also be due to various mobility restrictions that your body is compensating for which will be addressed in the next mistake excessively arching the lower back is probably the most problematic mistake that lifters make when it comes to this movement not only does the literature emphasize that this mistake often leads to acute back injuries and lower back pain but it's also been shown to significantly reduce overhead force and your ability to press heavy loads which is obviously detrimental to shoulder development in the long run so instead you want to keep your lower back as neutral as possible throughout the lift but if you're struggling with this and you're not using a weight that's too heavy for you then there's a couple of things you need to do first you need to ensure that your body is as stable as possible throughout the movement and to do this before you even initiate the press you need to first actively squeeze your glutes quads and your abdominals contracting these three muscles before and during the press will provide your body with the stability of needs to prevent your lower back from our changer in the press however in addition to this hyper extending in the lower back is often a compensation for a lack of mobile in other areas one such area is the lads since one of the key attachment points the lads is the back of the upper arm when this muscle is tight which it often is it actually restricts your ability to lift your arm overhead which your body then compensates for by arching your lower back during any overhead pressing movements so to improve this shortly before you begin your sets of overhead press simply foam roll side to side along both sides of your lats do this for a few minutes in order to loosen them up and afterwards you'll likely notice your press feels a lot smoother and easier to execute properly now another problematic area is something called thoracic extension or in other words your upper back mobility again similar to the lats and as stated in this study from the Journal of orthopedic sports physical therapy the higher you raise your arms overhead the more thoracic mobility is needed to maintain proper shoulder alignment therefore without sufficient thoracic mobility your body will tend to once again compensate by arching your lower back to get your arms fully overhead so to improve this after you finish foam roll in your lats you can then place a foam roller on your mid-back like so with your hands placed on your head you want to simply let your upper back extend over the foam roller as you exhale while avoiding excessively arching your lower back hold this for five deep breaths and then repeat this a couple more times further down your upper back another common movement area is excessively bending the wrist or in the press there's not only strains the wrist but will also limit your pressing strength since the wrists are now at a mechanical disadvantage instead you want to keep the wrists in a neutral position and in line with your forearms as you press and I find that the best grip to accomplish this is something called the Bulldog grip where you first place the bar such that it sits across the base of your palm then rotate your hands inward and then grip the bar if you've never used this grip before you'll immediately notice that it feels a lot more secure and easier to keep your wrist neutral as you press overhead during the overhead press your body should be thought of as a stable pillar with your arms moving overhead to press a weight however what a lot of people do especially when they begin to fatigue is start to incorporate more of their legs into the movement by bending then extending them in order to push up more weight or more reps and although this isn't necessarily a bad thing it is a completely different movement and it's actually something called the push press which shifts some of the tension away from the shoulders so if you tend to do this it's simply an indication that you should lighten the weight up or implement the previous fixes discuss such that you're able to perform your overhead pressing sets with no cheating whatsoever do keep in mind though that performing the push press separately can be an effective way to improve your strict overhead press but it is a separate movement that involves more of your lower body and less of your shoulders when compared to the overhead press and therefore it shouldn't be used simply as a compensation to lift more weight when performing your strict overhead pressing sets so the sum of the video up here are the main points as I've said before choosing the right exercises is one thing but performing them optimally and safely is really what makes all the difference in the long run and if you're looking for a complete evidence-based program that shows you exactly how to do this with the use of in-depth tutorials for each and every exercise so you can be sure that you're maximizing your efforts in the gym and simply head on over to built with science comm forward slash courses where you can view the four programs

    "title": "STOP Doing Squats Like This (SAVE YOUR JOINTS!)",
    "published_at": "2022-04-10T16:20:45Z",
    "transcript": "if you want to keep your joints healthy and maximize your strength then you have to stop squatting like this you're probably wondering Jeremy like what well to the untrained eye you wouldn't notice anything was wrong with this but in reality there are four key mistakes I'm making here that you're very likely making as well without even realizing it let's dive into what those are and how to fix them to get you a safer and stronger squat right away so the first mistake has to do with your hip structure and how it affects what the optimal foot width and foot positioning is for your squat this is actually something I covered in a past deadlift video which I'd highly recommend you watch after this one but the same concept applies here for your squats for example some people can naturally squat with a narrow stance others such as those born with relatively deep hip sockets will have to squat with a wider stance similarly depending on hip structure some will be able to squat with their toes straightforward While others will have to turn their toes out in an angle in order to reach full depth and if you try to use a squat stance that doesn't fit your Anatomy you'll often have trouble getting deep into the squat and may even feel a blocking or pinching sensation at the hip that stops you from getting any deeper this is your body's way of telling you that something needs adjusting to figure out what your optimal stance is there is a simple test we can do first we'll figure out your foot width get onto all fours with your hands directly under your shoulders knees under your hips and ideally with your feet against the wall from here try to sink your hips back into your heels as deep as you can hand without rounding your lower back make note of how that feels and how far you can go and then simply play around with it try widening your knees and feet a little bit and see how that feels keep doing this until you find that sweet spot position that feels the best and allows you to get the deepest without riding at your lower back once you found that position stand up and make note of how far apart your feet were then from here either with your body weight or under the bar squat down with your toes and knees straight out and see how that feels and then try it with your knees and toes point out more experiment and find what foot angle feels best and enables you to squat the deepest which will now be your ideal squat stance okay so by the end of that test you should have a good idea as to what the best squat setup is for you but even with that proper setup you may be guilty of making the next mistake as you then perform the squat take a look at these two shots at the bottom of the squat can you notice any difference if you take a closer look at the lower back on the shot on the right you can see that it rounds and the pelvis pulls under the body whereas a shot on the left this doesn't happen this is what's known as buttwink although it may be fine for some individuals for others it can put a lot of harmful forces on their spinal discs and in theory after years of this could eventually cause a disc bulge in this area now there are ways to avoid buttwink that I'll share with you but let's first determine how serious of an issue this may be for you with a simple screening test created by back pain expert Dr Stuart mcel the beginning of the experiment they would put just a 45lb Olympic Bar on their back and they would do pelvic tilts extension flexion extension flexion and they did 10 Cycles do you know we had to stop the experiment Jeremy because it caused so much back pain then I learned hey I just had a great I just developed a screening test by accident for is buttwink okay for that lifter so if they can do 10 Cycles with a bare bar back and forth with zero pain and they're not going really heavy and they're just squatting for the hell of it I really don't have much of an issue with that except I will say to them that eventually if you want a lifetime of good health you would be wiser to not smoke wear your seat Bel brush your teeth and avoid butt wi how's that so if you tested positive for that screen or would just like to airor on the side of caution there's two things you can do to minimize but wi the first thing is to Simply limit your range of motion for example if you try to go below parallel and notice significant rounding then it might be a good idea to just limit your squats to parallel but often times buttwink is actually caused by an ankle mobility issue if you have stiff ankles and you try to go into a deep squat once you reach the end of your ankle Mobility your lower back will have to start rounding as a compensation to try to get deeper to improve this try squatting with your heels on plates or use lifting shoes and see if that helps if it does great continue doing that while working on improving your EO Mobility with a few drills that I've outlined in a past Mobility video and I'll link in the description box down below all right so we've got our stance down we figured out buttwink but the next mistake is something almost everyone overlooks and it has to do with your feet try standing up on one leg with your other knee bent behind you are you able to hold this for at least 25 seconds without falling over the Russian training philosophy which has bred countless Elite level powerlifters states that if you can't do this then you don't yet have the right to squat with the bar this is because your feet play a major role in stabilizing your body as you squat as you perform the squat you'll make slight movements forward and back and left and right that our feet will have to respond to incorrect without adequate stability from your feet your body will seek for it elsewhere often leading to compensations that can cause excessive stress in the lower back and other areas especially when working with heavier loads to help improve your foot stability there's two things we can do the first of which I'll let back pain expert Dr Stuart mcel take you through Begin by spreading the toes and rooting into the ground and through the ankles move the center of mass forward pushing the toes down and explore the front of your foot now Leaning Tower back through the ankles onto the heels making your foot as big as possible for controlling what we call the thrust line from the weight down through your body as you're squatting to control the position and the thrust line of the weight you can use your ankles to Leaning Tower forward you can use your hips and you can use your knees the problem with some lifters is they compensate their injury resilience by correcting the thrust line with their back so it's especially important for them to gain the foot athleticism through the Leaning Tower then of course the idea is to transition and have a unloaded bar uh if you're doing a back squat on the racked on the shoulders and practice the Leaning Tower and then adding a little bit of weight to the bar to really learn to control the bar through the path the second thing you can do is pay attention to how you distribute your weight as you're squatting before you squat down grip the floor with your feet and spread your weight across these three points your heel and the base of your first and fifth toe this will form a stable tripod structure then when you perform your squat rather than shifting your weight more towards your heels or your toes make sure each of these three points remain in contact with the ground with the weight distributed evenly among them doing so will increase your stability and lead to a safer stronger squat all right so with your feet now stabilized it's important that you avoid the last mistake which has to do with your bar path to lift the most amount of weight and to avoid excessive stress on the knees or lower back the bar should travel straight up and down as you perform the squat but a common mistake lifters make is letting their chest fall forward and hips rise up during the ascent this shifts the bar forward from the midline which can place more stress on the lower back what causes this well although weak quads relative to your glutes may play a role in this based on a 2014 analysis of the squat by Meer and colleagues it seems that suboptimal motor recruitment patterns are the main culprit this refers to the inability for the body to turn on the right muscles at the right time to maintain proper form which can't be fixed by simply strengthening the muscle instead we need to essentially relearn the squat the goal is to get your hips and chest rising at the same rate to keep the bar path straight up and down to accomplish this for at least a few weeks swap out your regular sets of squats for what's called double pause squats this technique will force you to maintain the proper position and recruit the right muscles at the most crucial parts of the squat to perform it squat down how you normally do but then at the bottom position pause for a second then while keeping your chest upright push out of the bottom and then pause again about halfway up before completing the rep but to help further reinforce the proper form before you squat down I want you to tuck your elbows into your sides squeeze your shoulder blades together and pull the bar down into your traps and then on the way up think about driving your upper back up into the bar as if you're trying to push it up towards the ceiling when you apply this you will likely have to lighten the weight considerably to break out of old habits but after a few weeks of this it'll start to feel much more natural and is when you can then switch back to regular squats if you wish to do so so now what I want you to do is take a look back at the squat video I first showed you and see if you can now spot some of the mistakes with your new knowledge hopefully you now see the importance of the finer details when it comes to each and every exercise you do it's not just about choosing the right exercises but also performing them in a way to get the most out of them while avoiding any potential injury or setbacks later down the road it's so important that you get this right from the start and it's why I focus so heavily on that not just within my YouTube videos I put out but especially in the built with science programs that I offer for those interested who want to maximize your efforts and start transforming your body today just head on over to buildwi science.com and take my analysis quiz to see what step-by-step program is best for you and your body now chances are if you've been messing up your squats your dead list could probably use some work

    "title": "How To Build Muscle Almost 2x Faster (NEW RESEARCH)",
    "published_at": "2022-10-30T15:58:15Z",
    "transcript": "you could be building muscle almost twice as fast as you are right now now with this what would stretch focus training which is seemed to crack the code to build the muscle I've even started experimenting it with my own training and honestly it seems like it's working don't just take my word for it though I've assembled my Elite crew of researchers to dive into the science separate the truth from bad and figure out the best way to use this training to build muscle faster so whenever you lift weights your muscles contract to lift the weight up and then stretch in order to lower the weight back down but something special seems to happen when your muscles become stretched under load the muscles can sense the stretch in the contractile units and in response kick start a complex process that tells the body to build more muscle this is what researchers now term stretch mediated hypertrophy but not until fairly recently has more specific research actually put this Theory to the test and the findings were quite surprising even to me there's four studies I want to look at with each of them testing a different muscle group the first two tested what would happen if you only perform the bottom part of an exercise where the muscle is stretched one of the two published just last year tested this using preacher curls and assessed the growth in the biceps after five weeks the result the subjects that performed only the bottom half of the curl experienced 2.6 times more biceps growth than those who only perform the top half of the curl pretty cool right another study also published just last year replicated an almost identical design but this time on the leg muscles using leg extensions they had subjects perform the bottom versus top half of the leg extensions and one more group who did the full range of motion they measured the growth of the Quad muscles at four different sites after 12 weeks growth at almost every single one of the measurement points was greater for the group who only performed the bottom half of the leg extension now these two studies they highlight the importance of the bottom position of your exercises because that's when your muscle is stretched the most we'll talk about what this means for your training later on but before that what about exercises that can put your muscles into an even more stretched position than traditional exercises do with those exercises lead to more growth here's two studies that tested just that the first study was done on the triceps in this case subjects had one arm assigned to Cable push Downs whereas the other arm was assigned to overhead cable extensions they perform these exercises twice a week and to avoid favoring one arm over the other every workout the subjects alternated which arm that they trained first now based on the stretch focus training Theory since the overhead position places one of the triceps heads the long head of the triceps into a position of Greater stretch when compared to push Downs where your elbows remain by your side it would be the more effective exercise but what actually happened well after 12 weeks the overhead arm experienced about one point five times more growth not just in the long head of the triceps but surprisingly in all the three heads of the triceps by the way guys before we dive into the last study can we just give the subjects from the previous tricep study a big round of applause these guys are literally walking around with one arm one and a half times bigger than the other and they did it all for science so comment below for science to show your support who knows maybe one of them is even watching this video alright let's move on to the final study the last study I want to cover was done on the hamstrings in this case there were two groups of subjects each assigned with a different exercise one group did seated leg curls and the other group did Lion light curls now since three of our four hamstring muscles go from the hip down to the knee a seated position stretches them into a longer length than a line position does So based on this can you tell which exercise came out on top you guessed it after 12 weeks the seated leg curls provided significantly more growth in these three hamstring muscles than the lion leg curls all right we've covered all the research now let's dive into the Practical how exactly do you go about applying all this to potentially speed up your gains easy there's three training tips that I have for you but before we dive into those tips I do want to mention that science is always changing and evolving especially in new fields of research as of now I do believe there's sufficient evidence supporting what I'm about to share with you at least enough to start experimenting with it especially because there's no real downsides to them but as someone who appreciates science I must also be willing to be wrong and change my thoughts when new science comes out so we'll see how the science develops in the next few years and if you give me a follow on Instagram I'll keep you guys updated with new research and my personal results but for now let's dive into these tips the first tip applies to all your exercises we know how important the bottom position of an exercise seems to be for growth so don't cut it short when bench pressing bring the bar down all the way to your chest and consider using dumbbells to get an even deeper stretch when doing curls fully extend your arm at the bottom when squatting come down to at least parallel or even further if you can in addition to this make sure you're actually controlling the weight down to the bottom position and then when you get there don't cheat or bounce out of it using momentum it's often one of the hardest parts of the movement and you'll be tempted to cheat but don't control the weight and remember that is potentially the most important part of the movement for growth the next tip has to do with your exercise selection to be honest you don't need a bunch of special exercises that will provide more stretch mediated hypertrophy you're already doing that the tried and true exercises like bench press curls and squats they all put your muscles in a deep stretch position given that you perform them with a full range of motion how however as we discussed earlier there are some muscles that can potentially benefit from being stretched to a greater degree these are what's known as bi-articulate muscles muscles that cross over two joints rather than just one and as a result can be positioned in a way that stretches them even more than normal so for these muscles you'll want to make sure that you're doing an exercise that puts them into that position of extra stretch but until more muscle groups and exercises come up in future research here's the four muscles and exercises I'd be comfortable recommending that you incorporate the first two are the hamstrings and triceps as we saw earlier using exercises with exceeded leg curls and any sort of triceps overhead extension will provide a greater stretch and lead to more growth the biceps is another muscle I'd add to the list one of its heads the long head can be positioned into an even greater stretch by performing a slight incline curl or behind the body cable curl although there isn't direct evidence on this yet it does seem very likely to provide a better fit lastly the glutes while there's no direct evidence yet Romania deadlifts squats and split squats will likely be your best bet since they challenge your goods in that old important stretch position last but not least here's a more advanced tactic that I like to call length and partials so given how important the bottom position seems to be for growth why not spend more time in it here's one way of doing it before I share this technique though just realize you don't want to use this on big exercises like squats deadlifts and overhead press and you also don't want to do this very often since it can be quite fatiguing but every now and then such as during your very last set for a safe exercise such as a dumbbell press flies leg extensions triceps extension and bicep curl try this out after you reach the point where you can't do any more full range of motion reps continue your set by performing half reps at the bottom position to stress your muscle in that stretch position until you reach failure if you guys can't tell I'm obsessed with doing everything impossible to maximize gains in the time and effort I spend at the gym four years ago I compiled everything I knew and all the current Research into an online program designed to use science to shortcut your transformation these programs went on to transform the lives of over a hundred thousand members but since then I've expanded the team collaborated with experts continued mastering my craft and stayed up to date with new research I've made mistakes and I've been wrong about a few things along the way but there isn't a better teacher than failure I appreciate you guys joining me along this incredible journey but we are just

    "title": "How to Grow Your Biceps WIDTH (Nobody Does These!)",
    "published_at": "2024-04-28T13:00:06Z",
    "transcript": "nice biceps aren't just big they're wide especially when looking at them from the front but isn't this just genetics is widening your biceps even possible well once you understand their Anatomy you'll see it's definitely possible and after strapping some electrodes to my arm I found the best exercises to do so but here's what most guys miss the bicep isn't just one muscle in fact recent Studies have shown there may be up to six different parts so if you want to get the best results I high suggest you follow a 6-day bicep split just kidding don't do that really there's only two heads of the biceps that one well developed give it that full and wide look and with the red exercises you can actually choose which one to emphasize the warm head is the muscle on the outside of your arm providing that outer thickness and the short head runs down the inside giving you more of that inner Peak now whatever you do any biceps exercise whether that's a standard D curl even a chin both both heads are being used to some degree but if you know how to Target one more than the other you can not only create more effective targeted by support codes you can also prioritize a part of your biceps that may be lacking now to do so here's a basic runout if you want to work one head of your bicep more than the other it all comes down to positioning you need to position your arms so that the effort you're putting is directed in line with the area you're trying to Target now in the past I'd often do curls on an incline bench I used to think that targeting the long head or outer thickness was best achieved with behind the body curls like you get with this mve but after gaining a deeper knowledge into the anatomy of the biceps and working with some of the top experts in the industry such as coach with N1 training I learned about some other variations that seem a lot more promising and this is where things get interesting to find out what exercises actually Target each of the two bicep heads I did what any normal gyro would do I attached electrod to my skin hooked myself on to an electromyography machine or EMG and measured the level of muscle activation in each movement now while we're here it is worth mentioning that EMG is just one way of assessing each exercise muscle activation isn't the end all be for muscle growth but it is a very good indicator of what specific parts of a muscle are working the hardest especially when you're comparing similar types of exercises like we are here anyways using the AMG I found that the long was activated two times more than the short head when performing curls in what's known as the scapular plane now this might sound technical but it's actually really straightforward and you can try it up right now as you're watch it to get into this position all you got to do is stand up straight and bend your elbows into a 90\u00b0 angle then while keeping your elbows at your sides turn your wrist outward as much as you can so if you want to really Target the outer part of your biceps or the long head I recommend performing cable C CS in this position just add a few steps in front of the cable machine and then a small side step towards your working arm keep your arm in that scapular plane with your elbow tucked into your side and use the resistance from the cable to keep your arm locked into that position as you curl now for even better results you can move the cables up by about two to three notches to round wrist height this tweak adds more attention to the bear start of the movement when your arm is straighter and the biceps are more stretched which research suggests will lead to more grow but if you don't have access to cables you can always replicate this movement with dumbbells either way just promise me that you'll at least try this exercise out and let me know what you think when done properly you should really feel it in the outer part of your biceps especially once the soreness kicks in the next day or two now before we discuss which biceps head you should focus on to fill out and widen your biceps I need to show you the best exercise I've learned for targeting the inner biceps also known as a short head now while the long head is emphasized by external rotation which is why we rotated our arms out into the scapular plane in the previous exercise the short head is emphasized by internal rotation and so compared to the muscle activation I got from the long head dumbell curls doing a dumbell curl with internal rotation now shifted the activation towards my short head and one of the best exercises that applies this arm position is a concentration girl you just sit down pick up a thumbnail and then perform a curl while resting your elbow against your inner thigh and to to really nael down the AR path of the short head just think about it as if you were doing a curl across your body towards your opposite PEC now the only potential downside with this exercise is that it's most challenging near the top position of the curl when the biceps are almost fully contracted but remember we ideally want an exercise as hard as near the bottle luckily you can easily accomplish this by using an incline bench or preacher curl but angling your body sideways against it and curling the dumbbell across your body towards your neck now so far all of this information has been focused around exercises with dumbbells and cables you might be wondering if there's anything you can do with a bar to Target one head or the other well before I said to flare your arms out into the scapula plane to better Target the long head but with the bar you actually want to use a close grip which will flare your arm inwards now this might sound contradictory but I'll explain see when you're holding the bar in the close grip your elbows are trying to get back to neutral but differently when you're using a close grip it's like they're trying to externally rotate or pull the bar apart this is why when I tested close grip curls with EMG the long head had more activation relative to the short head whereas the opposite happened with a wider grip because your arms are now trying to internally rotate the enthesis shifts to the inner part of your biceps or the short head but my personal recommendation is that you use these exercises with caution as I found they can place a lot of stress on your joints like your wrists and elbows especially if you're loading them up with weight so if you have dumbbells or cables handy take advantage of those instead now which exercise should you focus on in your training well my advice is to prioritize whichever head seems to be lagging the most for some guys exercising the short head more will help their biceps look wider whereas others might need to focus more on the long head if it's less developed of course if you're still a beginner I'd recommend you just focus on following a solid routine that builds your B big enough to the point point where you'd be able to recognize if one head was left developed than the other and the easiest way to do this is just follow a comprehensive program that Nails all the basics and lays it all out for you and my team and I have developed a bunch of these programs for all different types of bodies over at built with.com but if you are in that intermediate stage these exercises are perfect for putting more focus on the area of the biceps that you'd like to grow it also might be a more effective way to grow your biceps in general since you can be sure that your biceps exercise takes each specific head to failure rather than just using general bicep exercises that may not push either head as hard as they could be now the easiest way to find out which head is lagged is literally just Flex like this in the mirror and see which side looks less developed or you can always just test out the different exercises and see which one you find more challenging and gives you the better pump I feel the best right here in this area okay let me know what you guys noticed with your Bess but in my case I noticed my long head was a bit less developed than my short head so I'll now be spending more time on it to try to bring up some of that outer width practically this just means that if I'm doing let's say three biceps exercises each week I'll Focus two more on the long head and one around the short head that's it most guys think they want bigger arms but what will actually enhance their upper body the most is growing wider shoulders and for a full shoulder workout designed to do just that you can give this video watch next thank you so much for watching as see you next time"

    "published_at": "2023-08-27T13:00:16Z",
    "transcript": "[Applause] how many grams of protein were you having on Olympia prep 600 g of protein wow protein shakes are really bad takes 3 years to digest one scoop of protein shake by the way if you take too much protein in you're going to damage your kidney and you end up just peeing it out or storing it as fat protein is hands down the most important food to build muscle but it's also an area of Confusion And there's a lot more that goes into it than just slamming a protein shake after every workout today we'll discuss the latest science on the best types of protein how much you really need and then how exactly to eat it to maximize growth let's start with protein type so there's two factors scientists use to rank how effective a protein Source will be at building muscle the first is digestability the higher the score means that more of that protein can be actually broken down and used to build muscle second every protein Source contains a variety of different amino acids which are the building blocks of protein there's 20 in total but nine of these can't be produced by the body and are defined as essential these are the most important amino acids for building muscle so what protein sources have the highest digestability and the highest essential amino acid content well it's typically the protein sources you'd expect protein powder meat fish and dairy products human muscle also scores pretty high but don't get any weird ideas P based protein doesn't score very well but we'll talk about what that means later on now there is some new research suggesting that digestibility and amino acid content may not be all we should consider back in 2017 a study had subjects eat either 18 g of protein from whole eggs or 18 g of protein from egg whites after a workout researchers analyze their muscle protein synthesis response after eating the meal which you can think of basically as a signal to your muscles to recover and grow bigger generally you'd expect it to be the same given the equal protein content to everyone's surprise the whole eggs led to a significantly higher muscle protein synthesis response but the real question is would this increase actually lead to more muscle growth well a few years after the study came out another group of researchers came to answer that question they assigned one group to eat 20 g of protein from three whole eggs after every workout whereas the other group ate the same amount of protein but by consuming six egg whites without the yolk both groups also eat the same amount of total calories and protein throughout the day after 12 weeks the whole egg group increased their strength and reduced their body fat percentage to a significantly greater extent than the egg white group there is also a strong Trend towards a greater increase in lean body mass in the whole egg group and although it's unclear what made whole eggs Superior it may be linked to their cholesterol content and possibly some additional nutrients contained within the yolk now I'm not saying to eat a diet exclusively of eggs based on this preliminary evidence but it just goes to show that there may be some unique muscle building properties within protein sources that we are not yet aware of and I'll keep you guys updated with any new research now what plant-based protein sources surely they're less effective than animal-based protein sources at building muscle right well the answer might surprise you remember how the plant-based protein sources ranked relatively poorly when it comes to digestibility and essential amino acid content because of this they tend to result in a lower protein synthesis response when compared to animal-based protein sources but protein synthesis doesn't always correlate well with changes in muscle growth and this led researchers in a 2021 study to inves further by comparing the effects of a vegan diet versus a primarily animal-based diet over the course of a 12we training program the vegan group supplemented with soy protein and also made an effort to vary their protein sources throughout the day just to make sure they weren't deficient in any particular essential amino acid surprisingly both diets led to similar increases in both muscle size and strength and this same result was shown in a similar study published just this year however researchers highlighted the outcome was likely heavily dependent on two things eating enough daily protein as well as properly spreading out that protein throughout the day both are what will cover next eat too little protein and you won't maximize your growth but eating too much has its downsides as well what's The Sweet Spot well it depends the best piece of evidence we have so far is a metaanalysis that analyze the effect of protein intake on muscle growth across 49 studies they found that adding more protein to one's diet significantly increased muscle mass on average by about 0.66 lb over the length of the studies however although more protein did lead to more growth this was only true up to a point in this case protein intakes above around 0.73 G per pound of body weight per day fail to help build any additional muscle so for the average 180 lb individual this would come up to around 130 g of protein per day and remember this is to maximize growth even if you're below this you'll definitely still be able to build muscle so don't get discouraged if that Target seems really high that's it in all the studies analyze subjects were eating at either maintenance calories or in a surplus but what about when you're in a calorie deficit this is when the body is more likely to burn off muscle for energy and is when an even higher protein intake could help prevent this well unfortunately we don't yet have a study comparing protein intakes that are both higher during a caliber deficit such as 0 .8 G per pound body weight versus 1.2 G per pound body weight but there is some speculative evidence suggesting that the cleaner you get and or the more aggressive your diet is the higher your protein intake should be to prevent muscle loss but again it's relatively unclear so I'd recommend if you're maintaining or eating in a surplus to maximize growth aim for a minimum of 0.73 G per pound of body weight per day you can also go higher than this it's perfectly safe and may have other benefits like helping with Hunger but I generally wouldn't go above 1.2 G per pound of body weight since by that point those additional calories may be better used towards carbs to help Fel your performance and energy in the gym whereas when you're in a deficit there's no harm in being extra cautious and bumping up your minimum protein inake to 1 G per pound a day especially if you're relatively lean however these protein recommendations are based on your total body weight but if two people weigh the same yet one has significantly less muscle and more fat then that individual won't need as much protein so if your body fat is higher than around 30% for males and around 40% for females instead of using my GRS per pound recommendation you can take your height in centimeters and simply eat that amount of protein in GRS per day okay so before we move on to how to eat your daily protein to maximize its benefit let's talk about the actual cost of eating enough protein while it can be pricey there's ways around that in my latest budget meal plan video which I'll link in the description box down below I found the cheapest protein sources possible and I ranked them based on their cost per gram of protein here is the list but i' also add protein badg to this despite its rising cost if you buy it in bulk and you calculate the cost per gram of protein it comes out cheaper than ground beef and Greek yogurt and actually ends up comparable to eggs milk and can tuna not to mention it tastes great it's convenient and it doesn't come with a ton of extra fat and calories like some other protein sources do now I do sell my own protein powder I've built with size.com which is a little bit more pricey but it is the highest quality protein and it delivers 29 g of protein for scoop now whether you get it from me or not it doesn't matter just definitely consider investing in the supplement as it's cost effective and it will make hitting your daily protein intake so much easier okay so you know how much protein you should eat per day but if you want to truly maximize the growth you get from that protein then how exactly you eat that protein throughout the day also matters you see every time you consume protein your muscle protein synthesis levels increase which as you now know is basically a signal for your muscles to grow however you can only increase this up to a point and it seems like around 20 to 30 g of protein pretty much Maxes this out in addition to this after this increase there is some evidence that you won't be able to restimulate it again for at least a couple hours and this is where protein distribution comes into play theoretically if you space out your protein evenly throughout the day you'll be able to keep your muscle protein synthesis levels elevated and provide a consistent signal for your muscles to grow but to determine if this actually makes any difference on muscle growth let's take a look at this 2020 study subjects were assigned to one of two groups one had a low protein breakfast an average protein lunch and a high protein dinner the other group had a more even protein distribution across the three meals both groups tried to eat a similar amount of total daily protein but the uneven protein distribution group actually ended up eating about 10 G more protein per day on a average so what happened well after 12 weeks of this combined with a strength training program the evenly distributed protein group had slightly more favorable strength increases for all five of the exercises tested and also had slightly more favorable increases in Total Lean mass that said the daily protein intakes for both groups was quite low and the sample size was pretty small for the study but it does provide some evidence that Distributing your protein to at least three meals per day may have a benefit but what about increasing this further to four five or even six protein meals per day would that provide an even greater benefit well a study that was published a year after this one helps provide some insight researchers compared the effects of spreading daily protein to take evenly across either 3 or 6 meals per day after 8 weeks there were no significant differences in muscle growth or any other measurement recorded So use three meals as a minimum but feel free to eat more than this if it helps making hidden your daily protein Target more manageable all right we've covered a lot so I thought I'd make a chart to help summarize everything but just always keep in mind that above all on this chart your daily protein intake is what's most important and for some more diet help I highly recommend giving this video a watch next for a $5 a day cheap high protein meal plan designed for fat loss or give this video a

    "title": "The BEST Way To Use Creatine For Muscle Growth (4 STEPS)",
    "published_at": "2022-03-13T16:39:38Z",
    "transcript": "with over a thousand studies being done on Creatine it's scientifically proven to Be an Effective and safe supplement to help you build stronger and bigger muscles but science also reveals that there's a specific way to use it to maximize its benefits and save you money while you're at it today I'll show you how to do just that in four easy steps before we dive into step one let's first briefly discuss what creatin is and how it can help you build more muscle and strength so creatin is a substance that we naturally produce and use Ed up as an energy source to power our muscles through the first 10 seconds or so of high-intensity activities such as Sprints or tough set of bench press when we supplement with creatine we can increase our natural creatine levels by about 30% this increase if maintain through consistent supplementation has been shown to provide a significant boost and power and strength during our workouts which over time has been shown to translate to significantly greater muscle growth it's effective and it works but it's also very easy to waste a bunch of money on it without fully reaping its benefits the first step to avoiding that is to make sure that you pick the right type of creatine walk into a supplement store and you'll be recommended all sorts of fancy forms of creatine that are supposed to boost absorption or provide some kind of enhanced effect but what does research say well ever since my last creatine video I posted a couple years back there's been some new contenders in the market luckily a 2021 systematic review was recently published that analyzed eight different different forms of creatine to determine which was most effective as you can see in the following table the researchers also broke down the cost per serving for the different forms of creatine with creatine monohydrate being the cheapest with buffered creatine costing almost eight times as much of the eight which came out on top well it turns out they all work just as effectively at boosting muscle creatin levels which makes sense plain old Crea monohydrate has no problems with absorption nor does it cause any notable facts that a more costly alternative would be solving these Alternatives still exist in the market however because companies try to one up their competitors by claiming to have a proprietary formula that makes it seem like they're more effective than others who just sell a single ingredient cheaper form of creatine because of this they can charge more of a premium for their product but their fancy forms have not beaten out plain old creatin monohydrate regardless of what their marketing tries to convince you so given that you could save over a dollar every single day from sticking to plain old cre monohydrate save your money and stick to that you can easily tell if you're picking the right choice if you look at the nutritional label and the only ingredient shown is creatin monohydrate all right so after you've picked up your creatin monohydrate The Next Step you want to get right is how much to take as it does seem there's a lower limit that you'll want to meet for example one study on female swimmers showed that 2 G per day of creatum monohydrate supplementation for 6 months failed to improve their performance similarly another study showed that 1 G per day of supplementation for a full year failed to improve muscle function or lean mass meaning that 1 to 2 G per day is likely too low of a dose however the typical dose of 5 G per day which is also the standard scoop size for most creatin products may actually be overkilled illustrating this is a 2018 paper that compared the effects of supplementing with either 3 G or 5 G of cre monohydrate per day when compared to the place both groups experience significant increases in strength and based on the results the researchers suggest that 3 G per day is a sufficient dose for most lifters and if you crunch the numbers it makes sense given that Studies have shown a significant Improvement in performance from dosages of around 0.03 G per kog per day so for 170 lb individual that amounts to just 2.3 G of creatine per day which is less than half of the often recommended 5 G scoop size and would mean that your tub of 30 serving of creatine would last you two months instead of just one so what I recommend is stick the 3 G per day a little less than the typical scoop size as that's going to be more than enough for the vast majority of people if you are on the much heavier side then you may benefit from just a slightly higher dose based on your body weight now with that being said when you first start taking you may actually want to consider bumping up the dose far above this this is where step three comes comes into play so after you start taking creatine it takes time for your creatine levels in your muscles to gradually increase and fully saturate it doesn't happen overnight and in fact often takes a couple weeks to significantly increase depending on how fast you'd like to experience the effects of creatine though there's two protocols you can use the loading protocol is a method that helps you saturate your muscles with creatine as fast as possible so that you can start reaping the benefits right away this involves taking 5 G of creatine four times per day to get a total of 20 G per day you repeat this for about 7 days to elevate your stores and then afterwards drop down to just 3 G per day as we previously talked about in order to now maintain your elevated creatin stores in contrast the non-loading protocol is a method that gradually increases your creating stores in this case you simply stick to 3 G per day from the start but rather than taking just a week to elevate your creating stores this protocol will typically take about 3 to 4 weeks before you start experiencing the benefits of supplementation both protocols do get you to the same point so there isn't necessarily a better one to pick from the loading method is advantageous if you'd like to reap the benefits as quickly as possible and it's also the protocol I'd recommend if you're dieting this is because as your creatine stores increase your muscles will begin to store more water with it and your body weight will increase taking a low daily dose will often result in a slow and gradual rise in your body weight over the first first 2 to 3 weeks which can skew your weight loss results on the other hand loading for a week will cause a quick initial spike in your weight but then you can easily use that as your new Baseline body weight going forward rather than having to wait several weeks to find out how creatine is affected your weight the only potential downside of a loading protocol could be some digestive distress from taking so much at once but the seems to be mitigated if you space out your 20 G per day into multiple doses like we discussed so pick your poison and follow whichever protocol that you'll be most consistent with but as you do so it's important to understand when to take it and what to avoid taking it with to maximize its benefit this is where step four comes in when I first started taking creatine I was under the impression that it was best taken right before my workout to help power my muscles and I also heard that I should chug it with grape juice to get an added benefit I vividly remember being in my car creaturing tub and gra juice in hand following the protocol and then proceeding to have a kid you not one of the best workouts of my life since then I've learned the placebo effect is a hell of a drug but I've also learned the truth about when and what to take creatine with although there isn't too much research that dives into the specifics of timing remember creatine doesn't have an immediate effect this means that taking a pre-workout doesn't provide any unique benefit and it makes no sense why many supplement companies still include creatine as part of their pre-workout formula in fact one study found a 1.7% difference in lean mass increases when taking in after your workout in comparison to before your workout but this difference wasn't significant by research standards as for what to take it with there is some evidence that taking creatine with carbohydrates and protein increases saturation levels more than just taking creatine on its own but this only really makes a difference during the initial saturation phase and is of lesser relevance during the maintenance phase so while taking a with a post-workout meal may have a very small benefit what's most important is that you're taking it every day at a time that you could be consistent with but with that being said there is a small possibility that caffeine consumption may actually hinder the benefits of creatine this is illustrated by a recent 2021 paper and an excellent analysis of it by Dr Eric Trexler within it he took the past five studies done on Creatine and caffeine and found that in four of those five studies creatine alone work to produce the desired outcome such as a boost and T strength and hypertrophy however in all of those five studies when creatine was combined with regular caffeine consumption equivalent to at least 2 to three cups of coffee a day despite the muscle still being saturated with higher levels of creatine it now failed to provide any performance benefits Dr Trexler speculates that it may either have to do with some of the opposing effects that creatine and caffeine have on our muscles from habitual consumption or the fact that taking them together can cause gastrointestin Al discomfort and would negatively affect your workout but the research is still far from conclusive for now here are the best recommendations if you're extremely concerned about the potential interference between caffeine and creatine ditch regular caffeine consumption since creatine tends to provide greater benefits over time instead save your caffeine consumption just for times or workouts when you need it the most but for many that can be a tough ask in which case a more suitable alternative is to Simply avoid Avid taking creatine and caffeine together at the same time so I know we covered quite a bit but here are the main key points to get the most bang for your buck using creatine monohydrate follow either the loading protocol or non-loading protocol to saturate your muscles and then take about 3 G of it whenever you wish every single day to maintain it and then after a few weeks there are a few signs that you want to look for to see if it's working for you as it's not going to work for everyone this is something I'm actually going to cover in a follow-up video that I'll link at the end of this this one when it's up that being said guys creatine just like any other supplement it's not magic it doesn't do the work for you but when paired with the right training and nutrition plan it can help you give you a bit of an edge and if you're looking for a simple yet effective science-based program you can trust that shows you exactly how to train and how to eat to transform your specific

    "published_at": "2021-07-11T15:12:45Z",
    "transcript": "I'm going to take your push-ups to the next level in a few easy to follow steps we're going to show you how to optimally set up your body position how to stabilize that position during your push-up by activating the right muscles and finally combine it with a few modifications to unlock its maximum potential after this video your push-up strength and the muscle growth you get from performing it will be taken to a whole new level first setup we'll start with hand placement set up your hand so that at the bottom of your push-up two things happen first your forearms should end up on top of your wrist in a straight line avoid having your forearms bent at an angle if your wrists aren't very flexible you may need to hold on to dumbbells to accomplish this the second thing that should happen is your elbows should tuck to roughly a 45 to 60\u00b0 angle if you were to look down from an overhead view this means your elbow should make an arrow shape flaring your elbows out will turn this into a t-shape we want to avoid this as it'll weaken our push-up up make it more difficult to properly stabilize this exercise and put our shoulders in a riskier position for injury having these two things occur during your push-up will help unlock several muscles that'll help maximize your strength as you push something will continue doing in steps two and three now to actually find your sweet spot hand position lie down on the floor with your hands at the level of your mid chest take a look at your forarm and elbows move your hands wider or narrower until you find the hand width where the forearm is positioned position directly over the wrist and the elbows are tucked into that Arrow position that we talked about earlier most of you will end up with a hand placement at the mid chest level and place just outside the shoulders so once you get your hand position nail down you're going to come up onto all fours and your hands and knees like so with your knees under your hips and once you're in this position you're ready for step two this step is where we're going to focus on turning on several muscles that'll help better stabilize your body as you perform your push-up it's something that we teach our members how to do for all the exercises in our bu with science programs which I'm going to talk more about at the end of the video this step is going to improve your push-up strength dramatically because we avoid what's called Energy leaks and maximize your push-up potentials start by pushing your knuckle down into the floor and spreading your hands such that there's space between each of your fingers this will help us incorporate more of our powerful chest muscles next slide your shoulders down and away from your ears you should feel your lats turn on as you do this the lats are a powerful stabilizer muscle that'll help contribute to your push and strength so we want to get them involved as much as possible then while maintaining this activation in your lats push the floor away to open up your shoulder blades this is going to help integrate an important muscle to help further improve our stabilization and pushing strength at this point your head will likely be protruding forward adjust this by pulling your chin back to draw your head back in line with your body this helps avoid stretching the neck and also puts our midback muscles into a better position to help stabilize our bodies as we do the pushup at this point we're done stabilizing the upper body and are ready to move to the lower body after we stabilize our lower body we'll be ready to finally perform our first perfect push-up so we're going to start with the lower body by setting your hips in the right position to do so think about tucking your tailbone like so once you've made it here you're ready to step back take a breath in engage your core and then extend one leg back dig your toes into the floor and squeeze your thigh really tight to fully extend your leg hold that then step the other leg back and squeeze the other thigh tight now you're ready to do a push-up don't forget if a standard push-up is too difficult or in the other hand too easy for you I'm going to show you how to modify them in the final step but for now let's look at the execution of a standard push-up to perform your push-up we're actually going to start by pulling and then pushing so from the top position we established in step two do not just let gravity flop you to the floor this will cause you to lose all the stability that we work so hard to create in the previous steps instead think about using your back muscles to pull yourself to the floor as if you were performing a row your body will have to travel forward slightly as you do so in order to keep those elbows directly over the wrist like we talk about in step one then once you reach the bottom position while squeezing your butt and thighs push away from the floor to the top to open up your shoulder blades again as we did during our setup at this top position your head hips and feet should make one straight line maintain this as you proceed to your next reps now that we've nailed down your perfect push-up it's time to modify it based on your current strength level and body type if you struggle with push-ups and you can't do more than 10 good push-ups in a row with the form that we previously covered then here are some good options to build that strength up this exercise is my personal favorite and something I found to be more effective than the common modification of knee push-ups to perform it Loop a bound around two fixtures such as in between squat rack there should be about a foot of space between the bottom band of the floor the higher the height the easier your push-up will be so just adjust the height based on your strength level get into your starting push-up position such that the band is at waist level and then proceed into your push-up the band is going to help provide more and more assistance the lower you go the area of the push-up where people have the most difficulty so if you guys are unable to do the previous setup then one alternative is just come on over here you can go to a squat rack or any Smith machine or even any table or elevated surface at home and just do your push-ups on there right so that incline it helps unload the upper body makes the movement a lot easier and gradually over time to make it harder and harder as your strength improves just lower the amount of incline that you're doing and then eventually you'll be able to do the standard full push-up now for those who have instead mastered the standard push-up and could perform more more than 20 good reps with them it's time to increase the difficulty this will be more effective for strength improvements and gains as opposed to just aiming to do more and more reps and you have a few options to do so the most convenient way is just just slow down the Reps instead of taking 1 second to go down extend it to 3 seconds do the same on the way up once that becomes too easy incorporate a 1 to 2 second pause at the bottom position as well this is going to help apply more tension to the Target muscles and result and more growth for the same number of reps my personal favorite however is something called banded push-ups and it's something that we incorporate in our build science programs because of how effective they are they've actually been shown in the research to improve upper body strength as much as a weighted bench press does so what you're going to do is you're just going to wrap a band around your back like so put the band in each hand and then you're going to come down into your proper push-up position like we explained earlier and then you're just going to perform a push-up it's going to add a lot more resistance throughout the push-up make it a lot more harder and just give you a little bit more to progress on with your push-ups by pecking the push-up that's perfect for your level you'll be challenging your body with the right difficulty rather than doing something that's too easy or too difficult for your body if you want to maximize your growth and strength then it's important to apply the same level of detail and execution with all of your exercises not just your push-up to do so take our free 60-second analysis quiz over at buildwi

    "title": "The #1 Workout That BLEW UP My Arms (4 Exercises)",
    "published_at": "2023-12-03T14:00:39Z",
    "transcript": "Thor Captain America Sam suik what's the one thing they have that every guy wants a big thick juicy set of arms unfortunately God blessed me with Twigs I spamed them with curls and push downs but that only got me so far and I had no idea wasn't hitting all the arm muscles as soon as I trained smarter my arm growth took off now I don't want you guys to make the same mistakes at it so today we're going to use the latest size to create The Perfect Workout to blow up your arms let's start with the biceps so if you take a look at a standing dumbbell curl it's hardest in the middle right around here but a new area of research suggests that for the most growth you want an exercise that challenges the biceps closer to the bottom when it's stretched for example a 2023 study had subjects do either incline curls or preacher curls now incline curls challenge the biceps the most in the middle whereas preacher curls challenge the biceps the most in the beginning the result after 9 weeks preacher curls led to more growth at all three measurement sites especially in the bottom part of the biceps and there's been similar findings in other muscles like the hamstrings quads and as you see later on the triceps as well which makes me relatively confident in selecting preacher curls as a top tier biceps exercise especially since our built with science program members have also seen a lot of success with them but there's a way to perform them which may get you even more growth first off the biceps function to not only Flex the arm but also turn the wrists inwards so try to start the curl with a neutral grip and then turn your wrist in so your palms face up at the toall however this will reduce the range of motion if you're using an incline bench so I'd only recommend doing this if you're using an actual preacher curl second given the importance of the stretch your arm should be almost fully extended at the bottom but this is usually a position that most people have never trained their biceps in so I highly recommend start off with lighter weight for 10 to 20 reps and then over time you can go relatively heavy year for around 8 to 12 reps so there's one more curl we want to do to really blow up the arms this one will help grow not just your biceps but two more arm muscles the biggest muscle of the forearm the break your radialis as well as a muscle between the biceps and triceps that can help thicken your arms called the bre Alis now unfortunately there's no direct evidence looking at how well different exercises grow these muscles but the bre radialis sits on the side of the forearm so simply turning your grip to neutral will line it up better with the direction of the arm path during the curl forcing it to do more work this grip is also theorized to reduce the involvement of the biceps and increase that of the brachialis now standing hammer curls are the usual go-to for these muscles but for an even greater benefit we can apply the earlier research we went through and perform these on a preacher curl to make it more difficult in the beginning when the muscles are more stretched similar to the regular preure curl though start off lighter for higher reps and work your way to 8 to 12 reps with a relatively heavier weight but if these feel tough on your tendons even when you use lighter weights for higher reps then you can consider swapping them for behind the body Hammer cable curls which will still challenge the muscles more when they're stretched now let's move on to the triceps so the triceps has three heads the medial lateral and long head now some of these heads already grow very well from other exercises you're already doing for example one study published back in 2020 found that the bench press grew the lateral and medial heads quite well but it did lead to virtually no growth in the biggest head of the TR biceps The Long Head this is because the long head is unique in that it's the only head that crosses the shoulder joint so you'll need a special exercise to Target it as for the best option the study we just covered also tested what would happen if subjects did both the bench press and Skull Crushers a common triceps exercise now compared to doing just the bench press alone they found that adding the Skull Crushers resulted in no additional growth in the lateral head a bit of growth in the medial head but considerably more growth in the long head but what exactly Mak skull crushes so effective and what about other triceps exercises would they be just as good at growing the long head well another recent study by mayo and colleagues provides some insight they head subjects to tricep overhead extensions with one arm and tricep push Downs with the other similar to Skull Crushers overhead extensions place the long head in a greater stretch which as we know from other research seems to provide better Gates the result after 12 weeks the overhead extension group experienced about 1.5 times of growth in the Long Head what's interesting is that even though the lateral and medial heads weren't stretched anymore during the overhead extension they still grew significantly more now we definitely need more research to find out why but I would be pretty confident in recommending some type of overhead extension as a top tier triceps exercise at least for the long head but choose whatever is comous on your joints you can do overhead with a rope single arm with just a cable or Skull Crushers using do bells or barbells aim for about 10 to 15 reps on these us using moderate weight all right guys so before I show you the last exercise I need to be honest with you while all the science can definitely give you an edge it's going to be useless if you're not nailing down the foundation you need to push hard enough during your workouts you need to fuel your body with the right foods and you need to be sleeping enough you're going to get far better results by fixing those areas than you will with any workout no matter how science-based it is and if you're someone who needs more guidance and wants a step-by-step science-based training and nutrition plan that takes care of all the guests work for you so you can build muscle and lose fat as efficiently as possible just take our quiz over at builtwith size.com to find the best plant for you and your body it's helped thousands of others and I guarantee it's going to work for you but anyways let's move on to exercise number four all right so we've covered the long head but now let's talk about the two other tricep heads so you've already learned that pressing movements alone do a good job at growing the lateral and medial heads for some people that actually may be all that you need but my pressing has always been relatively weak and my lateral head seem to lag behind so adding an exercise dedicated to this area really helped out as for the best option I found a lot of success with an exercise I first got from biomechanics expert coach kasm the arm position seems to both stretch and challenge the lateral head near the beginning which is recovered is probably beneficial for growth to perform it grab the cable with one hand face away and let the cable come over your opposite shoulder position your arm in front and across your body and then simply extend your arm while keeping your elbow walked in place you want to aim for about 10 to 15 reps per set now if you don't have access to cables another great option is close grip push-ups or something called the JM press but with dumbbells think of the exercise as of Skull Crushers and close grip dumbbell press had a baby it's a great way to emphasize the lateral and medial heads since as we saw earlier the long head doesn't do a very good job at helping out during pressing type exercises to perform it lower the dumbbells down towards your neck while sliding your elbows forward you want as much elbow Bend as possible such that your forearm is parallel with the ground at the bottom you can also let them angle out on the way down if it's more comfy on your elbows then simply use your triceps to extend your arms back up however these can be toughen the elbows so I'd highly recommend sticking with lighter weights and aiming for about 15 to 20 controlled reps so here's the four exercises with the Reps sets and Alternatives you can throw these exercises into your workouts throughout the week or just have a dedicated arm day where you do these all at once but guys the best compliment to bigger arms are wider Fuller shoulders highly recommend giving this video watch next if you want to learn about a shoulder workout I've been personally doing that's been working really well thanks for watching and I see you next time"

    "transcript": "with so many shoulder exercises out there it's hard to know which ones actually work but the truth is you're probably doing too many and focusing on the wrong areas in fact after cutting out all the fluff and focusing on just two science backed exercises my shoulders grew bigger and wider than they've ever been and with the right form the same will happen for you but here's the thing what makes shoulders look wide and gives you that classic Vaper isn't every part of the shoulder it's actually mostly now to just one main region the side delts but here's the problem most people's training doesn't reflect this priority for example when researchers analyze exercises and volume studies they count every chest pressing set as one set for your chest but also one set for your front delts because of how heavily involved they are now add in shoulder pressing which targets the front delts even more and you're left with way more weekly volume for your front delts than your side delts whether you plan to or not do this for long enough and your shoulders will become overdeveloped in the front but lack the width that truly makes them stand out but here's the good news fixing this imbalance is actually quite simple it just requires a shift in Focus if wider shoulders are your priority I'd even recommend ditching shoulder presses Al together if they're not helping towards your goal that's personally what I did I haven't shoulder pressed in over a year instead I shifted that time and effort to focus on my side delts and that's when I really started seeing my shoulders widen as for what exercises to focus on the best option is lateral raises but here's the thing not all lateral raises are created equal take dumbbell lateral raises for example they're convenient and easy to perform but they come with a key limitation they challenge your delts most at the top and ironically this is where your delts are the weakest as a result you're forced to use lighter weights than they can really handle but that's not the only downside there's growing evidence that exercis is providing a greater stretch and challenging your muscles in that stretch position may lead to better growth dumbbell lateral raises don't do either of those very well so how do we fix this well this brings us to exercise one first lock your elbow into your side and rotate your arm outward where your arm naturally stops is called your scapular plane this is the optimal arm path for lateral raises as it maximizes tension on your side delts and provides a biggest stretch at the bottom of the movement which means the best lateral raise is one where your arm can move behind your body to maximize the stretch cables are the perfect tool for this and by setting the cable at a slightly raised position rather than at the very bottom you can immediately shift the challenge to the beginning of the movement where your side belts are more stretched and you can do the single arm or double arm depending on your preference that said I do want to be upfront with you while I've personally seen incredible results with this exercise the science is still catching up for example I recently connected with my friend and researcher Dr Milo wolf who conducted a study comparing cable lateral raises to dumbbell lateral raises so in our study during 8 weeks we took 25 participants who all had a training experience of around 5 years on average and had them do one of two exercises using one arm to do one exercise and the other to the opposite exercise with one arm they exclusively performed cable ladder races with the other arm they exclusively performed dumbbell side raises we measured hypertrophy of the side delt using ultrasound at two sites one more proximal and one more distal now if you look closely at the results at one site hypertrophy was effectively the same between dumbbell and cable side raises whereas at the other site if anything there was a slight benefit like around 30 or 40% relative difference in favor of the cable side R my interpretation of this study effectively is that dumbbell side raises and cable side raises are both effective for goinging the side belts but if you kind of look a bit closer and interpret it in light with the overall research I would say you're probably still better off doing cable side raises it may just not be a huge difference but there's a catch the cable raises in that study were performed with the arm in front of the body instead of behind the body which doesn't provide quite as much stretch on the side delt Additionally the study was relatively short and it used ultrasound measurements which is tough to accurately measure thin muscles like the side delts that's why I'm currently running a highly controlled study using custom machines and MRI for measurement to determine if challenging your delts in the stretch position actually offers a significant advantage in the meantime I'd still highly recommend giving this variation a try if anything there might be a novelty effect where challenging your muscles in a new way could help you break through a plateau at least that's exactly what it did for me that said if you're a beginner this exercise might feel a bit tricky to master especially the double ARM version in fact I tried to show this to Kevin our head engineer at bu with science and let's just say he wasn't a fan he sucks it sucks what L ra actually but don't worry you do have other options one option is to First do a normal set of dumbbell lateral raises then immediately after you can't do any more full reps grab a pair of 5 lb heavier dumbbells and perform partial reps just in that bottom range this ensures your delts are actually work to their limit especially in that all important bottom position another option is to try the lean in dumbell lateral RS by leaning into the movement you shift the challenge to the bottom of the range targeting the stretch position more effectively now while the first exercise focuses on the main part of your side delt there's actually more to your shoulders than Mei ey Believe It or Not muscle activation research suggests that your shoulders might have up to seven different heads all of which can be independently activated by your nervous system now this doesn't mean that you need seven different exercises to Target each head but it does mean that small adjustments to your lateral raise technique can work areas of your side belts that you've probably never hit before one area in particular is the rear portion of the side belt I know I know it sounds weird and super specific but developing this area not only adds width to your shoulders but it also gives them a more complete beefy look in the back in area that's often underdeveloped so how do you target it let me show you the cables first and then I'll show you a dumbbell alternative so for cables start by setting the cable at wrist height like we did with the first exercise but this time rather than grabbing the cable behind your body grab the cable in front and rotate your body about 45\u00b0 towards the cable this slight adjustment lines up the tension perfectly more towards the rear part of your side belt from here raise your arm in a straight line away from the cable your arm should move slightly back behind your torso as you lift now you might not be able to raise your arm quite as high as you would in a standard lateral raise before it feels like your shoulder gets stuck and that's fine don't force it past that point simply focus on keeping the tension on the muscle now as for the dumbbell version first set up a bench at a slight incline just one notch down from vertical support your chest against the bench let your arms hang straight down in front of you and then raise them out to your sze you're also not going to be able to go very heavy with these so focus on form rather than weight while this variation doesn't provide quite as much stretch or challenge in the bottom position it's still an excellent option that targets the same area but before you jump into these two exercises there's one key principle you need to apply see the tricky thing about lateral raises is you're not lifting nearly as heavy compared to other exercises which means a small increase like 5 lb on nubells or moving one pin down on the cables can be the equivalent to adding 40 lbs to your bench press in one jump so what often happens is you think you're ready to increase the weights but as soon as you do your form completely breaks down leaving you stuck doing the same weights forever but here's the good news research shows you can build muscle either by adding more weight or by doing more reps this opens up a smarter way to progress and here's what I do I stick to a broad rep range of 10 to 20 reps once I can perform at least 15 controlled reps across all my sets that's when I'll bump up the weight but when I'm using cables where even one pin heavier can be too much I'll use a simple hack grabbing a 5 lb or even a 2.5 plate and stick it the pin through it to make much smaller jumps this smaller adjustment allows me to keep progressing without sacrificing my form but here's the thing guys you also need to program these two exercises into your routine with the right balance of volume and recovery for your specific body and that is why I am super excited to share that in January I'm launching something my team and I have been working on for years a brand new product designed to take care of your entire fitness

    "title": "How to Get MORE Growth In Less Time (3 Gym Hacks)",
    "published_at": "2023-11-05T14:00:05Z",
    "transcript": "is it possible to work out half as much as you are right now do just a few 30 minute workouts per week and build just as much if not more muscle according to the latest science yes there's three time-saving strategies that have been shown to be most effective I'll show you how to properly apply them to your workouts to get more gains and less time so the first strategy has to do with your workout volume during a workout the first few sets you do for a muscle give the most gains but as you do more and more sets you get less growth relative to the additional effort you're putting in eventually you actually reach a point where you don't get any additional growth from doing more sets and may even result in muscle loss if you take it way too AP so to save time in the gym you want to do the least number of sets that still gets you a solid return in gains and there's a few studies we can look at to find what that amount is one study from back in 2002 had trained subjects to just one set of bench press and one set of leg press three times a week for 12 weeks despite the extremely low volume in this case just three sets per muscle per week they were still able to build a bit of muscle another study took a different approach they had subjects do 27 sets for their quads every single week after 4 months they measured how much muscle was built and then split the subjects into one of three groups one group dropped their volume to just nine sets per week another dropped to just three cents per week and the final group didn't lift at all after 8 months at this new volume the no lifting group's muscles returned back to normal the three set per week group were able to maintain their new gains whereas the nine set per week group ended up gaining even more muscle now the last study I want to look at before providing some recommendations is a metaanalysis led by Brad shenfeld they compared 1 to 5 5 to9 and 10 plus sets per muscle per week what they discovered is a dose response relationship between muscle growth and the number of sets per form with 10 plus sets per muscle per week resulting in the most growth but what's interesting is that the 5 to n set group still experience about 80% of the max gains and the one to five set group we still able to get about 60% of it so based on the research we have so far it seems likely that three sets per muscle per week is probably enough to maintain your gains and maybe even build a little muscle depending on how inexperienced you are but 4 to seven sets per muscle per week is likely the sweet spot to get the most gains with the least amount of time and effort now at the end of the video I'll give you guys some free time-saving workout routines that take care of all the sets reps and exercises for you but for now here's an example of what this could look like with a 3-day per week full body workout that would train each muscle with around six sets per week assuming 2 minutes rest between sets and 1 minute transition time between exercises the whole workout could be completed in as little as 30 minutes and you can also just apply this strategy to your current routine by cutting down the number of sets and or exercises on all your workouts or just do so on days where you're busy or just not feeling it and need a quick workout however if you are going to go with this minimal volume there's three things you need to start doing in all your workouts to continue making almost as much or possibly even more gains than you were before first off research has shown that The Closer you train to failure the more growth you'll get but also the more fatigue you'll create in your case you don't have that many sets to recover from so to get the most growth possible every single set you should be pushing at least one to two reps short of failure and even going all the way to failure on exercises where it's safe to do so second since you're only doing a limited number of exercises it's crucially you pick the ones that are most likely to give the most Gaines and there is a really exciting area of research called long muscle length training basically it seems like some muscles May respond better to exercises that challenge them the most when they're in a stretch position I cover this research in more depth than and explain exactly what exercises to do for what muscle groups in my past video which I'll link in the description box down below and at the end of the video and lastly you need to dial in your form every single rep you do matters that much more now some of you may be wondering what if I don't want to do less what if I still want to train at the optimal volume and use other ways to cut down my time or what if I want to make my minimalist workout even more time efficient this is where the next two time saving strategies coming handy so you've probably heard of super sets where you do two exercises back to back with no rest while this can cut your workout time down in half most people don't do them properly and end up compromising their gains the key is to use what's known as antagonist super sets this involves doing an exercise that works one muscle and then almost immediately after doing an exercise that works the opposite muscle this way one muscle is resting while the other is working but how long it takes you to catch your breath between the two exercises seems to be important one study showed that keeping the transition time as short as possible no longer than a minute led to a unique benefit where subjects could actually do more reps than they could when they took longer rest or just perform the exercises without super sets however keep in mind that suets will only work if you're still pushing your muscles close to failure every set so just take as long as rest as you need to prevent your cardio from holding your back now here is a list of the best antagonist super sets that you can start apply to your routine but also don't feel limited to just these you can basically superset any two exercises that don't train the exact same muscles and wouldn't be overly fatiguing when done back to back bench press with calf raises chest flies with lateral raises and leg extensions or leg curls with pretty much any nearby upper body exercise are all great examples but if there's any exercises you can't end up super setting or would just prefer not to this is where the next method can come in handy so usually you do a set of an exercise rest do another set and repeat until you've completed your desired number of sets but with strategy three you do your first set until you can't do any more reps decrease the weight and immediately do as many reps as you can and continue dropping the weight until you complete about two or three drop sets in total now before I share what exercises you should and should not apply this method to I know what some of you may be thinking won't this reduce the amount of weight and Reps I can do leading to less gain while that is true drops has take advantage of what's commonly known as effective reps let's say you're doing a set of 10 reps to failure the first few reps you do contribute very little to muscle growth it's the last few reps when the muscles are being pushed to their absolute limit where the most growth happens so even though you're decreasing the weight journe each drop set your muscles are already exhausted from your previous set to the point that every additional rep it does now is far more effective for growth this is likely the mechanism behind why a handful of studies and a recent 2022 metaanalysis which is basically a study of Studies have all shown drop sets to provide the same and in some cases even more growth despite cutting workouts down to a third of the time but you should only use this on certain exercises keep in mind that during every set you have to train to failure so you need to use exercises where it's safe to do so and also really quick to decrease the weight for each drop set lateral raises arms exercises dumbbell chest presses calf raises and many machine exercises are all great options I definitely wouldn't apply this to squats and dead list and only with bench press if you have a good spotter now as for how many drop sets to do one stud you replace three normal sets with one normal set followed by two drop sets whereas another study replaced three normal sets with one normal set followed by four drop sets in both studies the drop set group led to similar growth as a normal group so I'd say try to at at least match the total number of sets including your drop sets with how many normal sets you usually do lastly as for how much to lower the weight during each drop set the study protocol is usually decreased by 20% at a time so don't drop by too much or too little you probably won't be able to do as many reps as you could do during the previous set but you should definitely be able to get more than a few just make sure you're still tracking how much weight and how many reps you're doing and try to progress this over time just like you would with normal sets so as promised I created three timesaving workout routines for you guys to download There's a 3-day 4-day and a 5day per week workout routine for you guys to pick from each workout can be done in as little as 30 minutes now I have designed these with the optimal volume but within each PDF I also explain how you could cut it down to the minimalist volume we talked about earlier if you wanted to save even more time and you can

    "published_at": "2024-08-25T13:00:01Z",
    "transcript": "a broad chiseled back is key to achieving that Greek god look but with over 15 different muscles training your back isn't as simple as your other muscles take me for example my Filipino genetics didn't bless me with a natural vaber and for years my back barely grew even with all the best exercises but recently my back has blown up it's broader and thicker than it's ever been and the crazy part is all it took was three key exercises that I guarantee will do the same for your back but only if you nail down the proper form but before we dive into the exercises here's the problem with your back so when you train a single muscle group like your chest it's pretty straightforward you just need to get that muscle to activate but with the back it's a different story with so many muscles it's easy for your stronger ones to take over leaving your weaker ones underdeveloped so using our understanding of biomechanics I'll show you how to modify each exercise to ensure you're actually hitting the right parts of your back let's start with your lats the muscle that gives your back that coveted V taper when this muscle is well developed you'll be able to do a lat spread flexing them as if you had wings a clear sign you've made some good gains fortunately the lats are usually one of the most underdeveloped muscles for us gim Bros take me for example after years of back training my biceps forearms and some parts of my back definitely grew but my lats barely noticeable to fix this you can't just train the lats as if they're one big muscle instead they should should be split up into two main areas the upper and lower lats we'll start with the area most people struggle with the lower lats so most people's go-to for lats is a standard lat pull down but despite its name it's not actually the best exercise to really Target the lats we need to make some adjustments you see typically during pull Downs your elbows are forced to flare out like chicken wings which is great for the muscles around the shoulder blades but not as good for hitting the lats to work the lats more you want your elbows tight tight against your body as you pull but if you're holding the bar too wide that's just not possible instead your hands should be about shoulder width apart and ideally in a neutral position because when you twist your palms inwards that naturally brings your elbows in so your best option is a bar like this but if your gym doesn't have that you can use a v bar and if you don't have that you can still make it work with a normal lat pull down bar but using an underhand grip while this will get the biceps more involved it's still more effective for the lats than the normal overhand grip plus there's a way to reduce how much we use our biceps and Target our lats instead in fact you want to do this trick no matter which grip you use it's simple rather than pulling the weight straight down with your hands focus on pulling from your elbows visualize them moving in the slight Arc in front of your body and then back and down towards your hips at the same time pull your shoulders down away from your ears keep pulling until your elbows are in line with your to torso then control the way up but here's a really important part at the top fully extend your arms and let your shoulders rise up for a deep stretch in the lats why well plenty of new research suggest that if you do reps without fully stretching your muscles you're missing not on a ton of gains but aside from just making sure your shoulders come up for that deep stretch there's another way we can use this study to grow our lats even more see the laat pull down like most back exercises it's hardest at the bottom and because you're a responsible gym goer once you can't get the bar all the way down you stop rather than use bad form right but here's the thing that might actually be a mistake as we mentioned most of the gains seem to come from the top of the lap pull down when the muscle is stretched so once you can't do any more full Reps don't stop keep going by doing as many half reps as you can in that top stretch position okay on to the upper lats the most important area for creating that Vaper believe me once I finally started hitting this area properly I noticed a huge difference in just how wide my upper body looked even wearing a t-shirt first I'll show you how to Target them using a cable rope and then I'll show you another really good option but with dumbbells now just like the pull down the way most people row hardly uses their lats at all often their biceps or their traps end up doing a lot of the work I'll show you how to fix this mistake but first there's a few other important changes to make let's start with your grip again for the lats you IDE want to grip where your hands are shoulder width apart with the Palms facing in the VB bar can work if that's all you have but the dumbbell alternative I'll show you in just a minute is also an excellent choice the next tweak you want to make has to do with your torso instead of rowing upright brace your core and lean forward slightly this not only lines up the tension more with your upper lats but will also allow for a deeper stretch at the end of each rep next to best Engage The Lots think about pulling the elbows back into down towards your hips similar to The Arc motion from the previous exercise but to prevent your biceps from taking over pay attention to your forearms the more they Bend upwards the less flats and the more biceps you'll end up using Instead try to keep your forearms parallel to the floor by focusing simply on pulling the elbows back and down once your elbow reaches your torso control the weight back fully extending your arms and letting your shoulders rise up to get as deep of a stretch in your lats as possible now as as promised I do have an excellent alternative that you're probably familiar with dumbbell Rose but with two key adjustments instead of a flat bench incline it slightly lean one arm on the bench and then put your opposite back leg far out to the side this setup makes the exercise far more stable and just less awkward next brace your core and think about driving your elbow down towards your hips in that same arcan motion as before think about it as if you're sweeping the floor with the weight keep the elbow tight to your sides and this time to prevent the biceps from taking over try to keep your forarm vertical as you pull now as you get closer to the top your body is going to want to rotate your torso to make it easier fight the Temptation keep your back flat pull until the elbow reaches your torso then control the weight back down lastly whether you use cables or dumbbells once you can't do any more full reps just remember to keep going by doing as many half reps as you can in that stretch position okay on to our final exercise which will now focus on building your back thickness to do so we're again going to use a cable row but this time modified to hit the mid and upper back muscles your traps rhomboids and rear delts and don't worry again I'll show you an excellent dumbbell alternative and then also show you guys a special drop set technique that's personally helped me blow up my traps let's dive in so unlike the lats the mid and upper back muscles are better worked when the elbows are angled out from the body and you'll actually see people in the gym try to do this but using a narrow grip so their elbows are kind of flared out but not enough to really work the mid and upper back so to fix this we actually need a wide grip a bit wider than shoulder width so in this case an overhand grip on the lat pull down bar works perfectly but to better Target the mid and upper back rather than the Lots this time rather than leaning forwards Lean Back slightly brace your core and pull the bar back and up towards your chest letting your elbows flare out in an arrow shape squeeze your shoulder blades together at the end and control the weight back down but remember the stretch is super important for growth so open up your shoulder blades as wide as possible at the end of the rep to fully stretch out your traps now you can easily do this with dumbbells instead by using an incline bench as a chest support and doing the same Row in motion a t- bar row also is an excellent choice but regardless of what variation you use this's a special technique I've been doing at the end of my sets that I honestly feel like is what made all the difference for my traps and it's simple after you can't do any more full reps continue the set with half reps just like I explained earlier but don't stop there once you can't do any more half reps rather than pulling with your arms keep them straight with your shoulder blades opened up then squeeze them together hard almost as if you were doing a shrug open up your shoulder blades again and repeat this for as many reps as you can until the weight just won't budge it's intense but trust me you're going to feel the pump of your life and I guarantee your traps will blow up really quickly from this so here's a breakdown of the full workout now you may want to adjust the volume or even add additional exercises depending on your body and goals but rather than trying to figure all of that out on your own I'd highly recommend just following a simple science back program that takes care of all the guesswork for you these programs are incredibly effective and cover not just your workouts but your nutrition as well to join today

    "title": "BIGGER QUADS: 5 Mistakes Keeping Your Legs Skinny",
    "published_at": "2022-08-14T16:06:41Z",
    "transcript": "if you're like me and appreciate a well-rounded physique then you care about your leg development and understand its importance in balancing out the upper body but developing an impressive set of legs isn't just about working hard there's five mistakes people make that severely limit their leg growth today i'll explain what those are go through how to fix them and then show you how to implement this into your routine so you can start seeing leg growth fast so before we dive into the mistakes let's take a quick look at the muscles we'll be focusing on the quadriceps the quadriceps or quads for short are a group of four muscles located in the front of your legs they're the most voluminous muscle in the body and one well developed are the key to creating the impressive set of legs you're after but the fact that there's four different quad muscles means that you need to choose your exercises carefully and while some people can simply squat and see great quad development others aren't so lucky to find out why that is let's dive into the first training mistake barbell squats are often recommended as the best exercise to grow bigger legs one issue with barbell squats however is they demand a lot from your core and lower back muscles to help stabilize the weight in fact if we take a look at research analyzing muscle activation of the back squat the lower back muscles are highly activated almost as much as some of the quad muscles are now this isn't a bad thing but if your main goal is to grow your legs then it can be an issue because what some of you may experience when squatting is that your lower back muscles will actually end up fatiguing first before your quads have reached anywhere near their limit this is exactly what i personally experience whenever i squat and this is where machines can come in handy exercises like the hack squat with the use of the back support help minimize the stability demands of the exercise and as a result you'll be able to truly push your quads close to their limits without having to worry about other muscles fatiguing first unfortunately most gyms don't have a good hack squat machine in this case another option is to use a smith machine squat yes you heard me right as shown in a 2014 emg analysis the added stability significantly reduces the demands placed on the lower back muscles and as a result can help you push your quads closer to their limits and no for those wondering as shown in a recent 2022 review machines don't seem to be any less effective at building muscle than free weights and in the case of the quads the right machine can potentially be even more effective so don't be afraid to use them at the end of the video i'm going to show you how to apply machine work into your routine but first i want to show you a way to make regular barbell squats even more effective at targeting your quads we're gonna cover that right now in mistake number two the next mistake has to do with your exercise execution so by tweaking your form during your leg exercises you can actually shift more of the focus to your quads rather than other muscles like your glutes and the lower back the way we do this mainly has to do with the angle of your shin it's been shown that the more forward your shin angle is the greater the knee movement and the more the quads will be involved compared to the glutes and lower back muscles to illustrate this if you were to compare these two squats the one on the right with the more forward shin angle would be providing far greater tension on the quads now some people they naturally squat in this quad dominant style and probably aren't watching this video because they've got big quads but most of you watching likely have limited ankle mobility which makes achieving this quad dominant squat very difficult to help with this one option is to invest in a pair of lifting shoes for a slight heel lift and i'll leave a link in the description box down below to a budget friendly one that i recommend another option however is to simply use a couple weight plates to elevate your heels onto as you squat as we'll talk about in the next mistake though you will have to use considerably lighter weight but this tip it doesn't just apply to squats for example a 2008 paper analyzed the muscle activation during the leg press researchers found that a low foot placement generated significantly greater quads involvement than either a standard or high foot placement why well if you've been paying close attention you probably realize that a low foot placement allows a greater forward chain angle and as a result will emphasize the quads more however again ankle mobility will still be a limiter for how low you can place your feet but play around with how low you can go and again consider using lifting shoes to help out with this and lastly you can also apply this concept to lunges and bulgarian split squats as well rather than keeping your knee directly over your foot let your knee and shin travel forward and try using the heel elevation on your front foot to create an even greater forward chain angle to emphasize the quads even more there is however one thing you need to be mindful of after applying this tip and this is where the next mistake comes in so by applying the previous tips to your exercises you'll have successfully reduced the tension placed on other muscles like the glutes and the lower back and move that tension to the quads but as a result of this you're not going to be able to lift nearly as heavy as you used to for example you may have been able to easily squat 2 45 plates on each side with your normal form but with your heel elevated quad focus form this may initially go down all the way to just one plate on each side this is expected because you're now forcing your weaker quads to do the work and don't be alarmed your muscles can't tell how heavy the weight is you're lifting it only cares about the amount of tension that's placed on it so it's absolutely crucial not just for a heel elevated squat but for all your leg exercises that you don't let your ego get the best of you and let your body cheat to get other muscles to help out control the weight and spend about two to three seconds on the way down of every single rep and you'll experience far more growth in your quads despite using lighter weight the next mistake has to do with your workout programming remember how your quads are made up of four muscles well one of them is special it's called the rectus femoris it detaches at the pelvis and travels down the middle of your thigh because of its unique anatomy during classic leg exercises like squats and leg presses the rectus femoris doesn't get very well activated when compared to the other three quad muscles this muscle is instead best activated in the exercises like the leg extension or the [\u00a0__\u00a0] squat where only your knees extend and your hips remain locked in place up until now we've mostly had muscle activation studies to support this and some research showing the rectus for mars doesn't grow very much from squatting but a recent 2021 study really put this theory to the test they had a group of subjects performed out of the squat or the leg extension for five weeks and measured the growth of three different sites in the rectus femoris muscle the result the leg extension group experienced statistically significant growth in the rectus femoris at all three measurement sites while the squad group didn't see significant growth at any of the sites after we go through the last mistake i'm going to show you how to tweak your routine to make sure your rectus for mars doesn't get left behind but for now let's talk about mistake number five the last mistake has to do with effort we know that to maximize growth you need to push yourself hard enough during your sets to reach at least within three reps of failure which is the point where you couldn't do one more rep with good form if you're left dependent on it the problem is even when training the upper body research has shown that most people don't push themselves hard enough to reach this point so when it comes to your leg days be honest with yourself are you truly pushing yourself hard enough or do you stop your sets when you just start to feel the burn and in reality could have done five or even ten more reps given the sheer size of the quad muscles and the blood flow it receives this is not going to feel comfortable but the willingness to push through this discomfort is often what separates those who have an oppressive set of legs from those who don't now to help with this consider using a pre-workout supplement i personally take pre-workouts specifically on my leg days as they've been shown to provide a greater benefit for lower body strength than upper body strength likely because of just how much harder you have to push yourself mentally on those days but regardless give it your all and remember that on the other side of that discomfort is the growth that you've been seeking all right we learned a lot today so let's quickly cover how to apply it to your routine first if you're doing regular barbell squats and not feeling that much in your quads try temporarily switching that for a heel elevated squat or machine like a hack squat or smith machine squat and for your leg presses and split squats consider using the quad focus form as showed to further emphasize the quads second after you do your big leg exercises don't forget about throwing in a leg extension and or a [\u00a0__\u00a0] squat at the end of your workouts to emphasize a rectus femoris that special quad muscle that we talked about earlier and lastly as you do this lighten the weight so your quads are forced to do the work or push yourself hard to reach close enough to failure for your quads to actually grow implement this and you'll very quickly start to feel and see the difference in your quads development but it's important that you take the same step-by-step science-based approach to all the muscles you train if you want to maximize your efforts for a plan that puts us all together for you and has helped thousands of others just like you transform their bodies just head on over to buildwithscience.com and take our analysis quiz to discover the best plan for you and your body also we focused a lot on the quads in this video but it's important that you don't neglect your other lower body muscles like the glutes you can click here

    "title": "How Hard Should You Workout To Build Muscle? (AVOID THIS MISTAKE!)",
    "published_at": "2020-06-07T16:48:16Z",
    "transcript": "when it comes to maximizing muscle growth in the gym it's common belief that the hardest worker in the gym is clearly going to get the most gains right I mean if you have the ability to do so then surely pushing yourself to the limit to get that extra rep or to every single set is going to lead to more muscle growth and strength now well though this does have some merit the truth is that in the case of how hard you should be training it seems that training smarter instead of just treating and harder leads to better gains with less effort but just how hard should you be trading to maximize growth well the answer this question let's start with the theory behind being the hardest worker in the gym which typically involves taking every set of your workout to failure or in other words to the point where you simply can't perform another full rep without compromising your form and this is commonly thought as the best way to train for muscle growth for a few main reasons first is the idea of something called mechanical tension which we know is the main driver of muscle growth now in order to maximize mechanical tension and the resulting growth from each of your sets you need to be able to recruit as many muscle fibers in your muscles as possible during that set our research has shown is that as we do additional repetitions I get closer and closer to failure during a set the more motor unit recruitment and overall muscle activation our muscle experiences meaning that in theory training harder each set by going to failure would lead to more growth given the maximum motor unit recruitment and mechanical tension that experiences and second similar to motor unit recruitment muscle protein synthesis is lower when you don't train very hard in your sets as opposed to when you go to failure which again would theoretically mean more growth when you train a failure given the importance of protein synthesis levels for growth and lastly given the positive relationship we see between workout volume on muscle growth it would seem that pushing each set to failure to get that extra rep or two would increase the overall work of volume you're doing and lead to more growth as a result so with all that being said it seems that pushing each set as hard as you can during your workouts is sure to be your best bet for maximized growth right well not so fast because trading to failure does come with a cost not only is it unenjoyable foremost and requires a great deal of motivation to do every workout but it's also very fatiguing on the body in fact a research has shown that training to failure causes excessive muscle damage and extends your recovery time considerably with subjects generally requiring roughly 24 to 48 hours longer for the performance to fully recover when they train a failure as opposed to stopping short a failure journey set which is problematic because this delayed recovery and muscle damage can easily carry over into your next workers for the week and as a result hinder your performance in those workouts and research has shown that when this is done over long periods it eventually leads to a state of overtraining which results in a reduction in your anabolic hormones and basically just creates an environment in your body that is detrimental to building muscle now well though we've gone over the various benefits and potential downsides of pushing yourself to the limit and train it to failure every workout we still have yet to answer the question just how hard should you train a maximize growth and well it turns out that there is a sweet spot but to figure out what exactly the sweet spot is we need to go back and take a closer look at the theory behind training to failure to maximize growth because first of all although it's true that motor unit recruitment and muscle activation does increase as you approach failure in a set as shown in the following grass analyzing the shoulders and the trapezius muscles it actually seems to plateau at around 3 to 5 reps shy from failure meaning that if you knew you can do 15 reps of lateral raises and not a single more before your form broke down the performing just 10 to 12 reps out of that 15 by leaving a few reps in the tank would be sufficient to pretty much maximize your motor unit recruitment and the same is true with the muscle protein synthesis theory it seems that a fee trained close enough to failure by leaving just a few reps in the tank then you're able to still maximize muscle protein synthesis but without much of the extra fatigue that you get from going to failure and lastly although you would think that training to failure would result in more were Koval Youm since you're pushing to get that extra refer to each set that actually isn't the case research has shown that the muscular fatigue caused by going to failure in your first set causes your performance to suffer in your next sets leading to considerably less rest being performed those next sets whereas if you instead leave a few reps in the tanker in your first set your performance and subsequent sets doesn't suffer nearly as much and you're able to perform more reps during those latter stresses of results as a result of this by the end of the workout all the subjects in this study ended up performing the same amount of volume but those who trained to failure required a lot more effort to do so so based on these findings it seems that taking your sets just shy of failure by leaving roughly one to three reps in the tank it's gonna be your best bet since this still enables you to maximize your motor unit recruitment and work of all you but with less effort and without compromising your recovery what does research say though well the majority of research out there especially recent and well-designed papers are in support of this and have found that as long as you're taking your sets close enough to failure by stopping each set with just three reps or so on the tank then you'll experience the same amount of growth as you would were compared to taking the sets to complete failure I'm probably the best evidence of this to date is a 2019 paper from the journal strength and conditioning Research which had ten subjects perform the leg extension to failure on one leg whereas on the other leg they instead stopped one to three reps short of failure journeys to their sets after 14 weeks despite both legs performing the same amount of volume the non failure leg actually ended up seeing slightly better growth strength and muscular endurance when compared to the failure leg suggesting that you may even reap slightly better gains when you leave a rep return the tech during your sets however do keep in mind on the other end of the spectrum research has shown a stopping well short of failure so for example stopping five reps and a set when you could have done 10 reps - failure is inferior for muscle growth meaning that it is crucial that you do get close enough to failure during your sets in order to still maximize growth and that doesn't mean that your training becomes easy or walk in the park because that's not the case at all I mean for example here I'm doing a set of curls I'm taking the set to true complete failure which as you can see is extremely taxing and fatiguing to do especially first thing in the morning but even if I had stock 1 to 3 reps short of the very last rep that I did you can still tell that it's still a very demanding and hard set to do and unfortunately even though you should be stopping a few reps short of failure most people underestimate the amount of reps that they can actually do to failure and end up training too easy as a result and this was shown in a 20-17 paper that had subjects ranging from beginners to intermediate stew experts in the gym try to predict how many reps that they can do to failure during their sets of various exercises they found that subjects significantly under predicted the number of reps that they could do to failure with the least experienced lifters under predicted by around 4 to 5 reps on average and the most experienced lifters under predicted by around 1 to 2 reps on average meaning that your ability to predict how many reps that you can actually do all out in a set improves as you gain more experience which implies that if you're relatively new in the gym and drastically underestimated what you're capable of this can be detrimental to your gains given the importance of pushing our sets close enough to true failure if we want to maximize growth aside from just gaining more experience though one way that you can ensure that you're actually pushing hard enough during your sets for an exercise is to dedicate a day where you use a spotter and try to get as many reps as you can injure in each of your sets so let's say that for the benchpress you managed to hit 10 reps 8 reps then 6 reps by going all-out trying to get as many reps as possible each set at a certain weight what you can do now is add these reps up together to get a total and then divide this number by the number of sets that you did so in this case it would be 3 and this number then gives you a good in the of what you want to aim for next time as it'll represent the theoretical number of reps that you'll be able to hit per set without going to complete failure you can always adjust accordingly if that ends up being too tough or too easy but you just want to use that number as the baseline to progress from as you get stronger and as that becomes too easy so to conclude based on the research that we have to date it seems that leaving roughly one to three reps in the tank during each of your sets is the best way to maximize growth would though accumulate in excessive fatigue I'd argue that this is particularly important to implement for your big compound movements not only because they're more fatiguing but also since the risk of injury starts to become more of a concern with them when you go to failure in your form starts to break down for your isolation movements though given that they're less taxing you can likely get away with doing these sets closer to failure and even taking some of these sets to failure as long as you're still recovering well and incorporating DLO tweaks as needed ball on all it's clear that constantly pushing for that extra rep or two isn't always a good thing as it provides very little additional stimulation for the huge jump of fatigue that you get in return so train hard but if you want to see the best results in the long run that you need to train smart as well now for step by step program that applies this and takes care of all the guesswork for you by showing you exactly how to optimally train and eat week after week in order to build muscles efficiently as possible with science then simply head on over to build with science calm and take the analysis quiz to discover

    "title": "Why The Bench Press Isn&#39;t Growing Your Chest",
    "published_at": "2021-04-11T15:00:09Z",
    "transcript": "the bench press is one of the most popular movements for the upper body and at first glance it seems fairly simple to perform in reality though for many of us it tends to be a movement that frequently causes discomfort in the shoulders elbows and wrists or is just a movement that we have trouble really feeling activate our chest and most of these problems are due to our individual anatomy as the way that our bones are structured and muscles are aligned will affect how exactly we should perform this movement in terms of things like grip width elbow angle and so on for example a less experienced taller individual with longer arms and a relatively flatter chest will have a bench press setup that looks quite different than a more experienced shorter individual with shorter arms and a bigger well-developed chest and if one tried to copy the other simply because it felt good for the other person they would likely end up with aches and pains over time and wouldn't be growing their chest as well as they could be with this exercise if they had tweaked their form based on their individual anatomy in this video we're going to show you how you can do just that in three easy steps but before diving into each of these steps i first want to pre-frame the video by emphasizing how the bench press is not absolutely necessary for you to do for some individuals it's a great effective movement at growing the chest and the overall upper body musculature whereas for others it's just not the best exercise for their structure especially since the barbell forces you into a fixed hand position so if your main goal right now is to build muscle rather than increasing your bench press and strength just realize that you can accomplish this just as effectively with other exercises like machine presses dumbbells and even push-ups if properly progressed the bench press isn't the end-all-be-all chest exercise and you don't need to force yourself to do it if you find it's just not a good fit for you and your body but before you actually make that decision run through the following three steps i'm about to go through as much of the discomfort and problems that you may be experiencing with the bench press is likely due to a problem with your setup the first thing you need to do is determine what elbow angle is going to best activate your chest while minimizing any shoulder or elbow discomfort as you press the way we do this is by aligning your elbow angle with where the majority of your chest fibers run which will vary for each individual for most people an elbow angle of somewhere around 45 degrees to about 70 degrees will best line up with and activate their chest fibers when they press while being the most comfortable on the shoulder joint if you flare your elbows too much and go above this range to 90 degrees for example this has not only been shown to increase the risk of shoulder impingement but will also shift more of the tension away from the chest and onto the front delts similarly going below 45 degrees by tucking the elbows too much will again shift more of the tension away from the chest and onto the front delts since they'll now be better aligned to do work so what i'd suggest is just play around within this range to see what feels best for you to do so you can simply mimic a bench pressing motion and just focus on contracting your chest using different elbow angles to see what best activates most of your chest fibers you can also just experiment with using dumbbells and just play around with the elbow position one of the things that you'll notice is that a lower elbow angle will bias more of your upper chest fibers whereas a more flared out elbow angle will bias more of your mid and lower chest fibers the key is just to find the sweet spot that feels the best in terms of overall chest activation and comfort on your joints once you determine roughly what elbow angle is best for you and your body it's now time to set up your grip width to enable you to actually use that elbow angle as you press the way you do this is by ensuring that at the bottom of the press your forearms are vertical with your elbows stacked directly under your wrists both from the front view and the side view if you use a grip that's too narrow for example your forearms will tend to angle inwards this shifts more the emphasis to your triceps rather than your chest and over time can also create quite a bit of stress in your wrists elbows and shoulders on the other hand if you use a grip that's too wide your forearms will tend to angle outwards this can again create more stress on your joints while limiting the range of motion that your chest goes through as you press also keep in mind that if in step one you chose an elbow angle that's tucked a bit more to around 45 degrees then you'll have to use a more narrow grip in order to get your forearms lined up properly whereas if you chose a more flared out elbow angle in step one then you'll need to use a slightly wider grip so play around with the different grip widths take a look at your forearms at the bottom position and record yourself from the front and side view just to double check that they're reliant once you nail this down you should notice significantly more tension placed on your chest rather than on other muscle groups like your shoulders or triceps lastly as you press you want to maintain at least some degree of an arch in your upper back rather than keeping it completely flat against the bench this helps activate more of your chest specifically the mid and lower fibers by putting them in a better aligned position to do work while also keeping your shoulders in a safer position but as for how much of an arch you should use this is going to depend on your individual chest fibers the structure of your sternum and the overall size of your chest as well generally though most people will get the best activation somewhere between an arch that isn't completely flat against the bench but also isn't as exaggerated as a power lifters are for example so again with this step play around with it to find the optimal position where you feel the most activation in your chest with minimal discomfort on your joints and there you have it go through the step-by-step process experiment with it and find what works best for you and your body if you want to build muscle as effectively as possible while minimizing your risk of injury then you need to not only pick the right exercises but you also need to ensure that you set up and execute them in the right way and in a way that's based on your individual structure for a step-by-step program that does just that for you by showing you exactly how to train and how to eat week after week so that you can transform your specific body as fast as scientifically possible and simply head on over to buildwithscience.com and take our analysis quiz to discover which of our

    "published_at": "2018-01-02T15:24:06Z",
    "transcript": "it seems simple if you're overweight focus on fat loss if you're skinny and underweight focus on gaining muscle but what about when you're stuck between the two also known as skinny fat well to figure this out let's first take a look at what exactly skinny fat is and what causes it skinny fat can be characterized as a physique that doesn't necessarily look overweight but severely lacks muscle definition therefore despite often having relatively low levels of body fat they still look soft and out of shape and we see this in both males and females and the journey to skinny fat usually begins with focusing too much on weight loss instead of improving body composition how much muscle compared to fat you're carrying around matters a lot more in terms of aesthetics and merely how much you weigh and when you have too little muscle compared to fat this is when you wind up looking skinny fat you see when you have a decent amount of muscle you can still look good at higher levels of body fat than those with less muscle now that we understand what skinny fat is let's take a look at the three most common mistakes people make that are causing this problem and what we can do to solve them I think is clear based on the definition of skinny fat that a lack of sufficient muscle mass is a major problem contributing to this body type thus neglecting resistance training is the major mistake those with skinny fat body types are making in addition although you may actually currently be lifting weights you may be also doing one of the following mistakes not focusing on getting stronger especially with compound lifts or performing mainly lighter weight high rep training both of these mistakes will inhibit you from building the adequate muscle mass needed to get rid of that skinny fat look I think you all know by now that in order to lose body fat you need to feed your body a bit less energy than it burns by eating at a caloric deficit however when you take this to the extreme and incorporate diets that cause severe caloric restriction for example over 1,000 calories below your maintenance you're eating a lot less energy than your body burns and as shown in this study by Falcone at all since protein intake is highly correlated with energy intake you're likely not going to be eating adequate protein since you're not ingesting a lot of food to begin with this causes two problems one as shown in this study by Garrow and call these a large caloric deficit with an adequate protein causes large amounts of muscle loss this causes us to run into problem two which is shown in this study by Redmond and colleagues results in a dramatic drop in your metabolism which prevents further fat loss as a result we end up at virtually the same body fat we started out at but with less muscle hence the skinny fat body type usually what's accompanied with severe caloric restriction is excessive cardio specifically steady-state cardio unfortunately research like this study by Hanson natal tends to show that too much endurance training interferes with strength and muscle growth now this doesn't mean that you shouldn't do any cardio and totally ignore training your cardiovascular system it just means that overdoing it can definitely lead to that skinny fat physique now that we know the main problems contributing to a skinny fat body type let's take a look at a three-step solution the first step is to start lifting heavy weights with a focus on getting stronger with compound lifts use something like an upper lower split and incorporate lifts like the bench press squat and deadlift as these are great exercises that you need to focus on progressively getting stronger with each week I suggest sticking to the same program for months at a time for this reason as opposed to switching up your workouts every week but you need to ensure that you're really pushing yourself to get stronger simply go into the gym to get a little pump isn't going to cut it in this case step two is to cut down your cardio to a reasonable amount if you're currently doing hours of cardio daily i'm not going to provide exact numbers here as it will vary for everyone but essentially you should be focusing and spending more time on resistance training than you do on cardio this step is definitely the most important one but is also where it gets a little more complicated as it will depend on a lot of factors but I've summed it all up into an easy-to-follow flowchart for you guys if your caloric intake has been severely restricted meaning more than 1,000 calories below your maintenance you want to reverse diet by adding in 150 calories into your diet per week until you reach your maintenance calories from here focus on getting stronger while eating at maintenance which will help promote body recomposition meaning that you'll be able to build muscle and lose fat at the same time if your caloric intake hasn't been restricted that if you currently have a high body fat percentage for example more than 20% for women and more than 15% for men then cut with a 20% caloric deficit until you get your body fat below those numbers and then you can reverse diet to a lean bulk if on the other hand you have average levels of body fat then if you've been training for less than two years or have taken a break from the gym for over two months you want to eat at maintenance calories and focus on gaming strength since as shown in several studies you'll be more likely to benefit from a body recomposition if you've been training for more than two years you want to eat at a slight surplus and lean bulk while focusing on getting stronger keep in mind that regardless of where you fall in the chart you need to ensure your protein intake is adequate although the exact amount will vary for everyone this study from McMaster University found that a minimum of 0.6 to 0.8 grams of protein per pound of body weight will maximize muscle protein synthesis for those who are resistance training so you want to at least hit that range and consider even going higher which as shown in these two studies seems to promote body recomposition and is beneficial if you're eaten at a caloric deficit so to sum up the video what you want to do is the following one stick to a weightlifting program and focus on getting stronger every week to cut down your cardio if it's currently excessive and focused more on resistance training and three adjust your caloric intake based on the flow chart I provided while ensuring your protein intake is still adequate thanks for watching guys I hope you enjoyed the video and found it useful but before I finish I just want to say that one caution that I'd like to mention is that if you are a teenager then I would strongly advise against any sort of caloric restriction in your diet because this can interfere with your growth since your body isn't fully matured yet having a little bit of baby fat at your age is completely normal and will start to thin out once you reach puberty and your testosterone spikes so unless you are extremely overweight then I would highly suggest that you just focus on eating healthy and Whole Foods and folk getting stronger with good form of the gym I also wanted to give you guys a huge thank you for helping me reach a hundred thousand subscribers I remember the day when I reached a hundred subscribers and I honestly couldn't believe it so for you guys to help me reach a hundred thousand it really means a lot to me and I appreciate it anyways that's it for this video guys I wish you all a Happy New Year and I'll see you next time [Music]"

    "published_at": "2023-08-13T13:00:15Z",
    "transcript": "this is the world's cheapest fat loss meal plan these poor meals come up to just over five dollars a day they're absolutely delicious and dead simple to make today I'll show you exactly what to buy how to prep it I will also see just how much fat my best friend Jeff can lose following this meal plan for seven days so each meal contains a minimum of 20 grams of protein with a grand total of around 2 000 calories and over 150 grams of protein for most of you guys watching this might already be the perfect amount of calories and protein for you to start losing fat but later in the video I'll show you how to tweak the plan more precisely and based on your body weight and gender now before we dive into the first recipe it's crucial that you buy the cheapest ingredients possible and this starts by shopping at the Right grocery store and to find the best option I created a sample healthy food cart across five of the most popular Grocers and then rank them from most to least expensive Whole Foods camo on top no surprise there Trader Joe's was around 20 bucks cheaper followed by Kroger Walmart and then finally the winner coming in at less than half the price of the exact same cart at Whole Foods all day unfortunately there's no Aldi close to where I live so while I will use their pricing I'll be getting the ingredients from the next best option on the list Walmart speaking of ingredients I now had to find what healthy foods were the cheapest and after a ton of searching and crutch to the numbers here's the protein carbs and fat sources I found that give the most bang for your buck and are what I heavily relied on to create today's four meals let's start with meal number one so overnight oats is when I personally eat every single morning for breakfast before my workout so it's great to see that all the ingredients were budget friendly it takes less than five minutes to make and you can make the night before and store it in the fridge simply use a mason jar or any container or bowl and first add in the oats zero percent plain Greek yogurt and protein powder whoa whoa German protein powder that is expensive so despite its Rising costs if you buy in bulk and calculate the cost per gram of protein it actually comes out cheaper than salmon ground beef and Greek yogurt it actually ends up around the same price as eggs milk and canned tuna not to mention it tastes amazing it's convenient and it doesn't come with a ton of extra fat and calories like other protein sources do now I'm using chocolate flavored protein here but you can use any flavor your heart desires and if if you really don't want to use protein powder then you can simply add a bit more Greek yogurt instead next add about half a cup of water and then mix until everything is well combined pop it in the fridge and in the morning you could top it with a banana a tablespoon of peanut butter and a pinch of salt and if your ball on and you can afford it feel free to go premium at topple with some sugar-free syrup or a bit of honey so as tasty as these meals are chances are you're gonna get sick and tired of eating the exact same meals every day so this is why for Jeff's opening oats I actually made a few of them with the original recipe but for the next few I'd switch it up by using a vanilla protein powder instead of chocolate mixing in a diced Apple instead of the banana and also added in some cinnamon and don't worry later in this video I'll show you guys the exact sweet swabs you can make within all of your meals for the day to keep them interesting but for now let's move on to lunch good so one thing I've always hated about meal prep is the meals are only good for a few days before they get funky that's why for lunch we're having freezer burritos not only can these bad boys stay good for months but I was honestly shocked at how delicious they were even after sitting in the freezer for a week here's the ingredients per burrito and here's how to make them so first you need the right tortilla normally I'd recommend a whole grain tortilla for some extra fiber but in this case we've got a call from us white flour tortillas not only tend to be cheaper but they will also be easier to roll and stay intact the one I'm using is a large size and comes in at about 180 calories per tortilla now unfortunately our budget couldn't quite cover condiments or spices but I'm assuming you guys have the basics if you don't then please make a quick trip to your parents place and snag some salt garlic powder pepper and soy sauce these are key to making pretty much anything taste good oh and don't forget to borrow some cooking spray as well to save you a bunch of calories compared to using oil when you're cooking one once you've got all that dice up your chicken and cook in a pan with your pinto beans transfer that to a plate after it's done then chop up the onions and peppers and cook them in the same pan until soft and don't forget to season both the chicken and veggies with salt garlic and a little bit of soy sauce as it's cooking once cooked drain any liquid mix in your chicken and beans and then let it cool for about five to ten minutes this step is crucial to prevent breakage of our beautiful tortillas next toss a tortilla in the microwave for five to ten seconds to soften it up and prepare the stuffer now how much you suffer with depends on how many burritos you're prepping for you can weigh everything out to get exact but I'd recommend just doing your best to divide the portions by the number of burritos or make it for example if you're prepping four burritos cook four portions worth of ingredients and then simply divide the pan into four somewhat even portions then you're gonna add one portion to the middle lower third of the tortilla then top it with a serving of cheddar cheese don't worry the cheese is going to melt real nicely Once you thaw the burrito now once everything is added it's time for the make or break moment wrap it now I personally I get way too anxious doing this step so my lovely girlfriend will show you how it's done don't be nervous guys it's actually really simple all you do is fold up the two sides and then roll it down the middle and you're good to go once rolled wrap an aluminum foil or Saran Wrap toss in the freezer and then once you're ready to eat simply unwrap and heat it up in the microwave now in my microwave I took it straight from the freezer I hit the defrost button and after about five minutes it was good to go but this won't be the same for everyone so I'd recommend just using a low heat setting flip it over at least once and every couple minutes just check to see if it's heated to like it and you can also just take it out of the freezer and bring it to work or school let it naturally thaw and then quickly heat it up when you're ready to eat and if you have the time feel free to toast on the pan to get it nice and crispy and for you Big Spenders who can afford it feel free to make this premium with a side of salsa or hot sauce all right so we've just eaten lunch and we're waiting for dinner to come around now for many people this is the toughest part of the day you start getting a little peckish and you end up snacking on pretty much whatever food you can find so instead try incorporating a simple healthy snack like an apple it will cost you about 77 cents roughly 80 calories but if you can afford the extra cost it can make a huge difference to helping you stick with your pot all right it's dinner time and this one's a childhood favorite so growing up with a Filipino Chinese mother fried rice was a staple the fried rice recipe I have is delicious and super easy to make and after we cook it up we're gonna see what my mom has to say so in a pan scramble three whole eggs then set aside on the plate next dice your carrots and cook them in a pan with the green peas and some garlic and by the way green peas are great for fat loss because they contain almost half the calories relative to their volume as rice does so when you're dieting you can easily save some calories by using less rice and replacing it with more peas like we do in this recipe anyways once the veggies are soft add in your white rice you can use brown rice if you prefer but regardless for the best fried rice you'll want to use day old leftover rice from the fridge this makes your rice firmer and prevents it from getting all clumpy when you cook it instant rice is also a good option next add some soy sauce to your liking and then stir in your scrambled eggs and you're done after your premium members who can afford it feel free to top it with some sriracha or chili garlic and add a side of steamed broccoli to increase your vegetable intake all right now it's time to see what my overly critical Asian mom thinks good yeah it's really good oh my God I think you guys realize like how much that means it's just a new recipe for the next video I would eat it yeah so I don't know about you guys but after dinner once it gets close to bedtime that's when my sweet tooth comes out no matter how good I was with my diet earlier in the day the late night snacking always got the best of me this is why we're throwing in a dessert helps satisfy your sweet tooth in a healthy budget-friendly way the recipe is super simple but tastes delicious in a blender simply add a frozen banana one scoop of protein powder chocolate usually works best one tablespoon of peanut butter 3 4 of a cup of water and about five to ten ice cubes depending on how thick you like your smoothies now if you don't want to use protein powder again you could just swap it for a serving of Greek yogurt instead but in that case you'll probably also want to add a sugar-free sweetener like Stevia to sweeten it up now for this one if you really want to go premium you could snag yourself one of these ninja creamies with it you can use this exact same recipe and in five minutes It'll come out just like ice cream honestly guys they're not sponsored for me at all but this has probably been one of the best investments of my life I make ice cream with it almost every single night type well worth in my opinion in the description box down below I'll leave a link to one on Amazon for those who are interested alright so we're gonna check in on Jeff's results shortly but as for how to prep these meals aside from the burritos which you can make a whole week's worth and just put in the freezer most of the meals you can prep about three to four days worth at a time and to do so you just multiply the portions of each ingredient and then store it in the fridge the Smoothie though I would recommend just whipping that up when you're ready to eat it but as I mentioned earlier while you can follow the plan as is I highly suggest tweaking the calories and protein based on your body for example Jeff's already pretty lean and he's quite an active guy and after using our build with size calorie calculator which I'll link in the description below while the protein intake was on target he actually needed a bit more calories to make sure he wasn't losing way too fast so I increased the serving of some of the carbs like the rice in this dinner as well as some of the fats like peanut butter and his breakfast and lastly here's a list of some swaps you can make to each of these meals to keep them interested to make things easy for you I put the whole meal plan instructions grocery lists food swaps and more into a free pdf you can download over at builtwithsize.com cheap meal pot and I'll leave the link to that in the description box in the comments down below as well but now it's time to check in on Jeff and see if he got any results after following the meal plan for seven days so from day one to day 7 Jeff lost a total of 1.8 pounds now some of this is probably water weight from just eating better but some of that was definitely fat and you can actually see some slight differences in his physique he also didn't follow the meal plan perfectly as he had a few meals out for family birthdays just goes to show you that this meal plan and the calorie deficit in general clearly works if you stick to it and you don't need to be perfect nutrition is key so many people look the same year after year simply because they never prioritize their diet this meal Pond is definitely a great start but if you want a step-by-step plan with workouts meals and daily Guidance just head over to buildtoothscience.com and take our quiz to find the best step-by-step plan for you I highly recommend giving this video watch next for the easiest exercise you can pair this meal plan with to help speed up that loss or give this video a watch next if you're looking for another budget meal plan but this time focused on building muscle thank you so much for watching I hope this helps and I'll see you next time"

    "published_at": "2022-05-08T17:19:31Z",
    "transcript": "let's go jeremy today is the day baby 10 pull-ups in a row i can feel it oh yeah number one smooth as butter oh man this is gonna be easy huh okay that one was a little hard what the  is happening muscles won't work pull ups are a great muscle building exercise they also look pretty darn cool when you can bang them out effortlessly oh my gosh in a row okay i did there's a reason why so few are able to accomplish this impressive feat of strength and are unable to do enough reps to truly maximize the muscle building benefits of this exercise today i'll explain why that is how to improve it and then give you a full workout designed to quickly take you from 0 2 4 8 or wherever you're at all the way to 10 pull-ups in a row and beyond let's begin by covering why pull-ups are so difficult in the first place the first reason has to do with your body weight so under normal circumstances to improve your strength in an exercise you use a weight and rep range that suits your current strength level and then you progress from there with pull-ups however you're forced to lift your own body weight whether you weigh 150 pounds or 300 pounds that's the weight that you'll have to overcome with each rep it's like being forced to use 225 pounds every time you bench press independent of how strong you actually are yet most people completely disregard this and try to improve their pull-ups by well trying to do more pull-ups for example if someone can do let's say five pull-ups in a row they'll likely be able to do five in the first set three in the second set and then two in the last set for a grand total of just 10 reps not only are you essentially training your all-out max strength every time you do this which has been shown to tax the body quite heavily but you're also not accumulating enough pull up volume needed to improve in addition to this most people don't realize that pull-ups are not just a back exercise to properly perform them several other muscles in your upper and lower body must work together synergistically no matter how strong your bigger back muscles and biceps get if you have weak links in the chain it's going to prevent you from improving your pull-ups this is exactly why research shows a weak correlation between movements like the lat pull-down and pull-up strength and that's why many people can get really really strong with assisted pull-ups or even chin-ups yet still struggle with pops you need to focus on the weaker often overlooked muscles that these big exercises just don't train very well so how do we solve this there's three steps to this the first step is to change the way you train your pull-ups that you're able to do enough quality volume to make strength improvements the right approach however depends on your strength level if you currently can't do any pull-ups or you can't do more than four in a row then we're not ready to use pull-ups quite yet but we will use two other exercises to quickly build your strength the first exercise will be used for all strength bubbles but is especially helpful for the zero to four group with it by manipulating your body position you can pull your body weight just like you would in a normal pull-up but your body won't have to fight as hard against gravity keep your core engaged glute squeezed and legs straight and pull with your elbows to bring your chest towards the bar as you get stronger lower the rolling angle to make the move more difficult until you get completely horizontal now we still however need an exercise that trains your body vertically like in the pull-up this is where the second exercise comes in this exercise it takes advantage of the fact that you have considerably more strength during the downward phase of the pull-up as opposed to the way up to perform it use a bencher box to assist yourself up to the top part of the pull-up from here hold this position for a few seconds and then lower your body as slowly as possible stopping and spending more time in the most difficult spots where you're the weakest work towards a five second hold at the top position and a total five second hold on the way down all right now step three of this video i'll explain how and when to retest your pull-up strength but once you're able to do between five to seven pull-ups in a row is when you'll want to then progress your approach to start we'll use a pull-up training philosophy popularized by pavel tatsulini tatsula tatsu former trainer of the soviet special forces the idea is that we do several sets of pull-ups that never allow your body to reach complete failure the result is a high amount of successful reps that will help your body quickly build strength and learn how to better activate the muscles involved in a pull-up to apply it you're gonna do sets of anywhere between two to five reps these sets should be at least two reps away from your max effort so if you can currently do just five pull-ups in a row stick the sets of two to three reps to avoid over-exertion you'll do a set rest for 30-90 seconds do another set and repeat this process until you reach a grand total of 20 reps it doesn't matter if this takes you 4 sets or 10 sets to accomplish this and it also doesn't matter if you can only do sets of just one pull up by the end of it the key is that you're staying away from failure and accumulating those reps the goal is to over time comfortably reach a total of 30 reps second thing you'll do is you get yourself a few of these loop one around the top of a bar just like this and put your feet into it the band will exert force upwards as long as you stand on it effectively reducing the amount of resistance you need to overcome with each rep the thicker the band the easier it's going to be so choose one that enables you to do between six to 12 reps wait wait jeremy but what if i don't have a band well you can instead use the negative pull-ups i showed earlier but whether you get the bands from me or somewhere else they are 100 worth the investment not only for improving your pull-ups but for mobility and even optimizing resistance curves for different exercises and trust me i know how intimidating it might seem to set this up and do this exercise especially in the middle of the gym but it's going to be one of the most effective ways for you to improve your pull-ups and far superior to something like the assisted bullet machine i hope that this at least encourages you to give it a shot but with that being said let's move on to the final strength level so once you get to eight to nine reps in a row yet can't quite break through ten you'll simply use the same routine as the five to 7 group but with more difficulty for the body weight pull-ups add a 5 pound weight either with a weight belt or a dumbbell between your feet for the banded pull-ups switch to a thinner band or take one foot out to lessen the support so now that we strengthen the big pulling muscles and practice the skill of actually doing pull-ups the next step is to strengthen common weak links in the chain that are likely holding you back there's two muscles in specific that are heavily involved in the pull-up yet tend to become underdeveloped the result of a 2018 research study by hewitt and colleagues helped reveal the importance of the first muscle their research team took subjects who could perform more than 10 pull-ups in a row and measure the activation of various muscles as they perform their pull-ups it may come as a surprise for many of you but the highest activated muscle even more than the back and biceps was the core which makes sense with pull-ups you're essentially doing a mid-air plank and forced to use your core to stabilize your body to best replicate the intense demands placed on the core front pull-ups we can use what's known as a long lever rocking plank set up how you would a normal plank but move your arms further up towards your head squeeze your glutes and rock your body slowly forward and back now as for the second muscle its importance is illustrated by a study from the journal of strength and conditioning research the researchers analyzed muscle activation during the pull-up but this time compared to other exercises like the chin up they found that one muscle the lower traps was highly active during pull-ups and to a significantly greater degree than it was during chin-ups since this muscle plays an integral role in stabilizing your shoulder and upper body as you pull it's essential that you train it to prevent it from limiting you to do so we're going to use an exercise that looks deceivingly easy until you try it hang from a bar with your hands shoulder width apart feet together core relaxed and elbows locked relax your shoulders and back muscles to let your shoulders come up towards your ears then without bending your arms you're going to pull your shoulders down and away from your ears and you should feel this in the middle of your back pause for two seconds at this top position come back down and then repeat all right now you're probably wondering how the heck do i take all the stuff and remember what to do in my next workout don't worry stop frantically writing everything down just relax and pay attention as i've done all the work for you with a free downloadable workout for you to follow next time you're in the gym but before you go and download it let's quickly go through the final step to cover how to best use this workout alrighty here is the game plan you'll first start with the main back exercises based on your current strength bubble this will be followed by the core and lower traps exercise we went through but how you incorporate this workout depends on what your training currently looks like it can easily be used as a full back workout performed once a week or if you train back twice a week you can plop in a couple of these exercises onto each day as you use this plan you'll also want to retest your max pull-ups every month and then move on to the next level as your strength improves then once you prestige is when you can now enter a whole new level by adding weight to continue maximizing the muscle building benefits of this exercise as for where to download your free workout with all the reps sets exercises and tutorials just head on over to builtwithscience.com pull up pdf

    "title": "How To Fix Elbow Pain (BULLETPROOF YOUR ELBOWS!)",
    "published_at": "2020-10-11T16:44:42Z",
    "transcript": "we don't realize it but every set and every rep we do adds to the stress that we place in our body and it's not just our muscles that take a beating our joints take on a lot of that stress too and often become sites of discomfort and one of the most common areas where this discomfort and pain occurs is at the elbow because of how complex this joint really is and how often it's involved during our exercises this can be felt as pain on the inside of the elbow or more commonly pain at the outside of the elbow now i've personally experienced elbow pain before and i know it's just not fun it hinders our training it diminishes our performance and it's just plain hurts so today i want to go over three causes that are likely contributing to the pain in your elbow and what you need to do in order to not only alleviate that pain but also prevents it from coming back so you can start lifting pain-free as soon as possible and protect this joint for life the first culprit is an imbalance in your forearm strength and just weak grip strength in general study after study has consistently linked weak extensor muscles in the forearm to be the main culprit for elbow pain and sight repetitive gripping to be what can kick off your pain initially now what makes these extensor muscles on the outside of your forearm more susceptible to overuse and discomfort is due to their heavy involvement during gripping because whenever we go to grab something our flexor muscles on the inside of our forearm will first help flex to grip the hand but our extensor muscles then kick on and stay on in order to prevent our wrists from excessively flexing in fact emg studies have clearly shown that every extensor muscle in the forearm is firing during gripping movements and tends to be firing to a greater extent than our flexors are and the harder or longer you grip something or the heavier the object that you're gripping the greater the stress that's placed on the extensors and the tendon that attaches the extensors to the outside of the elbow just meaning that if your extensors are weak due to a lack of forearm and or grip training then they'll be more susceptible to fatigue which can then result in an overuse injury from all of the gripping that you do during your workouts and this overuse injury then manifests as pain on the outside of the elbow right in the tendon that is connecting the extensor muscle so strengthening your forearms especially your extensors as well as just increasing your overall grip strength is what's key to creating bulletproof elbows and has consistently been shown to be an effective approach to relieving that elbow pain and the simplest way to start out is just to regularly perform standard wrist extensions to help strengthen and build more endurance in your weaker wrist extensors use lighter weight and aim for a few sets of about 10 reps then increase the weight over time as long as you're able to do so without increasing pain if however the pain you experience is on the inside of your elbow rather than on the outside then you'd want to perform wrist curls instead of wrist extensions to help build the endurance of your wrist flexors since in this case you have the opposite imbalance then eventually if you can do so without pain you'll want to then progress to more functional movements such as single arm suitcase carries the neutral wrist position of this exercise makes it easier for your elbow to tolerate and can help you build your overall grip strength and endurance over time i suggest performing a few sets of these exercises once per day but play around with the volume and frequency just to avoid increasing any pain as your forearm and grip strength improves you should gradually experience more and more relief as a result so we addressed a problem below the elbow but now we need to look above the elbow for some other possible problems and the most common culprit here is weakness in the muscles involved in stabilizing the shoulder and the scapula because a lack of stabilization here then means that the muscles surrounding your elbow joint will be forced to work overtime to compensate for that lack of stability during our pushing and pulling exercises which again leads to elbow pain due to overuse and over dependence on these forearm muscles a case study by bat and colleagues showed just how drastic this can be so in this case study a patient with elbow pain in one arm was found to be weak in their middle and lower traps resulting in one of their shoulder blades to be sitting in an off position which just so happened to be on the same side as their painful elbow but after completing a strengthening program focusing completely on these weakened muscles the shoulder blades sat back in the correct position and the elbow pain was completely eliminated many other studies have shown similar results with a strong association between shoulder and scapular instability and resulting elbow pain so just realize the importance of these often overlooked muscles especially when it comes to fixing and preventing elbow pain and i have put out quite a few videos that do address these muscles and i'll link those videos down below but some of the best options for you to get started with right now would be exercises like scapular pull-ups which help strengthen the traps and then simple external rotation movements to help strengthen your rotator cuff again perform these moves daily or at least a few times per week over time this increase in stability that you're going to develop will help reduce the demands that are placed on your elbow and help alleviate that pain you may be experiencing the last cause of elbow pain or the worsening of your existing elbow pain is often just trying to push through the pain we need to listen to our bodies when you feel discomfort in your joints don't ignore it the thing with overused injuries is that by the time you feel the pain it has already been overused and continuing to train it is just going to make it worse and possibly cause more severe problems the good news though is that as long as the pain is minimal we don't need to completely stop training we just need to choose less stressful variations of our exercises to give those tendons a break so for this reason dumbbells are going to become your best friend as they allow you to manipulate your hand position into basically any position that feels comfortable basically we want to take our hands out of a supinated or pronated position and into a neutral grip as much as possible since this places the least stress on our forearm muscles and eliminates our tendency to excessively flex and extend our wrist as we perform exercises so opting for exercises like hammer curls dumbbell rows and neutral grip chest presses are all great options since it takes our grip out of a pronated or supinated position in addition to this always be mindful of your wrist positioning during your exercises you want to avoid flexing or extending your wrists excessively during exercises like chin ups curls and even push downs as this creates a ton of stress on the forearm muscles and tendons instead focus on keeping the wrist neutral and in line with your forearms as you perform these movements and if it still hurts just try something else or consider decreasing the weight and aiming for higher reps instead there's plenty of ways that you can work around your elbow pain to continue stimulating your muscles and getting good workouts in while letting the overused muscles in your forearms recover so to sum up the video here is what you want to do first dedicate more time to your forearm training and grip training then address potential weaknesses in your shoulder and scapular stabilizer muscles and finally manipulate your exercises and be mindful of your wrist positioning to avoid worsening the pain but all in all you need to realize that if you're feeling stressed in certain joints that is often a result of imbalances or weaknesses elsewhere in the body and for a step-by-step program that prevents this from happening by showing you exactly how to train and maximize growth while correcting your imbalances and weaknesses in the process and simply head on over to builtwithscience.com and take our analysis quiz to discover which program is best

    "title": "How Many Sets Should You Do Per Workout To Build Muscle?",
    "published_at": "2019-05-19T14:37:28Z",
    "transcript": "[Music] one of the most common areas of confusion among lifters is figuring out exactly how many sets one should do in a workout on the one hand you have minimalist who offer lower volume approaches with some saying that even just one set taken to failure in a workout is sufficient whereas others are in favor of higher volume approaches and working each muscles to the point of exhaustion each workout so who's right well in this video we'll figure out just that by using current scientific evidence to determine exactly how many sets per workout you should be doing to maximize growth but first off let's discuss what exactly we mean by set so just to be clear a set in this case will refer to a set performed within the 6 to 12 rep range since this is in line with the research I'll be going through if you do less reps on this then you'll need more sets and vice-versa also each set should be taken close to failure with high effort so obviously a warm-up set won't count as your real set so with that being said let's find out exactly how many sets per workout is optimal so we know based on recent research that to a certain extent more volume leads to more growth for instance a 2010 meta-analysis by James Krieger found that as you increase the number of sets performed per exercise muscle growth increases well in fact when you compare four to six sets to a single set you experience around 80 to 85 percent more growth and then further support of this positive relationship between training volume and hypertrophy is a more recent 2017 meta-analysis which found a dose-response relationship between sets per muscle per week and resulting muscle growth so based on this alone we think that the more volume the better and the performing 5 sets for all the exercises in our workouts we're just trying to do as much as possible will be optimal for growth but upon further analysis we realize that this just isn't the case and in fact doing so can be detrimental this is because there actually seems to be an upper limit of sets per muscle group that you can do in a single workout before it starts to do more harm than good and as for an estimate as to what this number is researchers James Krieger provide some insight what he did is he took a deeper look into the previous meta-analysis I mentioned and found that limit to be roughly 10 sets per muscle group so for example in your chest day performing more than 10 hard sets dedicated to your chest would likely just begin to provide diminishing returns and start to Imperial recovery something widely known as junk volume now of course this will vary individually and depends on the nature of the exercises you perform and the limit is likely higher for more trained individuals nonetheless it still is a good rough estimate that's in line with past research on the topic so what exactly does this mean for you and how you should structure your training well it just means that you need to use the right training frequency and spread out your sets accordingly but this is going to enable you to avoid doing too much in one workout and helps them minimize any excess junk volume to clear up any confusion let's use a step by step example that you can follow so we know based on the 2017 meta-analysis mentioned earlier that roughly 10 to 20 sets per muscle per week is a sweet spot for maximizing growth with beginners being at the lower end of this range and more experienced lifters being at the higher end of this range so let's say you're a fairly experienced lifter requiring 16 sets per muscle per week we'll use chess as an example rather than using a bro split and hammering all of the 16 sets into one chess day would instead be best to split the required number of chess sets into at least two days per week to be trained with other muscle groups but for example using something like an upper lower split this way you can perform these sets with better quality to remain under the estimated 10 separate session threshold and you'll now be training each muscle at the optimum for any frequency of two times per week all leading to better gains and more efficient recovery in the long run in fact a study by Beck grotto and colleagues compared this exact idea the researchers compared training each muscle group once a week with sixteen cents per session with twice a week with eight cents per session after eight weeks they found that the eight cents per session group experienced similar but slightly greater muscle growth and a greater improvement and training low volume when compared to the sixteen cents per session group and the researchers speculate that these findings would likely reach greater significance if the study was done longer which is just further evidence suggesting that refraining from doing too much volume for a muscle group in a single session is lightly best for hypertrophy in the long run and that's basically all there is to it first figure out what you want to set your weekly target sets per muscle to be and then work backwards to split that up most effectively throughout the week each workout can consist of a total of around 15 to 25 sets but the number of sets for a specific muscle group in that work oh it should be at around 10 or below but obviously this does depend on several factors and lastly just always keep in mind that research tells us about averages some people respond better to higher training of volumes whereas others respond better to lower training volumes meaning that you'll want to use the guidelines shown in this video as a rough starting point but you should then be adjusting it over time based on how your body progresses so the southern video up here are the main points to keep in mind I think that a lot of people are under the wrong impression that more is better and that they have to completely annihilate their muscles every single workout in order for them to grow and I asked to do this as well but it wasn't until I cut out all the excess jump volume that I was doing and instead focused more on progression that I've really started to see results not much faster and for an all-in-one science-based program that shows you exactly how to do this but optimizing every aspect of your training and your nutrition for you such that you can build muscle and lose fat as quickly as possible then you can simply head on over to built with science comm and take the starting point analysis quiz which is going to determine what program and what approach is best for you anyways if you haven't already I'd really appreciate you following Instagram I post a lot more informative videos and content on there which I think a lot of you will find useful and as always if you enjoyed this video please don't forget to

hormonal profiles so it only makes sense that our approach when it comes to fat loss should drastically differs as well right well this is a yes and no answer despite our physiological differences and despite what mainstream media may promote the optimal approach to losing fat will actually be quite similar regardless of gender but with that being said for the best results there are also key differences that should be implemented in each respective routine and in this video I'll discuss exactly what those gender differences are and how to implement them in your training and nutrition let's start with training for the most part the basic concepts of training for fat loss will be the same for both men and women both need to put less emphasis on cardio and instead prioritize weightlifting on a regular basis and progressively getting stronger in the gym this will not only aid in the fat loss process but will also prevent you from simply ended up skinny fat rather than well defined or toned with adequate muscle mass after all your weight loss and hard work so focus on the weights and simply use cardio to speed up the process as needed now as for the differences between how men and women should train before diving into physiological differences we need to first take into account gender specific goals and how they differ for instance most men typically want a big chest broad shoulders a wide back and big arms and therefore their trainer should reflect this by emphasizing movements that target these areas whereas the vast majority of woman just don't really place grow in their chest muscles for example as a priority and instead simply want more muscle definition while often placing a priority on growing their glutes therefore in this case woman with these goals in mind should prioritize and add more volume to movements that target these areas and compensate by slightly reducing their upper body volume for example but training goes aside there are also various physiological difference this should be considered as well let's start with the differences in training volume and frequency multiple papers have indicated that woman actually seemed to recover faster after their workouts than men do for instance a 2010 paper from the International Journal sports physiology and performance Donna after one set of benchpress to failure trained men needed 48 hours to recover and reestablish their baseline strength where's trained woman only needed 4 hours to do so which is thought to be due to females having a better nutrient delivery to their muscles so as a result they don't experience as much muscle damage from a workout as men do and can thus recover faster between sessions which implies that females may be capable of doing slightly higher volume workouts compared to men and are also able to workout each muscle more frequently throughout the week without experiencing symptoms of overtraining which can be especially useful if there's certain muscle groups they'd like to bring up or prioritize by dedicating more weekly sets than usual to them for similar reasons as previously discussed woman also seemed to recover faster after his set than men do for instance a paper by Foucault and colleagues found that when the adductors will work to physical exhaustion during a set the female subjects were able to recover significantly faster for the next set than men could especially during the first minute of rest and other papers do agree with us finding as well implying that woman may be able to get away with shorter rest periods between sets than men so practically speaking since we know that the optimal rest time for men seems to be around two to three minutes or even slightly more between sets depending on the exercise and intensity women may want to experiment with slightly shorter rest periods than this in order to best take advantage of their faster recovery and greater ability to handle metabolic stress obviously experiment with it and ensure that this isn't impairing your overall strength as a result now moving on to nutrition and optimizing your diet for fat loss there's actually not too much difference between genders the key in both cases will obviously be ensuring that you're eating at a calorie deficit with adequate protein of around one gram per pound of body weight as these will be the most important factors determining the success of your fat loss efforts however what's really interesting is that woman may do better dieting with a slightly higher fat intakes than men as for the reasoning behind this research on female exercise metabolism has shown that woman burn more fat and less carbohydrates and protein compared to men at any given exercise intensity meaning that their bodies don't depend on carbs as much as men do to replenish their muscle glycogen for fuel during their workouts and as a result the lesser need for carbohydrates frees up more calories to be consumed as fat which can be particularly beneficial for woman when dieting since it seems to help with her satiety for instance a 2016 paper from the journal Nutrition compared the effects of a high fat meal versus a low fat meal on appetite and man versus woman they found that the high fat meal was 15% more satiated for woman but this effect was not found for men meaning that for woman eaten at a deficit a relatively higher fat diet for example having 30 to 40% or more of your daily calories coming from fat may help better manage hunger without negatively affecting gym performance given their greater ability to use fat for energy but in my opinion the benefits of higher fats versus higher carbs when dieting is very individual so I encourage you to experiment with it to find what works best for you so I hope you're able to see that although the main principles of training and dieting are actually quite similar for both men and women there are minor differences that should definitely be considered and implemented appropriately all in all though what's going to enable you to lose fat most effectively while retaining your muscle in the process is a combination of heavy weight lifting on a regular basis and the calorie deficit and this is true regardless of gender so the summit video up here are the main gender differences and how they can be applied in your training and diet although these little differences may not seem like much they really are what's going to enable you to transform your body as efficiently as possible this is exactly why I've actually created and recently launched my two new female programs which are optimized specifically for females and is something that I'm honestly just super excited about these programs just like my existing male programs are designed to transform your body from your starting point to a lean toned physique and the fastest most effective way possible and to join the program simply head on over to built with science comm and take the body type analysis quiz I have up which will determine what program is best for you anyways that also really appreciate if you give me a follow on Instagram as well I post a

    "title": "How To FORCE Muscle Growth (5 Science-Based Methods)",
    "published_at": "2022-02-13T18:10:03Z",
    "transcript": "in order for a muscle to grow you need to continuously challenge them with more than they're used to as simple as this sounds most people's workouts don't accomplish this sure they'll get a good pump and sweat out of their workouts but they aren't actually doing much to Signal their muscles to grow over time to better explain this let's take a quick look at the science behind what actually makes the muscle grow so let's say we just finish a workout immediately after our muscles don't actually get stronger in fact they become temporarily weaken from the damage that we put them through it's not until after a few days of proper recovery that they adapt to the damage we put them through and will come back bigger and stronger than they were before in order to be better prepared for the next work that we put them through however no matter how good of a pump you get or how much you sweat if that next session isn't providing your muscles more of a challenge than the previous session did then the muscle will have no reason to grow and will simply maintain its current size of strength or in some cases even start to become smaller and weaker for consistent gains over time your workouts need to be designed such that they literally force your muscles to grow every single session today we're going to cover the five ways to do just that increasing the amount of weight lifted is a method that most people rely on to apply it it's quite straightforward let's say you can currently bench press 100 lb for8 reps next week you might try to increase the load and do 110 lb for8 reps which would create a new stimulus for your muscles to have to adapt to and grow from now if you're a beginner then this method of progressive overload will be your bread and butter to help you make gains quickly you'll likely be able to add 5 to 10 lbs to the bar every single week especially on your main lifts like the bench press the squat and the deadlift however if you take our previous example of bench pressing 100 lb in week one and adding 10 lbs of weight every week at the end of the year theoretically you should be benching 62 20 lb as cool as that would be neither myself nor Alex one of our record-breaking built with science coaches who can bench over twice his body weight is anywhere close to that this is where people get stuck they rely on only adding more weight as their method of challenging their muscles to grow and eventually get stuck in a plateau to break through this we have to get more creative with how we continue challenging our muscles this is where our next Point comes in handy when applied properly adding more reps is another great way to force your muscles to grow the way this works can be Illustrated with a very simple math equation if I can bench press 100 lb for 10 reps one week I can multiply those numbers together and calculate that I've lifted 1,000 lb total across that set if next week I go to the gym and lift that same weight but for 11 reps I will have lifted 1,00 lb across that same set this means that by just adding one rep to my set I've technically lifted 100 lb more than last week which just like added more weight does would create a new stimulus for your muscles to grow but how high in reps can you go while using the same weight well based on a 2017 meta analysis as long as you're continuing to push hard you can keep the same weight and increase all the way up to 30 reps and still get the same growth compared to adding more weight this is extremely helpful if you only have limited equipment or a nagan injury and can't increase the weight on your lifts even if you wanted to however for those who do have access to more weights what we found to be most effective and teach in our bu with science programs is something called double progression this is a system that utilizes both reps and weight to ensure that week by week you're forcing your muscles to grow the way it works is quite simple let's say you're doing three sets of squats for 8 to 12 reps with 100 lb in week one you could do eight reps for each set next week you'd aim to do nine reps each set if that went well you continue doing that until you were able to do 12 Reps for all three sets at that point rather than continuing to increase your reps you could add 10 lbs and restart the process by going back down to eight reps however again this often only works for so long what happens when you get stuck unable to add more weight or do more reps well here's where another often overlooked form of progression can come into play the next method has to do with how many sets you perform let's say you're trying to build up your biceps adding sets can be as simple as going from three sets of 12 one week to four sets of 12 the next week using the simple math equation we used earlier if we were curling 40 lbs in each hand then each of our biceps would be lifting 480 lbs more volume in the second week by just adding that one set it's a really simple way to add a massive amount of training volume to your program and it's something we use in our more advanced build with science programs to help bring up laging muscle groups however when using this method you need to use it sparingly based on the literature we know doing at least Le 10 sets per muscle group per week nearly doubles the amount of gains that you would get compared to doing just five sets per muscle group per week but there comes a point of diminishing returns when you get into the 20 to 30 set zone so A good rule of thumb is to increase volume no more than 10 to 20% per week so if you're currently doing 10 sets of chest per week for example but you're stuck unable to lift more weight or do more reps then next week you could instead still use the same weight and do the same amount of reps but just add one extra set to each exercise and continue doing so every week then once you get to the 20 to 30 set zone or you just begin to feel quite fatigued you can cycle back down to the original program that you started with now although this method does have its benefits it is quite taxi on the body and can make your workouts considerably longer the next two methods are ways you can continue forcing your muscles to grow while lifting the same weight and doing the same number of reps and sets every single week Tempo refers to how fast or slow we lift weights if we slow down our reps we can increase the amount of time that tension is place on the muscle to stimulate more growth this is especially effective for exercises involving smaller weaker muscle groups like lateral raises where adding just a little bit of weight often disproportionately increases difficulty or body weight exercises like push-ups and pull-ups where adding weight may not even be an option however you want to avoid going too slow as that can provide the opposite effect and start to hinder muscle growth rather than boost it based on the recommendations of Dr Brad shenfeld who ran a 2015 meta analysis analyzing the effects of tempo on muscle growth it seems that we can slow down our reps up to about 6 seconds total so for example let's say you're doing 20 lb lateral raises and for each rep you usually take about a second on the way up and a second on the way down rather than doing more weight reps or sets to stimulate growth you can instead just slow down your reps by 1 second every week and you can apply this until you reach 3 seconds on the way up and 3 seconds all the way down at which point the rest would just get too slow and is when you'd want to apply another form of overload which could be as simple as increasing the weight up to 25 lbs or utilizing the next method often times when people think they are challenging their muscles more by adding more weight to their lifts they really just end up compromising their form in the process as a result despite using a heavier weight than they were previously their target muscles aren't actually working any harder you need to realize that if you do the same work that you did the week before but you perform your exercises with better control less momentum and more activation of your target muscles then that is progression better form involves relying more on the target muscles and will result in growth even if all other variables remain the same although this method may not catch your eye as much as some of the others on this list many of you watching could easily stimulate a significant amount of growth for all your muscles by simply cleaning up your form with your exercises even Advanced lifters we still spend time analyzing and tweaking our form because we know that any other method of growth will be meaningless unless your form remains intact now as for which of these five methods is best and is going to provide you with the most growth the truth is it depends it depends on your level of experience your equipment availability and if there's a certain type of plateau that you're stuck in the best way to find out is to just experiment with them and see what works best for you but if you're looking for a step-by-step program that takes care of all the guest workk for you and ensures that week by week you're challenging your body in the right way to consistently build muscle and lose fat just head on over to buildwi science.com and take

    "title": "4 Things NOBODY Tells You About Fat Loss (AVOID MISTAKES!)",
    "published_at": "2022-01-30T17:26:22Z",
    "transcript": "the sad truth is the vast majority of people who attempt a diet to lose fat they fail but what i've found both in the literature and with helping thousands of people successfully transform their bodies is there's four things that if people just simply knew before dieting would greatly increase their chance of success today we're going to reveal what those are and how you can use them to your advantage so most people are unaware that not all body fat is created equally within our fat cells are two receptors alpha and beta receptors you're soon gonna remember them as alpha for awful and beta for beautiful this is because alpha receptors they tell our body to store fat rather than burn it whereas beta receptors they do the opposite and encourage fat to be burned off for energy so where in the body do we have the highest density of these awful alpha receptors well for males to protect our internal organs we have the highest density within our belly fat and our love handles for women for child bearing purposes it tends to be around the hips and waist this is what makes these areas so stubborn to lose fat from yet unfortunately is also where most of us starting a diet want to lose fat from first the belly fat a lot of times is the last thing to go and just all this stuff like i was seeing myself gradually lose fat in certain areas and i still saw like my belly or like i would still see like the stubborn fat in my stomach be there man if i don't see like eight pack abs in like two months and i'm like been over 25 body fat for like the last three years then i'm gonna quit which then leads many of us to question is there a shortcut to burning off fat from these stubborn areas for example can abs exercises be used to spot reduce fat from stubborn areas like the belly well a 2011 paper tested just that and found that six weeks of direct ab training five days a week had no effect on reducing belly fat in overweight subjects in fact there's been studies that have tested all the most popular solutions to losing stubborn fat that even i've tried out in the past in hopes of a shortcut despite the proposed theories behind these methods studies have consistently found that no avoiding carbs past 6 pm is not going to help no early morning fasted cardio won't help no there aren't any special foods or unique diets that can help target these areas and no high intensity cardio workouts won't help either so that all doesn't work then what does well there is a method that i found and successfully tested with thousands of the members of our built with science program here's archie he applied this and successfully lost his belly fat and love handles and here's katie who did the same to lose her fat from her most stubborn areas and here's two more examples from kevin and dominico who lost it by applying this one thing and this one thing that was key to their success is actually something that you all have with you right now but just haven't properly applied it what is it well i'm gonna let one of our members archie reveal it for you it was like eight months of time like just going and going and so even in like four months in where i was like dang it bro what the heck is going on it could have happened that way you know it could have been like four or five even six seven right before i really started to see like my abs start to pop trust the process and just stay consistent and you will see those results if you just continue to go so realize that only once you've lost enough fat cells from other areas of the body will your body then start focusing on burning off your more stubborn fat cells for energy in the meantime embrace the other changes you're experiencing that most people overlook when most people go into a diet they expect their weight loss to look something like this a steady rate of weight being lost every single week but take a look at the one year weight loss graph of one of our built with science program members james do you know the ups and downs the reality is depending on how much you've had to eat whether or not you've used the washroom how hydrated you are or some combination of all the above your weight will vary up to about five pounds day to day scales and weights will fluctuate all the time and mine did if you're seeing your weight go up one day and then down one day and then up one day and you're like what am i doing right what am i doing wrong to account for this we recommend all of our built with science clients to weigh themselves every single day using the same scale first thing in the morning after they've used the washroom before they eat or drink anything if you apply this you're still going to see some variation but it won't be as big then to improve this even further there is something that we emphasize with all of our clients but it took me a while to realize all right let's try and live with this over kind of a trending fashion rather than this is what i am day to day today and try and measure on that because you're just going to drive yourself crazy mine was definitely looking at kind of week by week how hours going especially in the later stages of losing weight in the first few weeks you're going to notice a big drop from losing mostly water weight from then on it should still trend downwards just not as fast but be prepared for periods of two to three weeks where your weight just doesn't budge or may even increase this is completely normal when this happens it's important that you remain patient and keep your stress levels low rather than doing anything crazy or coming to the conclusion that what you're doing isn't working in the event that your weekly weight hasn't budged for at least three to four weeks then that's a sign that it may be a good time to finally change something up although most of you watching will say you want to lose weight what you actually mean is you want to lose fat this is a really important distinction if decreasing the number you see on the scale is your only goal you can achieve this pretty quickly by eating very little food and doing a ton of cardio the problem with this approach though is it won't leave you looking the way that you want this is because weight is made up of both fat and muscle although the very low calorie high cardio approach is gonna help you lose weight quickly most of the weight you do lose is going to be muscle rather than fat the result pretty much just a smaller skinnier version of you but with some of the negative side effects of muscle loss such as fatigue and hunger to look and feel the way that you really want you need to lose fat while preserving or even building as much muscle as you can in the process to ensure that this happens as you lose weight there are a few things that you can do first off as i've covered in past videos you want to focus on slow gradual weight loss losing no more than one percent of your body weight per week while also lifting weights regularly but aside from this there is one thing that seems to be increasingly important especially with new research emerging so what we did in our study in my lab was we had resistance trained females and we had we split them into two groups one group we had them increase their daily protein intake and the other group we had decreased their daily protein intake so both groups were naturally eating about 0.7 grams per pound the low group we said you have to decrease it they ended up going all the way down to 0.4 grams of protein per pound of body weight the high protein group increased their protein all the way up to 1.1 grams per pound of body weight and at the end of the eight weeks the group that increased their protein intake caused an increase in muscle mass and a little bit of a decrease in fat mass as well what made this study really interesting is when we look at the total calorie intake so the high protein group yes they increased their total protein but that also resulted in them increasing their total calories they increase total calories by about 250 calories per day now normally when you increase calories you think you're going to gain body fat but that's not what happened they actually had a significant loss of body fat compared to their baseline levels and remember they increased their calories all in the form of protein the other group that decreased their protein intake they also had a decrease in total calories now normally you would think well you would lose body fat in that case but they didn't so there's something unique about the protein content here that also contributed to the changes in their body despite increasing calories or decreasing calories so how do we apply this to the to the everyday user of protein supplement or protein intake what we suggest is if you can increase your protein and you don't have to go to 1.1 grams per pound if you can just increase from where you're currently at i believe that you will get a body composition benefit but if you can if you can reach that gram per pound or even more i think that you get more and more of a benefit so we've been talking a lot about weight and even went through the importance of weighing yourself consistently but the weight scale doesn't reveal all and it can get extremely frustrating when you're doing everything right but it just doesn't seem to budge this is why you need to look at other measures of progress our team of builder science coaches have every single one of our clients not only weigh themselves regularly but also take progress pictures keep track of their strength during their workouts track their waist circumference and monitor their physiological changes the good thing for me was measuring other things like my strength i may be plateauing with my weight loss i may be the same as i was maybe a month or two ago but my strength has actually gotten quite a bit better if for example your waist size is decreasing you're feeling more energized than normal and you're making positive changes with your habits then trust that you're moving in the right direction regardless of what that number on the scale tells you guys i can't stress how important it is that you set up your diet optimally from the beginning and equally it's important to know what to measure that's exactly why within our built with science programs we've not only created powerful custom tools for you to track your progress but we've also designed them to automatically adjust the plan for you in the event that your progress slows down it's been the key to the thousands of transformations our members have experienced to get access today just simply head on over to build with science.com and take our analysis quiz to discover what approach is best for you and your body anyways that is it for today guys don't forget to show your support by giving the video a like and subscribing to the channel thank you so much and i'll see you

    "title": "The Top 5 Foods to Lose Belly Fat (NO BULLSH*T!)",
    "published_at": "2023-06-04T13:00:46Z",
    "transcript": "lemon water cayenne pepper apple cider vinegar chia seeds and kombucha the top five foods Google said I should eat to lose belly fat while this will lead to the most uncomfortable dump of your life these won't do anything to get rid of belly fat let's cut through the BS and look at the real size behind the foods that can actually help you lose belly fat food number one has to do with something called calorie density here's what 200 calories of strawberries looks like here's 200 calories of oranges watermelon spinach zucchini mushrooms broccoli fat-free popcorn carrots green peas boiled potatoes shrimp and ground chicken breasts basically most fruits vegetables and low-fat foods classify as a low calorie density food whereas here is what 200 calories of a higher calorie density food like granola looks like and here's 200 calories worth of chocolate covered pretzels trail mix muffins ice cream cheese pork chop up ground beef and peanut butter now these low calorie density foods are so effective because your body is designed to hold on to your belly fat so the only way to get rid of it is to adhere to a calorie deficit for long enough simply put you need to eat less but there is a workaround you see Studies have shown that feeling full is more likely to make a person stop eating then is the calorie content of the food consumed and Studies have shown people who eat lower calorie density Foods consume fewer calories every day but end up eating more actual food think about it you can eat 400 calories of double stuffed Oreos and actually get even more hungry after or you could eat 200 calories of strawberries and pretty much eat yourself sick this is what makes high calorie density Foods so easy to overeat but that doesn't mean you should completely restrict yourself from them you just want to eat less of them and instead add more low to moderate calorie density Foods into your diet for example for breakfast instead of having high sugar granola go for a whole grain cereal with fruit or instead of having two pieces of toast have one piece with a side of raspberries in your morning coffee instead of whole fat milk or cream have skim milk or cashew milk for dinner instead of having two cups of rice have one cup of rice and one cup of green peas or a side of vegetables when you're watching TV and snacking instead of having trail mix or chips have some fat-free popcorn for dessert instead of one cup of regular ice cream have just half a cup with some fruit believe me these small changes to your diet will make it almost effortless for you to start losing fat especially when you pair it with the second food on our list so depending on the type of food you eat your body will burn a certain amount of calories just to digest that food research suggests that for carbs like rice and potatoes it burns about five to ten percent of those calories for digestion for fats like butter nuts and oils it's much lower between zero to three percent whereas for protein like chicken or fish it shoots all the way up to around 15 to 30 percent this is what's known as the thermic effect of food and as part of what makes our next Food lean proteins so effective for fat loss one study actually tested this by having subjects live in a lab where researchers could measure how many calories they burned every day they put one group of subjects on a high protein diet and two other groups on a low protein diet subjects on the high protein diet ended up burning about 70 calories more per day with another study of similar design finding a similar result now to be honest if you crunch the numbers the fat loss benefit you get from this isn't anything to get too excited about but the importance of having enough protein when losing fat goes far beyond this it's the most important food to help you maintain or even build more muscle as you lose fat which is going to help you look better once you get lean enough to lose your belly fat but it also seems to correlate well with preventing fat regain after your diet is over but it's important that you pick the right right types of protein because they're not all created equally and this goes back to calorie density you see some protein sources they contain significantly more calories relative to the amount of actual protein they deliver typically these are high fat protein foods like ground beef steak eggs pork chop and sausage whereas the lean proteins they deliver significantly more protein and for fewer calories egg whites shrimp protein powder low-fat Greek yogurt extra lean ground beef chicken breast turkey tofu and Whitefish are all great examples you can still have the fattier protein sources in moderation but by eating mostly leaner proteins you'll not only consume fewer calories but you can also potentially swap those saved fat calories for something else for example instead of having four whole eggs and toast if you had two whole eggs with some egg whites you'd be able to add a serving of fat to your meal such as peanut butter onto the toast or instead of having normal ground beef you can have extra lean ground beef and that'll leave you some room to top the meal with cheese or have some dark chocolate afterwards but choosing leaner proteins also comes with one more unique benefit for fat loss and it has to do with a third food on our list omega-6 poofa all right so remember how I recommended to moderate your intake of high fat foods while that is true you still need about 20 to 30 percent of your calories to come from fats to support your General Health and hormones but it seems like the specific types of fat you eat matter when it comes to belly fat but not the belly fat covering your abs the deep belly fats surrounding your organs that's associated with serious health implications illustrating this is a 2012 clinical trial that took 67 abdominally obese subjects and had them follow a 10 week diet plan designed to maintain their weight all the subjects ate the same amount of calories and the same amount of protein carbs and fats the only difference was one group had most of their fats come from saturated fat in this this case butter whereas the other group had most of their fats come from what's known as omega-6 polyunsaturated fat or pufa for short which are found in foods like nuts and vegetable oils such as sunflower oil so after the 10 weeks despite little to no changes in their body weight the saturated fat group ended up gaining a significant amount of liver fat Which is far worse for your health compared to the belly fat covering your abs whereas the polyunsaturated group again despite little to no changes in their body weight they ended up losing a significant amount of liver fat another study conducted in 2014 found similar results but this time a young normal weight individuals were put on a weight gaining diet one group was fed muffins high in saturated fat whereas the other group was fed muffins high in omega-6 pufa after seven weeks the saturated fat group gained significantly more liver fat significantly more visceral fat and significantly less lean mass than the pufu group some so to potentially avoid building up this dangerous fat in the belly and organs try to moderate the amount of daily fats you get from saturated sources such as bacon cheese butter cream and fatty Meats like pork and beef Instead try to have more of your fats come from foods rich in omega-6 pufa such as nuts seeds and Seed oils as well as omega-3 pufas which have been shown to have other health benefits and can be found in sources such as salmon tuna and flaxseed so the fourth food on the list is a controversial one and it was put to the test in a 2015 study where researchers took 300 overweight individuals and had them start the same weight loss program only difference was one group was assigned to drink an additional 24 ounces of water every day whereas the other group had to drink that same amount but with what the researchers called a non-nutritive sweetener which include diet sodas and pretty much any sugar-free drink here is a graph of the one year results notice that the sugar-free group not only experienced significantly greater weight loss but they were also better able to keep that weight off for good now what was the reason behind this well the water group ended up reporting an increase in hunger throughout their diet whereas a group with sugar-free drinks they reported no change in their hunger so it's possible that in the water group limiting access to Sweet beverages may have promoted their desire to satisfy their Cravings from other sources like candy and desserts I've definitely noticed this as well I personally always keep my fridge stock with some kind of sugar-free drink or diet soda and whenever a craven hits during the day or after a meal rather than going for some candy or chocolate oftentimes just having a sugar-free drink is all I'll need to satisfy it not to mention that if you're someone who regularly consumes sugary drinks or sodas then making this simple switch alone can easily save you hundreds of calories a day but let me know in the comments below what you think and if you've had any success by making the switch over to diet sodas or sugar free drinks so far I've given you a lot of great food options to lose fat but let's be honest some of the foods I mentioned won't appeal to you sure zucchini is a low calorie dense food and yes egg whites are a great lean protein Source but if you don't enjoy those Foods then don't force yourself to eat them the key to making your diet stick is to eat number five on your list your favorite foods for example here's Matt one of our built with science members who lost almost 80 pounds with our program and by eating healthy foods that he actually likes he loves mushrooms so he eats lots of them he also loves black beans and eggs so he makes breakfast burritos five times a week and for me personally I love wraps burritos and Shawarma so I make one pretty much every single day but I'll incorporate what I taught you earlier by using a low calorie wrap or pita adding plenty of veggies using a lean protein source and then adding fats or calorie dense condiments in moderation so pick a handful of your favorite foods from each of the categories we went through through add a couple of your favorite treats to have every now and then and that's pretty much your diet it's as simple as that guys and if you want someone to take care of all the guesswork for you and create a training and diet plan full of foods you actually enjoy and can stick to then head to build with science.com and take our free quiz to find the best science-based plan for you and your body it's worked for thousands of others and it will work for you highly recommend giving this video a watch next to learn about what I believe is the most underrated exercise to lose belly fat and

    "transcript": "the number one diet to lose fat I think I found it it's tough to lose fat let alone keep it off but there's a reason why the old saying abs are revealed in the kitchen is still around because it's true unfortunately there's a ridiculous amount of misinformation out there and even the popular diets that work tend to have more cons than Pros today I'm sharing the size back diet that's simple easy to stick to and just works here's everything you need to know first off you must understand that all fat loss diets regardless of what you call it have one simple goal to get you into a calorie deficit where you're eating fewer calories than you burn every day but in the diet I'll be showing you today rather than cutting out Foods the first step is actually the opposite eat more not just any food though I'm talking about protein one study published back in 2005 had participants change nothing else aside from eat twice as much protein as they usually do you'd expect since they were eating more they gain weight right well here's what actually happened after bumping up their protein intake the participants ended up eating 440 fewer calories every day without them even realizing it and after sticking to their high protein diet for 12 weeks they lost almost 10 lbs of fat now as for why this happened part of it is because protein is extremely filling try to eat 400 calories worth of chicken breast compared to a bowl of cereal and you'll be shocked with just how longer you stay full for but the real power of protein is that when you're in the calorie deficit your body can choose to burn off either fat or muscle for energy eating enough protein ideally at least 0.8 G per pound of your body weight per day it sends a powerful signal to your body to keep your muscle and burn off your fat for energy this is why high protein diets not only lead to more fat loss during the diet but have also been shown to be more effective at preventing fat regain after the diet is over however don't make the same mistake I did and start having chicken brass for breakfast lunch dinner and dessert you have plenty of other options for example here's what 30 G of different protein sources actually looks like for every one of your meals pick one that you actually enjoy so we're going to continue the theme of eating more but now with carbs so back when I was attempting one of my first diets ever I went on bodybuilding.com and I saw a post from a rip bodybuilder sharing his diet he explained how he cut out all his carbs and basically ate just meat and veggies so the next day I give it a shot I cut up bread rice candy even ketchup anything that contains some form of carbs Now by day three of this I felt like complete crap super low energy and my gym performance sucked now after about a week I actually did end up losing about 5 lb but I was confused because I didn't look or feel any better well this is why so when you cut out carbs initially you're going to lose a ton of weight but this is because carbs pull in water to your muscles so almost all of that initial weight loss is from water not a fat and the reason why cutting out carbs often that makes you feel like crap is because they're your main source of energy especially during high intensity exercise now eventually your body does adapt to this and learns to use other sources for energy but the research is clear as long as you're in the calorie deficit and eating enough protein you'll lose fat regardless of if you're eating a ton of carbs or none at all so for me personally I'm half Filipino and I grew up eating rice with almost every meal so cutting them out completely just didn't make any sense and you should have seen the look on my mom's face what I told her I wouldn't be eating rice for dinner that said the calories from carbs add up fast if you're currently overeating then you probably will need to cut back on some of your carbs or at least choose less processed carbs that can keep you Fuller for less calories a good strategy I personally use is saving most of my carbs for before and after my workout for when I need the most energy and then add them into my other meals depending on if I had the room for it I should probably address the elephant in the room which is my face I just got back from from Hawaii and I kid you not I had the most epic fight with a shark if you think my face looks bad you should see what I did to Mr shark okay fine this is what actually happened happy all right back to the diet all right so far we've talked a lot about protein and carbs but there is one more food group we've yet to cover fats unlike carbs and protein which only contain 4 calories per gram fats are much easier to overeat with because they contain more than double the calories at 9 calories per gram now aside from the obvious fats like desserts cupcakes or deep fried foods the real problems are often the hidden fats that pack on the calories without us even noticing for example here's what 200 calories of salad dressing Mayo cooking oil cream and butter actually look like I could easily scoop out a couple spoonfuls of peanut butter when I'm feeling a bit peckish and that could completely throw off my calorie intake for the day but just like with carbs you shouldn't completely cut out your fats just have them in moderation or try to make swaps like using skin milk instead of full cream spray oil instead of cooking oil choosing less batty cuts of meats or using a lower calorie salad dress that's said there are some high fat foods that I personally can't live without comment below what yours are but for me it's Donuts we have amazing doughnut recipes in our built with SI cookbook but still sometimes you just need the real thing you don't need to completely cudle anything from your diet there's ways to make them fit in moderation so you need to include lots of protein as well as some car cars and fats into your diet but how do you go about actually applying this into your meals well let's start off with what not to do this 2021 study had subjects follow a strict meal plan that I'll put a screenshot of here the goal was to put them in a calorie deficit and they weren't allowed to substitute any of the foods they were given after 10 weeks the results were great on average the participants lost about 7 lbs of fat but here's the catch as soon as the diet was over most of them quickly regained the fat they lost this is because sticking to strict meal plans doesn't actually teach you the proper habits of sustaining fat loss in the long run that's why I love what's known as the balanced plate concept instead of rigidly planning out your meals most of your meals should look something like this first fill a quarter of your plate with a protein Source like the ones I showed earlier next to keep you full fill half of your plate with vegetables and or fruits and then lastly balance out the last quarter of your plate with either carbs Andor fats and here's some great options from each food category that you can reference to start building your own balance plates for example for breakfast today I love eggs so I had a few of them as my main protein source with ketchup and then some whole green bread with sugar-free Jam as my carbs and then some fruit in the side and then for lunch I'm planning to have a balanced plate of extra lean ground beef steamed veggies and a side of hummus but you can also apply this concept when eating out I used to be that guy at restaurants restricting myself to just salads or pretending I wasn't hungry so I could just stick to my strict meal plan but instead of feeling restricted just tried to build or order a meal that fits within the general idea of having a balanced plate so far we've talked a lot about food but now you're probably wondering are there any supplements you can take to shortcut the process I'm sure you've seen your fair share of supplement ads of ripped guys and girls making all kinds of crazy promises simply take two inner shred and one sh of vcan first thing in the morning and it's like blow torch in your fat while these companies have mastered the art of using Marketing sales to take advantage of people who don't know any better their products are honestly a bunch of BS for example I personally spent hundreds of dollars on fat burners back in the day yet the research is clear they're basically just glorified caffeine pills that spike your heart rate up a little bit to burn a small amount of extra calories but doesn't do anything actually meaningful for fat loss now while there are a few legitimate supplements that can help you fill in the gas from your diet such as the omega-3 vitamin D and zinc there is one supplement that's probably the single best fat loss tool you can invest in illustrating this power is a study from the British Journal of nutrition that had a group of subjects first complete a 4-we diet after the diet they split the subjects into two groups one group added a 30 G protein shake into their day whereas the other group did not surprisingly the protein shake group regained less fat after the diet was over and also maintained a smaller waste Comforts so if you're someone who struggles to eat enough protein every day then you need to make protein powder your best friend as for which one is the best the most regulated highest quality protein is called whe isolate now I do sell my own brand of whe isolate over at builtwith science.com which I'll admit is more on the pricey side because of the top quality and the 29 g of protein you get per scoop but regardless of if you get it from me or from somewhere else I highly recommend making the investment so by now you should have a good idea as to what foods to include in your diet but one factor most people Overlook is how often they eat I used to think skipping meals was a great idea if I didn't eat much or just snack lightly throughout the day I wouldn't be getting many calories in and that would surely lead to a calorie deficit but this quickly became a nasty cycle I'd end up feeling like crap by the end of the day and as soon as I finally ate something my stomach would just be a bottomless pit that never got satisfied generally you should avoid Ever Getting to a point where you're feeling dizzy have low blood sugar and want to eat everything ins sight that's it there is a popular diet called intermitted fasting where you don't eat your first meal until usually around 12:00 p.m. and then don't eat anything past 8:00 p.m. I've personally used this in the past and it worked really well not because it's magic but because it can make stick into a calorie deficit Easier by fitting all your meals into a smaller time window but nowadays I prefer a more regular schedule of eating with at least 3 to four main meals per day spread out by around 3 to 4 hours from each other and then I'll just add in one to two snacks or fruit between my meals when I'm the most hungry just keep in mind that your body will need time to adjust if you change your eating schedule but if done properly you should feel improved and consistent levels of energy throughout your whole day now speaking about when you eat did you know that where you eat also matters this study published in 2021 analyzed the food environments of over 8,000 households it found that one of the strongest predictors of being overweight was eating meals in front of a TV in addition to this a few other interesting Studies have shown that slowing down your meal by taking more bites using Chopsticks or eating with smaller utensils all has a powerful effect on reducing hunger and potentially boosting fat loss I disappointed my Asian mom by never becoming a doctor but you can imagine just how excited she was when I told her I'd now be eating rice using her Chopsticks and sitting down at the table for dinner but remember you got to take things of moderation it's okay to eat popcorn while watching the movie or watch my YouTube videos during the occasional lunch break it's just not a great Habit to eat every single one of your meals in front of the screen so the strategies I've shared with you so far should help you get into a caliber deficit but I don't know if you guys have ever seen the video where average people try to keep up with a professional Marathon runner's pace and end up falling off after like 20 seconds that's kind of like what it's like if you completely change your diet overnight sure bodybuilders and hardcore Fitness guys like myself have no problem losing fat fast if needed but you'll make way more progress making just small changes at a time and aiming to lose even just half a pound of fat every single week consistently rather than losing a pound or two on some weeks and then gaining it all back again on other weeks now as for how many calories is R for your body you can head over to our custom calculator over at builtwithscience docomo give you calories for faster fat loss or slower fat loss depending on what's more realistic for you but just keep in mind that you will mess up at some point maybe you'll binge e really bad one night or maybe you'll have a cheat meal gone wrong and that's okay it's happened to me countless times one meal or even a whole day of eating junk won't ruin your progress but if you find yourself cheating on your diet too often then that's often a sign that you need to make it more enjoyable for example can tuna is cheap it's high protein and it's low calorie but I can't stand it and excluding it from my diet hasn't affected my fat loss results at all on the other hand I love certain Filipino dishes like chicken Adoba and C C so whenever my mom makes them I always find a way to fit them in or sometimes I'll just make healthier versions of them within our Bel with.com programs we also give our members access to hundreds of easy tasty high protein recipes that make dieting so much easier but look online and just get experimenting create a diet you actually enjoy because that's what you'll be more likely to stick to in the long run now while we've looked at how to structure your meals and what to put in them creating a healthy fat loss diet doesn't have to be crazy expensive in fact I created one of the cheapest fat loss meal buttons it includes all the concepts we've discussed in this video and it only cost around $5 a day so make sure to watch this video next to learn all about how to make the meals but if you need more

    "published_at": "2019-09-01T17:06:16Z",
    "transcript": "[Music] when it comes to losing fat we all know the importance of nutrition you can train as hard and as often as you're physically capable of but if you aren't eating the right meals and in the right amounts then you're simply not going to see the fat loss results that you're after but at the same time this is also where most people get stuck because with all the misinformation out there it becomes difficult to know what exactly you should be eating in order to burn fat most effectively but the truth is it's a lot more simple than you may think and it essentially comes down to just a few key tips that i'll be sharing in this video that most ripped lean individuals incorporate into their own daily meals before we dive into those tips though let's clear something up despite what you may have been led to believe there are no magical fat loss foods that will somehow burn fat for you without a calorie deficit in place as we know that at the end of the day that's what's going to ultimately determine if you lose fat or not so therefore in order to optimize your nutrition for fat loss it's absolutely vital that you design your meals such that they make it much easier and more likely for you to maintain a calorie deficit to burn fat and we can do so by incorporating meals that fill you up more and fill you up for longer as this is going to help you maintain your deficit and prevent you from overeating and this is especially true given that research has shown that an increase in appetite is one of the main reasons why fat loss eventually slows down for most people in fact in the 2009 paper the researchers found that as subjects lost fat they also began to experience an increase in hunger that led them to subconsciously consume more calories and cause their fat loss progress to come to a halt so to help you avoid this in this video we'll go through three key tips along with various fat loss meal examples that you can use and incorporate right away the first thing you want to do is incorporate foods into your meals that are highly satiating and to do this we'll use the findings of a classic 1995 study where researchers from the university of sydney investigated the effects of 38 different common foods on hunger levels the researchers fed subjects a serving size of 240 calories of each common food and then measured subjective hunger ratings afterwards and as you can see in the results here out of the list of the 38 foods popcorn oats fish potatoes apples and oranges were shown to have the greatest satiating effect and kept subjects fuller for longer meaning that incorporating these specific foods into your daily meals is a great way to keep you full throughout the day without sacrificing a ton of calories therefore providing the best bang for your buck and an easy way to implement this information is to simply make a few smart food swaps into your current meals for example instead of having a bowl of cereal for breakfast swish these out for oats which have a 45 greater effect on satiety and instead of having white pasta or white rice in your main meals switch these out for baked or boiled potatoes which have a 63 percent and 57 greater effect on satiety respectively and then for your snacks it would be wise to choose high satiety fruits like oranges and apples in order to keep you full between meals but by incorporating these simple swaps into your meal plan it's going to make a huge difference in your ability to stay full and maintain a calorie deficit day after day and hence improve your ability to burn fat next it's key that you make sure that the foods you eat are high in volume relative to their calorie density because one of the signs that your nervous system uses to signal fullness to your brain is the degree at which your stomach stretches so as you can imagine the higher in volume the foods are that you eat the more you're going to be able to fill up and stretch the stomach meaning that if you design your meals such that you incorporate foods that are higher in volume yet lower in calorie density you're going to be able to stay full and satisfied for longer without having to intake a ton of calories illustrating this point is a paper from the journal of clinical nutrition which found that modifying a pasta dish by replacing some of the pasta with vegetables instead not only lowered the calorie content of the meal but also led to subjects feeling more full and more satisfied after the meal leading them to consume less calories than they would otherwise so obviously veggies are an excellent choice for this but other practical high-volume foods you should consider implementing into your own meal regimen also include fruits air popped popcorn broth-based soups and potatoes for example and to put this into perspective for you let's compare 100 calories of rice cakes and a 100 calorie bowl of popcorn to this 100 calorie slice of bread and 100 calories of chips it's pretty clear which ones are going to keep you fuller for much longer and for the same amount of calories and to be totally honest simply incorporating more fruits and veggies into all of your meals is what i personally do and would recommend you start doing as well which can be very easily done by just swapping in a couple servings of vegetables into each of your meals as doing so is going to do wonders in terms of keeping you full and maintaining your calorie deficit the next tip is to simply boost the protein content of your meal this is because multiple research reviews have shown that protein is significantly more filling than both carbohydrates and fats so by increasing the protein content of your meals it's going to aid in fat loss by making you feel more satisfied and more likely to stay in the calorie deficit a classic example of this is a 2005 study from the university of washington which found that when subjects increased their protein intake from 15 to 30 percent of their daily calorie intake they experienced a sustained decrease in hunger and their spontaneous food intake dropped by an average of around 500 calories per day which over the course of 12 weeks enabled them to lose over 8 pounds of fat and in fact research shows that an increase in protein intake in your diet that's as small as just five percent will help with losing fat by enhancing satiety and promoting muscle maintenance so even if you're not a fan of high protein foods even just slightly boosting the protein content of your meals is also helpful but based on the 2018 review paper generally the optimal protein amount to aim for per meal seems to be around 0.4 grams of protein per kilogram of your body weight particularly if you consume 4 meals or 3 meals in a high protein snack throughout the day so aiming towards that goal per meal by incorporating various high quality protein sources is going to be an easy way to keep you full throughout the day and indirectly boost fat loss as a result so to help you put this all into practice you want to prioritize having more highly satiated foods incorporate more high volume low calorie foods and consume a protein source within every main meal for breakfast a great option is oats for its highly satiating effect which can also be combined with whey protein powder in order to boost the protein content and hence the fullness for this meal even more and strawberries are also a great low calorie high volume food that can be added into the oats to further boost satiety and then for lunch and or dinner boiled potatoes are a great option since they were found to be the most satiated in food add a highly satiating protein source such as fish to the meal and more volume through the use of veggies and you have a solid meal that's going to keep you full for several hours on end and lastly for snacks as mentioned earlier foods such as minimally flavored popcorn oranges and apples are all great options that are going to keep you full until your next meal i hope that you're able to see that as little tweaks in your diet like the ones i went through in this video that really make all the difference when it comes to losing fat as fast as possible that's exactly why within my build with science programs i not only show you what and how much you should be eating that in order to lose fat

    "transcript": "i'm gonna give you a four step plan to set up your next fat loss diet step by step we're going to be filling in a planner for your meal we'll first determine your calorie and protein goals and how many meals you should have then we'll fill in these meals with specific foods by the end of this video you'll have a system that you can use to build countless different meal plans that you can actually stick to in theory meal plans sound great but i remember back in the day stumbling across one from an online fitness forum it involved eating the same four bland boring lifeless meals every single day for weeks on end to lose fat now don't get me wrong i had a lot of willpower and i could put up with the lack of variety in the meals but what i could not put up with was the fact that after all this hard work and suffering i didn't even get any results and it wasn't until a lot of trial and error afterwards did i learn why this was and it came down to two reasons the first reason has to do with this healthy breakfast of eggs avocado toast banana and peanut butter it's a meal that most would think is great for losing fat but would you guess that this meal alone racks up to over a thousand calories these foods are by no means bad but they can easily take you out of a calorie deficit it's a reason why the meal plan that i used back in the day never ended up working and is why you need to be aware of roughly how many calories you're consuming with any meal plan as it can add up very quickly showcasing the dangers of reason 2 is a group of resistance trained males and females from a recent 2021 study who like me followed a strict meal plan for 10 weeks their meal plan consisted of 4 meals and they were instructed to only eat foods that were included on their specific meal plan and to not make any food substitutions throughout the 10 weeks they were actually able to successfully lose about 7 pounds of fat but they then regained much of that as soon as they went off their meal plan after the study was over the meal plan that we're going to go through today will be both personalized to your body and set up in a flexible way for both short-term and long-term success also as you go through the video you'll want to download a free copy of the custom meal plan builder that we've created for you with it you're going to be able to easily create endless custom meal plans based on your body you can download it at builtwithscience.commealplanner and i'll also leave a link to this in the description box down below the first step is the most important step if we want the meal plan to actually work there's no point adding any foods into our plan if we don't yet know how many calories you can eat to lose fat now most calorie calculators out there are honestly a shot in the dark they don't consider how much muscle you have how much you move every day whether you lift weights or not your age your gender and your height which all affect how many calories that you burn every day the method we're going to use involves just a few simple steps that's going to enable us to take all these factors into account and will be the easiest way for you to accurately determine the calorie target for your meal plan but to save you from the boring math we've actually automated these calculations for you into the custom meal plan builder that i mentioned earlier within just a few minutes of using it you're gonna have your gold calories calculated for you all right so after calories the next most important component of your meal plan is how much protein it contains we want to include enough protein to be able to maintain your muscle as you lose fat too little and you're going to risk losing muscle this means ending up just skinny rather than lean and muscular after your diet as for how much protein you should aim for a 2018 research study that looked at almost 50 protein studies found the sweet spot to be right around 0.8 to 1 gram per pound of body weight whether you shoot for the lower end or the higher end of this range however is going to depend on your body fat those with more body fat are going to require less protein in the meal plan builder that you can download we've actually automated this calculation for you as well most of you will end up with a goal of one gram per pound of your body weight so for example a goal of 180 grams of protein if you weighed 180 pounds once you have that number all that we have to do before we fill in your meal plan with actual foods is determine how many meals you should be eating so the number of meals that you eat per day will determine how many calories and protein will actually go into each of these meals although eating more frequently is commonly thought to boost your metabolism this has been disproven that being said protein frequency does seem to be important if you want to minimize the risk of losing muscle as you lose fat and because of this there is an ideal range that you want to stick with them this range seems to be between roughly three and six high protein meals per day each separated by a few hours and this is where personal preference is key are you somebody who prefers eating more food and less frequent meals or do you prefer eating less food and more frequently whatever you pick should best suit your schedule and keep you full and energized throughout the day once you pick the number of meals that you'd like to eat divide your protein intake up evenly across the number of meals so for example if your daily goal is to consume 180 grams of protein and you prefer to eat five meals per day then you simply aim to have roughly 35 grams of protein in each meal now it's time for the fun part filling in your meal plan at this point some of you may be wondering what about carbs and fats how much of those should i eat well that is a good question numerous studies have compared the effects of high carb diets with more rice potatoes and bread but less fats like oils butters and cheese versus low carb diets with more fats instead but as long as calories and protein were the same between the diets there were no significant differences on fat loss because of that i prefer not complicating things by having you worry about eating specific amounts of carbs and fats instead in the custom meal plan builder we're going to provide you with three lists of protein carbs and fats to use to fill your meal plan with the foods in these lists are the lowest calorie density options available and will be highly effective at keeping you full for protein here are the options and visual demonstrations of what 100 calories of these foods look like you'll use these to reach your daily protein target in the downloadable meal plan builder we've also added vegetarian and vegan protein options to the list here's the same for common carb sources here's the same for various fruits and veggies you can see how much more volume you get with fruits and vegetables and why there's such a great way to keep you full when dieting here's fats these you want to be a little bit more mindful of because of how quickly their calories can add up and finally here are a handful of low-calorie condiments and seasoning and salt that you can add to your meals as you wish you can also feel free to add your own items to these lists as well all right so now it is time to use this food list to create your meal plan all you're going to do is add each meal select the foods from each category that you want to eat so that by the end of the day you get close to your calorie and protein goal by at least within about 10 so using our previous example let's say that your calorie goal is 1900 calories your protein goal is 180 grams and you prefer to have five high protein meals a day jot down roughly the times you'd plan to have these meals then let's start with protein so in this case you want to try to split up the 180 grams of protein fairly evenly over each of your five meals pick from the list of protein sources and plug them into each meal accordingly the carbs and fats that you add to next will also contain some protein so don't worry if you're about 10 to 20 grams short of your protein goal after the step after you've selected a protein source for each meal it's time to pick a carb source now if you're going to be working out then generally you want to make sure that you include a carb source in the meal before your workout other than that if there is a meal that you want to exclude carbs from then that is perfectly fine in our example it might look like this so after this you're going to pick your fat sources so most people do best when they exclude this category from their pre-workout meal to avoid feeling too full during the workout but it is totally up to you make this your meal plan next based on your preference pick a vegetable and a fruit to add so these are going to be the most filling foods relative to the calories so i'd recommend including at least one into each meal last but not least add your favorite low calorie condiments and preferred seasonings throw in a little bit of your inner chef into each meal and you'll have a meal plan that is both designed specifically for your body and filled with meals that you actually enjoy you'll also be left with the knowledge and resources to change up your meals however and whenever you wish and again to download the free custom meal plan builder we made for you to help you easily create your meal plans just head on over to

    "transcript": "one of the biggest decisions you have to make when starting out in the gym is choosing what workout split you're going to use or in other words simply figuring out how you're going to group your exercises throughout the week for example when i first started going to the gym i used what was popularized in fitness magazines and what everyone at the gym seemed to be doing the bro split which simply involves training each muscle group once per week with high volume within each workout and after a few years of this style of training as you can see in this photo of me at i believe 18 or 19 years old i definitely made good progress but looking back with the knowledge i now have it begs the question as to whether or not i would have progressed noticeably faster had i used a different or better workout routine than the bro split and honestly i think there's a good chance i would have and as for what i would have done instead and recommend you do as well let's first take a look at our options one popular option is to train certain groups of muscles together during each workout the upper lower split is a good example of this and involves training your upper body together and your lower body together another similar concept is the push-pull leg split where again multiple muscles are trained together each workout another popular option which is basically the opposite of the bro split is a full body routine in which you train all of your muscles during your workouts mainly through the use of compound exercises and these other workout splits are likely superior to the bro split for a variety of reasons the main reason though as explained in my training frequency video and is outlined in this 2016 meta-analysis by schoenfeld and colleagues is that when volume is matched training each muscle at least two times per week results in significantly greater muscle growth than training each muscle just once per week as you do in a bro split in fact as stated in a further meta-analysis by greg knuckles subjects training at a higher frequency grew 38 faster than those training at a lower frequency and a similar result was found for upper body strength gains as well which is likely due to higher training frequencies not only being able to better optimize the protein synthesis response throughout the week but also enabling you to perform higher quality sets for example if you do 16 sets of chest per week with four exercises using a bro split you would start to fatigue after your first exercise and your performance would decrease from then on whereas if you were to split that into two workouts per week for example as part of your push days then you'd be able to perform those exercises with better quality since you're not doing as much volume all at once thus you can see how the bro split may not be the best option for these reasons and opting for a split that instead trains each muscle at least twice per week is likely optimal but now moving forward as for which of these splits is best for you it depends on a variety of factors but mainly on your training experience for example if you're a beginner and just getting started in the gym then i'd recommend the full body workout split two to three times per week where within each workout you use mainly compound exercises to hit every muscle and the reason being is because as a beginner your primary goal should be to master the main movements in the gym by improving your motor learning coordination and building up a base level of strength and endurance without causing excessive muscle damage and since a full body training split enables you to perform these movements more frequently when compared to other splits you're able to master them more effectively and build a solid base of strength faster than you would otherwise in fact this 2018 paper by ochi and colleagues found that training each muscle three times per week as you do in a full body split was not only more effective at improving strength in untrained individuals when compared to lower training frequencies but it also reduced their rate of perceived exertion meaning that they felt their workouts were easier and they were able to recover faster despite actually performing the same amount of volume as the lower frequency group which is a major bonus as a beginner since you're more prone to muscle damage fatigue and soreness from your workouts however despite the various benefits of full body workouts given the positive relationship between volume and muscle growth as you gain more experience you're inevitably going to have to increase volume in order to further progress at the optimal rate and although you could simply continue increasing the volume of your full body workouts there will come a point where your workouts just become too long and fatiguing to complete and in fact based on research in rats at least there may be an upper limit to the number of sets you can do per muscle in a single workout before its benefit on muscle protein synthesis plateaus although the exact number is not clear it does imply that once we go above a certain threshold of workout volume splitting it into separate workouts throughout the week should produce greater muscle growth than performing it all in a single workout hence why i'd recommend that once your progress stalls with the full body split switch to a four day upper lower split or something similar such that you have more training days to fit in extra volume and then as you gain even more experience it can be wise and possibly more enjoyable for you to switch to a 5-day routine or 6-day push-pull leg split or something similar to once again fit in extra volume as needed to continue progressing without causing your workouts to be excessively long but as you can see although some routines have various advantages over others there really isn't a best workout split your training routine should be simply viewed as a tool to organize your work of volume in a way that is most enjoyable and most practical for you whether it's with a bro split like i started out with one of the alternatives i mentioned or something completely different just know that workout volume and consistency are the more important factors so focus mainly on those two variables and you will see positive results regardless of the workout split you use and that's pretty much it for the video thank you so much for watching and to sum everything up for you here are the main points that you'll want to keep in mind i hope that this video was able to clear up any confusion you might have had regarding choosing the right workout split and if you're looking for an all-in-one evidence-based program that combines all of this research for

    "title": "How To Eat To Lose Belly Fat (3 STAGES!)",

    "transcript": "belly fat is really easy to gain but seems almost impossible to lose now you're probably aware that your diet is the key to losing fat from this area but you likely have no idea where to start let alone how to keep fallouts going for long enough to get rid of the most stubborn areas today I'll show you step by step in three stages how to eat to start losing fat and how to keep that going until you successfully lost all of your belly fat and for good before we dive into the three stages let me explain what these stages mean and why you need them in the first place so you're likely somewhere between a body fat of 15 and 25 or maybe even higher regardless of where you are right now you need to lose enough fat from other areas of your body before your body will start prioritizing burning off your belly fat for energy for most people this starts to really happen around 15 body fat by the time you reach around 12 or 10 body fat your belly fat will be almost completely gone now while your diet is key to achieving this the diet you use to get you from let's say 25 to 15 most often won't be enough to take you down to the next level of 12 the same is true for going from 12 down to even 10 as you get leaner and leaner there's certain things you need to be aware of and certain changes you should make with your diet to prevent you from getting stuck and to prevent you from losing muscle let's start with stage one the first stage is designed to kick-start the fat loss process and keep it going until you get to about 15 body fat throughout this stage your hunger levels will be low your risk of muscle loss will also be low and physiologically it will be the easiest stage to get through the stage is actually quite simple there's only two factors you need to focus on calories and protein let's first talk about calories you don't need to completely cut out carbs sugar or any of your favorite foods all you need to do is create what's known as an energy deficit to start forcing your body to burn body fat for energy you create this deficit by consuming less calories than your body Burns every day now to find the appropriate energy deficit for your body take your body weight in pounds and multiply that by anywhere from 11 to 13. if you're a taller individual younger or more active go with the higher end if you're shorter individual older or less active go with the lower end the number you get will be a rough estimate of the amount of calories you should eat every day but to hit your goal calorie intake some foods are better than others what I recommend is focusing on what's known as low calorie density Foods these are foods that for the amount of space they take up in your stomach will only add a relatively low amount of calories to your daily total for example here's what 200 calories of Oreos look like and here's what 200 calories of cereal looks like for the same amount of calories you could fill your stomach with a mountain full of strawberries and carrots not only that but since low calorie density Foods tend to be unprocessed they also tend to require more calories to burn and digest the more processed foods now as for how much of a difference this can make for fat loss a recent 2019 paper took 20 adults and first ran them through a diet consisting of only high calorie density processed foods for two weeks afterwards they switch them to a diet of low calorie density unprocessed foods for two weeks in both conditions they were allowed to eat as much food as they wanted the result the processed foods diet led to almost 2 pounds of weight gain once they switch the unprocessed diet however their daily calorie intake dropped by over 500 calories and they ended up losing over two pounds at the end of the stage I'll provide a list of low calorie density food items for you to pick from but before that there is one more Factor you need to pay attention to although eating fewer calories in your body needs will help you lose weight you want as much of that weight loss to be from fat rather than muscle this is where protein comes in you need to start eating more of it in fact in studies where subjects go on the same diet and lose the same amount of weight the ones who eat more protein end up losing more fat and less muscle as for how much protein you should aim for a good recommendation for relatively heavier males in the stage who are at a higher body fat is to eat one gram per centimeter over your height so if you're 175 centimeters tall you need to eat around 175 grams of protein per day with the recipe calories coming from carbs and fats whereas if you're a relatively lighter individual or closer to 15 body fat then you want to multiply your body weight in pounds by 0.8 and at a minimum eat that many grams of protein per day now this might sound like a lot at first but as you'll see it's pretty easy to do if you choose the right protein sources so to apply this all take a look at these lists here's a list of some low calorie density unprocessed foods and here's a list with protein sources ordered from highest to lowest in terms of how much protein they contain relative to their calories use these lists to build your meals throughout the day and try to have one lean protein source and at least one serving of fruits and or veggies into each of your meals for example instead of a muffin for breakfast have some egg whites with blueberries and oatmeal you definitely still can have processed foods now and then but just be mindful of your serving sizes and enjoy them in moderation so Focus only on calories and protein every day and if you're consistent you'll be able to get your body fat all the way down to 15 but at this point is when you'll likely need to refine your approach to continue getting results before we dive into the next stage I'm curious what stage are you currently in right now and what's your goal body fat percentage let me know in the comments down below and also let me know if what I'm about to say later on in this video changes your mind at all about your goal this is where stage two comes in which involves going from 15 down to 12 body fat by this point you'll be hungrier your fat loss will slow down and you'll be at a slightly greater risk of muscle loss as a result this is where most people get stuck there's two things that will help you overcome this first you need to get more precise with your approach from stage one as your body loses more and more fat your metabolism will decrease and you'll start burning fewer calories per day this is your body's way of protecting its remaining fat Source this means the energy deficit you use in stage one to get down to 15 body fat May no longer be enough to get you down to 12 body fat to overcome this if you haven't yet been doing so you should start tracking your daily calorie intake and doing so more carefully you might not think this is necessary but research has shown the average person will think they eat about 429 less calories per day on average than they actually do so even if just temporarily measure out your food to see how many calories you're actually consuming and ensure you're in an energy deficit second this stage is when you'll want to start addressing your carb and fat intake take a look at this list of carbs and fats although healthy fats are needed in your diet on a gram per gram basis fats contain more than twice as many calories as carbs do because of this an effective approach is to keep your protein intake high as is but lower your daily fat intake to the lower end of what's recommended for General Health this is about 20 to 25 percent of your daily calorie intake as a result you'll now have room to introduce more carbs into your diet these extra carbs can not only help you better manage your hunger levels but they'll also provide you with the Boost and energy to support your daily activities and performance of the gym helping you burn more calories every day and better maintain your muscle mass make these two weeks and if you're consistent you'll be able to get down to around 12 body fat this is where stage three comes in this is the most difficult stage while consistency with what we mentioned earlier will be the key to progressing through the stage it's going to require more discipline and sacrifice first off not only will you very likely have to be accurately tracking your calories every day you'll also want to ensure your daily meals are making the best use of The Limited calories you have at this point your hunger levels will be the highest they've been so most of your meals throughout the day will need to come from high volume foods that will help you stay full for less calories I do have a past video I made that shows the most effective high volume food swaps to make which I'll link at the end of this video but this also means that you'll need to be more disciplined when it comes to social events and dining out you don't have to eliminate it completely but you will have to make wise choices when you're out and make sure that you plan in advance for big meals out or for alcohol both of which can drastically increase your calorie intake without you even realizing it lastly ask yourself if the sacrifices are worth it in my opinion for most natural lifters a body fat of around 12 to 15 percent is the most sustainable physique it's practical to maintain you get the health benefits of being leaner and you'll still look great especially if you have a good amount of muscle on you and well developed Abs from training them while getting leaner than this yes it's going to provide a bit more definition than cuts it not only requires a lot more sacrifice but for many people that's when daily energy levels and strength will start to be negatively effective and unlike our built with science member Patrick over here who started off with a good amount of muscle you might actually not end up liking the way you look being really lean if you haven't yet built up much muscle so while you definitely can get to 10 body fat by pushing through with what you've learned at least consider hanging around at a higher level body fat first and be proud of how far you've come and realize that the extra push just may not be worth it especially if you can't maintain it overall guys the strategy when it comes to your nutrition is actually quite simple the hard part is staying consistent with it you have to be clear about what your goals are and then find what you personally enjoy and can stick to consistently in the long run and if you're looking for step-by-step Guidance with setting up your nutrition plan and finding foods and meals that you actually look forward to eating every

    "title": "How To Build Muscle For $8/Day (HEALTHY MEAL PREP ON A BUDGET)",
    "published_at": "2020-11-01T18:30:12Z",
    "transcript": "there's a common misconception out there that eating healthy and tasty is expensive today i'm going to share the truth and show you exactly how you can build an effective and healthy muscle building diet for just over eight dollars a day so the first thing we need to do to make this happen is we need to choose the right food sources we want to choose nutritious protein fats and carb sources that'll not only be the best option for us to use to build muscle with but are also the most budget-friendly options to hit our calorie and macronutrient targets with and based on the analysis of multiple sources here is a pretty accurate list of the best options for each category for protein some excellent options that maximize the amount of protein that you get per dollar are foods like eggs milk canned tuna chicken breasts and lean ground turkey for example but at the same time don't discount the cost effectiveness of whey protein powder although it may seem expensive when you look at it from a cost per tub perspective most whey protein powders actually come out to be just as cost effective as chicken breast or canned tuna when it comes to the amount of actual protein it delivers per dollar because it contains minimal fat and carbs and the fact that it is such a high quality and convenient source of protein that can be used in a variety of ways it makes it a great budget-friendly option as for carbs the best options here are oats bananas rice pinto beans and potatoes for fats the best bang for your buck would be olive oil and peanut butter as for vegetables to help with your vitamin mineral intake carrots onions cabbage and romaine lettuce are some notable options and lastly as for cost-effective condiments and seasoning i'd highly recommend investing in salt pepper paprika garlic powder soy sauce and salsa as these are staples that for a very minimal cost can easily add a ton of flavor and variety into whatever dish you choose to make overall these lists will provide you with the most budget-friendly yet healthy food sources to create your meal plan with however to take this one step further you want to then purchase these foods at the most budget-friendly grocery stores bank of america actually recently conducted a study on this and they compared the price of a pre-determined grocery list at various supermarkets as you can see here the difference in price from the most cost-friendly option walmart to the priciest option whole foods was almost about 30 so sticking to cost-friendly stores like the ones on this list and some other notable ones like aldi will be wise to minimize additional costs i'm going to be using the walmart prices for this meal plan so knowing that let's put this into practice and dive into our muscle building meal plan the meal plan will consist of four main meals with at least 20 grams of protein within each meal in order to keep our muscle protein synthesis levels elevated throughout the day so we're going to aim for a daily total of roughly 2700 calories and 160 grams of protein but after you run through it i'll provide you with some guidance on how to implement the plan and then how to customize it to best suit your body so to start off we're gonna make a smoothie that takes just five minutes to whip together here we'll use a third of a cup of oatmeal one frozen banana two cups of two percent milk two tablespoons of peanut butter a scoop of whey protein and then just blend this all together  the total of this comes up to just one dollar and seventy cents yet provides a great return in terms of convenience calories protein and nutrients meal two is going to be an egg stir fry here we're going to need three whole eggs half a cup of uncooked brown rice with a chicken stock cube thrown in there for some additional flavor half a cup of diced carrots half a cup of diced celery half a cup of diced cabbage and some soy sauce and garlic powder to taste for a grand total of 1.51 cents first give your rice a good rinse and throw it in a pot or rice cooker use a finger hack to cook the rice by lining up the water with the first line of your index finger this asian hack guarantees perfect rice consistency without fail then throw in your chicken stock cube and let cook next scramble your eggs in a pan and set that aside once that's done throw your veggies in the pan with some garlic until the veggies are cooked through add in your rice and soy sauce and give it a nice mix for a few minutes last but not least take it off the heat and add in your scrambled eggs give it a taste and then add whatever additional seasoning or sauce is needed meal 3 is going to be a fajita bowl here we're going to again need half a cup of uncooked brown rice with a chicken stock cube four ounces of uncooked chicken breast one green pepper one sweet onion one cup of canned pinto beans half a cup of salsa and some paprika and salt for a total of two dollars and 84 cents all right time to get cooking so we're going to use the exact same rice cooking process as a previous meal but don't worry after i go through all the meals i'm going to show you how to properly cook your rice in bulk as your rice is cooking throw your chicken green peppers and onions in a pan and season with paprika and some salt after a little bit throw in your canned pinto beans mix it all up and you're ready for plating add the mix beside your cooked rice and top with salsa if you prefer for some additional flavor and there you have it about a third of the price of a chipotle bowl yet just as tasty and packed with a ton of protein and nutrients the final meal is going to be some ground turkey with a side of roasted sweet potato and green beans here we're going to need about four and a half ounces of raw ground turkey about eight ounces of chopped sweet potato a handful of green beans a tablespoon of olive oil and a mix of different seasoning for a total of two dollars and 34 cents to start place your chopped sweet potato on a baking sheet season with salt and pepper drizzle over a tablespoon of olive oil and then give it a nice mix roast for 30 minutes at 400 degrees as that's going cook up your ground turkey in a pan with some salt pepper garlic and paprika in a separate pot of pan steam your green beans by adding a bit of water covering it and then let it steep until cooked to your liking and there you have it if you got some extra change to spare feel free to top this meal with some cinnamon or ketchup for some extra flavor but this alone guys it honestly tastes great without breaking the bank so now that we've gone through the plan let's go over some important information as to how to actually implement it first let's cover how to prep it what i'd recommend is meal prepping the three meals but not the smoothie and instead just making that fresh as it takes just five minutes to do so and will taste a lot better i'd also recommend prepping these meals to be good for three days since if you prep for the whole week some of the components will start to get a little bit off tasting and looking by the end of the week you can alternatively cook a week or even two weeks worth of meals in advance freeze it and then just take it out as needed if you're short on time but cooking it fresh in smaller batches instead is generally what'll taste best so as for how to do this it's very simple you just cook enough of each ingredient i've gone through to last for three days worth of meals so for example when you're cooking the rice in our meal plan we use it in two of our meals every day and we use half a cup of uncooked rice each time so when we cook it in batch we simply multiply this amount by three and we find that we want to cook a total of three cups to have enough rice to cover these meals for three days then you just repeat this with the rest of the ingredients by multiplying their amounts by three to see how much you'll need to cover for three days worth and use this strategy to guide your grocery shopping as well i personally recommend that for the perishable foods like your protein sources and veggies shop once a week for just enough to cover a week's worth of meals to avoid minimizing any waste and additional costs next let's cover how to add some variety to your meal plan so you're not sick of eating the same meals every single day and doing this is actually quite simple and it can be done by just swapping out some of your protein carb or fat sources in your meal for an equivalent amount of another budget friendly food source instead for your convenience i've created a list of swaps for each of the main protein carbs and fat sources within each meal these swaps will provide a similar amount of calories and nutrients as the original but can help just add some variety whenever you need it in addition to this just experiment with different seasoning sauces and veggies for each dish as well as this is a very easy way to change the flavors of the dish and just add some variety whenever you may need it lastly let's cover how to tweak the calories and macros of this meal plan to better suit you basically you want to prioritize amine for around 1 gram of protein per pound of your body weight and a calorie intake of your body weight in pounds multiplied by around 15 to 17 as these two factors are what's most important once you have these two targets set you can simply increase or decrease the portions of the meals in this plant as needed so for example if you require less than 2 700 calories simple tweaks to the carbs and or fats such as reducing the serving size of the rice in one meal by half can lower the calorie total quite significantly or for example if you require more protein than 160 grams just slightly bumping up the servings of each of the protein sources while of course being mindful of the additional calories that this will add will easily do the trick play around with it but don't stress over this too much the key is to just get started experimenting with it monitor how your weight is changing and then adjust the serving sizes to ensure that you're not either gaining weight too quickly or on the other hand you're not losing weight because it's just not enough calories that's pretty much all there is to it and to help you out even further with implementing this i've actually created a budget meal plan that puts all of these recipes together for you with a full grocery list included as well to grab a copy of this just head on over to buildwithscience.com forward slash budget meal plan and i'll send it right over to you and i'll also leave a link to this in the description box down below but hopefully you were able to see that

    "title": "Can You Build Muscle WITHOUT Bulking? (New Science)",
    "published_at": "2024-03-31T14:00:03Z",
    "transcript": "if you want to build muscle you got to bulk right I mean that's what all the biggest guys in the gym seem to be doing but bulking can actually be the wrong way to build muscle for many people today I'll share why that is and how you can build muscle without bulking now when I first started lifting I took the advice you got to eat big to get big to heart I kid you not at one point I was drinking almost a gallon of milk a day but after that first bulk I began to notice that bulking just didn't give me the results I hoped for I would end up gaining way more fat to muscle and I just couldn't figure out why and this caught me thinking is overeating really the only way to build muscle what about the excess bat on your body could that instead be burned off and used as fuel for the muscle building process well let's take a look at this 2021 meta analysis which is basically a study of studies they wanted to compare how muscle growth and strength is affected when you're in a calorie deficit eating less calories in your body needs compared to eating at maintenance or in a bolt surprisingly strength GS didn't actually differ that much but for muscle gains almost every single study involved in a calorie deficit led to muscle loss whereas every study without a calorie deficit led to muscle growth however a deeper look into the individual data points Paints the real picture although on average the calorie deficit led to more muscle loss it depended on the size of the deficit with a smaller deficit of around 20 to 300 calories muscle growth was actually quite common it was only once the deficit became greater than around 500 calories did muscle gain become far less likely this debu the belief that you need to be in a calorie Surplus or bulk to build muscle for many people it's completely possible to get hold of the Holy Grill building muscle while losing fat but is this the best approach for everyone to find out I reached out to Dr Eric HS a pro- natural bodybuilder and fitness scientist who specializes in the concept of bulit there's a great paper by Barat and colleagues in the strength and conditioning Journal all about body recomposition specifically looking at sometimes case studies or individual participant outcomes in well- trained lifters and they show multiple times that people can lose fat and gain muscle at the same time now is that as efficient in intermediate or Advanced lifter as being in a small Surplus probably not but it is one way another approach that might fit someone better if they're already higher in body fat than they would like to be when executed properly I've seen this strategy work with many of our build size membres but it won't work for everyone and I'll explain why I later on now does all this research mean bulking is useless what if you're not worried about fat loss and simply want them maximize growth if you're starting at an already high body fat percentage it's totally fine to go into a surplus and put on muscle just be aware that it's going to come with more body fat gain so if you're already close to where you're comfortable with the way you look you might want to consider taking an approach where you're eating at maintenance or you're trying to lean gain or you might decide to cut first before then eventually bulking and that doesn't mean it's better from any standpoint it really just has to do what the individual is comfortable with and what their aesthetic goals might be but there is one group of people that highly benefit from bulking they studied them back in 2002 took a group of beginners who just started lifting weights and gave them a 2,000 calorie Weight Gainer on top of their usual diet after 8 weeks they all gained around 7 lbs if you do the math this means they were probably in a daily calorie surplus of around 400 to 500 calories now of the seven pounds they gained almost all of it was lean mass not fat it goes to show you that if you're a young untrained person like I said relatively normative body fat ranges and you go on a pretty aggressive bulk where you're in on average probably a 400 calorie Surplus is what it kind of shook out to in this study you're going to put on predominantly muscle mass so long as you're training hard and progressively so I mentioned my first bulk earlier that works really well I gained a lot of size while staying relatively lean beginners have the highest sensitivity to muscle growth this is where the term newbie Gams comes from and it's why bulking mostly works for near were lifters what happens when you're past the beginner stage though one study pish just last year found that in trained individuals eating enough to just maintain your weight led to a similar amount of growth compared to Bulan but with far less backing which makes sense you can't just eat as much as you want and have all the extra calories turned of muscle if that were true everyone will walk around jacked out of their minds you'll get lifters like Sam solic and pro bodybuilders who are an exception and I'll explain why shortly but for most people muscle growth is slow and it gets even slower as your body grows so in the beginning building muscle quickly means your body can use more of its excess calories but once this slows down more of those excess calories will be stored as fat instead the only mistakes that you don't want to make are being in a really large Surplus Barb on what would be beneficial as an advanced or intermediate lifter or when you then need to cut being in a much larger deficit than is needed because then you actually start losing some of the muscle you gained and this is kind of a bad cycle that people get stuck in they're quote unquote bulking season or Improvement Season turns into this Seafood diet and they gain far faster than they could hope to uh you know put on muscle they're way past the point of optimizing the ratio of fat to Muscle Gain and then they get too high in body fat and then they wait till the last minute before when they feel like they want to look different and they do this rapid cut either for a competition or for the summer or for whatever reason that Spurs them on and then they go on this crash diet so they end up putting on a necessary body fat and then they end up dieting and actually losing some of the muscle mass that they would have got and there's no benefit to that process so what about Sam solic in a way steroids take you back to your beginner stage of training you all of a sudden can build muscle really quickly as a result more of the excess calories you eat will go towards building muscle rather than fat theoretically when you're using anabolics it does move you back maybe one step if you're Advanced it'll make you get intermediate gains if you're intermediate it'll make you get like novice gains but but honestly you shouldn't be doing this unless you're Advanced at all in the first place Sam solic weighs in at around 240 lb and eats anywhere between 5,000 to 6,000 calories per day during his bolt and he gain close to a pound a week from this and from the looks of it a good chug of that weight gain is muscle rather than fat but this can be misleading for example I remember back in the day watching videos of the incredibly jacked Ronnie colan eating 6,000 plus calories a day during his bulk and thinking that I had to do the same but eating anywhere close to that number of calories would have just blown me up and not in a good way for a natural lifter past the beginner stage muscle growth is very slow much slower than any of us would like to admit if you try to rush it you'll just gain more fat rather than muscle you need to scale your diet based on your experience level and how sensitive you are to muscle growth which brings us to the next question how many calories should you be eating to build muscle while minimizing f g well my talk with Dr Eric Helms led to some great recommendations if you're a beginner which means you're able to get stronger at the gym pretty much every week then aim to gain around 2% of your body weight per month this works out to what most people would Define as a typical Bol where you eat a daily calorie surplus of around 400 to 500 calories now this is what 2,500 calories looks like if this was the right amount of food to maintain your current weight then a 500 calorie Surplus would look like adding one small meal into your day and then once you start to notice that it seems like it's mostly just fat coming on you want to slow down that bulking process you want to cut that calorie Surplus probably in half roughly and then just focus on progress in the gym now typically you new be gain slow down after about a year of consistent training which is when you want to scale it back to more of a gain taining approach it's technically still a bulk just slower where you try to gain just 1% of your body weight per month by using a small surplus of just 200 to 300 calories such as adding an extra granola bar and apple to your day then once you get into the advanced stage and are near your genetic C of muscle growth that's when you di it back even further by using a small Surplus that could honestly be as little as one extra banana per day as you can see it doesn't take much extra food to build muscle which means it also doesn't take much extra food to gain fat either believe me guys I've been there you all of a sudden go into bulking mode and you use that as an excuse to eat whatever you want now even if you use a smaller bus you should expect some back gain but it shouldn't be excessive for example I've only gained around 8 pounds in the past 7 months by sticking to a very small surplus of just 200 to 300 calories I've seen really solid muscle strength gains that and while I have put on a bit of fat as well I can quickly Burn It Off Just 4 to 6 weeks of dieting compared to my traditional bxs in the past or would have to die for at least 12 to 16 weeks afterwards that said unless you're super analytical or really dedicated to your fitness goals I'll admit tracking all this stuff can get overwhelming especially if you're trying to naeil down a really really small Surplus and if that sounds like you then don't worry about tracking anything I mean most 6-year-old kids that I know don't count their calories but they still manage to eat enough to grow and get bigger so just focus on eating lots of protein healthy Whole Foods and use your strength and your body weight to determine if you're eating the right amount if after a month you step on the scale and you've gained 10 pounds then you know you got to dial it back on the other hand if you lost weight and you haven't been get stronger the gym then that's a sign that you got to eat a little bit more okay pay attention because I'm about to give you a simple breakdown of the best approach to building muscle depending on where you're at first off for those who aren in Crazy lean and want to lose fat while build muscle then eat just enough calories to maintain your weight or a small deficit to lose no more than half a pound a week just keep in mind that this approach can become less effective as you get more experience on the other end for those who are less interested in losing fat and want to maximize muscle growth then use the bulking and gain taming guidelines I presented earlier that said guys if you're not training in a way that forces your muscles to grow in the first place then you're not going to see very good results no matter your approach so if you're not completely often with the effectiveness of your CER workout routine I highly recommend taking our quiz at builtwith size.com to find the best size based program for you and your body also if you're struggling with your nutrition and you want a quick cheap and healthy muscle building meal pile then give this video watch next thank you so much for watching I'll see you next time"

    "title": "The Perfect Push-Up To Build Muscle (AVOID THESE MISTAKES!)",
    "published_at": "2020-11-22T18:23:37Z",
    "transcript": "the push-up is one of the most primitive muscle building movements that we possess unlike some other body weight exercises such as dips or pull-ups you need absolutely nothing to perform this movement it can be used for strength development muscle growth or even as an effective warm-up tool in fact at least for beginners it's been shown in the literature to provide chest and triceps size and strength gains that are comparable to that of the bench press however just because it's a simple exercise doesn't necessarily mean that it's simply done due to the high amount of muscle mass and joints which are involved in this exercise there's a lot that can go wrong which as you'll see is not only detrimental for growth but it's also problematic from an injury and pain standpoint since we tend to do push-ups with a lot of volume and the wear and tear from improper form can accumulate very quickly so in this video i'll share what the most common and problematic push-up mistakes are and how to fix them right away so that you can start seeing faster growth while avoiding potential injury down the road the most common mistake people make with their push-ups is flaring their elbows out commonly as a result of using a hand position that's too wide thinking that this is going to better target and grow their chest but instead it actually does the opposite while putting our shoulders at a greater risk for injury because whenever we do any pressing motion like a push-up we want our elbow angle to line up with our chest fibers in order to best activate them but what happens when we use a wide grip is that not only is the range of motion shortened but our body is also forced to flare the elbows out to the sides whenever we get to the bottom position so now as you can see the elbow angle and the tension is now best lined up with the front delts instead of the chest which is what we want to avoid in fact multiple studies comparing a wider grip with the elbows flared out to a narrower grip with the elbows tucked in have indeed found not only significantly less chest activation with the wider grip but also less activation of the triceps and less strength and power improvements likely due to the reduced range of motion so instead use a grip that's roughly just outside shoulder width or narrower and then when you execute your push-ups don't forget to tuck your elbows in towards your body rather than flaring them out now as for the optimal elbow angle here's what research has to say one study examining the effect of elbow placement during the push-up found that at degrees higher than 60 degrees out the shoulder is placed in a compromised position that can lead to shoulder impingement so keeping them tucked to below a 60 degree angle preferably right around 45 degrees is recommended what you'll find when you implement those two push-ups is that rather than moving vertically up and down your body will now actually move forward and back similar to the correct bar path of your bench press which is a good thing so make this simple tweak in your elbow positioning as it will not only help place our elbows in the optimal position for chest activation but will also be a much safer position for your shoulder to be in next we want to be mindful of our hand orientation the first problem that we see is when people have their hands turned in slightly what this does is it not only encourages the flaring of the elbows which as i previously mentioned is something that we want to avoid but it also places our shoulders in an internally rotated position that puts us at a greater risk for shoulder impingement not to mention the added shear stress on the elbows that research shows this hand placement causes as well so instead when you perform your push-ups keep your hands in a neutral position so not pointed in but also not pointed out because similar to how you would set your feet when you squat you should actively screw your hands into the ground like so to promote external rotation of your shoulders before your push-up so if your hands are already pointed out quite a bit then this prevents us from being able to do this then after you set your hands you want to promote this position as you go into your push-up by thinking about distributing the weight in your hands more externally rather than internally by again thinking about screwing your hands outwards apply this tweak and you'll immediately notice a big difference in the stability and the comfort of your shoulders as you perform each rep [Music] most people are unaware that by making very simple adjustments to your push-up form you can actually emphasize specific muscles more than others which is beneficial when you want to specifically focus on working a certain muscle group like during a chest focus workout or an arms focus workout for example to do this we mainly want to pay attention to what our elbows and shoulders are doing during the movement for instance if we wanted to make the push-up more chest focused then we would want to limit the amount of flexion that our elbow experiences by moving our hands back a touch during the setup and then keeping our elbows stacked right on top of our wrist as we execute the push-up what this will do is it'll place more tension on the chest and less tension on the triceps which is exactly what a 2005 paper found when comparing several different push-up variations on the other hand if we wanted to make the push-up more triceps and arms focused then we want to maximize the amount of flexion our elbow experiences instead this can be done by tucking the elbows in and dropping them down and back as far away from your hands as you're capable of doing comfortably during the push-up as opposed to keeping them stacked over your wrist like in the chest focus variation this subtle tweak will take the triceps through a greater range of motion and hence place more tension on them rather than other muscles like the chest and the shoulders and lastly if we wanted to emphasize the shoulders a little more then we would want to elevate our feet up onto a high enough platform or perform a pike push-up similar to the effect of adjusting the incline of a bench further and further up as we press the added shoulder flexion in these variations will shift more and more of the tension to the shoulders rather than the chest or the triceps so play around with these variations and place them in your routines based on what muscle you want to emphasize the most the next mistake is something i've talked about frequently for other exercises but is just as commonly seen with push-ups and it's shrugging the shoulders even if you have the proper hand placement once you start fatiguing and grinding out reps it's very easy to let the shoulders shrug up towards the ears this not only shifts tension away from the chest and onto the traps but it also causes you to lose a ton of stability and present strength so instead using your lats actively pull your shoulders down and away from your ears and into a stable and locked position that you want to now maintain as you perform each rep this simple change will add a ton of much needed stability to your push up improve your push and strength and ensure that most of the tension goes towards the target muscle rather than the traps [Music] lastly is speed for most of you with a good amount of training experience push-ups become fairly easy when done only using your body weight as a result when you do perform them you probably tend to knock out a bunch of push-ups as fast as possible or just with a relatively fast tempo now if you're doing this for a fitness test then go for it however if you're regularly using push-ups as part of your training program to build muscle then you aren't going to benefit as much for a couple reasons illustrating these reasons is a study that examined different temples during the push-up the researchers found greater chest activation and significantly greater triceps and rear delt activation as the speed of the push-ups slowed down from one and a half seconds per push-up to two seconds per push-up to two and a half seconds per push-up which provided the greatest activation what's even more of a concern though is that doing push-ups with the fast tempo resulted in 135 percent greater sheer force and 163 percent greater torque on the elbow joints which is a major concern if you're doing quite a lot of volume with the push-ups since over time this can cause excessive stress and pain to the elbow joint so if push-ups have gotten pretty easy for you then instead of just trying to bang out more and more push-ups with a relatively fast tempo slow it down take at least two and a half seconds to perform each push-up you can even slow it down even further to five or six seconds per push-up if you need some added difficulty because doing so will enable you to stress and grow your target muscles to a greater degree as you get stronger over time while placing less unwanted stress in your joints so hopefully you're able to see that there's a lot more that goes into even the simplest of exercises like the push-up yet if you want to see the best results while minimizing your risk of injury then you need to apply the same level of detail to each and every one of your exercises in your routine and for a step-by-step program that does all of this for you by showing you not only the workouts to do every week but then how to execute those workouts and exercises to maximize your results then simply head on over to buildwithscience.com and take our analysis quiz to determine which program is best for you and your body it

    "title": "How To Get 6 Pack Abs With No Equipment (DO THIS ANYWHERE!)",
    "published_at": "2021-11-21T15:16:28Z",
    "transcript": "I'll show you how to sculpt a great set of ABS using just your body weight and a few square fet of floor first we'll expose why most body weight ab workout are a waste of time then we'll go through the four ab exercises we'll be using and at the end combine them into a full downloadable workout that you can use anywhere so there's three things that we're going to do with our ab workout that will make it far more effective than most body weight ab workouts out there first to build a great balanc looking midsection there's four regions that you need to make sure your ad workouts are hidden a 20 study on tennis players helps explain the potential dangers of failing to do this the researchers analyzed the muscle development of the players abs and found major imbalances in fact when comparing the left and right sides of their abs there was a 35% difference in the size there were differences seen in the growth of the upper and lower section of the ABS as well this disproportionate growth is obviously attributed to the fact that tennis players work predominantly on one side but it helps illustrate the fact that the same can occur from an AB routine that favors certain regions and movements over the others second the ABS are just like any other muscle you can actually build them up to make them more visible however most body weight ab workouts don't make their exercises more difficult over time to continuously stimulate growth in your abs as it gets stronger and lastly how many times have you done an ab exercise yet felt it more in your hip flexors or your lower back instead many ab exercises are just poor choices and should be avoided for this reason today's workout is going to to solve each one of these three common problems let's learn how by diving into the first exercise okay so the first exercise we'll cover will be the most demanding it's going to Target a region called the TVA also known as the transverse abdominus this is perhaps the least talked about app muscle you actually can't see this muscle because it sits beneath your abs but when well trained it plays an important role in creating a better looking midsection and it does so by acting like a natural corset pulling the ABS in and tightening the waist it also has the added benefit of making the sexiest muscle on a man more prominent AKA does two lines that start near the hips and come down towards a happy place so to best work this muscle we're actually going to recreate a no equipment version of a great gym exercise the ab Rolo the ab Rolo has not only been shown to work your six-pack muscles extremely well but it also forces the TVA to contract hard to stabilize our spine as we move forward and back to recreate this without a roller though get onto all fours with your hands under your shoulders and knees under your hips move into something called posterior pelvic tilt by rotating your hips and Contracting your abs pull your belly button into your spine to fully activate your TVA then from here slowly walk your hands out forward but go only as far as you can without breaking this form and arching at your lower back and then walk your hands back as you get stronger you want to progress it over time by trying to get your hands further and further out don't worry it's totally fine if it's just a few steps at first trust me it's going to improve over time now we're going to move on to the next most demanding exercise to Target the lower abs now the key to effectively targeting the lower abs is to use what's known as bottom up exercises where the bottom half of your body is brought up such as with leg raises these types of exercises however are where most people have a lot of trouble feeling them more in their hip flexors rather than their abs so pay close attention to the form I'm about to show you first lock your back with your arms straight by your sides and knees bent to 90\u00b0 to preactivate your lower abs initiate posterior pelvic tilt by squeezing your glutes and Contracting your abs your lower back should flatten against the floor as you do this next don't think about raising your legs instead simply curl your pelvis up towards your belly button then on the way back down avoid arching your lower back and instead make sure it remains flat against the ground when you reach the bottom when done properly you should feel a strong contraction in the lower region of your abs to make it easier you can simply tuck your knees in towards your upper body more as your lower abs strengthen though you can increase the difficulty by straightening out your legs more and more by the way guys just so you're aware I've compile this ab workout into a free PDF for you to download so you can quickly reference it when you're performing it it's complete with step-by-step picture tutorials and instructions for each exercise to download it after watching the rest of this video just head over to built with science.com slabs atome and I'll send it right over to you I'll also link this in the description box and in the comments down below but for now let's get back to exercise number three and hit those upper abs so to Target the upper abs we'll now want to use what's known as a top down exercise this is where the top half of your body is brought down such as with crunches speaking of crunches since our upper abs will already be quite fatigued from our previous two exercises it actually makes a less demanding Movement Like a crunch the perfect option but to make them effective and avoid messing up our backs there's a specific way that we'll want to do them first set up by lying on your back with your knees bent and hands placed behind your head place a rolled up t-shirt or towel under your lower back to increase the range of motion your abs go through now given the role of the upper abs we don't need to come all the way up as that's just going to work more of a hip flexors instead all we're going to do is lift the shoulder blades up off the ground by flexing the spine and then come back down avoid yanking your neck as you come up and avoid using momentum take it slow and really feel the upper abs working once that becomes too easy though you can progress these by placing your arms straight over your head or add weight using a bottle or stuffed backpack all right so before we dive into how to best perform the full workout we're going to complete it by covering the last region the obliques these muscles they're best trained with exercises that rotate the Torso our move of choice is a well-known exercise Russian twist but the problem with this popular move is that they're often performed in a way that makes the exercise far less effective at work in the obliques to avoid this it starts with a proper setup sit on your butt with your knees bent and feet on the floor sitting too far up right will make the exercise easier but less effective so try to angle your back to about a 45\u00b0 angle from here the goal is to touch either side of the ground but your hands aren't will activ your your obliques so avoid just reaching with your arms and not rotating much at your torso instead let your shoulders dictate your rotation so when you reach to each side focus on trying to line up your shoulder with your leg for example your left shoulder lining up with your left leg when you twist to the right doing this will force you to rotate your torso and engage your obliques as a result and to progress this move over time you can raise your feet off the ground slightly and try to reach further and further out with your arms to force your obliques to work harder to stabilize your body all right so so now let's get into how to perform the full workout for the best results you're going to perform this workout as a circuit moving through one exercise to the next with just 15 seconds of rest between each exercise to catch your breath after you run through it once you're going to rest for 2 minutes and then you're going to repeat it for a total of three times as for Reps for the walkouts aim for 5 to 10 Reps for the reverse crunches and the regular crunches aim for anywhere between 10 to 25 reps and for the Russian twist you'll do as many as you can within one 1 minute now you can do the workout two to three times a week but what's most important is that as you get stronger you're trying to increase your reps and using the progressions that I mentioned earlier this is what's going to be key to helping your abs grow and pop more over time and as mentioned earlier for free downloadable PDF of the full workout with tutorials just head over to builtwith science.com slabs atome and I'll send it right over to you but keep in mind guys that no matter how hard you train your abs you're not going to get the sixpack you're after without a solid D plan in place that's the secret behind the incredible Transformations that thousands of art members are getting using my bu with science programs within each program you're shown exactly how to train and how to eat to lose fat and build muscle to start today just head on over to buildwi science.com and

    "title": "How To Increase Your Pull-Ups From 0 to 10+ Reps FAST (3 Science-Based Tips)",
    "published_at": "2020-02-02T17:07:52Z",
    "transcript": "if your pull-up game currently looks and sounds something like this you want it to look something like this and fast then you've come to the right place pull-ups are one of the best if not the best exercises for increasing the size and strength of your upper back and arm muscles while also contributed to your core development I'd actually tributed most of my back development to the several years I spent regularly performing pull-ups and not to mention that it's an extremely convenient exercise as well given that you can effectively work your back muscles with just a bar and the use of your bodyweight however this does come with a price as pull-ups are generally one of the most difficult exercises to master in fact most individuals have yet to even achieve their first pull-up or for those who have they'll then off the struggle with increase in the total number of pull-ups that they can perform and although you've probably already tried a few things to help strengthen your pull-ups or achieve your first ever pull-up the truth is that most people simply use the wrong approaches I'm sorry to break it to you but hammering away with lap pull downs and the assisted pull-up machine just won't cut it in this video though I'll show you what research indicates are the most effective steps and routines to achieving your first pull-up and then getting them into the double digits in the fastest way possible the first thing you need to do is focus on strengthening the prime movers involved in the pull-up more specifically based on research such as this 2018 EMG analysis the muscles most activated and evolved in the pull-up are the core the biceps the lats and the mid and lower traps and are therefore the muscles that you want to focus on strengthening because as suggested by the researchers by training each of these muscles with alternative pulling exercises you'll be able to strengthen them to the point where they're accumulated to be strong enough for you to achieve a pull-up we'll also indirectly boost your pull-up strength in the event that you can currently only successfully do a few so what are the best alternative exercises to strengthen these prime movers well first we're going to start with scapula puller to target the lower traps which is especially important for your pull-up strength given that they've been shown to be more active and involved in the pull-up when compared to chin-ups or any other pull-up variation and could therefore very well be the limiting factor for you and to perform this exercise you simply hang from a bar relax your shoulders down and away from your ears and then pull your body up without allowing your elbows to bend with a slight pause at the top this movement will not only help with strengthening your lower traps as well as your grip strength before the pull-up but the movement itself is an essential component of the pull-up given that the pull-up actually consists of two phases with phase one involving the subtle motion of the scapula pull up and then phase two involving the actual pulling up to the bar it just doesn't look like it because it's typically performed as one fluid motion but just showcases how important this seemingly insignificant muscle really is for your pull-up strength next we'll move on to the Neeley lat pulldown - now primarily strengthen the lats and the core as well as the biceps now although the traditional seated lat pulldown is quite a similar movement as the body we pull up and therefore seems as if it would transfer well in terms of strength developments this just isn't the case as research has found that there's actually a relatively weak correlation between the two exercises meaning that getting stronger in the seated lat pulldown doesn't seem to increase pull-up strength very well and the reason for this seems to be with the lack of core involvement in the seated lat pulldown which you now know is a major component of the pull-up illustrating this is a 20-18 EMG analysis which aimed to find the best supplemental exercise for pull-up strength based on the pattern of muscle activation of the prime movers and what the researchers found was that when compared to C did that pull downs and the assisted pull-up machine the knee lean that pull down elicited a significantly greater core activation and was the only exercise that demonstrated the same activation pattern as a pull-up meaning that theoretically this exercise provides the best drag transference to your pull-up given the similarity of both movements in terms of muscle activation patterns and is therefore essential that we included here next we're going to use the inverted row to further strengthen the pulling strength of your lats core and arms but to also emphasize the mid traps a little more which we know based on the activation research shown earlier is a highly involved muscle in the pillow now this exercise was chosen based on research from the American Council of exercise which showed that the inverted row only highly activates the lats but also outperforms other rowing movements like the barbell row in terms of mid traps activation and therefore would be another great exercise to use in our arsenal to strengthen the prime movers involved in the pull-up and for this exercise simply hang from a bar with your legs extended on the ground and pull up until your chest just about reaches the bar then you'll want to progress this overtime by simply lowering the bar and or elevating your feet to get your body more horizontal next we want to get some actual pull-up training in to not only continue strengthening our prime movers but to neurologically get better at the movement itself but obviously if you're unable to do a pull-up or you just can't do very many you'll have to first use alternative exercises to accomplish this and the first exercise we'll use for this purpose is the banded pull up which would highly recommend incorporating since it's a closest exercise to the pull-up itself and it's also going to give you a major confidence boost being able to get your head over that bar but with this exercise is crucial you progress it over time but first started with a heavier band for more resistance and then gradually move into lighter and lighter resistance once you can do over 10 reps at each level and that's for the assisted pull-up machine this is a somewhat decent alternative but just isn't as effective given the low amount of core activation we've seen this exercise and the vast differences in the muscle activation patterns of the prime movers when we compared to the pull-up itself now finally we'll use negative pull-ups to work on strengthening the eccentric portion of the pull-up and to also just get you more comfortable with feeling what it's like to control your body weight against gravity for these simply jump up or use a step off to get yourself to the top position the pull-up and then descend as slow as you're capable of at first you likely won't be able to control your descent very but this will very quickly improve and you'll want to try to work up to a 30 second descent which will translate to huge strength gains in your actual pull-up so the sum of the previous exercise here is the exact routine that you'll want to use to get to your first one to 10 pull-ups you want to perform this twice a week and simply replace all of your back training for the week with this routine and as you do this give it an increasing frequency is highly correlated with faster strength gains what I want you to do is during the start of both of these workouts and one to two other workouts that you do for the week simply perform two sets where you try to do it as many pull-ups as you can over time you'll notice this number very quickly improved and then once you can successfully do roughly 10 to 12 clean pull-ups in the single set it's time to move on to the next step which involves progressing your pull-ups and to do so you want to simply start adding additional resistance to your pull-ups with the use of a dumbbell or weight belt in order to continue overloading your pull-ups and to enable you to stick within that rep range that'll be most effective for hypertrophy as your pull-up strength improves so once you get to the stage what I'd recommend is the following first off program in pull-ups into your current routine twice a week with the following set and rep range I'd also recommend still doing and progressing the movements previously discussed as part of your back training as well except for the banded pull-ups as these other movements will continue to complement your weighted pull-up strength very well secondly it start with as little as 2 point 5 to 5 pounds of additional resistance and aim to increase the amount of reps you can do with this added weight then once you're able to perform 3 to 4 sets of 10 clean reps at this weight add another 2.5 to 5 pounds and repeat the process I'd recommend repeating this process for four weeks and then take a deal oat or easy week for your pull-ups by switching your pull-ups for another back exercise or just performing bodyweight pull-ups for that week in order to boost your recovery before then going back to the weighted progression and lastly I also recommend that one of these pull-up days be a slight variation of the pull up like a chin up or neutral grip pull-up for example these variations have been shown to work your prime movers to a slightly different degree and pattern than the pull-up does which helps not only indirectly boost your strength in the traditional pull-up but also helps prevent overuse injuries from developing over time especially once you start using heavier weights so to sum the video up for you here is the overall action plan designed to take you to your first pull-up then to your first 10 to 12 pull-ups and then to your first weighted pull-up and Beyond and in the fastest way possible but all in all hopefully you can see that by applying the right science and the proper steps into your weekly routine you'll be able to experience significantly faster results and for step-by-step science-based program that builds these protocols and exercises into your weekly plan for you and shows you how to properly progress them over time such that you can break through plateaus and pack on size and strength in the most effective way possible just like countless other members have successfully done with their build science programs then simply head on over to build with science calm and take the analysis quiz to discover which program is best for you and your specific body and always guys I hope you enjoyed this one please do me

    "transcript": "does your chest refuse to grow no matter how many exercises you try trust me I've been there I tried every big chested fitness influencers workout yet my chest stayed flat and underdeveloped and it was embarrassing I've hated taking my shirt off because I didn't want anyone to notice it but over the last year that changed my chest has grown faster than ever I've even got new stretch marks from the growth and all it took was focusing on two key exercises that actually fit my genetic structure do these properly and I guarantee you you'll start experiencing the same chest growth I did in no time so what were it well it wasn't the barbell bench press and here's why multiple studies show a strong correlation between bench press strength and chest growth so on average a bigger bench does in fact lead to a bigger chest but even after increasing my bench press from 25 PBS on each side to two plates aside other muscles grew but my chest stay flat why well studies report averages while they provide insight into what works for most people there's always outliers and I soon realized I was one of them my genetic structure just meant the bench press wasn't the best option for growing my chest as for why part of this has to do with the fact that the barbell locks your arms into a fixed position so no matter what I tried with my form I can never really get my chest to properly activate based on how my balls are structured so what did they do instead two things first I switched from a barbell to dumbbells this gave me the freedom to adjust my arm position as I pressed which allowed me to better activate my chest and second I changed the bench angle in a study done back in 2020 researchers split participants into three groups one group only did incline bench press another did only flat bench and the last group split their volume into both flat and incline after 8 weeks the incline group saw the same mid chest growth as the other groups but with significantly more upper chest development but here's the catch incline doesn't mean the same thing for everyone and this is where understanding your genetic structure becomes really important if you have what's known as a steep sternum angle then a flat bench isn't really a flat press it acts more like a decline press because your chest fibers are angled downwards in this case you'd have to use a relatively High incline of about 30 to 45\u00b0 to actually start hitting the upper chest but if you've got a flat sternum angle like me that a flat bench is flat and it only takes a very slight incline to unlock the upper chest anything higher and you'll feel it mostly in your shoulders which is exactly what happened to me so for my body type setting the incline just one or two notches up from the bottom was a sweet spot to maximize in my chest activation and to find out when your sternum angle is lay down on a flat bench and place your phone between your pecs right on top of your sternum if your phone angles down you have a steeper sternum angle whereas if your phone sits more horizontally you have a flatter sternum angle like me I want to know what sternum angle you have though so do this test and then comment down below which one you've been blessed with unfortunately though even after I figured out my stum mangle and I applied this exercise Swap and I worked my way up to pressing 95 lb dumbbells my chest still wasn't growing as much as I hoped and it was frustrating at this point I honestly thought my Filipino genetics curse me with a flat chest forever until I realized there was one more key factor I was neglecting take a look at Ronnie Coleman's pressing form watch his upper arms notice how they go well below 90\u00b0 at the bottom of each rep and how he doesn't fully lock out his arms at the top what's fascinating is that bodybuilders like Ronnie learned just through trial and error that this form grew their chest the best but now there's research to back it up while studies on the chest are still needed every single study done on the biceps quads and calves have shown that performing half reps in the Deep stretch position results in significantly more growth compared to half reps at the top so even though I was lifting heavy I was doing the complete opposite of what's actually best for growth and as much as I hurt my ego I decided to let go of the big 95s and grab the smaller 65s instead and yes it stung a little but remember it's not the size that matters it's how you use it and that couldn't be more true here focusing on that deep stretch and Conant tension with the 605s did way more for my my chest than Eagle lifting those 95s ever did but to continue forcing growth once I nailed down my form and could really feel my chest working I slowly started progressing the weight again but here's the thing it's taken me a full year to work my way back up to the 80s with this new form so focus on getting stronger but don't rush it and sacrifice your form in the process now as for how to implement this exercise into weekly routine I've tried to make this as easy as possible for you by creating a free six we chest workout plan that implements the two chest exercises into a full workout plan you can start using right away I'll explain how you can access that later but for now since the first exercise focused primarily on the mid and upper chest I now needed a second exercise to really Target the mid and lower chest especially the outer Porche and for years I relied on the pack deck machine but while it's great for isolating the chest here's the issue it's hardest at the end of the movement during the squeeze but the latest research suggests that exercis is challenging your muscles in the stretch position heads to deliver more growth especially in the distal parts of the muscle which in this case would be the outer chest however unlike other muscle groups like The biceps this hasn't been directly tested on the chest which is why I recently launched a study using custom machines and MRI technology to see if this approach truly works for the chest shoulders and glutes I'll update you guys on the results but for now let's talk about what worked for me instead of the p deck I grabbed an incline bench set it one notch below the very highest incline and put it smack in the middle of a cable machine to create my own seated cable fat the beauty about this exercise is that if you execute it properly it not only challenges your chest in the Deep stretch but it also maintains tension throughout the full range even at the end during the squeeze something that pressing exercises don't fully provide but remember just swapping the exercise isn't enough there's three tweaks I made to get the most growth up of bit first I placed a half foam roller behind my back this helps open up the chest to unlock that deep stretch we've been talking about it might feel a bit weird at first but believe me it's game changing once to get it right now if you don't have a half foam roller a regular one will work perfectly fine too just slide it in and let it open you right up trust me it feels even better than it sounds second tweak I justed the cable setup so I set the cables at shoulder height and Scoot my butt forward on the bench this aligned the tension directly with my mid and lower chest but to actually keep that tension on my chest throughout the movement I avoided letting my forearms drift out of line with a cable and instead focused on keeping them directly in line lastly I had to stop my shoulders from taking over since my chest was so weak I had the tendency to Ru my stronger shoulders forward and let my chest cave in especially as the Reps got really hard but the way I prevented this was actually quite simple I imagined a string attached to my sternum pulling my chest up during the entire movement as I simply focused on squeezing my biceps into the sides of my chest then once the Reps got really tough as soon as I felt my shoulders creeping forward I knew my chest hit failure and I was just cheating my way to more reps so I'd end the set there now speaking of failure what if your Gym's packed and the pec deck is the only chest fly available no problem there's actually a way to make it more effective here's how first do as many full reps as you can to focus on the squeeze but after your hit failure shift your attention to the stretch by cranking out as many half preps as possible in that stretch position this way you still get the benefit of the squeeze without sacrificing that crucial stretch but some of you might be wondering can you really build your entire chest with just these two exercises well I've recently decided to push my chest train into the next level by experimenting with a much higher volume approach based on some new research my goal is to turn my chest into a strong point by next year and I'm tracking in every step to find what works best and I'll be sharing these updates on my channel so if you want to stay ahead with the latest strategies just keep an eye out but the short answer is yes if you're executing these two exercises with the r form but also doing enough volume and properly progressing them you can definitely see incredible chess grow which is why I built two resources to help you out first I've created a free 6we chess workout

    "title": "Fasted Cardio: Why You SHOULD Do It To Lose Fat Faster (And How To Do It)",
    "published_at": "2019-05-12T16:13:55Z",
    "transcript": "if you want to lose fat as fast as possible then it's often wise to include some form of cardio in your routine to speed up the process but to lose fat even faster many suggest performing your cardio on an empty stomach or in other words fasted often first thing in the morning and this is something I'll often personally do as well especially as I get leaner why well let's start out by discussing why exactly fasted cardio got so popular in the first place and clear up some of the common misconceptions people have around it so the basic theory behind fasted cardio being superior for fat loss is the fact that research has shown that when exercising in a fasted state your body preferentially burns fat for energy since your insulin and glycogen levels are low during this period whereas when you eat before you exercise your body now tends to preferentially use more carbs and less fat for energy when compared to if you were fasted and this is mainly what led people's believe that performing your cardio in a fasted state would lead to more fat loss as opposed to eating before however although it's true that you burn more fat during a fasted cardio session it's vital that you take into consideration the post exercise period and what happens to your body after the session because research has shown that although you may have preferentially burned more fat during the fasted cardio session your body eventually compensates for this by burning more carbohydrates for the rest of the day so by the end of it you've actually burned the same amount of fat as you would have had you eaten before your cardio session meaning that fasting wouldn't actually provide any superior fat loss effect and this was proven in a recent 2017 systematic review and meta-analysis on the topic which found that performing cardio in a fasted state had no superior fat loss effect when compared to performing cardio in a fed state as it's a calorie deficit at the end of the day that's the overriding factor and although as I've stated in the past fasted cardio may be particularly beneficial for burning stubborn fat this is only applicable to very lean individuals and has yet to be proven in human studies but with all that being said why exactly is it that I still actually recommend using fasted cardio well for a couple of reasons first off it often makes it easier to eat at a calorie deficit by skipping your pre cardio meal or breakfast your days eating window will now be shortened as a result this often makes it a lot easier when dieting since your meals are now closer to each other throughout the day which I personally finally helps a lot in terms of appetite suppression and preventing excessive snacking throughout the day and these subtle changes often lead to a lower daily calorie intake and this is something that's been proven in multiple papers for example a recent 2019 study from the journal nutrition compared the daily calorie intake and healthy male subjects who perform the cardio either in a fasted state or with breakfast prior to their session it found that the fasted cardio group ate on average 400 calories less than the fed cardio group enabling them to achieve an energy deficit by the end of the day which the fed group actually failed to do and this alone if repeated daily would on average lead to almost a count of extra fat loss every week for the fasted group and another great benefit of fasted cardio is that for many people it's just more practical to do getting that done first thing in the morning can not only help get your day started and boost your mood and productivity for the rest of the day but I find that helps with consistency as well as leaving your cardio for later on in the day makes it more likely that you'll find some excuse to skip it and push it off to the next day so you can see how these indirect benefits of fasted cardio may actually provide superior benefits on fat loss now as for what exactly your fasted cardio routine should look like although this will vary for everyone I suggest sticking with the following general guidelines one stick to mostly low to moderate intensity cardio incline walking lights I clean the Stairmaster and so on are all good examples of this high intensity cardio sessions and interval training is fine as well but they should be used sparingly as they cause a lot more muscle damage deplete your muscle glycogen to a greater extent and can negatively affect your weight lifting workouts if you'll be training later on in the day in to keep your sessions less than an hour long this just helps prevent any potential muscle breakdown from occurring and prevents your performance from being negatively affected which research shows begins to occur in fasted sessions lasting over an hour long and that's pretty much all there is to it although fasted cardio doesn't seem to provide any magical fat loss effect it may be beneficial for you to use for the reasons previously discussed but all in all you need to choose what you'll be most consistent with and adhere to week after week whether it's fasted cardio or not because at the end of the day getting the work done and consistently achieving a calorie deficit is what's most important so the sum of the video up here are the main points to keep in mind I hope that you were able to see that although fasted cardio may not provide any magical fat loss benefits it does come with some indirect benefits that may actually enable you to lose fat at a faster rate and for an all-in-one science-based program that combines all these little details into a step-by-step plan to enable you to build muscle and lose FAT at the fastest rate possible and what you can do is simply head on over

    "title": "STOP Doing Chest Flys Like This (5 Mistakes Slowing Your Chest Gains)",
    "published_at": "2022-08-28T16:01:15Z",
    "transcript": "chest flies are one of the most effective exercises for building your chest but if you don't do them correctly they'll end up working other muscles like your shoulders instead of your chest there's five common mistakes almost everyone makes they're easy to fix but will make a massive difference in your chest growth now there's generally three different types of chess plies you can do dumbbell flies cable flies and machine flies like the pec deck as you'll learn later on in this video some of these options might be better than others but for now as we go through the mistakes and fixes i'll make sure to show you how they apply to each one of these variations the first mistake actually has to do with your biceps i'll first use the dumbbell fly to illustrate this at the bottom position the straighter your arm is the more tension will be applied to your chest in fact if we apply simple physics if you move your hand about 50 percent further out from your elbow it will result in roughly 50 percent more load on the chest this is what makes the fly such an effective movement you can highly stimulate your chest with less weight however the straighter your arms go the more your biceps also get involved eventually there comes a point where your biceps are starting to work harder than your chest is and will become the limiting factor in the movement instead of your chest the same is true with a cable fly or a peck deck so instead at the bottom position you want to keep a slight bend in your elbows such that your hands are just slightly outside your elbows however once you get to the top position the opposite is now true the main function of the chest is horizontal abduction the act of bringing your upper arms together so if you kept your arms bent your upper arms wouldn't be brought together as far as they could be and you'll be engaging less of the chest muscles and encouraging more of your shoulder muscles to take over instead straighten your arms and think about squeezing your elbows together as you approach the end position here's how the proper form would look on all three fly variations simply focus on bent arms at the start position and straight arms at the end position the next mistake has to do with something called the line of force let's first explain this with the cable fly during this exercise the direction of the cable will determine where on your body the force is being placed for example here the cable angle is set a little bit higher than the height of my head now at the end position i want you to look and notice at the direction of the cable compared to my arms they're not aligned and as a result the cable is pulling my arm up and my arm has to fight to pull the cable down as a performance fly this takes some of the tension away from the chest and puts it onto other muscles like the lats instead on the other hand here the cable height is set lower at the end position the cable is now pulling my arm down in this case my arm has to fight to pull the cable up as it performs the fly and takes some of the tension away from the chest and puts it onto the front delts so instead to maximize chest activation the direction of the cable needs to be aligned with the direction of your arms you can play around with the cable height in your arm position until you get this right later in this video i'm going to show you how a higher or lower cable setup would work and when you use that but for now just try this out and you'll feel the difference right away now the same applies to the pec deck or even the dumbbell fly as well in this case however since you can't adjust the line of forsake you can with cables you'll simply want to keep your elbows up such that your hands and your shoulders are always at the same height rather than letting your elbows drop down the next mistake is probably the most common mistake i see given that many of us are stuck in a hunched over posture your shoulders will have a natural tendency to want to take over during your chest exercises this can lead to the front of your shoulders experiencing most of the growth rather than the chest here i'm letting the shoulders take over and you can see how my shoulders round forward every time i reach the end of the movement instead to ensure the tension is being placed on the chest first bring your shoulders down and away from your ears and then stick your chest up and out from here simply focus on squeezing your biceps into the sides of your chest and as you do this your chest should remain up and out rather than letting your shoulders come forward and take over you may have to lighten the weight but trust me make this one fix alone on whatever fly variation you're doing and it's going to make a world of difference in your chest development the next mistake has to do with how you're setting up your fly during a regular dumbbell cable or pec deck fly the main area targeted is the mid chest but if you're already doing a lot of flat bench press and flat dumbbell press which already target the mid chest i'd highly recommend adjusting the setup of your flies to work more of your upper and lower chest to help round out and provide a more balanced look to your chest now the pec deck unfortunately can't be adjusted much because of the fixed bench but for a cable fly to target the lower chest you'd want to bring the pulleys up higher and perform a high to low fly just make sure that your forearms still move and stay in line with the direction of the cables like we talked about earlier and then to target the upper chest you'd want to use a bench setup at a slight incline like so and the same can be done with dumbbells by using a slight incline to emphasize the upper chest a little bit more and a slight decline by putting a plate under one end of the bench to emphasize the lower chest a little bit more now the last mistake has to do with the type of chest fly you choose to do a common choice is the dumbbell flat although with the fixes we already went through your dumbbell flies will be made far more effective they still have their limitations their main limitation is they're only really hard and challenge your chest at the bottom position as you get towards the top the tension placing the chest reduces and becomes non-existent as soon as your hands come in between your shoulders this is why in studies that have compared the dumbbell fly to other chest exercises like the bench press it doesn't seem to activate the chest very well now this isn't necessarily a bad thing in fact exercises that challenge your muscles most when they're fully stretched like at the bottom of a dumbbell fly seem to be the most effective exercises for muscle growth so they're definitely still a good option especially if you only have access to dumbbells however most of you are likely already doing either a dumbbell press bench press or machine chest press before you get to your chest flies these exercises already challenge your chest the most in the fully stretched position so doing a dumbbell fly afterwards can be redundant pretty much like doing the same exercise again but just with lighter weight instead to potentially maximize growth your workout should challenge your chest throughout the whole range of motion especially in that end position when your arms are brought in together how can you do this simple with a properly executed cable fly or machine pec deck with cables having a slight advantage because you can easily adjust them to target the different areas of the chest like we went through make these five changes and you'll instantly feel and see the difference even if you're using lighter weight than you usually do but guys it's important that you take the same detailed science-based approach to all lip your exercises by doing so you'll maximize every single rep you do and will get results faster and easier for a step-by-step plan that puts this all together for you

    "title": "How I Got to 11.6% Body Fat in 60 Days (Just Copy Me)",
    "published_at": "2024-09-22T13:00:05Z",
    "transcript": "to get lean you're looking at getting down to at least 15% body fat but here's the thing according to the largest dexas scan analysis of over 9,000 American men 97% are above that with the average body fat being 27% to make matters worse less than 0.1% of men are lean enough for their abs to really pop at 12% or below statistically you're more likely to become a millionaire than you are to get lean but don't let this discourage you this is me at 15.6% body fat this is me just 60 days later at 11.6% body fat according to dexa and based on ultrasound I've also burned off almost 50% of my belly fat and the best part the process was actually quite simple not easy but something anybody can do if you follow my three-part Plan diet training and The crucial steps I took afterwards to prevent regaining fat I guarantee you'll be able to get lean fast and more importantly stay lean for good but before we dive into the plan there's a huge issue almost everybody ignores until it's too late so you know how I clocked in at 11.6% body fat in my last dexa scan well in the body fat analysis I shared earlier the lowest recorded body fat out of 9,000 men was 11.7% And yet when I scroll through Instagram it seems like everybody on my feed is absolutely shredded Max 10% body body fat I feel fat just scrolling through deer the reality those Ultra shredded physiques often come at a huge cost one that's rarely talked about as you get leaner your body Fights Back hunger skyrockets energy levels plummet and your metabolism slows just look at the Minnesota starvation experiment participants who were dieted down to sub 10% body fat levels became obsessed with food some even chewing through 40 packs of gum a day just to feel sad satisfied the takeaway dropping even below 12% of body fat comes with serious trade-offs and it's why most people who get there don't end up maintaining that shape so be realistic if you're just starting out it's far more sustainable to aim for 15 to 20% and if you're more experience or you just have less fat to lose in for 12 to 15% and this still looks amazing especially if you built muscle along the way for example Chris Evans was reportedly around 12.5% body fat during his iconic Captain America transformation he looked incredible and didn't need to go to extremes now let's dive into the first step of actually achieving it your diet you've probably heard this advice before start your diet off slowly and then get more aggressive as you progress but what if I told you there's a more effective approach that's the opposite of what you'd expect it sounds counterintuitive but instead of easing into your diet and ramping up over time do the opposite think about it when you start a diet you have the most fat to lose your energy levels are still high and you're the most motivated this is actually the best time to push harder and go aggressive but as you get leaner your body starts fighting back so if you save the hardest part of your diet for when you're already struggling the chances of you stick into it drop dramatically and I'm not the only one who noticed this a recent study backs it up showing that an aggressive approach early on led to better fat loss results overall now to get it very rough idea of how many calories you should eat during this phase take your body weight in pounds and multiply it by 10 or 11 so for me on a typical diet I'd stick to around 2300 calories a day which puts me in a moderate calorie deficit to lose about a pound a week but this time in the very first week of my diet I drop down to just 1,200 calories a day now I would not recommend this it's not sustainable and I only did it for a video to see how much fat I could lose in just one week and you can check that out later if you want to see me suffer after that initial week though I stayed aggressive eating just 1,900 calories a day for the next 4 weeks surprisingly it was much easier than I expected only 30 days in I'm already down 6 lb visibly leaner and feeling great but then on the fifth week today the body it's feeling it I just had my breakfast usually that keeps me full for at least a few hours but today my body's telling me no way Jeremy like you need more food and also the past four weeks I haven't had any Cravings but today I have this intense craving for donuts not even just one dut too like I need multiple Donuts so I think this is officially in my body's way telling me I got to slow things down I think if I try to push through this this not going to end well the good news is because I started off so aggressively I was able to increase my daily calories by 300 this helped me continue losing fat at a slower more sustainable days without feeling like my diet was a daily battle but here's the thing whether you start aggressively or take it slow getting lean will always require eating fewer calories over a long period And if you're eating the wrong Foods there's no way you're going to make it so here's the three simple things I did to make my diet as easy and enjoyable as possible let's start with the most important macronutrient protein if you're not getting enough protein your body will end up burning through your muscle instead of just fat it's why many people end up looking flat fat or skinny fat after their diet to avoid that eat protein every meal and enough of it if you open up your hand the protein portion in each of your meals should be at least the size of your palm but now let's talk about the big one cutting calories and here's where most people go wrong they cut out entire food groups which makes sticking to their diet impossible you don't have to eliminate carbs or fats entirely it's about modifying how much of them you eat but fats are a great place to start because because they're the most calorie dense and easiest to adjust for example think about your breakfast let's say you usually have three whole legs and Toes what would be easier cutting out the toast so there's no carbs or keeping the toast and instead reducing the fat by replacing those three eggs with one whole egg and egg whites I know what the answer would be for me and during my diet I apply this concept by using half an avocado instead of a full one in my lunch wrap and having chicken or shrimp for dinner instead of beef so I challenge you take take a look at what you're currently eating and find just two or three opportunities to cut down on your fat sources that alone may already be enough to get you in a calorie deficit however chances are you're going to have to tweak your carbs as well but again small changes for breakfast I cut my usual pre-workout oatmeal from a full cup to a half for lunch I swap my 300 calorie tortilla wrap for two pasas that added up to just 120 calories and for dinner I cut my usual serving of rice in half and load it up up on extra veggies for fullness it didn't feel like I really changed anything yet the fat was quickly coming off let's be real the hardest part of any diet is the weekends believe me I've been there you're sticking to your plan all week but then social events come up you want to relax enjoy meals up with friends or family but at the same time you don't want to undo all your hard work it can feel like a lose lose situation but here's how I made weekends work for me a science back strategy called Planned honic deviation a fancy term for treat meals every Saturday or Sunday I boost my intake by 500 to 800 calories to enjoy a big meal guilt free sure it technically slowed down my weekly progress by day but in the long run it made sticking to my diet way more doable and gave me the Boost I needed for the next week ahead but focusing on your diet alone isn't enough combining it with a proper training plan can not only get you leaner faster but also plays a crucial role in helping you keep the fat off long term now while lifting weights should be your major Focus here there's a few tweaks that can make all the difference especially when it comes to your most stubborn muscle groups see from my experience and conversations with top coaches the muscles that are hardest to grow also tend to be at the highest risk of muscle loss during the diet to counteract this keep the volume high for those muscles for me my chest was always a weak point so during my diet I kept my chest volume High while cutting one to sets from stronger muscles like my back and arms the result 60 days later I was down 10 lbs of fat but my chest actually got stronger and seem to continue to grow that said be careful not to completely neglect any muscle groups either a new study released just this year found that any muscles that aren't trained in this case the inner thighs and calves will likely be burned off for energy so to lose more fat rather than muscle you probably benefit by following a program that doesn't neglect any me need your muscle groups especially your calves but as great as lifting weights is it doesn't burn nearly as many calories as you think and the fewer calories you burn every day the more you're going to have to cut PR your diet which can make stick into it a lot harder so what's the solution cardio obviously yes but here's a Twist the cardio you need doesn't have to evolve running jogging or hours on the stair Master what if I told you cardio workouts not only burn fewer calories than you'd expect but can also make you compensate by burning less energy throughout the rest of the day it's probably why some of you have noticed that even after adding more cardio to your routine your fat loss stalls the real solution Focus Less on cardio workouts and just set a daily step goal think about it the average person Burns about 60 calories per th000 steps so if you go from walking 4,000 to 6,000 steps a day that's an extra 120 calories burn doesn't sound like much but that's an extra pound of fat loss per month and you're much more likely to go for a 15-minute daily walk than a daily run but also be realistic while 10,000 steps a day is often the recommendation even for me that's tough to fit into my schedule so I aim for more achievable 8,000 steps per day as my minimum some days I H it just through walking while other days I might add in some running cardio or Sports it's less about how you get there and more about increasing your daily activity in a way you can actually stick to so with my nutrition workouts and steps in place here's what my weekly plan looked like but imagine this yo what up man I got something to show you you ready let's see D bro you look amazing thanks man thanks yo what's up bro hey bro dude what happened man I just don't want to talk about it the sad reality is more than 80% of people end up gaining the fat right back after the diet is over why it's not just about discipline it's about your physiology working against you this is me before the diet and here I am after who do you think burns more calories a day you think it would be the ri version of me right ra believe it or not before the diet I can get away with eating around 2800 calories a day but now anything over 2500 and I'd start gaining weight and if I tried to get even leaner let's say 10% body fat or below I'd probably have to eat just 2300 calories a day to maintain it which I just wouldn't be willing to do as for why this happens research suggests that for a 10% drop in body weight your metabolism takes a hit dropping by 20 to 25% so if you went down from 180 to 160 lb you'll now burn about 400 fewer calories each day this is exactly why within our built with science programs we not only teach you how to eat in a way that's sustainable both during and after the diet but we've also built a custom nutrition algorithm that tracks how your metabolism changes over time so you know exactly how much to eat to not just lose fat but keep the fat off for good but keeping the fat off isn't just about food research shows that one of the biggest factors in long-term fat loss is how active you are after the diet and that's why for me those 8,000 steps a day didn't just stop once I got lean they became even more critical especially with a slower metabolism which is again why setting a realistic step goal that you can actually stick to longterm is so crucial now while this three-step process is simple and I guarantee it will work for you I get it if this all still sounds really overwhelming so if you're looking for extra help and you want a done for you all-in-one program that guides you every single week to the best shape of your life then just head over to buildwi science.com to find what program is best for you in your body but I highly recommend supplementing your plan with these two ABS exercises which will help you build your six-pack as your diet and you can give that video watch here hope you enjoyed this one don't forget to give it a like And subscribe to the channel and

    "published_at": "2022-03-27T16:07:28Z",
    "transcript": "i'm sure you've heard the advice if you want to grow a big chest and you need to do heavy pressing movements exercises like the bench press dumbbell press and push-ups and there is truth to this studies that have tracked an individual's strength in these movements have found a strong correlation between their pressing strength and resulting chest growth but if we take a closer look at the data we find what are known as outliers some individuals despite gaining significant strength in these movements failed to increase their chest size much at all and i'm sure many of you can relate in fact this was one of my biggest frustrations when i first started training no matter how strong i got with my bench press or how many push-ups i could do my chest just would not grow i'd end up feeling the movements more on my shoulders and triceps and i blamed it on genetics but eventually i realized that even though i was doing the right chest exercises i wasn't doing them in a way that allowed my chest to do most of the work and although my chest is still nowhere near where i want it to be it has improved drastically ever since i fixed four things regardless of how long you've been training for fix the four mistakes i'm about to show you and i guarantee you during your next workout you'll finally feel your chest light up and rapidly grow like it never has before so many of you watching are probably students or full-time professionals who sit most of the day back when i first started training i was a student and sat like this for hours every day without me realizing it my posture eventually became more hunched over time with my shoulders round and forward why am i telling you this well let's take this sludge posture and apply it to the bench press if you're locked up in this position then when you press the bar you'll naturally be inclined to let your shoulders round forward and chest cave in as you push your weight up but the more you let this happen the more tension is shifted away from the chest and onto the shoulders instead do this over time and even if you get stronger at bench pressing it's your front delts that'll end up growing and not your chest so how do you fix this well there's two steps to this and both are equally as important the first step is to address the root cause you need to work on your mobility to help open up your chest that you'll be able to better utilize your chest in the first place during any pressing movements i do have a daily posture routine that focuses on the upper body which i'll link in the description box down below and at the end of this video but for your next workout i want you to try these two exercises right before you press to help open up your chest first take a band and perform over and back to open up the tight chest and front delt muscles if you don't have a band you can clasp both hands behind your back and extend your arms back and up squeezing your shoulder blades together to open up your chest do two sets of five to ten slow and controlled reps here next we want to now activate some of your weakened back muscles that help reinforce this upright posture lay on your stomach squeeze your butt and move your arms into a wide position overhead with your thumbs pointing up lift your hands off the ground slightly hold that for a second and then move your arms into a w position by squeezing your shoulder blades back hold that for a second then straighten your arms out to the sides to make a t-shape before going back to the w and y once more focus on working the muscles in your mid-back and repeat that for a total of six reps what you're going to do next will make sure that your chest now stays in this proper position as you press now most people will keep their back completely flat whenever they do any sort of pressing against the bench this not only puts your shoulders rather than your chest in a more favorable position to do work since they'll be more inclined to run forward but it also tends to be an uncomfortable and riskier position for your shoulder joint instead before you press bring your shoulders down and away from your ears and then retract your shoulder blades by pinching them together as if you had a pencil between them as a result of this your chest will pop up and an arch will be created in your upper back creating a bit of space between your lower back and the bench set this up and maintain it as you press as you can now see your shoulders will stay pinned back and chest out enabling your chest to now do the work now you'll want to mainly focus on maintaining this retracted position as you lower the weight down as you press however it's perfectly fine if your shoulder blades open up a little bit since that helps fully contract your chest as long as your chest still remains up and out and you aren't excessively protracting your shoulder blades and letting your shoulders roll forward or shrug up like we talked about earlier all right so applying the previous point will set you up to successfully start using your chest when pressing but the second mistake can steal tension away from the chest even if you keep your shoulder blades retracted and chest out and it has to do with your elbows so in order to maximally activate your chest when pressing you want your elbow angle to line up with the majority of your chest fibers this tends to be at an angle of around 45 to 60 degrees however many of you watching will likely have relatively stronger shoulders and a weaker chest as a result your body will be inclined to flare your elbows out to the sides as you press in an attempt to use your stronger shoulders to lift the weight rather than your weaker pecs it's very subtle and it's not something many of you will be able to notice let alone feel to minimize the odds of this happening though here's what you can do first you want to avoid using a crazy wide grip since that will tend to cause your elbows to flare out regardless instead try using a grip that's about 1.5 times shoulder width and then as you bring the bar down tuck your elbows to roughly a 45 to 60 degree angle as a result of this the bar should actually move down and back as you lower it landing around the level of your nipples then as you press try to consciously avoid letting your elbows flare out keep them tucked in and drive your biceps in towards your chest the bar should then end up back over your chin at the top position and the same applies for dumbbell presses and even push-ups maximally activate the chest by keeping those elbows tucked on the way down and avoid letting them flare on the way up but trust me your elbows will want to naturally flare out so if you can't keep that from happening as you press up that's a sign that you need to lower the weight unfortunately your chest just isn't ready to take on that heavy load [Music] so by applying the previous two points you'll be setting up your form to maximally activate your chest but to boost activation even further you want to apply something called the mind-to-muscle connection doing so has been shown to boost even well-trained subject's chest activation by 22 and seems to result in faster growth over time to do so we need to first change the way you think about pressing although throughout the video i've been using terms like pressing and pushing the weight up that's not actually what the chest does the chest is mainly responsible for a movement called horizontal abduction which is the act of bringing your arms together so to properly activate your chest while you bench do push-ups or any pressing motion you need to shift your thinking from pushing and instead to pulling your arms together which as a result is what moves the weight up to reinforce this i want you to try this exercise right now as you're watching and then do it right before the next time you press stand with one arm out to the side and the other holding your chest bring your shoulder blades down and pinch together like we talked about earlier now think about the following two points point a at your biceps and point b at your inner pec use that pec to bring point a to point b while feeling that chest contract with your other hand avoid letting your shoulder take over by keeping your shoulder blades back once you start feeling that try bending your arms if you're pressing and again just think about bringing point a to point b or squeezing your biceps into the side of your chest try this with both arms and try it with a band as well for some resistance once you start feeling that you can try it out with push-ups again don't think about pushing your body up think about bringing your arms together as if you're trying to slide your hands in together then when you get to the gym try this out on an empty bar and again just think about pulling your arms together every rep by using your chest rather than just pushing the weight up or for a dumbbell press think about trying to create a big arch with your arms and again squeezing the arms together on the way up rather than just pumping the weights up and down once this clicks for you you'll feel the difference right away and this mind to muscle connection you establish with your chest will only grow stronger over time especially as the size of your chest increases all right so we've already covered quite a bit but there is still one more mistake that has the power to sabotage everything you've just learned this is ultimately what caused me to have a really strong bench press but no chest to show for it what is it ego if you properly apply the tips that we went through you're going to start actually using your chest when you press but since your chest is relatively weak compared to your other stronger muscles that usually take over you're not going to be able to lift as heavy of a weight as you used to when this happens don't let your ego take over and fall back into bad habits realize that now tension is being placed where it should be as a result you'll finally be able to feel and visually see massive chest growth despite using lighter weight and it won't take long for you to return to what you were lifting before but this time it'll be because your chest is getting bigger and stronger so lighten the weight take it slow and trust the process i can't stress how important this is so i hope you're able to see the importance of not just doing the right exercises but performing them in a way that maximizes your efforts working smarter and focusing on quality work rather than wasting time in the gym is what we preach at build science it's why within our science-based programs we provide in-depth tutorials for each and every exercise as well as muscle activation drills just like we did with the chest but for all your muscle groups to gain access and start transforming your body today just head on over to buildupsize.com and take my analysis

    "transcript": "if you can hit that you've done 90 95% of what you can possibly do to maximize your gains today I'm bringing you exclusive insights from seven of the world's smartest muscle building scientists don't you dare keep doing exercises that you think are must do cuz there is no such thing so we're talking about basically gaining a pound a week of nearly entirely lean mass gains every muscle needs the same volume there's nothing written in stone that says that and then I've also seen folks that as they become more well trained benefit more from training not to failure the whole egg groups testosterone levels increased by 239 nanog per deil that is a freaking huge increase in testosterone using their research I'll create a step-by-step blueprint that will serve as your ultimate muscle building hack so the first piece of the puzzle is figuring out your exercises how many exercises should you do what are the best exercises for each muscle and how often should you change your exercises to help answer these important questions is Dr Mike isrel a brilliant Professor with a PhD in sports physiology who clearly practices what he preaches you don't need 18 exercises per session but if you overuse the number of exercises that you have you end up going through all of your best stimulus to fatigue ratio exercises that you have realistic access to within a matter of a few months so we want to conserve some variation I would say that the number of exercises per muscle per week you should have in your plan something like 2 to four now was for what's specific exercises to do for each muscle here's Dr mice recommendations all right where are we starting calves bottom up oh I was going to say chest um chest broke unbelievable chest some kind of flat barbell or dumbbell pressing is a good idea and then some incline work and then lastly for chest I would say uh some kind of flying movement is a good idea to do for most people now the big guy back pull-ups rows and deadlifts with strict technique are the core of big back movements I would also say flexion rows are a pretty good idea to do it's where you let your back completely curl over and then you Arch and extend your chest up super high at the top which gives your back an extra extra juicy thickness that you know you just can't buy at the store biceps for biceps I would say doing bicep curls from a stretched position of biceps is a good idea whether it's cable basian curls behind the back incline dumbbell curls something like that for triceps I would say there are at least three candidate types of movements you should consider doing one is overhead movements because they really stretch especially the long head of the tricep another one is some kind of isolation extension work things like cable push Downs are a perfect exercise here and the third thing I would suggest be some kind of compound pressing work shoulders I'd say see for shoulders almost all rear delt work is already done for you very well by proper back training almost all front delt work is done more than sufficiently by pressing for your chest so I would say after that really you just need to focus on side dels so I really like dumbbell lateral raises seated or standing with very good control I like a variety of upright rows and of course a variety of cable laterals are all always really great for legs do you want to do just legs together or you want to do separate quads hamstring glutes  Cals did you forget about Cales what the hell kind of channel are you running here caless followers running around let's get calvs over with I would say doing your calf raises with a straight leg more often than with a bent leg pre-stretches the gastrus muscle and thus also makes it grow much much more impressively than with bent leg calves you have to have a big ass stretch the biggest stretch you can have hold for 2 to 4 seconds and then come up that's going to be the key with calf training quads yeah quads High bar barbell squats Smith machine squats leg presses ha squats properly done leg extensions all right hamstrings uh some kind of hip hinges I like stiff leg a deadlifts with a regular barbell you can do them um Bells too and then I would say um some combination of lying leg curls and seated leg curls seated leg curls are on average a little bit more effective because they do put the hamstring into a bigger stretch position but as is the case with variation nothing is the best for forever you know like what is it that for every hot girl there's a guy that's tired of dealing with her so uh at some point you know if you really love seated leg curls you're going to try lying leg curls and they're going to blow you out of the water just because you're not used to them okay and then uh glutes lunges have to be the core some kind of lunging and it doesn't matter much what kind but front fo out of front foot elevated and weight Focus focused on the front foot is a really good idea then I would say the next type of movement you want is some kind of hip thrust and then and then lastly I would say some kind of very deep Sumo squatting is also really awesome for the glutes so here's a master list of all the exercises Dr M recommended now before our next expert shows us the best workout splits to use these exercises with we first need to answer the next question how often should you change your exercises it's been shown a few times in the research literature that if you change exercises every single week to a different one you actually shortcut away some of your growth you probably want kind of the same ones over and over and over for how to know when it is a good time to switch your exercises you're getting pumped you're getting sore you're getting annihilated and you're progressing in load and Reps and your joints feel quite good and the exercise isn't pissing you off a ton there is no compelling reason to change that exercise but if your exercise hurting your joints it's pissing you off Etc and there are other good candidates around don't you dare keep doing exercises that you think or must do you go to your little lists that we just made of all the best exercises you go which one do I want to use uh I'll try that one put them in put them in put them in replace them and then the whole thing keeps spinning so you've got your exercises the next piece of the puzzle is volume and frequency how many sets you do how many days a week you work out and the workout split you use are all crucial components of your training this is where our next expert comes in Dr Brad schenfeld Brad runs a research lab dedicated to studying how to optimize muscle growth he'll start by sharing how many sets we should do what I think we can draw based on the research in combination with anecdotal evidence from the From The Trenches is somewhere in the range of 10 to 20 sets per muscle group per week and those are very variable I mean some people can do well with lower volumes and some people need to be on the higher Brad then explained how higher volumes could be strategically used to grow stubborn muscle groups there may be a benefit to specialization Cycles let's say your chest might be somewhat needy you might do 20 sets for that but other muscle groups may maybe only getting five sets if they're more welldeveloped and that way you you can think on an individual level and research is never going to tell you that now as for beginners who haven't grown much overall muscle in the first place if you're a ranked beginner I think all of this goes out the window like to me you should not be focusing on volume for hypertrophy first several months should just be focused on learning your movement patterns and very basic uh type routines so we know roughly how much volume we should be doing but how often should we train each muscle to maximize growth contrary to what I had thought data doesn't seem to show that training a muscle more than once a week has better growth effects with the caveat that it's generally in studies that are fairly modest volumes so somewhere 8 to 10 sets per muscle or less per week when you start getting over that amount there does seem to be a modest benefit so let's say you're going to do 16 sets of your chest on Monday because Monday's National chest St so instead of doing your 16 sets you're bet probably better off spreading it out let's say doing eight sets on Monday and eight sets on Thursday but what workout split should you use to accomplish this I think a a very basic one which is a good starting point is a upper lower split uh that again can be customized where you could do upper lower and then maybe you throw in a total body work out on one day if you want to get more volume in so here's what Brad's upper lower split could look like using the exercises Dr Mike recommended I'll give you guys a link to download this routine at the end of the video but how heavy should you lift and what ring should you use this is where our next expert comes in Daniel plin Daniel is actually a former student of Brad shenfeld and a brilliant researcher for us over at built with science here's what he had to say so interestingly a wide variety of rep ranges can get you similar amounts of hypertrophy but practically speaking if you go too heavy then you'll likely need to do more sets and it might come with a little bit more joint wear and tear and on the other side of the spectrum if you go too light then it's harder to gauge proximity to failure and probably harder to take sets to or close to failure particularly on compound movements so The Sweet Spot is likely going to be for most exercises and most people between 5 and 15 reps which is usually a moderate load however if you're following a proper diet you should be able to get stronger week after week and to keep your muscles growing you need to continue challenging them but what's the most effective approach to do that adding a bit more weight compared to your last workout or on the other hand trying to do more reps luckily for us Daniel was the lead author on a recent study that looked at just that we ran a study to try to see whether increasing in reps or increasing in load was better for hypertrophy so we tested their strength and we had one group only progress in load while the other group only progressed in reps and the Reps group started at an average average of about 10 reps per set and ended the study at about 15 to 20 reps per set depending on the exercise and we found that there were pretty much no differences between groups in terms of how much hypertrophy they gained so to actually apply Daniel's research stick to a rep range of around 8 to 12 reps on most of your exercises then during each set apply a technique called double progression this is where you focus on increasing your reps before adding more weight for example if you can do eight reps with a certain amount of weight aim to do more reps with that same weight the following week only once you can comfortably do 12 reps should you then consider add in a small amount of weight and continuing the process so you now have a way of forcing your muscles to grow every workout but how hard should you trade some people believe that you should take every single set to All Out failure the point where your muscles can no longer lift the weight whereas others believe the style of training is just too much for your muscles to recover from who's right this is where our next expert comes in Josh Josh and his colleague Zach from data driven straight recently ran a massive analysis to determine if you actually experience more growth the closer to failure you train they found that on average AP stoer sets about five reps short of failure you'd achieve about 75% of Max gains from that point for every rep you get closer to complete failure you get about 5% more relative growth however Josh cautioned that although training to failure may lead to more growth when you look at just one set in isolation it also creates more fatigue so if you start training to failure during all your workouts and end up not being able to recover from it it may not actually lead to more growth you have to train hard there's really no way of getting around that but then you can get into the weeds a little bit and say going to do um you know maybe more sets and and train a little bit further from failure am I going to do less sets and train all the way to failure or am I going to do both right what can I recover from what do I seem to benefit from um and and where do I kind of get those indications that progress is moving in the right direction but here's what Josh recommends to start out with if you're a beginner it's your first few weeks of training probably what's going to matter more is is good safe technique but then hey as you become you know more comfortable with that exercise train two to three reps in reserve for all your sets except for the last set just take it all the way to failure and if you get 10 more reps in the previous sets okay now I know that for the next time I do that exercise and okay maybe if you're doing you know back squat you don't necessarily want to go all the way to failure make dang sure that you know you're pushing your limits and one final note I'd like to make is that their analysis use an average volume of 10 direct sets per muscle per week so it's relatively unclear as to how exactly the benefit of training to failure changes for higher volume routines but Josh does have an exciting analysis in the works on this flash drive right here I have about 400 ultrasound scans I need to analyze at some point we compared basically a higher volume condition with three reps in reserve and then the other arm of each individual looked at lower set volumes all the way to to momentary failure I'm excited about these projects not necessarily because they're going to save the world independently but maybe can give some insight into like we have this range of motion research we have the frequency research we have the volume research how the hell to put it all together because it is it is tricky I'm honestly really excited to see the results from Josh and I'm curious what do you guys think will come out on top and why higher volume but training further away from failure or lower volume and training all the weight to failure comment your answer below and I'll keep you guys updated with the result so far we have an excellent Foundation that's going to drive the vast majority of your results but for the icing on the cake there is one New Growth hack that's been consistently shown to provide between 5 to 15% faster growth here to explain this is the world's most knowledgeable expert within this field of research Dr Milo wolf we now have around five studies looking at partial range of motion at longer muscle lengths or lengthen partial versus for range of motion we call the length and partial because you're training in the lengthened part of the range of motion and you're doing a partial range of motion about half the full rep across these five studies four found more muscle growth when using length and partials versus four Ranger motion and one has found no difference now as for the best way to start applying This research to your training here's what Milo recommends so I think the single best way to do it would be instead of doing a full range of motion on a given exercise try using about 50% or about half reps in that length and position that's typically we've studied in the research there are other ways like for example doing a 4ange motion set but extending it by doing partials at the end of the set when you can't get another full rep and then the set as for what exercises to apply this to avoid using this on exercises worth unsafe to go to failure your best options are instead lateral raises bicep curls tricep push Downs most back exercises and chest flies but as for how often to use this technique here's what mil recommends that's a good question the honest answer is we don't fully know the evidence simply hasn't looked at whole programs personally in my own training I use exclusively length and partials and I think if someone wanted to optimize their growth and came to me and was like I just want the most muscle growth I care about nothing else I don't have any strength goals or anything I would say use at least 50% of your training with length partials so basically take a look at your routine and see what exercises this technique could work well with perform about 50 % of those sets with either length and partials instead of full range of motion reps or with length and partials done after your normal set but what about beginners should they use this technique as well I think people who have never lifted weights before to provide them with a frame of reference for what a partial should actually look like teaching them a full Ranger motion first is good but I think after a few weeks of them knowing how to do a full Ranger motion they're essentially good to go as far as Lin partials go and in fact as much as uh scientists don't like to say it most of these studies are done in relatively untrained populations so that is where it's most likely to have a big [Music] effect we've covered a lot so far and honestly I was considering just stopping the research right here in end of the video but I couldn't do that to you guys as important as your training is your nutrition is actually what's going to deliver most of your results so I called out two more experts to now focus on that first up we have Pro bodybuilder and scientist Dr Eric Helms Eric began by explaining that while eating more calories than your body needs is often recommended for growth it may not always be the right approach if you are someone who is starting relatively high in body fat you're probably not going to want to be in a calorie Surplus beginner who's relatively high in body fat will probably be able to maximize muscle growth at maintenance or even potentially in a small deficit while there are some limits to that so a calorie Surplus seems to make the most sense for those who are relatively lean but just how large should that calorie Surplus be so rosik and colleagues actually reported nearly exclusive lean mass gains on average in a group of untrained young male participants who started resistance training is they just gave them roughly 2,000 calorie Weight Gainer on top of their habitual diet they gained roughly 3 Kg of of body mass in 8 weeks so we're talking about basically gaining a pound a week of nearly entirely lean mass gains when you're young uh completely naive to resistance training and you first start there is an argument for having a large Surplus unfortunately though JY is that it seems like after that you know first maybe one or two big bulks that you have you can't really go back to the well cuz we've seen in multiple other studies on well-trained individuals that larger surpluses predominantly result in larger gains in fat mass and most recently our group here we just published at the end of 2023 and unfortunately we found roughly the same thing now as for what this looks like in terms of how fast you should be gaining weight every month here's what Eric recommends I think basically you want to scale your rate of weight gain to your your experience level so if you're a rank novice I think gaining 2% of your body weight per month which you would roughly track with that 300 to 500 calorie Surplus is a good idea uh and then if you're say an intermediate probably something closer to 1% of your body weight per month is a decent Target that's probably going to be between the 200 to 300 calorie Surplus and then if you are Advanced we're probably talking a 100 to 200 calories Surplus at at most and gaining like .5 to 1% of their body weight per month now to help you guys figure out exactly how many calories you need I've implemented all of this research with Eric's recommendations into a simple calculator you can use over at built with size.com slal which I'll also link below but what's just as important as a calorie intake is your protein intake this is where our final expert comes in Allan Aragon Allan is one of the world's top nutrition researchers with over 30 years of success in the field he'll first explain how much protein we really need and then he'll provide a list of the best protein sources to maximize growth you have total daily protein intake 1.6 to 2.2 G per kilogram of body weight OR7 to 1.0 G per pound if you can hit that by the end of the day you've done 90 95% of what you can possibly do to maximize your gains but we do have a study by yasuda and colleagues who compared a low amount of protein at one of the meals a moderate amount and then a large amount of protein at the meals versus an even distribution of protein and so what they saw was the evenly distributed group had more muscle size and strength gains than the skewed distribution group if we want to optimize muscle growth a first importance get total daily protein straight that's the cake now the icing on the cake spread it out relatively evenly over I would say a minimum of three uh protein doses over the course of the day that was for the best protein sources to hit your daily Target get a mix of protein sources in the diet through the day or through the week so you have your flesh Foods you have your beef fish poultry um and then you've got Dairy Greek yogurt to you know milk itself to whey protein then you've got the legume based proteins or Bean based proteins for the for the plant-based side it's also worth mentioning Jeremy that cholesterol dietary cholesterol is a a really potent precursor to testosterone production this was a study semi- recent study that Bugari and colleagues did where they tested three whole eggs post exercise with the equival protein equivalent roughly six egg whites post exercise and they ran the experiment I believe it was for 12 weeks and they found that um the whole eggs group had Superior changes in body composition but um the interesting part about this study is that the whole egg groups testosterone levels increased by 239 nanog per deciliter and so that is a freaking huge increase in testosterone just from eating whole you know three whole eggs um Unfortunately they didn't report the Baseline testosterone level so we don't know whether that was like people going from lowish to kind of moderate or whether it was going from moderate to like you know MN level so yeah there is a good handful of literature showing three eggs a day essentially is doesn't do anything concerning I love eggs they're they're one of the greatest protein sources in nature my blood lipids are fine and uh I I enjoy the the testosterone I was just going to say that guys I've made over 260 science-based videos but this one is by far the one I poured the most effort into and I did that not just because I'm a nerd who loves research but because I want to bring you guys trustworthy science back Fitness information that I honestly wish I had during my early years of training so if you found it useful please let me know in the comments below and share the video with anyone you think of Might benefit or at least take a screenshot of the main points for them and of course massive shout out to all the experts who made this video possible I've

    "transcript": "is it possible to out exercise a bad diet to find out today my friends and I are eating our favorite meals from McDonald's but what they don't know is we'll then be using the world's most scientifically accurate calorie tracker to see who can burn off the calories the fastest Nicole you're at 980 calories cam you're at a thousand sixty three calories and I am at 1600 calories to burn I am very shocked that my two small burgers in my root beer which is honestly a regular meal for me is 900 calories 1063 calories for some nuggets dude it felt like I was eating a kid's meal I got us some dessert no takers all right more for me [Music] the race was on my Approach I'm gonna be playing basketball I'm gonna get some shots up do some training maybe play some one-on-one I really like playing basketball so I'm hoping that this takes some of the pain out of just mindlessly doing cardio and it can actually be fun put that in the video I'm gonna do a leg day do some squatting that is my usual go-to so I'm confident I can get my calories burnt and get my heart racing during that one I don't think I'm gonna beat Jeremy but maybe I have a shot feeding camp we'll see so while Nicole and cam are almost certain I'm gonna win I have over 800 more calories to burn than they do I need a secret weapon so a day before The Challenge I spoke with well-known Fitness scientist Dr Eric Helms what I recommend is just accumulating a lot of time at a moderate intensity or moderately high intensity basically the most you can tolerate for a long period of time Eric recommended I take a look at the compendium of physical activities this bad boy ranks almost every exercise you could think of based on how energy demanded they are so I combed through the list and chose the most energy demanding upper and lower body exercises to guarantee My Success starting with vigorous uphill biking by now you're probably wondering what's up with the pain like mask everyone's wearing well I'm sure you've all used an Apple Watch Fitbit or even looked at the number on cardio machines to see how many calories you've burned from your workout these have all been shown to inaccurately report calories burned by over 20 percent The Mask we're using developed by a company called Pinoy is the most scientifically accurate way to measure calories burned by capturing every single breath we take it measures the amount of oxygen used and carbon dioxide released and uses that to determine the exact number of calories you're burning now the mask made everything so much harder after the first 20 minutes I was gassed but I'm the Science Guy I'm the fittest and I'm competitive I have to win losing would be an embarrassment I kept pushing through until my legs were literally burning to the point where I just couldn't take anymore and after an hour of giving it everything I had it was time to check in I'm hoping for at least 600 calories oh just broke a thousand calories dang okay so it's been 60 minutes so far and you've burnt an astounding 595 calories that's not bad that's not bad you're at 3 13. almost a third of the way there no I could cry after one hour of giving it my all I'd already burned off my Big Mac impress but cam was right there with me burning off his 12 chicken nuggets just from playing ball Nicole on the other hand has yet to burn off enough calories to cover just one of her Burgers Eric helps explain why this is you really don't see great energy expenditure from resistance training until you get really really strong you're spending 80 of the time resting between sets so you can maintain the intensity you want to burn the most calories possible cardio wins hands down now although Nicole made a smart move by jumping around instead of resting between her sets just as Eric predicted her weights workout just didn't burn very many calories but this doesn't mean lifting weights is pointless would be a huge mistake to not do resistance training because when you create an energy deficit you're going to lose weight but you really want to be losing as much of that weight as fat mass as possible the resistance training tells your body I need to hold on to my muscle mass the cardio UPS your energy expenditure to create the deficit to make sure that deficit comes strong fat Mass I found Refuge by this trash can because it's the only shade right now so that's about how it's going right now I needed to get out of the Sun so I found a small patch of shade over on a pathway and I figured I could do some jump rope now I was so tired at that point and everything was starting to hurt while cam has gotten off to a good start he does have a slight Advantage the heavier you are the more calories you're going to burn moving however Eric also explained for a given unit at a time if you're both training pretty hard and trying to redline it or doing the hardest you can for 30 minutes the person in better shape will burn more calories so if Cam's cardio isn't as good as mine hopefully he starts slowing down soon to give me a chance to pull ahead after that first check-in I thought I'm gonna need to bring Tony in I've known her for a long time we're really good friends but it was almost like a boot camp so you're doing 12. so Tony was definitely pushing me to my hardest how's that feel okay not good good turn it off then there was no stopping she wasn't gonna let me take a break it was go go go one two one two it was one of the breaking points I was just so tired you would probably assume the most energetic method of burning a lot of calories is something kind of like what a CrossFit games competitor would do or you're bouncing between ball slams Sprints back and forth obviously that will burn a lot of calories but I think for the average person they don't necessarily have the cardiovascular conditioning to make that really really effective you're most of the time going to see higher energy expenditure just from spending that time you know doing moderate intensity training so I'm halfway through my total I'm feeling confident but my legs were exhausted so it was time to change my Approach and use one of the most energy demanding upper body exercises from the compendium of physical activities chopping [Music] so I was hoping ax shopping might actually take me all the way to the win but just 10 minutes in my hands were blistering my cardio was perfectly fine but my hands just couldn't bear the pain clearly I'm not used to getting my hands dirty but I couldn't let this stop me from the win I pushed harder and faster for the next 30 minutes until I just finally had to call it quits okay so it's 40 minutes honestly my cardio was good I could have kept going but my hands just like ate me up okay 497 calories it's honestly like more than I expected at this point I burned off my Big Mac my fries my drink and my McFlurry but my body was exhausted eating that apple pie may just end up costing me to win but defeat was no option I had one more trick up my sleeve to help me secure the win after a bit of jump rope I realized I was having a much better time playing basketball so I opted to go back out into the heat to do some shooting some dribbling drills and that is when my brain really started to kick in telling me please stop exercising please my shots were bad my form was bad everything was starting to deteriorate after feeling so exhausted from the circuit I thought let's change it up go for a walk felt good then I came back to find out I have another 180 calories to burn I forfeit so I jumped on the treadmill tried to do some Sprints there down to the wire I only have my apple pie left to burn but cam only has his fries and Nicole only has to burn off her root beer it's time for the final push losing was not an option so I chose to stick with the basics StairMaster with cabinet Cole closing in on the totals I just didn't have a second to lose luckily I recalled Eric's comment about body weight the heavier you are the more calories you burn so I decided to add 25 pounds to a backpack to speed things up I was exhausted my ankles were hurting my legs I couldn't feel so I thought the best decision and that point would be to get on the bike I opted to do the most mindless thing I could do which is just going up and down the court and doing a layup I can't even call it running because it was just pathetic at this point if I'm being honest you're almost there come on bring it all the way home go go go go go go go go go it's the last one in three more calories bro you got it you got this last bucket come on don't slow down just because you know what's coming fast go go go go go go go go [Music] that's the hardest one that was all mental holy I am never eating McDonald's again all right let's be real that's a lie don't think because of this video you can never eat fast food again or that you need to burn off all the calories every time you eat something bad the average male already Burns around 2 000 calories doing absolutely nothing all day but nowadays it's easier than ever to gain weight by simply eating more calories than your body needs and while it is possible it's very difficult to try to reverse this through exercise alone it's much easier to turn down the apple pie than it is to burn off 300 calories don't get me wrong exercise is amazing for you when everyone needs it but if you want to lose weight and get in shape you'd be a fool not to prioritize your diet and if you want a proven step-by-step plan that'll tell you exactly what to eat and how to work out to transform your body based on science then just head over to buildablescience.com and take our quiz to find the best plan for you and your body but now it's time for the results [Music] well coming in third place with a total of 134 minutes Nicole now keep in mind she did have a disadvantage being the lightest of us three and considering her poor choice of exercises I'd say her time was very impressive this means it's down to just me and cam so my official time was 126 minutes and you clocked in at 107 minutes yo you smashed it dude dude you beat me at my own game let's go so here's your prize dude all right McDonald's gift card dude I'm about to burn this you can get a hundred a hundred chicken nuggets with this as disappointed as I was about my loss kan's Victory taught me an important lesson this whole time I was so obsessed with science and creating the best plant but while a fancy workout may look good on paper it's not going to do much if you absolutely dread doing it exercise is crucial for both your physical and mental health and it doesn't have to feel like torture whether it's basketball biking playing with your dog or who knows maybe even chopping wood find activities you actually have fun doing as that's what you'll be most likely to stick to so here's a full breakdown of the results for those interested comment down below what you'd like to see us test next and special thanks to Eric for all his help with the video I'll leave links to his stuff down below thanks so much I'll see you next time"

    "title": "How I Grew Wider Shoulders FAST (5 Science-Based Tips)",
    "published_at": "2023-03-05T14:00:28Z",
    "transcript": "so a few months ago I asked my girlfriend if there was one muscle I could grow to enhance my physique what would you pick here's what she said your shoulders like the wet they're like the twirling madly it just looked good to me okay you've got it but there's a problem so you know how some guys are just naturally blessed with a broad prey yeah that wasn't me I'm not trying to blame it on genetics but how many Filipinos have you seen with a superhero frame we're small bones at that so I knew this would be a challenge but with five simple tweets to my training here's where I'm at now and I'll be honest my shoulders have never looked better A lot of you guys have noticed the games as well here's exactly what I did so the first week has to do with exercise selection while the front delts and rear delts are helpful to build overall shoulder Mass the key to getting wider broader shoulders from the front and back do is to grow the side delts and there's a lot of new exciting research I use to help pick the best side dealt exercises for example as some of you may have seen in my past shoulder Experiment video we tested 17 shoulder exercises to see which ones best activated the three different regions of the shoulder although shoulder presses did activate the side belts quite well they mainly activate and grow the front delts what I needed was an exercise that activated only the side delts really well and wasn't as fatiguing on the body so what came out on top were lateral raises but I didn't just do your typical lateral raise you see there's been a lot of new research on muscle stretch and how it can help you build muscle faster I've covered this in a past video that goes through this Research In Depth that I'll link below but basically some muscles seem to grow faster during exercises that challenge them the most when they're fully stretched although it hasn't been shown with the delts quite yet it seems very likely that they would benefit as well the problem with your typical dumbbell lateral raise however is their hardest at the top when the shoulder is fully contracted the opposite of what we're looking for so my secret weapon was this exercise behind the body cable lateral raises I stand in the front and slightly to the side so my delt is fully stretched and challenged mode went in this position next up training volume the shoulders seem to recover really fast some research also suggests they don't get as sore as easily as other muscles like the chest legs and arms do however there is a limit to how much you should train them generally research suggests it takes muscles around 36 to 48 hours to fully recover this would mean if you wanted to maximize growth you could train the same muscle up to a Max of about three or four times a week before it would likely become too much to recover from so what did I do well I definitely could have bunked it up to three times a week but twice a week fit my worker routine better and still worked incredibly well especially because of the other tweaks you'll learn about now as for actual volume on one day I do four sets of the dumbbell lateral raise either standing or on a bench and then a few days later I trim them again with another four sets but using the cable lateral raise that I mentioned earlier now I know what some of you may be thinking only 8 sets a week honestly guys heat sets was all it took to grow my shoulder but only because of the next tweaks that I applied the next tweak has to do with weight there's a unique feature about lateral raises that most people Overlook you see the further away a weight is from your body the heavier it will feel this is what makes even a really lightweight feel extremely heavy during lateral raises for me personally as soon as I try to go anywhere above 35 pound dumbbells I start to cheat way too much to avoid this I took advantage of the fact that research suggests you can use a lightweight and do up to 30 reps with it before it becomes too light and less effective for growth so to apply this I'd stick with the same weight and only once I could do at least 15 to 20 reps with good controlled form on all my sets where they then jump up by another five pounds and repeat the process but guys do not rush this in the past three months my lotto raises have increased only by about five pounds and just one notch heavier on the cable machine now although it doesn't sound like much that's almost a 20 jump in weight the equivalent to adding over 20 pounds to the average person's bench press and if you don't sacrifice form you can be fairly confident that the increase in strength is indeed from your shoulders against bigger in fact take a look at michoud here he's one of our bill with science program members who apply to similar plan and you can see just how much wider his shoulders are after just three months so take it slow and if you're interested in joining one of our fitness programs after this video take our quiz at buildwasize.com to find the best plan for you next intensity honestly this is a tweet that I think made the biggest difference I'm not gonna lie as much as I love wide shoulders I hate lateral raises the burn is disgusting and very uncomfortable but here's the thing one study from back in 2012 showed that in order for the side delves to reach full muscle activation during lateral races subjects had to push to at least within around three to five reps short of complete failure that's just activation though to maximize growth plenty of research suggests each of your sets need to be taken to at least within three reps of complete failure problem is I guarantee that during your lotto raises many of you are stopping well short of this heck even even me someone who's been training for years as soon as I told myself I was going to start really pushing through my mental limits I was instantly able to get about five more reps on lateral raises compared to when I usually stop trust me even if you think you're done and even if your shoulders are burning you've still got more as Muhammad Ali once said I only start counting when it starts hurting because they're the only ones that count that's what makes you a champion and that couldn't be more true here the last piece of advice is the most important it has to do with my diet while some people might be able to build a little bit of muscle when in the calorie deficit or even at their maintenance calories a recent meta-analysis suggests that a calorie Surplus is likely necessary to maximize growth and for those follow me on Instagram you know have been Vulcan for almost a year now I've been eating a lot of pasta potatoes rice beef and high calorie foods in general to make sure I'm consistently eating in a calorie Surplus I'm not gonna lie it's been mentally tough seeing more and more fat gain over the months but I've noticed a big difference in my muscle size I guarantee if I applied all the training tweaks I went through yet I wasn't in a certain blast sure I might have seen some improved definition but I wouldn't have seen any big difference in new muscle size or strength and once I dye it to lose the excess fat I put on during the bulk I guarantee that the shoulder gains I've made will become even more noticeable so if you truly want to make noticeable new muscle gains make sure you're even enough but guys don't forget to grow your front delts and your rear delts as well these are key to balance out your shoulders and give them that 3D look and you can get this video watch next to learn what shoulder exercises we found were best at targeting these areas all right Bud wider shoulders have been unlocked what is next leg legs and the calves oh God [Music]"

    "title": "How to ACTUALLY Lose Belly Fat (Based on Science)",
    "published_at": "2023-04-23T13:00:16Z",
    "transcript": "belly fat is really easy to gain yet often the hardest area to lose and there's actually two types there's that annoying belly fat we all know that covers your abs but there's also a more dangerous type of belly fat stored deep within your organs known as visceral fat which can create serious health problems to find the most effective way to get rid of both types of belly fat I reached out to five of the world's most qualified phalla scientists and came up with five easy steps anyone can start doing today to lose belly fat for the first and most important step I spoke to lay Norton scientific researcher Champion powerlifter and honestly just a really smart dude who calls out BS when he sees it so why is stored belly fat so difficult to lose once again we don't know the exact scientific explanation for that but it may have something to do with the tissue being a little bit more metabolically active than other forms of stored body fat now the real question is is there any way around that well yes kinda of sadly even though we'd like to think if we do a bunch of crutches and work the area where the fat is stored it will preferentially Target that fat there is no evidence to support that idea and it's unlikely that that would make a difference overall now there is research showing that exercise can reduce visceral fat without actually causing weight loss so it is a good idea to exercise in general but specific exercises are not going to Target preferentially belly fat per se I know people don't want to hear this the real key to losing belly fat is just getting into a caloric deficit consistently and doing it for long enough now the most effective way to create the calorie deficit Lane talked about is by modifying your diet that's where our next expert comes in Alan Aragon Allen is one of the world's top nutrition researchers and Educators with over 30 years of success in the field he recommends first find out roughly how many calories you eat in a day next find out how many calories you should be eating to lose fat which you can do by using the free calculator I've made over at builtwithsize.com calculator then simply try to close that Gap over time with most of your Foods coming from the following sources you have to be eating the foods that you like and look forward to people have an idea of what their 20 favorite foods are that's honestly that that's what they should be eating that's what they should be eating if people freak out when they hear that but hey man if you love the foods that you're eating you're gonna stick to your diet it helps to have an awareness of the food groups as well because when I say your 20 favorite foods I mean your 20 favorite foods that are reasonably healthy choices across the food groups and there's six of them there's the the meat or the high protein group there's the fat group there's the fibrous vegetable group and there's the starch group and then there's the milk group and then there's the fruit group so choose your three favorite foods across like in each of those food groups choose your three favorite three favorite ones you like the most and there's your diet man there's your diet oh oh wait we have two two more Foods left to get those 20 Foods choose your two favorite YOLO Foods your two favorite desserts or whatever or what you like wine okay wine and freaking cookies or something you know brownies and ice cream whatever um and that's a healthy diet right there that'll hold you down for for life and not just a dieting phase I love that approach I've never actually heard somebody put it like that um but now what about protein intake how important would you say protein intake is for losing belly fat just losing fat in general protein intake adequate protein is crucial among the macronutrients it helps you preserve muscle mass it's the most potent thereof because it's protein is a muscle mass is protein and this is sort of a side thing that's a little bit trivial but protein has the highest energetic cost of processing within the body and so um in you know in theory you take a a diet that's a hundred percent protein then your body will spend about 30 percent of those calories just trying to process it and and so it's like that's not necessarily the case with carbohydrate and fat this helps from the standpoint of um a a weight and fat loss perspective it doesn't have to be a a tough thing to to try to accomplish even I mean on the low end if you consume 1.6 grams per kilogram of body weight which is 0.7 grams per pound of body weight then you are at an adequate starting point and the last question I had is uh what about visceral fat are there any kinds of foods that promote the storage of visceral fat and are there foods that people can eat to avoid getting that yeah man that is a great question and researchers have been fighting over the answer to this question for a really long time okay so the overarching answer that covers a lot of things is that if you're losing fat um or if you're getting lean there's really no concern about visceral fat because if you're losing overall fat then visceral fat is diminishing as well it's not like that's gonna hold steady you know principle number two is that visceral fat is mainly a concern for people who are who are gaining fat and um there's actually a study by rosquist and colleagues where they compared what types of dietary fat most influence visceral fat they compare to polyunsaturated fat source with a saturated fat Source it was a hyper caloric experiment which where the subjects were eating more calories and the saturated fat Rich diet that resulted in in Greater visceral fat accumulation than the polyunsaturated fat Rich diet alright so you've got your nutrition plan but now let's talk what exercise as Lane mentioned earlier exercise can burn off that dangerous visceral fat even if you don't lose any weight but the right type of exercise can also help you avoid regaining belly fat as soon as your diet is over to explain this is Eric Trexler Pro natural bodybuilder and published scientist with a PhD in human movement science so usually when people are trying to lose belly fat but they automatically think that they have to do a bunch of cardio but how about resistance training like how important is lifting weights for someone who's interested in losing belly fat so I'd say it's really important there are some major benefits of resistance training if you're trying to lose belly fat and really just trying to lose fat in general so first of all if you're lifting during this fat loss phase there's a very high likelihood that you are going to reduce the amount of muscle loss that occurs during that weight loss and that can be great great for two reasons so a lot of people who don't lift weights and just do fat loss they often find that they end up looking more skinny and less shredded than they were hoping at the end so retaining muscle can be great for maintaining definition there's also been some really good research in the last couple years indicating that the more muscle or the more lean mass you lose during a diet the more hunger you tend to experience later on and the higher likelihood that you're actually going to regain some of the fat that you lost later right and then let's say somebody is you know lifting weights regularly how does cardio now fit into the picture I mean it definitely like has a lot of benefits for your health that lifting weights doesn't necessarily provide but how much does it help when trying to lose belly fat the reality is you don't need cardio in order to lose fat or to lose belly fat but cardio can be a helpful thing and one of the reasons for that is energy expenditure has a tendency to go down during a fat loss phase so of course there will be some reduction normally in resting metabolic rate but non-exercise activity thermogenesis is another really key thing that can change during a fat loss phase so non-exercise activity is basically everything that exists between resting and doing structured exercise so walking to the mailbox walking around at your work or your school um you know anything that fits between those two extremes of exercising on purpose office and uh you know just kind of totally resting It's usually the second biggest contributor to Total daily energy expenditure for most people and so unfortunately when we diet a lot of people notice their non-exercise activity thermogenesis goes down pretty significantly uh so cardio can be a really helpful thing in keeping your expenditure higher when that non-exercise activity starts to go down over time so you're just trying to kind of keep things steady by adding some cardio to the mix for some people it's even just purely behavioral we might just say hey use the stairs instead of the elevator and park at the back of the parking lot instead of the front so everything that that gets you moving counts but even with proper nutrition that exercise a recent 2022 study found there's an often overlooked variable that can still prevent you from losing belly fat to explain this study is exercise science professor and body composition researcher Bill Campbell that this new study was very unique in that it was the first ever investigation to assess a lack of sleep and how it affects where body fat is stored they took 12 healthy males and females who on average slept about seven and a half hours per night they had these subjects live in a research sleep lab and then place them into two different sleep conditions the first condition was a sleep restricted condition where they were allowed to sleep only four hours per night the other condition was a normal sleep condition where they were allowed to sleep nine hours per night and during this entire process they were allowed to eat as much and whatever food they wanted to eat so after two weeks in each condition here's what happened the Sleep restricted subjects on average consumed 300 more calories per day and they gained about a pound of body weight when compared to the subjects when they were in the normal sleep stage but here's where things get really interesting the subjects that were sleep restricted they gained eight percent more subcutaneous body fat and then the normal sleep condition they only gained about four percent the other part of our bellies that stores fat is called the visceral region or visceral body fat and that's the dangerous body fat because that's associated with a lot of adverse Health outcomes the Sleep restricted condition caused an increase in 11 of this visceral body fat and the normal sleep condition they didn't gain any now again we would expect they had they ate more calories they gained a little bit more body weight so we would expect a little bit of a gain in body fat but not nearly to the extent that we saw as it was localized to the belly region to the abdominal region so this study suggests that there may be a link to sleep restriction leading to overeating which causes a gain in body fat that is preferentially stored in the belly region so my takeaway from this is to make sure that you prioritize sleep I would suggest that you get about seven hours per night and that you do not Overlook the importance of this now I know some of you might be thinking okay well the subjects were overeating what about if I'm still in a calorie deficit this sleep still matter as much and that's a valid question and a 2010 study actually tested this researchers put two groups of subjects on a weight loss diet with the same amount of calories the only difference was one group slept eight and a half hours per night while the other group slept only five and a half hours per night the result both groups lost a similar amount of total weight both groups also did lose some muscle because they weren't lifting weights but the well-slapped group lost 1.6 times less muscle and lost 2.3 times more fat than the Sleep restricted group suggesting that a lack of sleep alone may in fact lead to more muscle loss and less fat loss during a diet so you've now got all the tools you need to lose belly fat but there's one more thing you need to add to your plant failure to do this is why so many people start out strong yet never end up successfully losing their belly fat Lauren conlon a master coach exercise scientist and ifbb bikini Pro will help explain what this missing piece is all right let's go through what commonly happens so a client is going to obsess over losing belly fat even if they have seen some changes on the scale or seen improvements in other areas of the body since there hadn't been much change in their belly fat they are going to feel like what they're doing isn't working or it's not happening fast enough some clients are just going to give up right then While others are going to slash their calories or increase their cardio this increase in their deficit is typically unsustainable though so they're going to fall off plan and inevitably quit first it's important to recognize that unless genetically you have little body fat on your abs and core area that you will probably need to get leaner than you'd think to lose belly fat for many people the belly is the last area we're going to see fat come off but in the meantime you can pay attention and be proud of the progress you've made in other areas like your face and your shoulders and your legs and trust that if you remain patient but eventually you'll start to see more and more progress in these problematic and stubborn areas second take multiple measures of progress you can use scale weight and measurements as quantitative feedback but we also want to look at qualitative feedback such as how your clothes are fitting how you're looking and how much better that you're feeling don't just obsess over your belly and and lastly and probably most importantly out of this entire video be patient and recognize that you're usually quitting right before it gets good okay it doesn't matter how perfect your program is unless you are patient and remain consistent you are shortchanging yourself and your results you owe it to yourself to make this change so don't give up follow or create a great program adjust it when it's necessary and take your time your belly fat didn't get there overnight so you're not gonna lose it in a few weeks either I want to give a huge thank you to all five of the experts who help with

    "transcript": "lifting weights is great for building muscle but not so great for burning calories in this video i'll explain how that affects your ability to build muscle and lose fat and then cover three tweaks that you can make to increase the number of calories you burn during your lifting workouts by the end we're gonna apply this to a full body workout that you can get started with right away first off it's important to understand that exercise alone is not very effective at losing fat if your diet is not under control for example it would take nearly two hours of running to burn off the calories from a cheeseburger in small fries this isn't very practical but with a proper diet adding the right type of exercise to it can significantly speed up your results illustrating this very well is a 2012 study that took 119 participants and compared the fat loss effects of died in with cardio dieting with resistance training or dieting with both cardio and resistance training each group ate 2 000 calories a day the cardio group went jogging for 45 minutes three times a week the resistance training group lifted weights for an hour three times a week whereas the last group did both of these throughout the week after several months of this the researchers then analyzed how much bat each group was and this is where it gets really interesting the group that only did resistance training they only lost roughly half a pound of fat the group that only did cardio lost almost five times as much as this whereas a group that did both resistance training and cardio experienced the most fat loss now the reason for these results is that resistance training it just doesn't burn many calories compared to cardio research has shown that on average lifting weights only burns about two to three calories per minute a simple brisk walk burst more than this this means that a single cardio session can easily burn two to three times as many calories than a traditional resistance training workout does however resistance training did have one important advantage over cardio doing cardio alone led to a small amount of muscle loss whereas resistance training led to almost a 2.5 pound increase in muscle this is important to know because muscle is what's going to help keep your metabolism high as you lose weight it will help ensure that you end up looking lean and muscular rather than just skinny after your diet this means that for the best fat loss and muscle building results a combination of resistance training with cardio is best but let's face it for most people this is a big commitment and traditional cardio it can be quite unenjoyable another option combine them both into a single high intensity workout a workout that gives the calorie burning efficiency of cardio as well as the muscle building benefits of lifting i'm going to show you how to do this with three tweaks and then give you an example workout that puts this into practice the first tweak is with how much weight you'll be lifting and how many reps you're gonna be doing in your sets for each exercise a 2011 study analyzed the calories burned during sets of the bench press by having participants either do sets with heavier weights for less reps or lighter weights for more reps the researchers found that participants could nearly double the number of calories they burned in a set by lifting lighter weights for more reps however although we can burn slightly more calories the lighter in weight that we go there's two scientific findings we need to apply to avoid making the workout less effective at building muscle number one is from a recent 2020 analysis of several studies where researchers tested if you could build the same amount of muscle using either light weights or heavy weights they found that this was in fact possible but only if participants pushed themselves hard enough during their sets to the point where they could only do one or two more reps if they went all out number two is from a similar paper done just this year which found that although you can build just as much muscle with lighter weights there's a point where the weight becomes too light and less effective for muscle growth because of this for the best muscle building results while still burning significantly more calories a good recommendation is to use a weight that's between 40 to 60 percent of the maximum weight you can lift for that exercise for most people this means choosing a way that you can do around 15 to 30 reps with just remember you still need to push yourself hard enough for this to be effective tweak number two so this involves using the most muscle masses possible within your workouts this is something we implement into my built with science programs because of the several benefits it provides illustrating this is a 2017 study which tested a variety of resistance training exercises and compared the calories burned they compared several isolation exercises that only worked one small muscle at a time to compound exercises that work several different muscles simultaneously and what they found is actually quite surprising for example lat pull downs which worked several back muscles as well as the biceps burned almost 20 percent more calories than bicep curls they also found that squats which work the whole lower body burn almost 35 more calories than leg extensions which only work the quads we're going to apply this by filling our workout with big exercises that will work every single muscle of our body finally the most important thing you can do to increase the calorie burn of lifting weights is improve your time efficiency think about it during a 60 minute resistance training workout you don't actually spend much time working out much of it is spent resting letting your muscles recover before the next step this is great if you're trying to maximize muscle growth and strength but not very helpful for burning calories there is however a way that we can structure our workouts to increase our calorie burn without sacrificing gains a 2011 study showcased just how effective this method can be the researchers took a group of trained men and randomized them into two groups one group performed a traditional resistance training workout that involved three minutes of rest between each set and moving through each exercise one at a time the other group performed a circuit style training where they perform each exercise one right after the other taking just 30 seconds to transition to the next exercise they then repeated the circuit for the same number of total sets as a traditional group after eight weeks of this the researchers found that both groups experienced similar increases in muscle mass and strength but the circuit training group had a significant decrease in body fat percentage while the traditional training group did not and this occurred even with the workouts on the circuit group being half the time of the traditional group workouts using this method will enable us to add more exercises and sets into our workout without having to stay in the gym any longer than normal but we will want to be careful with the exercise selection to ensure that we don't compromise our gains by overworking the same muscle groups with not enough rest all right we got the science down now let's apply it into a workout that can be done either at the gym or even at home with just dumbbells the workout includes three circuits that each have four exercises within each circuit you're going to progress from one exercise to the next resting for only 15 to 20 seconds and for each exercise you're going to pick a weight that you can do somewhere between 15 to 30 reps with if you push really hard if you reach above 30 reps then you know it's time to use a heavier weight finally if you're a beginner perform each circuit two to three times intermediate three to four times and advance four to five times let's now dive into the first circuit so the first circuit is gonna focus on the upper body and all you're gonna need is a bench and two pairs of dumbbells first start with a flat dumbbell bench press to work the chest and triceps if you don't have a bench these can be just done on the floor once you finish your set using the same pair of dumbbells move on to a bent over dumbbell row to now work your back and biceps pull the dumbbells into your hips not your chest after you finish rows take a quick breather and then grab a second set of dumbbells you want these to be a little bit lighter we'll use them to perform shoulder presses and we're going to do these standing to slightly boost shoulder muscle activation when compared to the seated version when you're done with this set the dumbbells down i will now focus on working the core with reverse crunches take it slow and feel your abs working every part of the rep after that you've completed one round take 15 to 20 seconds to rest and then repeat for the required number of cycles based on your experience level once you're done with circuit one take two to three minutes to rest and prepare for circuit 2 to now focus on the lower body first we're going to start with a tough yet very effective exercise for the quads hold the dumbbell at your chest and squat down to at least parallel pace yourself here not going too fast or too slow around rep 15 your legs will be on fire but keep on pushing once you're done grab a pair of dumbbells and will now focus on the hamstrings and glutes with a romanian deadlift lower the dumbbells only as far as you can while keeping your back flat then use your hamstrings and glutes to pull yourself back up to the starting position after this keeping the same dumbbells will now work the calves no we're not skipping them while standing raise up on your toes as far as you can squeeze hard at the top and then control the weight back down and repeat we'll then finish the circuit off with some core work grab either a 10 or 25 pound plate lie on your back and perform weighted crunches you don't need to sit all the way up just think about trying to touch your chest towards your belly button once you're done take about 15 to 20 seconds to rest and then it's back to squats when you're all done your required number of circuits take another two to three minutes to rest and get ready for the final circuit so the third and final circuit is going to focus on the full body and all you need is a heavier and lighter pair of dumbbells first we're gonna work the lower body with the heavier dumbbells held by your sides take a step back into a reverse lunge keep your chest up and push up with the front leg alternate legs each rep after this you're going to drop down for push-ups depending on your experience level you can elevate your hands up on a box to make it easier or elevate your feet to make it harder what's most important is that you're pushing yourself hard and getting no more than 30 reps after this grab your lighter pair of dumbbells and we're now going to focus on the mid back and rear delts bend over then raise your arms into a w position at the top hold this briefly and then come back down for another rep finally we're almost there we're going to finish the circuit off with the plank squeeze your glutes together and keep your chest and hips parallel to the floor don't worry about reps here just hold it until you get to about an eight or nine out of ten difficulty just like the last two circuits cycle through these exercises two to five times depending on your experience level after that give yourself a much needed pad on the back and congratulate yourself for hopefully making it through so you're gonna get the most benefit from this workout if you implement it no less than two but no more than four times a week that being said i wouldn't use the style of workout if your main goal is to build muscle and improve your strength i have other workouts on my channel that are much better suited for that and for those who are looking for an all-in-one step-by-step program that's personalized specifically for your body and your fitness goals you can take a free quiz over at

    "published_at": "2018-11-25T17:03:45Z",
    "transcript": "when it comes to building muscle and adding size to your frame your diet is going to be the most important factor that you have to get right because simply put when your diet is optimized for muscle growth it will enable you to perform that much better in the gym and physically recover and progress that much faster but what exactly does a diet optimize for muscle growth entail well despite all of the confusion and common misconceptions surrounding this topic it's actually quite simple and by no means does it require you to explicitly stick to eating chicken broccoli and brown rice every day but there are a few factors that you need to get right and are primarily how many total calories protein carbs and fat you're consuming on a daily basis so let's start with that if you want to maximize muscle growth while minimizing excess fat gain then you have to ensure you're in taking enough calories but at the same time you don't want to go overboard in fact research has indicated that more is not necessarily better for growth since there's a limit to the amount of muscle that you can build a month this will cause the rest of your excess calories to be stored as fat therefore i'd go with the recommendations of multiple researchers within the field which is to aim to slowly gain roughly two to four pounds per month depending on your training experience and to find out how many calories this amounts to for you you can simply use researcher lau mcdonald's recommendation and multiply your body weight in pounds by 15 and then add 200 to 400 calories to this if you're a beginner aim for the higher end since you'll have a greater muscle growth potential whereas intermediate lifters should aim for the lower end although this likely won't be spot on initially you can start with this and then adjust your calories based on how your weight gain progresses as for protein again more is not necessarily better but there is an optimal range that you want to hit given that it plays a vital role in muscle recovery and growth as for what this range is based on this 2018 analysis from the journal sports medicine intaking roughly 0.73 to 1 gram per pound of body weight seems to be optimal for muscle growth note that going over this range doesn't seem to provide an added benefit for growth but in the event that you do just know that research shows that it's completely safe to do so given that you have normal and healthy kidney function now as for carbs and fats you need sufficient carbs in order to fuel your workouts and boost your performance in the gym but you also need sufficient fat to support your hormone levels and overall health as for how much of each the literature recommends to intake roughly 0.25 to 0.5 grams of fat per pound of body weight and then the remainder of your calories coming from carbs therefore you have a lot of flexibility with your carbs and fats and can adjust them to better suit your lifestyle and food preferences and if you're confused about figuring out all these numbers an easy way to get started is to simply use a macro calculator which i do have up on my website and i'll link that in the description box down below but now that you've learned the basics of setting up and optimizing your diet for muscle growth let's take a look at what a typical day of eating could look like for you and given that the average person needs roughly 2 500 calories to maintain their weight we'll aim for an intake of around 2 800 calories and this intake will be spread across four main meals throughout the day since as shown in brad schoenfeld's 2018 study this is optimal in order to maximize muscle anabolism so with that being said let's start with meal one i find that a very easy and convenient way to intake a lot of calories and nutrient-dense foods is to simply blend them into a shake and in fact as shown in this literature review in taking liquid calories seems to impact satiety less than in taking the same amount of calories in solid form therefore for those struggling to intake sufficient calories to gain weight this shake is an excellent and convenient option to do so i personally usually add oats a frozen banana and frozen berries from my main sources of complex carbs and fiber peanut butter as a source of healthy fat whey protein powder as the main protein source dairy milk for the extra calories and protein and some cinnamon for taste and its positive effects on insulin sensitivity blend it all up and this will by far be the easiest and most affordable way to make a big dent in your daily calorie intake without having to resort to eating junk for the next meal something like the following would be a great option as it contains adequate protein and sufficient carbs which will help fuel your workout later on it's just a simple combination of baked chicken white rice boiled lentils and cooked zucchini with various seasonings and light sauces added and one of the great things about this meal is the varied amino acid profile of the foods for example lentils on their own are a great source of protein however they do lack in two important amino acids but the good thing about pairing it with rice is that grains are particularly high in these two amino acids that lentils lack meaning that they complement each other well when eaten together which is especially beneficial if you're vegetarian or vegan and can't have the chicken in this meal [Music] as a midday snack one great option is almonds or any form of nuts they're not only a great nutrient dense source of healthy fats and fiber but also provide a variety of other important micronutrients and minerals just be cautious of your serving size and not to overeat them as they are very calorie dense so measuring out your portions would definitely be recommended and i'll leave a link to a scale i personally use in the description box down below although this food combination may be a little weird for some of you it's a great option as a go-to pre-workout meal this is because multiple studies have indicated that ingesting protein and carbohydrates pre-exercise produces significantly greater levels of muscle protein synthesis with high glycemic carbs such as rice cakes likely being the better option for performance but regardless of what food you do choose to include in this meal ingesting some form of protein and adequate carbohydrates is ideal to enable your body to perform at its best during your workout in addition although it may be of little significance one recent study did show that ingesting whole eggs produce 42 greater levels of muscle protein synthesis when compared to ingesting the same amount of protein in egg whites alone therefore pairing your egg whites with whole eggs as done here may be more beneficial for this reason and finally as for your post-workout meal to finish off the day this meal is a great option and is a combination of baked salmon baked white sweet potato and a large stir-fry veggies the salmon provides not only sufficient protein but also the all-important omega-3 fatty acids dha and epa which have actually been recently shown in a 2018 literature review to possibly help with anabolic signaling and muscle repair and growth the sweet potato serves to replenish any glycogen that was depleted during your workout and the stir fry veggies is just what i personally find to be the easiest way to increase your micronutrient and overall vegetable intake for the day which does likely play a role in muscle recovery and performance but is something i'll cover in another video so that's pretty much what a full day of eating for muscle growth could look like for you and here it is all written out for anyone who's interested hopefully this provides you with some insight as to how to approach and optimize your diet when it comes to building muscle the key really is to not only incorporate foods you personally enjoy but also foods that are simple and easy to make as that's exactly what will enable you to stick with it in the long run thanks so much for watching everyone nutrition really is the biggest factor when it comes to transforming your body and it's honestly why so many people fail to progress despite putting in the effort in the gym but if you're looking for a complete evidence-based

    "published_at": "2025-01-05T14:00:11Z",
    "transcript": "if you want to build every major muscle with just six exercises full body workouts are the way to go they not only boost growth but new research suggests they might also enhance fat loss by activating more total muscle per workout 5 years ago I shared a full body workout plan but since then new research and hands-on experience have shown me how to make it even better today I'm bringing you the upgraded version a full week of training packed into one video the plan includes three workouts per week with six key exercises in each session I'll walk you through all three workouts breaking down each exercise with sides back tips and the best part you can try this entire routine for free on my brand new app but more on that later let's dive into workout one so to kickoff workout one will Target the upper chest with the incline dumbbell press for three sets of 8 to 12 reps why start here most people's upper chest is underdeveloped compared to other areas yet it plays a major role in creating a fuller more balanced chest and the incline dumbbell press does doesn't just hit the upper chest it's one of the best allaround chest builders in fact a 2020 study found that incline pressing led to similar mid chest growth as fat Bening but was significantly better for the upper chest but before jumping in do a quick warmup to activate your muscles and protect your joints start with one light set for 8 to 10 reps then increase the weight for 3 to five reps and then do this one more time with a heavy weight for one to two reps this helps you ease into the movement without draining your energy but you also want to make sure that you get the bench angle right this can make or break the exercise and it depends on your chest structure lay on a flat bench and place your phone between your pecs if your phone angles down you've got a steep sternal in this case a flat bench acts more like a decline press so you'll need a steeper incline to hit your upper chest properly but if your phone stays relatively flat you've got a flat sternum like me in this case a flat bench works as intended and a slight incline just one or two notches up is all you need anything past that and you'll likely just feel it more in your shoulders and finally to optimize your form tuck your elbows into an arrow shape on the way down and press the dumbbells up and back towards your collar bone this lines up the tension perfectly with your upper chest fibers next up we're moving to the lower body with squats for three sets of 6 to eight reps follow the same warm-up protocol we use for the incline dumo press to now get your leg muscles ready now the barbell squat has been getting some hate online recently with people claiming that it's not optimal but in a full body workout you want exercises that give you the most bang for your buck and squats do just that research shows they not only grow your glutes as effectively as glute Focus exercises like hip thrust they also strengthen and grow the quads adductors and even your lower back it's essentially four exercises in one which is why it clearly deserves a spot in this routine that said not everyone's body is built to squat the same way take Alex here he has short femurs and great ankle Mobility making him a natural born squatter he can stay almost perfectly upright and squat deep without losing balance now compare that to Max who has longer femur and less ankle Mobility to stay balanced Max has to push his hips back and lean forward more and he can't get quite as deep without rounding his lower back both squat forms are correct but they will emphasize slightly different muscles so if you're like Max and you struggle to squat deep try elevating your heels onto plates this simple adjustment will allow you to stay more upright shifting more of the focus to your quads which is perfect since we'll be hitting the glutes harder later on in the week next we're focusing on the mid and upper back muscles with a dumbbell chest supported Row for three sets of 8 to 12 reps this time you'll only need one to two quick warm-up sets since your upper body should already be fairly warmed up to set this exercise up adjust an incline bench to 45\u00b0 and lay chest down on it with your legs slightly bent and feet firmly planted on the floor now the key to targeting your mid and upper back is to keep your elbows angled out in Arrow shape as you pull at the top of each rep squeeze your shoulder blades together as hard as you can then let them fully open up at the bottom to stretch your back muscles but be careful your biceps might try to take over the movement especially if your back is weaker or you're just using too much weight from the side if your forearms Bend upwards then your biceps are taken over so instead keep your forearms straight up and down and focused on lifting The Weight by squeezing your back muscles together lastly here's a bonus technique to squeeze out extra growth most back exercises including this one are hardest at the top that means when you can't do any more full reps you still got gas in the tank for partial reps at the bottom which research suggests is actually the more important part for growth because the back muscles are stretched so once you've hit failure on your last set try to get at least three to five more half reps in that bottom position we'll apply this strategy to the last set of all back exercises in this routine next we're heading back to the lower body to Target the hamstrings which are actually a group of four muscles but here's the interesting part one of these muscles only crosses the knee so its primary role is to flex your knee like in a leg curl but the three other muscles cross both the knee and the hips meaning they also help extend your hips like during deadlifts so to fully develop your hamstrings you need both a leg curl movement and a deadlift type movement in your workout plan today we're going to focus on the leg cro now if your gy gives you the option between seated and line leg curls here's what you should know a well executed study by mayo and colleagues found that seated leg curls led to significantly greater hamstring growth compared to Lion leg curls and this is likely because the seated position stretches the hamstrings more than the lion version a stretch that research Su justest is a powerful driver of muscle growth so if I had to pick one I'd go with seated light curls but if you only have access to a line leg curl like me or you simply prefer it then it's still a fantastic option for building your hamstrings But whichever version you do here's a critical form tip many people feel their calves working more than their hamstrings during leg curls and this happens because the first 15\u00b0 of a leg curl actually heavily involve the Cals so to fix this avoid fully straightening your legs at the start of each rep stop slightly short so your knees remain slightly bent before starting the next rep all right so we're down to the final two exercises of the workout so far we focused mostly on compound movements that Target m multiple muscle groups at once but to fully round out your development we need to address two key areas that compound lifts often neglect the biceps and triceps for example while rows do involve the biceps to some extent back exercises biomechanically favor the other arm muscles that could break Alis and break your radialis in fact a study comparing dumbbell rows to bicep curls found that curls led to double the biceps growth as for the triceps wild chest presses are excellent for building the triceps research show they primarily grow the lateral head of the muscle whereas the long head the biggest part of the triceps barely grows at all because it's placed in a mechanically disadvantaged position it's instead been shown to grow the most from tricep exercises where the arm is placed overhead so to finish off this full body workout you have two options if you're using dumbbells perform a super set of line incline dumbbell curls for the biceps then go right into dumbbell overhead extensions shortly after repeat that for a total of three times if you're using cables you can do behind the body cable curls superet with overhead rope extensions both superp sets use exercises that provide a deep stretch which as you learned earlier may be a powerful driver of growth now you could just stick to the six exercises in workout a and do that three times a week but adding variety throughout the week has some big advantages research shows that using different exercises to Target the same muscle often leads to more balanced growth it's also easier on your joints reducing the risk of overuse injury from repeating the same movements and perhaps most importantly exercise variety has been shown to keep you more motivated and consistent with your routine and that is why we're switching things up for your second workout of the week workout B the new exercises will build on what we started in workout a while still keeping the program simple and effective first up we're hitting the chest again but this time focusing on the mid and lower chest with the barbell bench press for three sets of four to six reps now we used to think think that lower reps were only for building strength 6 to 12 reps were ideal for growth and higher reps were best for endurance but research has now shown that all of these rep ranges can lead to similar muscle growth as long as you're pushing hard so why go with lower reps here well heavier weight in the lower rep range not only builds muscle but also comes with the added bonus of boosting strength and for the bench press going heavy can be a lot of fun especially if you have a spotter to keep things safe that said if heavy benching bothers your shoulders no worries you can lighten the load and import higher reps or just swap it out with a flat dumbbell press which tends to be easier on the joints next up we're working the hamstrings with Romanian deadlift for three sets of 68 reps so back in workout a we focused on one function of the hamstrings knee flexion which has also been shown to activate the lower part of the hamstrings more Romania deadlifts however focus on the other main function hip extension this shift also seems to activate the upper hamstrings more making it the perfect combo for overall development but with this exercise proper technique is key to avoid just overworking your lower back start with a shoulder with stance and grip the bar just outside your knees brace your core and then imagine a band around your hips pulling your back this will naturally bend your torso towards the floor keep your knees relatively straight and let the bar slide along your thighs as you continue pushing your hips back but once your hips can't push back any further stop going any lower just rounds your lower back but this end point is going to vary for everyone if you have longer arms you're going to be able to get closer to the floor but with shorter arms you might St just past your knees both are perfectly fine so don't force it and on the way up drive your hips forward then repeat for the next rep next up lap pull Downs for three sets of 8 to 12 reps despite the name lap pull Downs don't actually work your lats very well the wi your bar forces your elbows to flare out engaging more of your upper and outer back muscles which is perfectly fine so don't be worried if you can't feel your lats that much as we'll be focusing on the more in workout seat but for here use a fairly wide grip Lean Back slightly and pull the bar towards your upper chest and lastly don't forget about the technique from workout 8 on your last set do as many full reps as you can and then drop to at least three to five half reps in that stretch position next up we're back to the lower body to Target the glutes with three sets of Walkin lunges aiming for about 6 to 10 reps per leg now the secret to making this exercise glute focus is all on the setup take a wide step forward keep your knee directly over your foot and lean your torso forward slightly while keeping your back straight this creates a deeper stretch in your glutes switch legs with each step and focus on controlling The Descent your back knee should hover just above the ground at the bottom of each rep finish up workout B we've got another isolation exercise superet this time with the side delts and abs so for the side delts I'd recommend behind the body cable lateral raises with the cable set up 3 to 4 notches up from the bottom this not only gives your side delts a deep stretch but it challenges them a bit more in that stretch position after you're done we'll immediately go into an ab exercise reverse crunches now while your abs help stabilize your body in many of your compound exercises training them directly can help build them up just like any other muscle which visibly can make them pop more reverse crunches are a great choice here because they challenge your abs a little bit more when they're stretched lay on a bench or on a mat and bend your legs to 90\u00b0 then raise your hips by moving your knees towards your chest focusing on curling your pelvis even if it's just lifting your tailbone go up as far as you can and then slowly control the way down and repeat the super set for a total of three times okay so that wraps Out Workout bit but if you're wondering how to track all the exercises or remember the form for each move let me show you something that I've been personally using to make things way easier this is built with science plus my new app and it's designed to do all the heavy lifting for you set the actual weights of course it's super simple guys just click on the exercise and you've got the porn video right there and you can even swap exercises if you're missing equipment or have an injury and the app will make sure you're still working the right muscles plus it tracks your sets and even starts coaching you after the first week it's just like having me with you at the gym and you can try two weeks of it completely free at builtwith science.com but I'll talk more about that at the end of the video for now let's move on to the final workout of the week workout C first up we have the C dumbbell shoulder press for three sets of 88 to 12 reps which will mainly Target the front part of your shoulders I personally prefer dumbbells over barbell for this because they're easier on the joints plus by setting the bench one to two notches down from fully upright you'll reduce the demand on your shoulder Mobility while still getting the most of the exercise lastly as you press to maximize shoulder activation let your elbows flare out to the sides but as you lower the dumbbells tuck them slightly in front of your body okay so far we've emphasized almost every every area of the back in the previous workouts but there's one major part left the lats this is where the dumbbell row comes in with three sets of 8 to 12 reps start by placing your same side hand and knee on a bench for support while planting your other leg far out for stability next the key to activating your lats is to keep your elbow tight to your side as you rope and focus on driving your elbow back towards your hips in a sweeping arcing motion almost like you're sweeping the floor with the weight but to prevent your biceps from taking over make sure your forearm stays vertical rather than curling the weight as you pull and lastly as you row avoid rotating your torso to make the movement easier keep your back flat pull until your elbow reaches your torso and then control the weight back down and of course don't forget on your last set push past failure by doing as many half reps as you can in that bottom position next up our first lower body exercise three sets of 10 to 15 reps of hip thrusts now hip thrust have been shown to grow the glutes just as much as squats and in one study even led to almost double the glute growth when it was added to an existing leg workout so if you're somebody who sits most of the day then this exercise is a must to prevent the dreaded flat butt syndrome ew but you going to do it right and one big mistake is arching your back which puts pressure on your lower back instead of the glutes to fix this brace your core as if someone's about to punch your stomach then squeeze your glutes hard think about holding the $100 bill between your cheeks don't let me steal it at the top your back should be flat and your glutes should be burning but if I'm being honest guys sometimes I just don't feel like going through all the effort to set up the hip thrust so an effective swap our dumbbell step UPS on a bench or platform but just like we did with walking lunges and workout B Lean Forward slightly to Target the glutes more and Alternate your legs each step so to finish off the quads for the week we're doing three sets of 10 to 15 reps of leg extensions now while pressing movements like squats are great for overall quad growth research suggests they only really grow just three of the four quad muscles the fourth muscle the rectus for morus because of its unique Anatomy is instead better grown with leg extensions hence why I've added them to this routine but if you want even more growth from this exercise then if your machine lets you lean back as you perform it this stretches the rectus for moris and it's been shown to significantly boost growth compared to the normal version next up we're working the chest with three sets of 10 to 15 set of flies to complement the pressing we've done earlier in the week now my preferred setup here is a seated cable fly with a pad or foam roller between my back and the bench to create a deeper stretch in the chest another option here is the pec deck but the downside is it tends to be much harder in the squeeze so to make up for it just like we did with the back exercises throughout the week at the end of your very last set do as many half reps as you can in that all important stretch position all right to finish off the week we've got our final isolation superpet starting with calf raises so your calves are made up of two muscles and we used to think seated calf raises Target one better while standing hits the other but when researchers actually tested this they found something surprising seated calf freees do grow that one muscle well but standing calf reees grow it just as much while also growing the other calf muscle significantly more so to get more bank for your buck standing calf raises are the way to go and you can do this on the leg press machine Smith machine or single leg with a dumbbell on any platform anything where your leg stay straight but here's the key guys pause at the bottom of each rep for deep stretch for calves this stretch is one of the most important drivers of growth once you're done move straight into reverse cable flies to Target the rear delts a part of a shoulder that often gets overlooked set the cable slightly above shoulder height grab the left cable with your right hand and the right cable with your left hand and sweep your arms outward and let your arm cross over at the start for a deeper stretch in the rear delts repeat this super set for a total of three sets to wrap up your week of training all right so here's the full plan and if you're a member of my new app built with science plus just open up the camera on your phone and scan this QR code

    "title": "Protein Powder: How to Best Use It For Muscle Growth (4 Things You Need to Know)",
    "published_at": "2018-09-16T15:41:42Z",
    "transcript": "protein powder is by far the most widely consumed supplement with in the fitness industry and for good reason it's convenient contains high quality protein and it's a lot more cost efficient when compared to other protein sources and not only that but it's also one of the few supplements that's heavily backed by research in terms of its safety muscle building properties and several other benefits however despite the popularity of protein powder most people are often left clueless when it comes to how to choose the best type of protein and even more so when it comes to how to best use it to build muscle and unfortunately asking the sales guy at your local supplement store will likely just leave you even more confused or misinformed than you were to begin with but luckily in this video I'll clear everything up for you and show you exactly how to maximize the effectiveness of protein powder by looking at the following points when it comes to picking a protein powder the sheer amount of options can definitely be overwhelming but to keep it simple research indicates that when compared to other forms of protein powder whey and casein have the highest essential amino acid content and are the best at stimulating muscle protein synthesis meaning that they're going to be your best options now as for the difference between whey and casein and which one is better it mainly has to do with their digestive properties whey is a faster digesting protein that rapidly spikes protein synthesis for a short period of time whereas casein is a slower digesting protein that gradually increases protein synthesis over a longer period of time but generally I'd advise sticking with way over casing since it has a slightly higher leucine content and because research such as this 2015 literature review on the topic tends to favor way over casein when it comes to elevating protein synthesis and promoting gains in muscle mass and more specifically and recommends sticking to whey isolate since it's a purist form of whey protein and contains the least lactose if that's an issue for you however with that being said I so see you later on in this video if you're seeking to maximize your results then casein does have a unique potential application and maybe something you still want to consider in addition to way and for vegans who can't intake whey or casein although research shows that plant protein powders don't stimulate muscle protein synthesis as well as whey or casein does research also shows that this can be potentially compensated by ingesting a greater amount of plant protein or simply ensuring you in take adequate amino acids through various food sources which is just something for you to keep in mind although most people are firm believers that protein shakes are meant to be taken right after your workout research actually doesn't fully support this idea for example as shown in this 2013 literature review on the topic ingesting protein immediately post-workout doesn't seem to be very important if you've already had a pre-workout meal with sufficient protein multiple other studies support this idea by emphasizing that this one-hour post-workout anabolic window may only apply to fasted training where there's no pre ingestion of protein whereas if you've ingested protein some time before your workout it essentially renders the timing of your post-workout shake as useless which just means that a post-workout shake isn't as important as we thought it was if you're in a fed state and in fact if you haven't had any protein before your workout research even suggests that ingesting your shake before your workout is more beneficial than after for example this study from the American Journal of physiology showed that when subjects in a fasted State ingested protein before their workout they experience significantly higher muscle protein synthesis when compared to subjects who ingested their protein immediately after their workout therefore when it comes to the timing of your protein shake I'd suggest a following if you've ingested protein at some point before your workout a post-workout shake doesn't seem to be absolutely necessary meaning you can have your shake at any time during the day to simply boost your daily protein intake however since a post-workout shake is convenient for most people it's fast digesting and it helps you spread out your protein intake throughout the day it may still very well be the ideal for you to take it just know that it's not urgent on the other hand if you haven't eaten any protein prior to your workout then just in your shake shortly before your workout is likely the best option to maximize protein synthesis and lastly if you're planning on working out in a fasted state then adjusting your shake within an hour so after your workout seems to be ideal in addition to this as mentioned earlier to maximize your results you might also want to consider ingesting casein protein powders shortly before bed this is because multiple recent studies have found that in taking at least 40 grams of a slow digesting protein before bed helps improve overnight muscle protein synthesis which theoretically leads to better muscle recovery and growth over time and since casein is a slow digesting protein that makes in taking this 40 grams of protein shortly before bed more convenient it might be something you want to incorporate in addition to your whey protein as for how much protein to take at a time multiple studies have arrived at the general consensus that 20 to 25 grams of a high-quality protein like whey is sufficient for maximizing muscle protein synthesis and is therefore a good minimum you'd want to aim for when taking it it's also worth noting though that having more than this might provide a small additional benefit with one recent 2016 paper concluding that in taking 40 grams of whey protein stimulated muscle protein synthesis to a greater extent than a 20 gram dose regardless of the subjects body weight and lean body mass but generally it seems as sticking to a dose of anywhere between 20 grams to 40 grams is likely your best bet now as for how often to take protein this just ultimately depends on your own total daily protein requirements you want to prioritize and taking your protein from food sources since they provide a variety of other amino acids and nutrients and then use protein powders to supplement this if needed for example we know that sticking to a protein intake of roughly 0.732 1 grams per pound of body weight is ideal so if a 170 pound individual requires 1 seventy grams of protein a day and can comfortably intake 130 grams of protein from real food sources then they could take 140 grams scoop of protein daily regardless of if they worked out and off to help them reach their daily goal and if you needed to take more than this to reach your goal that's perfectly fine whatever helps you hit your daily protein target conveniently and consistently is what will be ideal to keep it simple multiple studies have shown that although Co ingesting protein powder with additional carbs and/or fat does slow down digestion it does not increase nor decrease muscle protein synthesis simply meaning that you can feel free to take your protein with whatever you prefer whether that be milk water or something else however in my opinion if you're focusing on gaining weight then it can be helpful to take your protein with dairy milk for the additional 100 to 200 calories and the extra protein it provides whereas if you're focusing on losing fat it might be best to take with something like almond milk or water which just helps you conveniently save an extra couple hundred calories or so so to sum the video up here are the key takeaways one thing I want you to keep in mind though is that as with all supplements protein powder is not anything magical and is by no means necessary to see results however if you struggle to hit your daily protein intake through food alone then this is where it becomes useful and something for you to consider thanks so much for watching everyone I

    "title": "How To Diet To Lose Fat FOR GOOD (4 Phases)",
    "published_at": "2020-07-19T15:09:05Z",
    "transcript": "if you're watching this video then chances are you've attempted to diet of your own in the past and you likely saw some success with it maybe lost a few pounds or maybe lost a ton of weight but eventually you reached a point where you just got stuck despite working out and dieting as hard as ever then you got frustrated and ended up regaining even more weight than you initially lost then you likely attempted to diet again afterwards to get rid of that regained weight but this time even when you put in the same effort you just can't seem to get as lean and everything just seems so much harder i've seen this happen time and time again and i've personally been through this series of yoyo dieting myself as well because the truth is in the short term just about everything works as long as you're in a calorie deficit with your diet the long term however is where most people fail in fact there exists eight to twelve week study showing successful weight loss with pretty much every dieting approach out there but when you look at long-term research only about 10 to 20 of those individuals are able to keep that weight off in the long run which is due to the fact that most people have been taught to use approaches that set themselves up for failure in the long run by negatively affecting their bodies both physiologically and psychologically with diets that leave them in a position where it's now much harder to strip off that excess fat and to help explain the science behind how exactly this happens here is dr eric trexler pro bodybuilder and phd researcher who has done a ton of work within this field so yo-yo dieting is something a lot of people experience you know repeated cycles of dieting and regaining the weight that they lost and one of the reasons it's problematic is because you know with metabolic adaptation we start losing fat our body adapts to that in certain ways none of them are terrible but they're things that we have to plan for you know and so people will lose weight and they'll start running into a little bit of friction they might notice that their energy expenditure is lower than it used to be they're much hungrier than they used to be you know there might be some hormonal changes depending on how much weight they've lost and how lean they've gotten and for a lot of people they run into enough friction that they decide they no longer wish to be dieting you know so they'll lose some fat and say i don't think i really want to continue with the fat loss or they're simply unable to continue because it's become so uh so unpleasant and so you know sometimes people will say this i just can't keep up with this because i don't like how low my calories are i don't like how hungry i am i don't like how lethargic i'm feeling and they might go off the diet start overeating and because they have so much hunger and you know relatively low energy expenditure the weight gain they experience can be fairly rapid and so what's unfortunate about that is we have a lot of hunger toward the end of a diet some of that is a result of just having low chloric intake some of that's related to having less fat storage than we used to but some of it is related to the loss of lean mass which occurs during a diet and what happens is if we regain all of our fat from a diet during this yo-yo dieting process in many cases we regain the fat more quickly than we could possibly regain the lean mass and if we find ourselves in a position where we're back at our normal starting body weight but we have less lean mass than when we started we haven't restored all the lean mass that we lost we'll find that some of that hunger from the diet persists even though we've regained all the weight and so that's where you can start to see not only do people go back to the starting line after a relatively unsuccessful dieting attempt but they can actually shift that starting line back a little bit now as eric alluded to this is exactly how restrictive diets leave you in a worse place every time you attempt to die down and literally just sets you up for failure in the long run by making it harder and harder for you to strip off that fat for good so this sounds like you and you're at a point where you've been chronically undereating doing a ton of cardio binging every now and then and basically just in a cycle of yo-yo dieting then you need to realize that weight loss should not be your priority right now your body isn't ready physiologically nor psychologically remember we're talking about lifetime results here not just some 12-week weight loss program so we need to first get your body recovered back to a point where we're now ready to start cutting calories and stimulating fat loss the right way and to do so we want to first use something called the recovery phase so with this phase we have three major goals one we want to restore the lean muscle mass that you lost as this will not only help slightly boost your metabolic rate but muscle loss also seems to be directly correlated to your hunger levels where the more muscle and overall lean mass you lose the hungrier your body tends to be we don't actually know physiologically why this is but nonetheless it's why we need to prioritize lean mass restoration before beginning the diet again two to restore any hormonal imbalances related to hunger fatigue and just overall feeling like crap as a result of your previous diet and three to just get you in a better mindset with regards to your relationship to food and your weight we need to get you in a state where you're actually excited and truly ready to start a diet again before we do so now to accomplish this all you're going to do is simply bump up your calories to whatever your maintenance calories currently are or even slightly above this while also cutting back on your cardio if you're currently doing quite a bit of it and to get a rough estimate of what maintenance may be for you you can simply multiply your body weight in pounds by 14 to 15. stick to that then monitor your calorie intake and body weight over the next few weeks and adjust accordingly to the point where you're now maintaining your current weight with a certain calorie intake but do be comfortable with your body weight slowly creeping up just a little bit throughout the process although this may sound counterintuitive what a lot of you may notice by doing this is that these extra calories are just what your body needed and you're now so much more energized you're moving more you're performing better in the gym you're regaining your loss muscle and strength you're not completely wrecked after your workouts you're sleeping better and you just feel better throughout the day now as for how long you should stay in this recovery for here's what eric recommends once we do get into the recovery phase how long typically would it take someone to at least physiologically recover back to a point where they're now ready to go back on the diet it's a good question now assuming that you're no longer in a caloric deficit assuming that you're at a reasonably comfortable body fat level that is sustainable um you know we're usually looking at it at least uh a month or two usually more in the two to four month range to reach full recovery so take your time with this phase guys and think about the long term i really just can't stress this enough when you're ready though phase two is where we can give dieting another shot but this time we need to do it right which means that we need to set up our fat loss phase in a way that minimizes muscle loss and minimizes the metabolic adaptation that we typically experience throughout our diet and as outlined in eric's research papers there are a few ways that we can do this first you need to avoid using a very aggressive calorie deficit as research has shown that just a moderate deficit that enables you to lose weight at a rate of about 0.7 percent of your body weight per week is ideal to maximize fat loss while minimizing metabolic adaptations and muscle loss for most people this equates to roughly only a 15 to 25 calorie deficit but just keep an eye on how your body weight progresses throughout the weeks and adjust accordingly next we want to use an approach that's called intermittent dieting i have covered this in a past video but essentially after every six to eight weeks or so of dieting you want to break this up with what's called a diet break where you eat at maintenance calories for about a week or two now although research regarding this is still very preliminary it does suggest that diet breaks may help reverse some of the metabolic adaptations you experience from release of dieting potentially minimize the metabolic adaptations going forward and it just prepares you for your next phase of dieting not to mention that it can also help with better adherence over the course of your diet in fact i would even recommend that after you lose a considerable amount of weight take a break from dieting altogether for a little while and just focus on maintaining that current weight remember it's about lifelong results here so don't be afraid to take it slow and lastly you need to ensure that you're eating a high protein diet along with high volume low calorie filling foods the sufficient protein will not only help you burn more calories by just metabolizing it but will also help keep you full and maintain or even build muscle mass as you die down an opting for satiating foods that provide the most bang for your buck in terms of calories will just again help you stay full and satisfied even when your calories do drop quite low in your diet which in turn will minimize the risk of you overeating and binging when things do get tough and i do have a past video on what foods i'd recommend for this reason and i'll link that in the description box down below so basically you apply these three steps until you successfully lean down to the level body fat that you're satisfied with then once you do so it's time to transition to phase three now this phase is where most people screw everything up because just like as i explained earlier as you die down your body adapts and gradually slows down its metabolism to try to fight back we've minimized this in our dieting plan but nonetheless there will still be some metabolic adaptation present which just means that now your maintenance calories will be lower than they were in the beginning not to mention that by the end of your diet you're also usually in a state where you're hungry and fatigued so after phase two if you simply go back to what you're eating at in the beginning of your diet while also cutting down your activity and maybe even having a cheat day or two to celebrate the end of your diet you're going to be overeating considerably and can gain a ton of weight in a short amount of time especially since your body at this point is primed to favor fat gain which can then lead us to the same problem that we're at in the very beginning of all this so instead what we want to do here is simply find a way that you can maintain your weight loss in a sustainable way without feeling like you're starving yourself or doing an excessive amount of cardio and one option to do so is with something called a reverse diet where immediately after your diet you bump up your calories back up to your new lower maintenance levels to just get out of the diet and phase then from here you basically experiment with very slowly adding calories back into your diet while keeping a close eye on your weight although the effect this has does seem to vary individually oftentimes what happens is even though you're adding more and more calories back into your diet your body count interacts this by essentially getting out of that dieting mindset and tends to start burning more calories through subconscious increases in daily activity or need to slowly bump up your metabolism so by the end of this process you'll still have successfully kept off most or all of the fat that you lost you'll feel more energized and stronger in the gym and you'll be eating considerably more calories than you were after you finish your diet which should eventually be similar or close to the maintenance calories that you started out your diet at however keep in mind that again this does vary individually as people respond to increases in calorie intake differently for instance in one over feeding study researchers brought 16 normal weight subjects into a lab for eight weeks and served them in excess of a thousand calories each day based on the math everyone should have gained 16 pounds in eight weeks however in reality the subjects gained anywhere from under a pound to up to about nine pounds and the discrepancy and variation here between subjects was mainly due to a difference in meat meaning that some subjects responded much better to the excess calories by in turn burning more calories subconsciously through fidgeting postural adjustments and other subtle movements throughout the day whereas others just didn't respond as well here's what eric recommends so with regards to the reverse dining phase after a successful dieting phase to let's say somewhere around 10 body fat so not you know physique competitor completely shredded but you know six pack visible overall what do you typically see as the general response to reverse dieting and then also on that now how much do you think that most individuals in this position can increase their calories by while still more or less maintaining their current level of venus good question so typical response is really hard to give a singular kind of description of because what you find in the literature is the magnitude of metabolic adaptation during weight loss is quite variable and the magnitude of responses to over feeding is quite variable so with reverse dieting what we're trying to do is just kind of slowly increase calories to see if we can increase our energy expenditure kind of on a similar timeline so if we're kind of fueling a little bit of recovery and getting our energy expenditure back toward a normal level the idea is to nudge that process along with slow increases in caloric intake so that we're not going to have a huge caloric surplus at any given time that's going to cause any rapid weight gain for most people reverse dieting we might be able to increase caloric intake by 100 calories a couple hundred calories for some people you know higher than a couple hundred maybe a few hundred or so uh you do see these rare instances where people push it really really high but they are pretty infrequent so basically what the reverse diet process does is let's say your old maintenance was here your new maintenance after your diet is here and your dieting calories are here right so immediately after you finish your diet you bump up to your new maintenance which is lower than your old and then with reverse dieting you might be able to increase this just a little bit so you're working with more calories and are able to sustain your current level of leanness in a much more sustainable way correct correct and you might not be able to push it all the way up to where your old maintenance was because you know you still have less body mass than you used to um but you can start reducing that adaptive gap in energy expenditure start nudging that back up toward normal and you can build a little bit of extra space into the diet that makes it a little bit more sustainable in terms of caloric intake simply meaning that the response to this reverse dieting phase will vary for everyone so experiment with it and keep in mind that the main goal is to get you to a point where you feel great your body weight hasn't increased by much or at all and you're maintaining your new physique with a sustainable and satisfying amount of calories as well as a manageable amount of cardio and then from here it really is up to you where you want to go next you could either maintain your new physique with relative ease with your new higher calorie intake or you could simply choose to now focus more so on muscle growth if you're seeking to add some more size to your frame in which case you'd simply start eating at a calorie surplus to slowly gain muscle over time and then transition back to phase two of this plan whenever you're ready to start leaning down some more now although this whole process may seem very complex and you may be feeling as if there's no hope for you just realize that that simply is not true i'm not gonna lie it will take time but by following these four phases remaining patient and combining this with a solid training and nutrition plan then you can and you will be able to strip off that fat for good on that note though guys for those who do need that extra bit of help my step-by-step programs have been designed to guide you through each of these phases in detail it comes fully equipped with the software that enables you to actually know exactly what your metabolism is at and how it's changing week after week as you strip off that and lose weight so you can easily break through any plateau that you encounter along the way and lean down in the most efficient way possible just like several of our built with science members have done with their programs so to get started today just head on over to buildwithscience.com and take the analysis quiz to discover what program will be best for you and the state that your specific body is currently in also a big thank you to eric trexler here for his help with the video you can give him a follow at

    "title": "The #1 Workout That BLEW UP My Shoulders (3 Exercises)",
    "published_at": "2023-11-19T14:00:28Z",
    "transcript": "today I want to share the one workout that blew up my shoulders my Filipino genetics blessed me with a one to1 shoulder to waist ratio and narrow clavicles that made me look frail and weak but I refused to let my genetics Define me this past year my shoulders blew up they're wider broader and Fuller than they've ever been I didn't use any of this either I followed a simple science-based workout that's worked better than anything I've tried in the past there's only three exercises but proper form is crucial so pay attention first up the side delts this is the part of the shoulders that broadens your frame and is where I put most of my effort now in the past I'd always just do your typical dumbbell lateral raises but there's an exciting new area of research called long muscle length training that suggests this may not be ideal for growth This research has shown muscles tend to grow better if they're challenged in the stretch position for example one study published just this year found that preacher curls which challenge the biceps the most right around here when they're almost fully stretched grew the the biceps 150% more than inclin dumbbell curls which are instead hardest right around here when the biceps aren't stretched as much similar finds have been shown in the triceps hamstrings and quads as well so although the shoulders have yet to be tested it seems probable they'd also benefit from this but the thing about dumbbell lateral raises is they're easiest at the bottom when the Delta is fully stretched and hardest at the top when the Delta is fully contracted the opposite of what we want so my main exercise was instead behind the body cable lateral raises where I stand in front and to the side so my side Delta is now stretched behind me but simply stretching your delt isn't enough you need to make sure the cable is at the right height so it challenges your delt the most when it's stretched if the cable set at the very bottom the exercise will challenge your delts closer to the end whereas if you bump it up by two or three notches the exercise will now challenge your delts more at the beginning when they're stretched now if you don't have access to cables dumbbell lateral raises are still a great option and are probably complimentary to this exercise and you can implement the stretch research with them by first doing as many full reps as you can and then finishing off your set with partials at the bottom to work your delts more in that stretch position that said there is one more tip I applied to my side Del training that made all the difference it has to do with how much weight I used usually whenever I do lateral raises and tried to increase the weight my form would get floppy and I'd start feeling it all in my traps but a recent 2022 study helped provide a solution to this one of our buillt with science researchers Daniel plin actually ran the study so I'll let him share the results we took trained individuals and we wanted to answer the question of if you increase in reps or you increase in load will there be differences in muscle size so one group the load group each time they trained they tried to increase in the amount of weight while the Reps group stayed at the same weight each session but tried to to increasing reps so at the start of the study the Reps group was doing 10 reps per set and by the end of the study after the 8 weeks they were doing between 16 and 20 reps what we found was from measuring multiple thigh and cap muscles is that this might be surprising but there was virtually no differences between groups so it seems like there's a good amount of flexibility and what you can choose for your progression so it could be reps and it could be load so applied This research by sticking to the same weight every week and trying to do just a couple more reps than last time I'd start around 10 reps per set and only once I was able to do at least 15 to 20 Reps for set with good form did I increase the weight so the side delts create width but the rear delt helped balance out the shoulder and give it that 3D look but it's by far the most underdeveloped part of most people's shoulders and that was no exception my rear delts have always been trashed I'd spam them with dumbbell reverse splies in the reverse PC deck and couldn't figure out why they just wouldn't grow well here's what so we know that muscles are best grown if the arm path of the exercise matches the direction of the muscle fibers in the case of the rear delts they run at about a 45\u00b0 angle this is why some people can end up building massive rear delts without even trying they perform any of their rows with this 45\u00b0 arm angle and end up growing their rear delts instead of other parts of their back but this was never the case for me so I needed an exercise that isolated my rear delts really well what I found the most success with was using this 45\u00b0 arm angle during the reverse cable flat but with a few steps back from the cable to make it more difficult near the beginning of the exercise when the rear delts are more stretched but you can apply this to the reverse pec deck as well move the seat up high and instead of sitting right up against the pad scoot your butt back and lean your chest into the pth this way your arm angle will now line up better with the rear delts and if you don't have access to cable or machines you can do an incline dumbbell row with your arms kept in that 45\u00b0 angle in all these exercises though to prevent your midback muscles from taking over don't squeeze your shoulder blades together push your arms forward to open up your shoulder blades and keep them that way as you pull your elbows back now I'm going to share the sets and Reps for each exercise at the end of the video but for now let's move on to the last exercise lastly the front belts so this is usually the most developed part of people's shoulders because it's already worked into directly in many other exercises in fact in studies researchers would count one set of bench press as one set for the chest but also one set for the front delts but it's still a good idea to do at least one exercise to work this area especially since the exercise will show you can help indirectly grow the other parts of your shoulders as well now unfortunately there's no studies that have compared how well different exercises grow the front delts but remember how we said muscles are best grown if the arm path of the exercise matches the direction of the muscles fibers well for the front delts the arm path looks something like this which matches quite well with overhead shoulder presses now in the past I'd always do standing barbell overhead presses but over time they just really started beating up my joints and it was always a struggle to stay balanced so I switched this exercise out for more stable and smoother exercise on my joints the seated dumbbell shoulder press but not the way most people do it let me explain bring your arms up directly to your side with your elbow at a nice \u00b0 angle then without arching your back rotate your hand back as far as you can how far could you go a 2020 study with over 2400 participants found that on average they could only get to about 60\u00b0 but take a look at the dumbbell shoulder press with the bench straight up you need to be able to comfortably get to 90\u00b0 otherwise you'll end up pressing the weight forwards and using other muscles or you just may end up aggravating your shoulder so try to bring the bench back about one to two notches and as you can see now it'll require far less shoulder Mobility once you're set up line up your arm with a front delt fibers by driving your elbows inward slightly with your paws facing it then press the weight over your shoulders and return back to the starting position after each rep so here's the three exercises with the Reps sets Alternatives and how often to perform them you could do this on a workout on its own but i' recommend splitting these exercises up into two to three of your workouts throughout the week now that said research is always evolving I may end up being wrong about all of this in a few years time but I will do my best in keeping you guys updated with the latest science so far though the research is promising and it seems like it's working if you guys want a step-by-step plan that takes care of all the science and guesswork for you so you can build muscle and lose fat as efficiently as possible just take our quiz at builtwith size.com to find the best plan for you and your body I highly recommend giving this video watch next which dives into all the exercises that are known to provide better muscle growth because of the stretch research we talked about earlier thank you so much for watching and I'll see you next time"

    "title": "How Long Should You Diet To Get A Six-Pack? (AVOID THIS MISTAKE!)",
    "published_at": "2021-04-04T15:30:03Z",
    "transcript": "how long does it take to get a six-pack this is one of the questions that i've always wondered when i first started training seriously because for many of us getting a well-defined six-pack is the ultimate goal but the answer to that question is that it depends and it depends on one where you're at right now two how defined and visible you want your six pack to be and three the process that you use to get there because let's face it some work out for years they can never quite achieve it because they're using the wrong approach which is why in this video we'll first calculate how long achieving a six-pack will take for you and then more importantly we'll cover how to best ensure your success throughout those weeks first and foremost anatomically everybody has a six-pack it's just a question of whether it's visible or not abs only become visible once a low enough body fat is achieved to reveal them for men your abs will typically start to become visible at around 15 but at twelve percent is when you start to really see some good definition with your six pack and at ten percent your six pack is clearly visible and well defined and for women i wouldn't recommend a clearly visible six pack as being the ultimate goal but some percentage equivalence to what i covered with males would be around 22 percent 20 percent and 18 now to determine roughly how long it would take you to reach those goal body fat percentages and to reveal your six pack we can use the following formula so take a pen and paper and we'll run through this simple calculation step by step using joe over here as an example i'm going to use pounds in my example but if you use kilograms then just run through the exact same calculations but with kilograms instead first we're going to determine your lean body weight which is simply how much you would weigh if you had absolutely no fat to do so estimate what your current body fat percentage is by looking at the following charts then divide that percentage by 100 and multiply that number by your current body weight the number you get is roughly how much fat that you're currently carrying subtract that number from your current body weight and that number will now be what's known as your lean body weight next pick your goal body fat percentage based on what i said earlier determine how lean and how visible that you want your six pack to be i personally recommend that you be very conservative here because once you reach a certain body fat percentage you can always keep pushing to get lower if you decide to in this example we're going to use 12 as a goal for joe next once you have this divide it by a hundred and we'll then plug everything into the formula like so [Music] run that calculation and the number that you end up with represents roughly what your body weight would be once you achieve your goal body fat percentage and desired six-pack then simply take that number and subtract it by your current body weight the number you get there it represents roughly how much fat you'd have to lose in order to achieve your goal body fat percentage and strip off enough fat for your abs to become visible in this case joe would need to lose around 15 pounds of fat to get to his goal of 12 body fat and reveal his abs and finally based on this number we can determine roughly how long it will take you to lose that amount of fat and the team your six-pack but this is also the step where most people screw everything up because if you tell someone that they need to lose 15 pounds to get their six-pack chances are that they're gonna try to lose that weight as fast as possible in an attempt to attain their six-pack as quickly as possible but what most people don't realize is that there's a limit to how much fat that you can lose every day exceeding this limit will cause more weight to be lost but from muscle not from fat which is the opposite of what we want for instance in one study resistance trained males and females were prescribed to lose weight slowly at a rate of 0.7 percent of their body weight per week or quickly at a rate of 1.4 percent of their body weight per week although it took the slow group three more weeks of dieting both groups lost the same amount of total weight however of the weight that was lost those in the slower weight loss group lost significantly more fat than the fast weight loss group and actually gained a small amount of lean mass compared to a loss of muscle mass in the fast group because of this it's recommended to set a goal of losing an average of 0.7 percent of your current body weight per week in our example joe weighs 170 pounds and needs to lose 15 pounds with the goal of losing 0.7 percent of his current body weight per week this would take him roughly 12 weeks to put this into perspective for you here is one of our build with science members andrew his starting point as you can see was 202 pounds at around 25 body fat using our calculation he'd need to lose about 30 pounds of fat to get down to around 12 body fat to reveal his six-pack assuming that he maintained his existing muscle mass so at our proposed rate of fat loss of losing 0.7 percent of your body weight per week this would on paper take him about 21 weeks to accomplish now it actually took him just shy of 21 weeks to lose 30 pounds of fat and get down to 173 pounds and around 12 body fat with his abs now clearly visible which is just a real lift example to help illustrate the potential accuracy of the formula i just went through do know however that this formula does have its limitations since it won't account for water weight muscle gains and anything else that isn't fat that would affect your before and after weight throughout the process but nonetheless it's still a good way just to get a rough estimate just also keep in mind that throughout this transformation andrew was following his program to the t and remains consistent day after day and week after week and that's exactly what the estimation that you calculated assumes that you're going to be doing so to be realistic you should provide yourself with at least a few weeks of extra time and expect the process to have as various ups and downs in addition to this few weeks of added buffer time to your estimation another thing that you may want to consider is taking periodic breaks from your several weeks of dieting rather than attempting to do it all in one shot this is because the longer you die for the harder it will inevitably become as you lose more and more weight it's likely that increased hunger and fatigue will start to set in making adherence difficult to counteract this research shows that increasing your calories back up to maintenance calories for several days every few weeks or what's now commonly known as a diet break can help to fight off these cravings illustrating the effectiveness of this approach is a brand new study led by researcher jackson pales here he is to provide us a breakdown of the study results and the implications that it may have on the length and approach of your diet so jackson why don't you just give us a really quick breakdown of the study that you ran and then also what it potentially means for the overall approach of our day so we had 60 weight trained athletes come to our lab and they were allocated to one of two groups one group was a continuous dieting group now they dieted for 12 weeks straight continuously then we had another group which was referred to as our intermittent dieting group now they did 12 weeks of dieting in total as well but after every three weeks of dieting we gave them a one week diet break which meant that their total intervention time was actually 15 weeks and during those diet breaks we would increase their calories to maintenance so they weren't losing any weight during that period and we also increased their carbohydrate intake so they were eating a lot more carbohydrate after both groups had completed their 12 weeks of dieting we saw no differences in fat loss or lean mass retention which was surprising to a lot of people we also didn't see any difference in the drop in metabolic rate between the two groups which sort of surprised a lot of people who had been promoting things like diet breaks and refeeds uh for many years but we did see some very interesting things on the flip side what we did see was that in the group who used the diet breaks every three weeks they had lower hunger and less desire to eat than the continuous dieting group another cool finding that we noticed was that twice the number of participants dropped out from the continuous dieting group than they did from the group that was using the diet breaks which gives us the impression that okay perhaps when you're using diet breaks that sort of weight loss regimen is a little bit easier to follow than a weight loss regimen with no breaks whatsoever to support that finding when we analyze the adherence data so how well they were sticking to their calories and their macros we saw that 77 were adherent in the group that was using the diet breaks but only 58 were adherent in the continuous dieting group which again tells us that okay perhaps weight loss and fat loss is a little bit easier to achieve when you're using diet breaks sort of intermittently what can we sort of take away from that to sort of frame um a conclusion if their biggest challenge with weight and fat loss is adhering to their calories or fighting hunger urges then diet breaks perhaps is going to be a really good tool for you to use and it also makes sense that perhaps diet breaks might not be needed early on in the dieting phase because that's when hunger isn't too much of a challenge everyone can sort of stick to their calories quite easily but later on in the diet phase when when you sort of lost a bunch of weight and fat hunger starting to creep in and get a little bit more challenging perhaps that's going to be the better time to use this strategy so if the weight loss is not time sensitive if you're not in a rush then perhaps diet breaks they might make a lot of sense to use in that scenario but if a certain body composition is wanted as fast as possible for example i've got eight weeks until my wedding and i want to be in the best shape as i possibly can perhaps just go with continuous dieting because using diet breaks is probably just going to sort of chew up too much of your of your weight loss time so to put this into perspective for you if let's say you calculated it would take you 12 weeks to get to 10 body fat then you may want to consider interspersing one to two diet breaks towards the tail end of it to help with adherence and hunger levels but you can always make that decision based on how you feel when you get there and lastly just remember that diet breaks are not an excuse to eat anything that you want but rather involves strategically increasing your calories back up to maintenance mainly by increasing your daily carb intake and then continuing to track your intake to make sure that you're staying on track so all in all guys despite everything that i went through with regards to timing please just don't obsess over the exact time that it's gonna take although it's good to have a rough time frame in mind which is what the formula that i went through can help you do focus on the process and the specific steps that you're going to need to take to achieve your goal rather than how long it's going to take those who set goals and focus on the specific things that they will do along the way are the most successful at achieving them which not only applies to attaining a six-pack but to everything in life but if you're currently seeking for more guidance and looking for an all-in-one customized approach that shows you step-by-step exactly how to train and how to eat week after week in order to burn off unwanted fat and build lean muscle just like thousands of our built with science members have done then simply head on over to buildwithscience.com and take our analysis quiz to discover the best approach for you

    "title": "Why You\u2019re Not Losing Fat (4 HIDDEN Mistakes You Don\u2019t Realize You\u2019re Making)",
    "published_at": "2019-06-30T15:53:31Z",
    "transcript": "one of the most common reasons why people give up on their fat loss journey is simply because they aren't seen any progress despite putting in the work and doing everything right and I don't blame them believe me if I didn't know any better and wasn't seeing the results I was after then I would sure as hell acquit - but rather than giving up altogether it's important that you instead take a step back to pinpoint exactly what it is you're doing that's preventing you from losing fat and let me start off by saying that no you're not genetically cursed no your metabolism is not damaged and no you're not too old to see results instead there's a few hidden mistakes that I see people unknowingly make all the time and that I even used to make that prevents you from losing fat despite your hard work and in this video I'll show you exactly what those mistakes are and how to correct them so you can actually start burning fat and seeing the results that you're after the first and most common mistake you don't realize you're making is under estimating your calorie intake meaning that you're unknowingly overeating which prevents any fat loss from occurring this is a mistake that 99.9% of people are making when they claim that they don't eat a lot of calories but still struggle to lose weight illustrating this is a paper from the British Journal of nutrition which looked at a group of women struggling to lose weight despite claiming to be small eaters as they reported their daily calorie intake to be on average just 1340 calories however after the researchers determined their true daily calorie intake they found it to be on average over 2,500 calories which was clearly the reason why they couldn't lose any fat and it wasn't until subjects were then supplied with the actual amount of calories that they claimed to be eating that they started finally losing weight at roughly 1.65 pounds per week and this phenomenon of under estimating calorie intake is something that multiple other studies have found as well with one study showing that even experienced dietitians ended up under report in their true calorie intake so why exactly does this occur well the truth is that most people are really bad at estimating the actual amount of calories that they eat for instance how many calories would you gases in this meal consisting of two pieces of whole grain toast with avocado and a little bit of olive oil drizzled on top chances are you wouldn't have guessed that this healthy meal consists of a whopping 620 calories now let's take a look at these two seemingly similar bowls of dry oats would you honestly be able to eyeball and guess that the one on the right has almost a hundred calories more than the one on the left just from adding a little bit more oats probably not and this difference in perceived versus actual calories very easily becomes the factor that's inhibiting your fat loss so to mitigate this you want to start monitoring your food intake and ideally taking the time to accurately measure everything with a food scale I'll leave a link in the description box down below to a very affordable one that I personally use myself you can then use an app like My Fitness Pal to then track the calories from these foods I highly recommend you do this or at least try it out as its going to help you see how many calories you're truly eating that and it's also going to drastically improve your skill of estimating calories and Foods in addition you want to make sure that you don't forget about hidden calories for example let's say you require 2,000 calories to lose weight you've monitored your food intake for the day and you're confident that you hit that goal but upon further analysis you've forgotten about the drop of oil that you use to cook your eggs and the ketchup that you ate them with the drizzle of salad dressing added to your healthy salad and the little bites you had if your significant others chocolate bar that's a whopping 300 calories and you've forgotten about which can easily put you out of the calorie deficit that you thought you were in and becomes a reason why you're not losing fat so just be aware of and take into account these hitting calories as they do quickly add up and can prevent to you from seeing the results that you're after the next hit a mistake you're making is you're not properly weighing yourself well most people do is they weigh themselves sporadically every week or so and the problem with this is well let's use myself as an example the following image is my daily weigh in history for the last four weeks as I've been cutting as you can see my weight fluctuates quite a bit which is completely normal but the overall trend is downwards and my weekly average weight has decreased every week which is thing however if our 12 instead weighed myself randomly once a week using the first two weeks as an example I could have ended up with this data which would leave me confused and frustrated because I'd be under the impression that I haven't made in your progress and actually gained weight despite all my hard work which you don't know isn't true and leads you to quit altogether but this is just because you haven't taken the time to properly track your data with only one weigh-in per week you become severely misled about the general direction of your weight change so what you need to do instead is weigh yourself every single morning right when you wake up after you've used the washroom but before you eat or drink anything as this is going to help minimize any weight fluctuations you'll then want to write down this number every day and take a weekly average of it and then every week you want to compare that average weight to the prior weeks average as this will more accurately represent what's actually happening with your weight and then if after three or four weeks or so you don't see any change in your weekly average weight then you'll be much more informed that something may need to be changing your plan and you can dress it accordingly and if you don't currently have a precise weight scale that measures with decimal points which believe me is essential I'll leave a link in the description box down below to one that I personally use and recommend the next hidden mistake you're making is overestimating and eating back the calories you burn a lot of people find that after doing an intense workout they're hungrier and feel as though they should eat more to compensate for the calories that they burn but what multiple papers have found is that especially after a cardio session people end up eating back in significant portion or even exceeding the calories that they burned from their workout which can slow down and/or prevent fat loss altogether and to make matters worse research indicates that people tend to overestimate the calories they've burned in a workout by up to 70% and devices or machines that track the calories that you've burned in your workout have been shown to overestimate the actual calories that you've burned by up to 24 percent so if you're using either of those methods to track your calories burned and then you're eating back your calories based on that that's likely what's hindering your fat loss a much better method is the stick to a set daily calorie intake and a set weekly workout routine then you simply keep track of your weekly average weight and if you're not losing weight then you adjust your plan accordingly by either slightly decreasing your calorie intake and/or bumping up your weekly cardio as needed the last mistake is you're not realizing that you're going through a body recomposition and when most people think of fat loss they immediately think of numbers on the scale they assume that if their weight isn't going down then they're not losing any fat but this isn't always the case because if you're relatively new to training or you're coming back from some time off or you've just started taking your training and your nutrition much more seriously then you're more likely to experience something called a body recomposition this is where your body both builds muscle and lose fat at the same time which is a good thing but it will result in your weight actually remaining the same which can throw people off and this right here is exactly why it's so vital that you've measured your progress in other ways rather than just relying on the scale so in addition to tracking your weight it's also a good idea to keep track of your strength in the gym take weekly progress pictures and take weekly bodily measurements because if for example in the past six weeks your weight has stayed the same but your strength has increased your arm measurements have increased and your waist measurements have decreased then these are all signs that you're going through a body recomposition meaning that you can rest assured that you are indeed making progress and doing everything correctly all-in-all I'll admit fat loss can be confusing at times and nothing is more demotivating than not seeing the results that you're after despite actually putting in the work if you take a step back review the various points I went through in this video and properly apply them then you will see the change that you're after guys as I try to emphasize in this video I can't stress to you enough the importance of tracking tracking your strength in the gym tracking your foods tracking your weight and so on are all a must because by having all these variables tracked you'll then know exactly what it is that you need to change or adjust in order to break through any plateaus you encounter and this is why within my built with science programs along with the training and nutrition programs that you're gonna get you're also provided with multiple tracking software's that I've built so that you can easily and accurately track your workouts your diet and your weight change over time and basically just everything that you need to along your journey with another program you're also gonna learn how to avoid making crucial mistakes like the ones I went through in this video before they even happen that's why so many of my members are seeing incredible changes in their bodies so to join today simply head on over to built with science comm and take the assessment quiz which is just going to determine what program is best for you anyways thank you so much for watching I hope you guys enjoyed this video please don't forget to give it a like

    "title": "How to PROPERLY Warm Up Before Weights",
    "published_at": "2017-11-12T17:24:28Z",
    "transcript": "a proper warm-up is essential for any workout that it's often either overdone or not done at all the main goal of the warm-up is to reduce stiffness awaken motor units and raise the temperature of the muscles and joints that are going to be worked but extending your warmup beyond the point that each of these has been accomplished will only lead to a depletion of energy that could be better used towards your high exertion working sets when done properly a warm-up provides several benefits that can translate to better muscle gain over time several studies have shown that a proper warm-up boosts strength and performance in the workout to follow and in the long run this translates to better muscle gains since you're able to perform better and more effectively progressively overload your muscles and although we commonly think that the main reason of the warm-up is to reduce injury this idea isn't well established in the literature but recent studies have shown a reduced risk of injury when a proper warm-up is used and just through experience I think the majority of us can say that our injuries often happen when we lift heavy weights or do certain movements without being sufficiently warmed up which is just more reason for you to include a proper warm-up so in this video I'll explain the three essential parts of your warmup and then give you guys a sample upper body and lower body warm-up that you can use this part of the warm-up mainly applies to lower body workouts as the leg muscles require a lot more blood flow and time spent warming them up then the upper body muscles do the main goal here is just to raise the temperature and increase blood flow to the legs so for this portion of the warmup you're simply going to cycle at an easy pace of around 50 to 60 percent of your max heart rate for five minutes the recent study in the journal of strength and conditioning showed that subjects that performed a low intensity cycling warm-up prior to like breasts led to significantly increased strength when compared to a high-intensity cycling warmup or just jumping right into the leg press and since cycling mimics a lot of movements that are used in lower body workouts it's likely a better option than walking on the treadmill or using other cardio machines and as for warming up the upper body part two and three of the warm-up as you'll see is likely enough to adequately warm up the upper body muscles to be worked and keep in mind that the goal is to warm up these specific muscles that you'll be training this means that you're probably wasting your time and valuable energy by cycling for five minutes before an upper body workout which is why I suggest keeping part one for lower body you've probably heard of the ongoing debate between static and dynamic stretching to sum the research up for you dynamic stretching leads to better performance and warming up with muscles and static stretching does and it's shown in many studies when static stretches are held for too long or done immediately before exercise it can actually negatively affect your strength and overall performance therefore this next part of the warm-up will consist of dynamic stretches to help reduce joint stiffness and further warm up the muscles to be worked for upper body workouts one of the main concerns in addition to warm it up major muscle groups is adequately warming up the shoulder stabilizers as well as various small yet essential muscles like the lower traps which all play a role in many upper body exercises here's a good routine a follow that covers these points start with wrist circles by keeping your palms together and make sure you do them in both directions so these keep your palms facing forward and protract the shoulder blades as you come forward and retract them as you come back for this one keep your core tight and try not to compensate by arching at the lower back on the arm swings try to get as much range of motion as you can and allow your shoulder blades to move up forward down and back throughout the movement for the rotations make sure you're getting sufficient rotation in both the upper and lower back and not just rotating at the hips for the band dislocations using appropriate hand width and pull the bat apart slightly to create some tension and then bring the band over and behind your head for band pull apart keep your arms extended in front of you and initiate the movement by performing a reverse fly motion by moving your hands out laterally to the sides you want to include the next two exercises just to further warm-up your rotator cuffs use a light weight and focus more on the range of motion try not to let your elbow drift away from your side again use a light weight here for these and slowly control it throughout the movement while keeping your traps depressed and for lower body workouts here is a good routine to follow keep your core tight and swing front and back as far as your leg will go follow this with side swings for these you want to put your hands on your feet and come down into a deep squat while keeping your chest up and hold this position for a couple of seconds you can also do these by holding on to something instead to make it easier for these lay with your arms straight out to the side and drop your knees to both sides as far as they will go keep your knees and ankles together and face your head in the opposite direction of way your knees draw get into a push-up position and bring one foot up beside your hands while pushing the hips forward and hold this position for a second then do the other side for these come up to a wall and plant one foot forward with the other behind keep the heel of the front foot on the floor and bring your knee towards the wall and back oh the further away you are from the wall the more ankle mobility you will need this last exercise is something I believe pretty much all of us should do for both upper body and lower body warmups the majority of us myself included sit for hours a day and lack sufficient thoracic extension which is something that is required in several weight lifting movements so reducing joint stiffness and improving range of motion in thoracic extension is something that will really benefit you in your lifts to get into position you want to lay on the floor with your feet and butt on the floor the foam roller in the middle of your back and your hands placed over your head like so to get your shoulder blades out of the way then you want to lift your hips into the air and slowly roll up and down for a bit to loosen up your upper back before we get into the next step once you're done this you want to put your butt back on the floor and place a foam roller between your shoulder blades take a deep breath in and as you exhale you want to extend over the foam roller while holding your head to release any tension in your neck relax in this position for a few deep breaths and then come back up move the foam roller slightly lower on your back and repeat the process one or two more times getting lower on your back each time part three of the warm-up is very important and will get your joints and muscles prepared for the movement you're going to perform and the heavy weight you will lift what you're going to do is perform two warm-up sets and then two of what are called weight acclamations sets before you start your work and set you want to do the following set one do twelve reps with about 50% of your working weight and then rest for a minute set to do eight reps with the same weight at a slightly faster pace and then rest for a minute set three do three to four reps with about 70% of your working weight and then rest for a minute set four do one rep with about 90 percent of your working weight and then rest for two minutes before you start your working set now by the time you start your first working set the muscles you'll be working all will be adequately warmed up without being fatigued due to too much warmup you want to do these four the first main exercise of your workout for example bench press if you're starting with that as your first main exercise that's pretty much it guys thank you for watching here is the upper body warm-up routine all written up for you and here is the lower body maintain our first glance it may seem like a lot but trust me guys this is only going to take maximum move around 10 to 15 minutes to do and that extra 10 minutes is going to benefit you a lot in terms of injury prevention increasing your mobility and range of motion over time and also boosting your strength and performance in the gym so it's definitely something that you want to start incorporating in your routine if you aren't already I want thing to always keep in mind is individual variations so as with many things it's not a one-size-fits-all and you want to tweak it according to your body and what helps you the most and for those of you asking my legs video will be up probably sometime next week and then we're gonna move on and do shoulders after that as well as always if you like this video please give it a like and leave a comment down below and also don't forget to subscribe to my channel thank you again for all your continued support guys I really appreciate it I know he's that's it for today guys I'll see you

    "title": "Drop Sets vs Normal Sets for Muscle Growth",
    "published_at": "2018-10-28T15:51:10Z",
    "transcript": "when it comes to the quest of maximizing muscle growth a variety of different training methods are often employed one popular training method drop sets simply involve performing one or more sets with a lighter weight immediately after you finish your heavy set they're typically used to accumulate more volume in a shorter amount of time achieve a greater muscle pump and elicit more metabolic stress in your wood with standard straight sets which would theoretically lead to better growth since metabolic stress is proposed as one of the main drivers of muscle growth however given that recent research has revealed that metabolic stress may not be as important for muscle growth as we once thought it begs the question as to whether drop sets are worth incorporating at all or whether sticking to normal Street sets would instead be best and to figure this out fortunately there are a handful of studies that can provide us with some insight for example one very recent 2017 paper by Fink and colleagues compared the effects of using job sets versus normal sets on muscle growth and strength during the triceps push down the drop set group performed one heavy set of their 12 rep max and then immediately went into two drop sets with lighter weight to failure whereas the normal set group simply performed three heavy sets of their 12 rep max with rest periods in between the result despite the drop set protocol taking just half the time to complete and despite volume being equated between the groups after six weeks the drop set group experienced almost doubled the triceps growth as a normal set group but before you go ahead and start implementing drop sets for all your exercises there are a few things to keep in mind first off although the drop set group experienced greater muscle growth there was a trend for greater strength improvements in the normal set group which makes sense since they were able to use heavier weight rather than dropping it throughout the sets which we know is better for strength gains meaning that over time normal sets would likely lead to significantly better strength gains and likely better muscle growth in the long run due to the concept of progressive overload especially if the comparison was done on compound movements as opposed to just a try extension secondly the study was done on just 16 subjects and their findings have yet to be replicated the only two other drop set studies out there where volume was equated between groups showed no significant difference in muscle growth when drop sets were employed and lastly it seems that training to failure is required in order for drop sets to be effective and since we know based on recent research that training to failure causes more fatigue and extends your recovery time when compared to non failure training this can become problematic if you start overusing drop sets since each set requires you to reach failure which can negatively affect the rest of your workout and even workouts later on in the week so does this mean that drop sets have no place in your routine not necessarily it just means that their implementation should be carefully considered and to provide you with some guidelines here's what I'd recommend one if you find yourself time-constrained for a workout then drop sets are an effective way to significantly reduce the duration of your training session without hindering muscle growth and to implement them instead of performing three sets of a biceps curl with rest in between for example you'd instead start with one heavy set to failure then immediately drop the weight by roughly 20 percent and do another set to failure and then repeat this again by dropping the weight by another 20 percent now this definitely shouldn't be used for all of your workouts due to recovery issues but it can be useful to occasionally implement whenever you're short on time too you mainly want to incorporate drop sets on accessory exercises or machines rather than compound movements this is because implementing drop sets on compound movements tends to lead to form breakdown which can be risky especially when you don't have a spotter available and not only that but research has also indicated that training to failure on major compound movements diminishes performance for at least 48 hours and likely even longer and since drops us require you to train to failure this lingering fatigue could negatively impact training sessions later on in the week whereas doing so with isolation exercises doesn't interfere with recovery to the same extent and finally three used drop sets sparingly for instance instead of replacing every single set for every single exercise with drop sets you can instead read the possible benefits of them without causing recovery issues by simply adding in a drop set to just the final set of the last one or two exercises in your workout doing so is a time efficient way to quickly add more volume and induce more metabolic stress within your workouts without causing much interference with your recovery so for example in the following upper-body workout this is how you can employ job sets using what I previously mentioned again just keep in mind that you don't want to overdo it so consider and be wary of any potential recovery issues in the event that you do decide to implement drop sets into your current routine so some of the video here are the main takeaways but keep in mind that there is definitely a lot more research needed to be sure as to whether combining drops has with traditional sets does actually enhance muscle growth in the long run because based on what we have right now is just relatively unclear regardless guys if anything drop sets really are just icing on the cake and the grand scheme of things although it's perfectly fine to incorporate them for their possible added benefits and their time-saving capabilities just know that your main focus and priority needs to be on progressing your main compound movements over time as it's clear both anecdotally and through research that this is what's going to deliver the majority of your results and if you're looking for a

    "title": "How To Grow Your Chest With Only Push-Ups (FULL ROUTINE)",
    "published_at": "2021-10-17T19:56:05Z",
    "transcript": "if you don't think you can grow a big chest by just using push-ups then i'm about to prove you wrong first we're going to do a test to determine your current push-up level then we're going to go through how to pick the right push-up variations based on that and then complete it with two key exercises to speed up your gains by the end of this video you'll have a personalized weekly push-up routine to grow your chest first let me tell you how we use science to make this routine so effective at growing your chest so 2018 study had a group of male subjects trained three times a week using either the bench press or using push-ups the bench press group simply increased the weight as it got stronger whereas the push-ups group used 10 push-up variations that range from easiest to most difficult once the subjects mastered one variation they moved on to the next one to continue improving their strength over time after four weeks the push-ups group managed to increase their overall upper body strength as much as the group using the bench press did other studies that analyze muscle growth show similar results and to indicate that with the right push-up progressions you can build comparable size and strength as you would with a weighted exercise like the bench press we're going to implement this in our routine by having you train three times a week with the appropriate push-up variations based on your current level of strength in addition to this we'll apply a special method of training to further boost your gains this method's effectiveness was recently tested on a group of 18 power lifters the participants trained three days per week with each day using a slightly different style of training on day one they performed an easier workout focused on just getting some skill practice in with their exercises on day two they performed a heavy workout focused on improving their strength then on day three they performed a muscular endurance workout focused on improving how many reps they could do in a row these three styles of training challenge their muscles in different ways and proved to be extremely effective increasing their upper body strength over three times as fast as traditional methods we're going to replicate the same approach into your three weekly workouts by using a skill day a strength day and a muscular endurance day each filled with the right accessory exercises for that day all right step one so to do a normal push-up your muscles need the strength to be able to lift about 70 percent of your body weight this is why we're going to first determine your push-up level to know which exercises are best fitting for you so first warm-up if you're able to do push-ups this is where you want to do a few sets of 2-3 push-ups just to get your body warmed up if that's too difficult then you can do wall push-ups instead after your warm-up rest for about two to three minutes before the push-up test for the test only good form counts if your hips are sagging you're not going all the way down or all the way up or your elbows are flaring out to the sides then those reps that just don't count each rep should be controlled with your body remaining in a straight line nose almost touching the ground on the way down arms fully locked out at the top and the elbows tucked to about 45 degrees away from your side when you're ready drop down and do as many push-ups as you can note down how many you get and see which level you fall under level one is if you got between one to ten push-ups level two is if you got between 11 to 30 push-ups level 3 is if you got more than 30 push-ups now it's time to actually go through your workouts starting with day one but make sure to pay attention to each exercise that i go through as many of them will be used in multiple levels and you'll be using them as you graduate through each level so for those in the one to ten group we'll use an exercise that will require you to lift less of your body weight making it easier for you to do find any kind of elevated platform like a couch or table and place your hands on it the higher that platform is the easier this move will be so choose an appropriate height and lower it over time as you get stronger simply perform your push-ups on that platform and use a height that allows you to get three sets of six to eight reps for those in the 11 to 30 group take the number of push-ups you can do in a row and take 70 percent of that so for example if you could do 16 in a row 70 of that would be roughly 11. you're going to do three sets of that number using just normal push-ups for those in the 30 plus group you're going to use a slightly harder variation called hand release push-ups so in normal push-ups at the bottom position after your descent something called a stretch shortening reflex kicks in that gives you muscles more strength on the way back up we're gonna take this reflex away to create a greater demand on your muscles which will in turn make normal push-ups much easier to perform it get into a normal push-up setup slowly come all the way down until your chest is resting on the ground take your hands off the ground place them back and then continue a normal push-up for this exercise we're going to aim for three sets of half the number of what your max push-ups are all right now let's move on to d2 your strength there so for the one to ten group you're going to use a variation that's focused specifically on the downward portion of the push-up this has been found to be a unique way to quickly improve strength and a method that we use frequently in my built with science programs because of its effectiveness to perform it start at the top of a push-up position and then lower yourself as slowly as you can towards the ground once you reach the ground set back up to the top and repeat try to slow down more and more as you get stronger over time we're going to do five sets of just one rep of this variation for the 11 to 30 group for strength you're going to do the hand release push-ups that we mentioned earlier for the 30 plus group we'll want to do a variation that makes you lift more weight than you would with normal push-ups to perform it you're gonna start in a normal push-up position but come down to one hand instead of straight down this shifts more of your body weight to one arm to increase the difficulty push back up using that one hand and then switch to the other hand for the next rep we're gonna do three sets of fifty percent of your max number of push-ups all right for day three all groups are going to do something called e-mom push-ups this stands for every minute on the minute this variation involves short bursts of effort followed by minimal rest this allows you to get a lot of reps in to build up your endurance without letting your body completely fatigue they're tough but very effective to perform it take fifty percent of your max push-ups number then using a timer every minute for a total of five minutes you're going to perform that number of push-ups so if you had 20 as your max number push-ups you'd aim to do 10 push-ups every minute to get a total of 50 push-ups if however you finish that and it was too easy then simply increase your goal push-ups for each minute so with your push-up variations this is what your three days should currently look like based on your level now it's time to finish off your routine by adding two key movements that will strengthen the various other muscles you'll need to speed up your push-up gains so the push-up is actually just a plank that is moving up and down which requires your core muscles to be strong enough to do so if they're not your lower back will arch or your hips will pike up this exercise will focus on strengthening these core muscles while integrating your shoulders your triceps and your chest muscles as well to perform it get into the top of a push-up position placing your feet together will make this movement harder so start out with your feet spread out brace your core and fully extend your legs then for 30 seconds while keeping your body as stable as possible and without sagging your hips from one side to the other lift one hand to tap your opposite shoulder and then switch to the other hand slower tabs are going to place a greater demand on the core and muscles of the arm so take it slow rather than just trying to do as many taps as you can the last exercise will add more volume to your routine while improving your push-ups power by focusing more on the triceps to perform it you'll do a standard push-up but with your hands placed closer together at about shoulder-width apart based on your strength level you can do these on an incline to make it easier or on a decline to make it more difficult you'll do two sets of these and take each set to failure to the point where you can't do any more reps so this routine is a lot of volume for your chest and triceps and should replace all the chests and triceps exercises that you're currently doing after starting the routine every couple weeks i want you to retest how many push-ups you can do in

    "title": "How Many Exercises Do You Need To Maximize Muscle Growth?",
    "published_at": "2021-03-28T16:13:50Z",
    "transcript": "when it comes to exercise selection generally there's two extremes on the one end are those who say all you need are the basics squats bench and dead lifts to build an impressive physique on the other end are those who hit each muscle with every single exercise in the book often inspired by their favorite instagram influencer [Music] what approach is best to maximize growth well both approaches actually do have valid reasoning behind them for those who take a minimalistic approach research does actually support this cap for instance one recent 2021 paper had one group of subjects performed just one exercise for each muscle group three times per week whereas the other group worked each muscle group with a different exercise every workout total workout volume and intensity were matched in both groups and muscle growth was assessed at three sites each on the front and side of the thigh and the biceps and triceps after nine weeks both groups experience a similar amount of overall growth in each of their muscles now taking these results at face value you'd assume that doing just one exercise per muscle would be sufficient however when you dive into the results a little more not only was there a slight trend towards better growth in the varied exercise group but they also experienced growth at all 12 sites that were measured whereas the other group that used the same exercises workout to work out failed to experience significant growth in two of the measured sites the same effect has been found in past research as well such as in this 2014 paper that employed a similar study design but only analyzed growth of the quads after 12 weeks the researchers found similar overall quadriceps growth in both groups but the subjects that vary their exercises experienced significant growth in all four heads of the quads whereas the same exercise group failed to experience significant growth in two of the four heads and there's a couple reasons why exactly this happens the first reason is due to what's known as regional hypertrophy which is a well-supported phenomenon that different exercises cause growth in different regions of a muscle for example squats will grow certain parts of your quads well that leg presses just don't grow as well and vice versa and we see this effect occur because for most of our individual muscles some fibers of that muscle will activate very well in certain exercises and ranges of motion yet not as much in others for example certain biceps exercises will favor growth in the inner portion or short head of your biceps whereas other biceps exercises will favor growth in the outer portion or long head of your biceps now although it's currently not crystal clear as to what specific exercises will favor specific regions of a muscle this phenomenon does exist and does support the idea of using multiple exercises to maximally stimulate and grow a muscle in a proportionate manner the second reason is due to the various biomechanical actions that each of our muscles have for example the chest functions to primarily bring our arms together during a bench press we do this with heavy weight but we fail to work the chest through its full range of motion whereas with the fly we can bring the arms together and further back and will help activate specific motor units and parts of the chest that the bench press likely would not similarly again looking at the chest we can divide the chest into its upper middle and lower fibers which can each be emphasized with different movements so if we were only to train the chest with something like the bench press which tends to favor growth in the mid and lower regions of the chest that is shown in a 2020 paper that tested just that your upper chest would likely end up lagging behind another good example are the hamstrings which have two main functions to flex the knee and extend the hip so if you were to leave all of your hamstrings training to deadlifts which primarily work the hamstrings by extending the hips then you'd be missing out on one of the major functions of that muscle whereas adding in a knee flexion movement like leg curls or glute ham raise would ensure that the main functions of the hamstrings are utilized and that all parts of the muscle can be stimulated and grown to the greatest extent aside from just overall growth though another benefit of varying your exercises is that it helps minimize wear and tear and your risk of overuse injuries if you do all of your volume for a muscle group with just one or two exercises without ever rotating them then you're stressing the same joints and same stabilizer muscles to the same stress all the time which can eventually cause irritation and overuse injuries for example if you did bench press three times a week indefinitely then for many people their elbows or shoulders will eventually start experiencing some discomfort whereas if you added in a more elbow and shoulder friendly dumbbell press to one of the days in between you'd still be able to provide growth to your chest but with less risk of overuse injuries and discomfort in your joints now with all that being said some people will take what i've just mentioned and over apply it into their training routines by hammering each muscle group with six or even seven exercises every workout while i will admit this can be satisfying to do it often does more harm than good yes our muscles do need some variety and novel stimulus over time to keep our muscles growing but if you're using every single exercise in the book for a specific muscle group right from the start then you're already exposing that muscle to all of the best tricks up your sleeve for when your growth plateaus meaning that once your muscles get used to what you're currently doing you'll have no left over exercises to introduce it to in order to potentially stimulate more growth so instead a much more effective option is to pick about two to four exercises for each of your muscle groups that work very well for you and cover a good variety of movement patterns then simply distribute these throughout the week as needed and feel free to repeat some of these exercises on multiple days if needed but at the same time you want to limit the number of exercises that you use per muscle in each workout to three or four at most otherwise the additional exercises and work that you do for that muscle in that workout will likely go towards junk volume rather than actually provide an effective stimulus for growth so for example with four exercises per week for chest here's how you could intelligently distribute them into two workouts per week with something like a push-pull leg split then after that setup you simply throw in however many sets that you need for each exercise in order to meet your weekly volume targets which for most people will be somewhere between 10 to 20 sets per muscle per week and even if you're not hitting every angle head or movement pattern for a given muscle in your weekly routine don't worry about it too much because once that initial routine you're using becomes stale and you need some variety is when you can swap in certain exercises and accommodate for whatever movement patterns you might have been missing out on in your previous routine so as a summary here is a step-by-step plan for how you can apply everything we just covered if you're serious about designing your own program then i'd highly suggest that you take the time to go through this step-by-step process because it's a little details like this that make all the difference if you want to maximize your efforts and results and for those who are looking for a step-by-step program that takes care of all of the guesswork for you

    "title": "The Best Science-Based Triceps Exercises for Each Head (Work Your Weak Points!)",
    "published_at": "2018-08-12T13:59:09Z",
    "transcript": "[Music] four five when it comes to building big powerful looking arms the majority of us know that we need to focus on the triceps since they actually make up most of the size of your arms however sheer size is one thing but what really makes the difference in terms of the aesthetics of your triceps is a relative development of each head and for those who are unaware there's three heads there's the long head which is responsible for most of the overall mass of your triceps and is located towards the back of your arm there's the lateral head which is smaller than the long head but is the most visible head from the side and lastly there's the medial head which is the least visible of the three but still plays an important role in triceps definition and in providing stability and overall strength for the triceps muscle as a whole and when well developed these three heads collectively form the distinct horseshoe shape that essentially symbolizes a well-developed tricep so as you can see it's a proportionate development of all three heads that is the key to creating aesthetic looking triceps and in order to accomplish this it's important that you choose the right triceps exercises because although all three heads cross at the elbow joint and therefore will be active to some extent in any triceps movement we do also know that based on the literature and based on the anatomy of the triceps we can emphasize the involvement of each triceps head through proper exercise selection and in this video i'll show you exactly how by going through the best triceps exercises for each head and i'll show you how to implement them into your routine based on where your triceps are lagging as discussed previously the long head makes up the majority of the triceps and usually has the most potential for growth especially since most people just don't effectively emphasize it within their routines this is mainly because the long head of the triceps is the only head that crosses over the shoulder joint meaning that as you'll see it can be preferentially targeted through exercise manipulation and one of the best exercises that accomplishes this are inclined dumbbell kickbacks this is because based on the long head's anatomy by moving your arms back such that they're parallel with the body and then fully flexing at your elbows you're putting the long head in a state of maximum contraction relative to the other two heads which leads to greater activation in fact as shown in this emg study by baron and buskies incline dumbbell kickbacks elicited the highest long head activation when compared to nine other common triceps exercises shown here but in order to reap the full benefits of this exercise it's vital that you perform it correctly and to do so you need to ensure that your elbow stays locked in place at your side such that your arm remains parallel with your body as you perform each rep if you let your elbow drop such that your arm is no longer parallel you're going to lose the strong contraction of the long head that makes this exercise so effective but despite this exercise's benefits the main downside with this exercise is that tension and overall load is sacrificed when compared to other movements which is where the next exercise incline dumbbell overhead extensions will come in handy as stated in some of my other videos any triceps exercise that places the shoulders in a flexed position will emphasize the long head to a greater degree and there are several exercises that do this but in my opinion one of the safer versions for the shoulder joint that also provides a better stretch on the long head since you're lying on an incline is the incline dumbbell overhead extension however as with the previous exercise proper form becomes essential in order to maximize the effectiveness of this exercise as shown in this 2006 biomechanical analysis of the triceps by landon and colleagues greater degrees of shoulder elevation provides a greater stretch on the long head simply meaning that rather than starting and ending this exercise with your arms directly overhead where your long head activation will be sub-optimal you want to instead move your arms slightly back lock your arms here and then proceed to perform your reps this way you provide more stretch to the long head which in turn enables the long head to be more active throughout the whole range of motion now since these heads don't cross over the shoulder joint like the long head does it makes it difficult to preferentially target one over the other however we can make some inferences based on emg analysis for example based on the previously mentioned barons and busky study we do know that for the lateral head at least cable push downs with a straight bar or a v-bar seems to be the best isolation exercise for the lateral head when compared to other triceps exercises whereas on the other hand as shown in an extensive emg analysis by researcher brett contreras it seems that when a rope instead of a bar is used the exercise now involves greater medial head involvement while also becoming a more balanced triceps exercise for all heads so by knowing this difference you're able to slightly favor one head over the other now with that being said another exercise i would add to the mix for the lateral and medial heads would be the weighted triceps dip where you perform the dip in a more upright position since research indicates that the triceps are composed of mostly type 2 muscle fibers which are thought to be best stimulated by using heavy weight incorporating an exercise such as the weighted triceps dip which can be progressively overloaded with heavy weight can ensure that you're maximally stimulating the triceps muscle fibers now on that note it's also vital that you're aware that most of your triceps development will come from your main heavy compound pressing movements mainly because you're able to most effectively overload those movements with weight when compared to isolation exercises so rather than trying to incorporate all the exercises previously mentioned focus on your compound movements and then pick a couple of the ones i mentioned based on your weak points as shown here so for example if i thought my lateral head was lagging i'd mainly focus on weighted dips and straight bar pushdowns as my main triceps accessory movements this way you're not trying to do everything at once which can be detrimental and instead you're focusing on bringing up what's lagging which will make a huge difference in improving the overall aesthetic of your triceps thanks so much for watching guys i hope you enjoyed the video and found it useful i'm really sorry

    "title": "What Are The BEST Protein Sources to Build Muscle? (Eat These!)",
    "published_at": "2019-02-24T15:02:35Z",
    "transcript": "[Music] today we are going to eat like Hercules what is this gonna consist of sir it's gonna consist of seven whole meals I think two steak meals there's gonna be two fish meals two chicken meals there's also gonna be there's gonna be a protein drink and here's the key although ingesting lines blood isn't necessary we all know that protein plays a major role in muscle growth failing to get enough protein means that your muscles won't recover and grow to the best of their ability however getting enough protein shouldn't be your only priority it's vital that you also take into account the sources that you're getting your protein from as you want to ensure that they're high quality sources because as you'll see in this video doing so can enable you to maximize muscle growth and optimize your recovery and performance but before we dive into what the best protein sources are let's first take a look at what makes a protein source good in the first place generally there's two main factors that determine the quality of a protein source one leucine content which is an essential amino acid shown in a number of studies to be the most potent amino acid at stimulating muscle protein synthesis and to digestibility which is simply the proportion of amino acids from the protein that can then be digested absorbed and used for protein synthesis and growth thus the higher the leucine content and higher the digestibility of a protein the better it will be for muscle repair and growth so what protein sources meet this criteria well research has indicated that animal-based protein sources are generally better for protein synthesis and growth than plant-based protein sources and the reason for this as explained in this literature review from the Journal of nutrition is that animal-based proteins typically have a higher digestibility and a higher leucine content than plant-based proteins do which are also often deficient in other essential amino acids as well but to be clear this does not mean that you can't maximize growth if you only ingest plant-based proteins but it does mean that there's a few things you'll have to implement which I'll go through later on in this video but for now let's take a look at the various animal-based protein sources and determine what might be best so based solely on the criteria I mentioned earlier whey protein powder comes out on top it's been shown in multiple papers to have both the highest leucine content and the highest digestibility when compared to various other protein sources and since research also indicates that most individuals need roughly 2.5 grams of leucine in a single meal to maximize protein synthesis it makes it a very practical and calorie wise option of doing so however you don't just want to rely exclusively on way as your main protein source because if you did you'd be missing out on the various micronutrients and minerals that other protein sources provide which can play an important role in your recovery of performance and perhaps even augment muscle growth for instance was actually really interesting is that recent research has indicated that certain micronutrients found in whole food protein sources may actually boost the resulting protein synthesis response to a greater degree illustrating this one 20:17 paper compared the protein synthesis response between roughly 20 grams of protein from egg whites versus roughly 20 grams of protein from whole eggs they found that the whole eggs elicited a protein synthesis response significantly higher than the egg whites which of researchers stated could not be attributed to the differences in caloric intake but rather was likely because the yolk in whole eggs contains several micronutrients that are potential candidates to augment the protein synthesis response now although this is a relatively novel finding the results of other recent studies are in support of this as well displaying the potential importance of micronutrients for recovery and growth so what I recommend is stick to a way for your pre or post-workout meal given its convenience and superior digestibility properties but don't rely on it excessively throughout the day as it's lacking in micronutrients instead it's a good idea to incorporate some of the following high-quality whole food protein sources as well eggs are very affordable and as I mentioned rich in various micronutrients and you can definitely add egg whites to them as well for more leucine and overall protein lean meats such as chicken breast extra lean ground turkey and grass-fed beef are all great options with a high leucine content and rich in a variety of important minerals lean fish such as tuna and oily fish rich in fatty acids such as wild salmon and mackerel are recommended as well given the various benefits of their omega-3 content which is have stated in past videos may actually play a role in muscle recovery and growth these are all excellent protein sources that each have a rich composition of essential amino acids and different micronutrients that have been widely supported by the literature to support muscle growth so you want to incorporate a variety of these into your diet in addition slower digesting protein sources such as casein protein powder and foods high in casein such as Greek yogurt and cottage cheese are worth discussing as well this is because research has indicated that although fast digesting proteins are preferred during the day when there's not a very long break between meals high amounts of slow digesting protein is a preferred choice during longer periods of over six hours without food such as overnight since they will elevate protein synthesis for a longer time thus strategically ingesting a high amount of a slow digesting protein either shortly before you sleep or if you know you won't be ingesting protein for six hours or longer would be recommended in order to maximize growth that was for plant-based protein sources although they're essential for vegans of vegetarians I'd recommend everyone aim to incorporate them as well for both sustainability and the additional fiber and micronutrients and various phytochemicals that they provide however as I mentioned earlier plant-based protein sources don't stimulate protein synthesis as well as animal-based protein sources do but there are ways to compensate for this for instance as shown in this 2019 review by Georgia Mellon and colleagues 20 grams of a plant-based protein often doesn't elicit an adequate protein synthesis response but the consumption of a greater amount of plant-based protein and or mixing different plant-based protein sources raises the muscle protein synthesis response to a significantly greater degree therefore with plant-based protein sources it's a good idea to ingest a greater amount at a time and/or makes different sources within the meal or throughout the day to optimize the protein synthesis response and for your reference here are various plant-based sources you can incorporate that are relatively high in protein and rich in the various essential amino acids so the some of the video up here are the main points that you want to keep in mind just note that at the end of the day total protein intake is what's most important for supporting muscle growth but at the same time you also want to pay close attention to the quality of the protein that you're ingesting and for the reasons I previously discussed that's a sudden in the past your nutrition will hands-down be the most important factor when it comes to transform in your body I used to be completely lost as to how to approach my nutrition and I know a lot of you out there are in the same position this is exactly why with my bill to the science programs I not only cover training but also stress the importance of nutrition and even developed a custom-built nutrition software designed to optimize your diet based on your own stats and goal and it get started you can simply head on over to build with science comm and take my starting point quiz I have up in order to discover which program is best for you also I know a lot of you struggle with meal ideas so it highly suggest giving me a follow on Instagram where within my stories I share a lot of my own daily meals recipes and the reasoning behind them which I think a lot of you will find useful as always don't forget to get the video a like if you enjoyed it and subscribe to my channel if you haven't already so you can stay updated with all my future content anyways I hope you enjoyed the video please do let me know in the comments below what other nutrition topics you'd like to see me cover and I'll do just that

    "title": "How to Get a Rounder Butt FAST (ft. Bret Contreras)",
    "published_at": "2023-04-02T13:00:00Z",
    "transcript": "do you have a weak flat butt I want to turn it into a strong rounded set of glutes today I'm bringing in red Contreras the man has dedicated his life to studying and transforming people's glutes and five easy steps will help you build a 12-week workout plan designed to grow your glutes as fast as scientifically possible the first step is to figure out how often to train your glutes and with how much volume the glutes are a huge muscle they have multiple subdivisions they carry out several distinct muscle actions and they can handle a lot of volume and frequency as long as you incorporate variety now the most common training split we use to accomplish this is a lower upper lower upper lower so we're going to train them three times per week to maximize our rate of glute growth so that's three lower body days with two upper body days sandwiched between them but you can tweak this depending on how many days you have available to work out as for how many sets to do Brett recommends 36 sets of glutes per week at first I was pretty shocked 36 sets per week week you can recover from it it's not too much of most males in the industry would say oh that's Overkill according to the published research we should only be doing 20 or you know you should be doing 36 sets but I'm telling you the glutes can handle it I'm telling you how my top responders they're all doing it all the top bikini Pros they're all training glutes three times a week they wouldn't be doing this if it wasn't effective they figure out the best way they're obsessed they care more about glute training than we do about pecs or biceps you know but you can't just do 36 sets of really exhausting exercises like squats and deadlifts Brett explained the key is to split up the 36 sets a week into three different types of exercises 12 cents should come from what's known as a vertical hip extension exercises where the body is positioned vertically in relation to the resistance although we don't really know why both Brett and I have tested this with EMG and found they activated more of the lower glutes it's also the most taxing category of exercises since the they heavily involve the quads and hamstrings this is why 12 sets should also come from horizontal hip extension exercises where the body's positioned horizontally relative to the resistance these are a bit less fatiguing and will Target both the upper and lower glutes and the remaining 12 sets should come from abduction exercises where the legs move out to the side these are the least tax in but they help build up the upper glutes and the glute medius as for the best exercises to use for each of these categories and how to perform them for the most glute growth let's start with vertical hip extension so the first exercise is the back squat use whatever stance width and foot angle is most comfortable for you and try to descend as low as possible without too much butt week for Max glue growth you'll want to try to get down to at least parallel slightly below and focus on pushing through the heels on the way up dumbbell Bulgarian split sweats will complement squats very well but to better Target the glutes you'll want to lean your torso forward and descend diagonally at a slight angle backwards on the way down once your back knee almost touches the ground push up through the heel of your front foot and drive your hips forward another great exercise my clients have had success with is the Smith machine reverse lunge the added stability helps them really focus on their glutes here we position the feet so that at the bottom the knee is in line with the foot we also use a slight lean at the Torso to better Target the glutes and don't be afraid to go heavy my top girls they're using two plates per side last but not least we have the Romanian devil so you can do these with dumbbells or with the barbell but the key to targeting the glutes is to keep your shins vertical sit back as far as possible and let your knees Bend come down to just below your kneecaps and then use your glutes to thrust your hips forward for this category I'd use a lower rep range of around 6 to 12 reps per set that usually works best so you want to add two to three of these exercises into your weekly glute routine we'll do this for you at the end of the video but to grow your upper glutes and also challenge your glutes in a different way you'll want to some of the exercises from the next category as well horizontal hip extension one of my favorite exercises for this category is hip thrust they do a great job of activating all the glutes especially the upper area but it's important that you do them right keep your mid back on a bench or pad push up through your heels to drive your hips as high as possible now at this point your shins should be vertical if they're not shift your feet further in or out and hold that top position for three seconds before coming back down now I also like exercise that work the glutes one at a time and this next one is a great option especially if you don't have access to weight you can do these off of a couch here you spread your arms across the bench in a T formation and Center both feet so that they're touching then come up to the top of the hip thrust and lift one leg off the ground while keeping the knee bent lower yourself down and push through the heel of the grounded leg to push your hips as high as possible but also a single lay of just the 3x20 protocol became popular and it's hard for everyone like I don't care who you are at least let's say 20 with really smooth form is brutal yeah and and you know especially as you get good you can reduce the rest time so if you do three by Twenty with a minute rest between sets ugh the third set at 20 reps your glutes are burning real good this next one works the glutes a little differently than hip thrust here you'll need a back extension machine set it up so that the pad is just on your hips now to better Target the glutes flare your feet out to 45 degrees and round your upper back keep your upper back rounded and raise your body up by pushing your hips into the pad using your glutes if you don't have access to this one you can do the reverse hip extension exercise that Jeremy and I covered in our past video together so we're going to go a little bit higher Reps for this category usually a moderate rep range of around 8 to 20 reps per set works best all right so before we get to building your glute workouts we need to cover the last category of exercises hip abduction Brett explained how most people Overlook the effectiveness of these exercises because they aren't big and heavy movements yet he's found that when his clients do this properly and consistently only and really push hard during them they see massive growth especially in the glute medius an important muscle not just for looks but for function and knee and hip Health as well here are his top picks most girls love this machine but guys don't be embarrassed to hop on here it's extremely effective for glue growth now I likely to recommend leaning forward and holding on to the support drive your knees out as far as you can then control the weight back until your knees almost touch together if you don't have a machine you can replace these with band seated hip abductions or the next exercise which is body weight now for an exercise that doesn't involve any equipment this one is a great option get into a side plank position with your knees bent at around a 90 degree angle drive up through the grounded knee while driving your hips forward and separating your knees as much as you can let the hips move back on the way down you should feel both sides of your glutes working this is actually an advanced exercise though so take your time and only do as many reps as you can with good form even for someone like myself who's been training glutes for many many years I only do three sets of 12 with body weight and it's very challenging still last but not least if you have cables make sure you include this one stand sideways to a cable machine and use a strap to attach the foot of your far leg to the cable hold on to the column with your opposite arm take a few steps sideways until there's tension in the cable and then move your planted leg in front of your working leg with your foot slightly turned in from here swing the leg outward as far as you can to your side without rotating your foot outward don't lean forward as you do this and keep your core braced strongly you can also try swinging your foot in front of your planted leg instead of behind of your planted leg and see if that feels better I'd say fifty percent of my clients like their leg out in front fifty percent like it behind now for this category I recommend a higher rep range of around 12 to 30 reps per set that's what works best so you've got the workout split you've got the exercises but now you need the actual workouts this step is the most important you need to build your glue workouts in a way that doesn't create excessive soreness throughout your week yet also challenges your glutes in different ways here are three sample glute workouts you can get started with that do just that but Brett and I have also created a free 12 week workout routine that will guide you week by week with all of your workouts you can download this over at builtwithscience.com group plan give this video a watch next if you need some help activating the glutes big thanks to Brett for his help with this video the man is truly a master of his craft and I'll leave links below to his website and social media and I'll see you next time"

    "title": "How To Get Bigger Legs FAST (3 Science-Based Tips For Bigger Quads)",
    "published_at": "2019-10-13T16:05:44Z",
    "transcript": "what's going on everyone and Jeremy here and today we're gonna be talking about the Klaus more specifically why they may not be growing for you despite you actually showing up on your leg days and doing all the exercises that technically should be growing them I'll be honest I personally struggled with growing my quads ever since I started training even though I never skipped my leg workouts I was actually lifting heavier weight during them my quads just never really grew much and always seemed to lag behind but fast-forward to now and although my quads still aren't where I'd like them to be their development and the rate of growth has improved significantly mainly due to correcting three key mistakes that I never even realized I was making and these same mistakes are what I now see other people unknowingly do all the time with their leg training so to prevent you from doing the same let's go through each mistake and show you what to do instead so you can actually start seeing some results with your leg development the first mistake has to do with your exercise execution well most people don't realize is that you can actually make minor tweaks to the way you perform your leg exercises to shift more of the tension away from the glutes and hamstrings and onto the quads instead to prioritize their development during your leg workouts let's take a look at the four lunge for example there's essentially two completely different ways that you can perform this exercise the biomechanical research has shown will significantly affect the emphasis is placed on the quad stir in the movement to emphasize the glutes and hamstrings more during the lunge you would take a long step forward such at your shin as vertical over your foot each step lean your torso forward slightly to increase the flexion of the hip joint and hence increase the involvement of the glutes and lastly push through the heel of your foot to better activate the glutes during each rep whereas to hit the quads more which is what we want to do you would instead take a short step forward so that your front knee positions itself just over the top of your toes or slightly past them as long as you don't experience discomfort keep your torso upright to minimize the flexion of your hip joint and involvement of the glutes and then push up through your foot rather than focusing on pushing through the heel so by doing this version when you perform your lunges you'll be able to biomechanically favor your quadriceps more and hence enable you to better grow them over time and also keep in mind that these three tweaks can be easily applied to pretty much any laundry split squat variation you do in order to just shift more of the tension onto the quads and we can even apply a similar concept to exercises like the leg press as well by simply tweaking your foot placement for example one paper from the journal strength and conditioning research actually analyzed the effect of various light pressed foot placements a resulting muscle activation what they found is that a low foot placement elicited significantly higher quadriceps involvement than a standard or high foot placement which both favor the glutes more due to the greater hip flexion involved so applying this to your leg press by shifting your feet down slightly as long as you have the mobility to do so is a great way to further emphasize a quads and can also be applied to other pressing machines like the hack squat for example but do keep in mind that for these various tweaks it will shift a little more force and stress onto the knees as a result which isn't a bad thing at all and perfectly safe unless you currently experience knee pain or going through a knee injury in which case it wouldn't be advised the next mistake that's low when your quad gains is cutting your range of motion shorter in your leg exercises and it's something I see people do all the time at the gym especially on exercises like the squat and leg press for example yet what these half rappers don't realize is that you literally get half the gains as a result for instance multiply mg studies looked at how the activation and muscular effort of the quadriceps changes based on how deep you go during both the squat and the leg press what they found is that the deeper you go the more the quads are activated up until around 105 to 120 degrees of knee flexion which just to put it into perspective is right around the point when your upper thigh becomes parallel to the ground you're in the squat and then for the leg press it's right around the point where your knees 90 degrees of Bend simply meaning that it's a very bottom of these lifts that seemed to be the most important for Quattro and cut in this short which most people do is definitely cutting your gains as a result and to illustrate the importance of this even further as a 2013 paper that now looked at how quad muscle gains compared during a partial versus a full range of motion squat pictured here so the researchers had subjects do one or the other for 12 weeks and measured the resulting growth at six different measurement sites and their quads and as pictured in this graph from the study quad growth was significantly greater with the full range of motion squad at all six measurement sites and just to really hammer in this mistake for you even though you'll be able to handle a much heavier weight with a partial squad than you can with a full squad it's still not going to be as effective for gains in fact one study actually showed that subjects were able to get 25% higher quadriceps activation with a full squad compared to a partial squad despite having to use sixty pounds less weight so my point is guys that the finally start seeing improvements in your quad gains and actually also protect your knee joints in the process it's time to put the ego aside lighten the weight and use a full range of motion you can start doing so with your squad or any similar movement by aiming to get your upper thigh at least parallel with the ground or even slightly lower if your mobility safely allows for it and then for your light press as I mentioned earlier you want to go 12 these past 90 degrees of knee flexion or as deep as you're capable of doing safely doing this will just guarantee that you're working your quadriceps through those peak degrees of knee flexion described earlier where the most growth is likely to occur however if you struggle with doing this then it's time to address mistake number three which is that you're neglecting your ankle mobility and to illustrate the importance of this let's take a look at a recent 2015 paper that looked at various mobility restrictions in a hundred subjects in an attempt to see what affected squat depth the most they found that of the restrictions tested ankle mobility seemed to be the most dominant factor that affected squad dev and that increasing ankle mobility was strongly correlated with a greater ability to squat deeper which is obviously problematic for most of you out there trying to grow your claws because without sufficient ankle mobility if you try to achieve a full squad or leg press or even if you try to apply the quad modifications that I mentioned earlier your body biomechanically just won't let you and its instead gonna compensate by lifting your heels up and or bending your torso forward for example so in order to both indirectly boost your quad gains and improve your form you need to focus more on your ankle mobility and although lifting shoes will slightly help with this I think the vast majority of lift additions still be doing more ankle mobility work regardless and this can be easily done by just getting into the habit of regularly doing the following first roll at the bottom of your feet and calves side to side as well as your shins just to loosen up the soft tissue then you want to move on to a couple of dynamic ankle mobility drills like the need of wall drill and or a weighted stretch like I'm doing here for example but by regularly doing a routine like this especially right before your actual leg workout you're going to drastically improve your ability to apply the various tweaks I mentioned in this video and hence a boost your quad growth in the long run guys I hope this video was useful for you and I hope that helped clear up why you may not have been seeing the leg growth that you're after and for a step-by-step program that avoids these mistakes for you and applies the science to enable you to build muscle and add size as effectively as possible just like Brian over here did in just 9 months then simply head on over to built with science comm and take the starting point quiz to discover what program is best suited for you anyways guys thank you so much for watching hope you enjoyed this one please don't forget to show your support by giving the video a like leaving a comment down

    "title": "How to Increase Your Testosterone NATURALLY (18 Studies)",
    "published_at": "2018-04-29T14:05:13Z",
    "transcript": "huge thank you to hims for sponsoring this video if you ask the average gym goer with the most important hormone is for muscle growth they probably say testosterone and in this case they'd be right study after study has demonstrated testosterones ability to enhance muscle growth take this paper from basin and colleagues for example eight men were injected with 600 milligrams of testosterone over the course of 10 weeks which Rose their testosterone levels to roughly 3 times higher than the highest testosterone levels you can expect to achieve naturally as a result despite performing no resistance training whatsoever these men were still able to gain 7 pounds of lean muscle and improve their overall strength which is a feat that would likely not be possible naturally now this is pretty cool and all but the real question is how would naturally increase in your testosterone levels affect muscle growth well the truth is it's relatively unclear at the moment but a few studies are able to provide us with some insight 1 2016 study by Mouser and colleagues states that testosterone levels for adult men can range from anywhere between 240 to 950 nanograms per deciliter with the average being somewhere in the middle of this range and what's interesting is that multiple studies have found that when men who were at the lower end of this range increased their testosterone levels to average or above average they saw significant increases in muscle mass and strength even when the old resistance training was performed so what's clear that if you have lower than normal testosterone levels then increasing it can definitely enhance muscle growth but unless you have male hypogonadism or experience obvious symptoms of low testosterone like low sex drive or erectile dysfunction then chances are you probably have normal levels so the real question now is what effect would increase in your testosterone levels from average to above average levels have on muscle growth well again research is definitely lacking in this area however one 2016 study showed that those at the higher end of the normal testosterone range had greater lean muscle mass and lower levels of body fat compared to those with average or below average levels and this finding was still significant even when race age activity and protein intake was accounted for which does support the idea that increasing your testosterone levels to the higher range naturally may very well enhance muscle growth research also illustrates that testosterone plays a big factor when it comes to fat loss for example this 2003 papers showed that when researchers decreased subjects testosterone levels from average to below average levels they saw a dramatic 36 percent increase in fat mass in addition optimal testosterone levels are essential for a variety of other factors as well and becomes especially important as you age since it helps slow down muscle loss and since your testosterone levels begin to decrease by around 1 to 2 percent per year starting from some time in your 30s it would likely be in your best interest to learn what you can do to naturally increase your levels of this hormone so what exactly can you do well one popular belief is that the large increase in testosterone caused by the use of heavy compound movements is what makes them so effective although it's true that testosterone spikes to a meaningful degree after compound movements this actually doesn't last for very long and in the words of researcher dr. Brad Schoenfeld well I can't dismiss that acute hormonal elevations may play a role in the growth process I'm quite confident in saying that if such an effect does in fact exist it would be of small significance therefore relying on this might not be the best approach so with that being said let's take a look at a few more effective options for increasing testosterone in the long term the first thing you can do is to stay within a certain range of body fat that isn't too low and isn't too high research shows that as body fat levels rise your testosterone Falls whereas your estrogen levels actually increase researchers have noted that this is probably because the more fat you have the higher your aroma taste enzyme activity which converts testosterone to estrogen so by lowering your body fat you lower the activity of this enzyme and more testosterone is left unconverted as for how much of an increase you can expect to see it will depend on how much fat you have to lose 1 2013 meta-analysis found that based on 20 relevant studies overweight subjects were able to experience an average testosterone increase of 100 20 nanograms per deciliter after losing a significant amount of fat which was roughly equivalent to a 20 to 50 percent increase in testosterone levels now this doesn't mean you want to lower your body fat to extreme levels since this can be detrimental as well but there is likely an optimal range that you want to stay in which seems to be around 8 to 15 percent and is why I recommend staying within this range even when bulking the second thing you can do is to correct deficiencies in your diet now although to optimize testosterone levels it's recommended that you eat a balanced macronutrient ratio of protein carbs and fat most people already seem to be doing this where most people fail though is with micronutrients and the two main micronutrients that seem to affect house Austral levels are vitamin D and zinc one 2011 study showed that one year of daily vitamin D supplementation in those who were deficient increased testosterone levels by 20% and another study from the Journal of nutrition showed that daily supplementation of zinc in males that were deficient almost doubled their testosterone levels in just three months and since multiple studies have indicated that zinc and vitamin D deficiencies are in fact very prevalent I would advise ensuring that your in taking adequate zinc and vitamin D from your diet or through supplementation which is actually very affordable the third thing you can do to increase testosterone in the long term is to get adequate sleep multiple studies have shown a strong positive correlation between Kotal sleep time and total testosterone levels with one study showing that subjects who routinely slept for four hours a night had testosterone levels that were roughly half that of subjects who routinely slept for eight hours a night in fact each hour below eight hours of sleep seemed to drop testosterone levels by around 15% therefore aiming for around 8 hours of quality sleep on a consistent basis would be ideal now aside from the previous recommendations there are various other ways to increase testosterone but are of less significance since it increases only short-term for example just being sexually aroused or conversing with an attractive woman is enough to briefly spike testosterone levels to a large degree whereas on the other and being around a woman while she's crying is enough to decrease testosterone by 12% but again this effect doesn't last for long so unless you're constantly sexually aroused or constantly around crying women these won't have a very big impact rather I'd suggest sticking to the three main points I covered and you'll likely be able to make a meaningful difference in terms of your testosterone levels and experience the many benefits that come with it that's pretty much it for the video guys thank you so much for watching I hope you enjoyed it and found it useful I also just wanted to quickly thank hims for sponsoring this video for those of you who don't know hims offers personalized recommendations for prescription and non-prescription hair loss and sexual wellness products for men and these recommendations are based on the advice of real doctors we will speak with online rather than having to visit a doctor in person and for those of you who are unaware 66% of men will face hair loss by the age of 35 and 26% of new erectile dysfunction cases are reported by men under the age of 40 and despite these issues being so prevalent I think this is just something that US guys don't really like talking about which can make finding a solution difficult but the great thing about hims is that it eliminates a process of you having to go to an actual clinic in order to address these issues instead this can all be done completely confidentially online yet the products you can receive are still medical grade and at an affordable price and luckily for you guys hims is offering views of this channel a one-month trial of their comprehensive hair kit all for just $5 which is normally up to a sixty seven dollar value you can get this deal by simply going to four hems com forward slash Jeremy or click in the first link in the description box down below I highly suggest that those of you who are interested take advantage of this deal while you can because they truly are unique in the way that they offer science-based medical grade products that are personalized for you so again huge thank you to hims for hooking us up anyways that's it for this video guys sorry for my less frequent uploads lately I've been spending my time working on my online programs which I'm hoping to get up soon but

    "title": "The BEST Treadmill Sprints Workout to Burn Fat Quickly (HIIT Training)",
    "published_at": "2017-07-09T17:46:07Z",
    "transcript": "what is up guys today i'm going to be showing you how to do high-intensity interval training on the treadmill and for those who don't know hit is basically alternating between periods of all-out intensity and rest and it's my preferred method to get it down to really low levels of body fat and although a lot of you already know what it is you're likely not doing it at a high enough intensity to reap the majority of benefits from hit you need to be working at around 85 to 95 percent of your max heart rate in order to maximize fat loss with hit and you can tell when you've reached its intensity when you're breathing so hard that you can't keep a comfortable conversation with someone so when you do your treadmill sprints you want to choose an appropriate incline and speed level that will allow you to reach its high intensity and stay there for a long period of time and this setting will vary for everyone so i suggest using the following as a guideline to follow so if you're a beginner or you're currently sedentary then i suggest starting with a 30 second work interval and a 60 to 90 second rest interval and repeating this for 5 cycles but you want to choose a treadmill speed that is more of a jog for you than a sprint so for example a good treadmill setting would be a speed of 6.5 miles per hour with zero to two incline for your work intervals then once you feel comfortable and your body adapts and you can slowly increase the speed and incline in the future on the other hand if you're more intermediate or advanced then i suggest starting with a 30 second work interval and a 45 second rest interval and repeating this for seven or more cycles but you want to choose a treadmill speed that will put you at an all out sprint or close to it for example i personally use a treadmill speed of around 12 miles per hour at an incline of 5 which allows me to reach around 85 to 95 of my max heart rate throughout the workout but don't worry too much about the numbers guys as this will vary for everyone the key is to choose settings that will require you to work very hard during your workout and in the workout i'll be showing you today i'll be doing the advanced workout all right now let's get started with a workout so you want to warm up for at least five minutes to ensure that your legs are prepared for the workout i suggest doing the following perform some leg swings and then walk in the treadmill for two minutes and then jog for one minute and then do more of a run slash fast jog for one minute and then walk again for around one minute to catch your breath and then you can bump up the speeding incline and get started with your sprints [Music] and one important tip i thought i mentioned is how to get off the treadmill for your rest interval i suggest lifting yourself up by grabbing onto the side handles of the treadmill and then putting your feet on the outer sides of the treadmill then you can safely lower the speed to a walk-in pace for the remainder of your rest interval another option is just to stay running on the treadmill while you lower the speed but this is a little harder to do another thing i want to mention is that when you go from walking and sprinting it usually takes a treadmill quite a while to adjust the speed so i recommend that you start counting your 30 second work interval once the treadmill has just about reached the sprint speed you set it at or else you'll kind of be heating yourself and something to keep in mind especially when you start sprinting at faster speeds is that you want to try your best to use proper form i won't go too much into depth with this and i know i don't have the best form here but the main things you want to do when sprinting is to stay on the balls of your feet bring your elbows back close to 90 degrees and bring your knees up this will help you conserve energy and sprint more efficiently especially when you get to higher speeds [Music] so this is the type of intensity you want to be working at when you're doing hit you want to be working to the point where you won't be able to keep up conversation with someone if you're not midway through and thinking why the [\u00a0__\u00a0] am i doing this then you're probably not doing it right so i won't show you guys all the cycles that i did but i hope this gives you guys some insight as to how to properly do a hit workout and the intensity that you should be working at it doesn't take long at all to complete actual work time is only around 10 to 20 minutes at max we want to make sure that you do the warm-up that i mentioned earlier and also a proper cooldown period of around two to three minutes of walking now as for how often to do this workout it really depends on your goal body fat percentage and also your current fitness level for beginners i suggest around one to two times per week to start and for more intermediate advanced level fitness anywhere from three to four times a week is ideal another important point i thought i mentioned is that you need to progressively overload your hit workouts in order to prevent reaching fat loss plateaus and you want to do this every two to three weeks hit is great for fat loss especially in stubborn areas but if you aren't making your hip workouts harder your body will adapt and you'll eventually reach a fat loss plateau and i've actually made a video going over that concept in depth and i highly suggest you check it out in order to see the best results you can check that out right here anyways thank you guys for watching i hope you enjoyed the video as always please like and comment below and subscribe to my channel i'll see you next time [Music]"

    "title": "Beginner Takes CREATINE for 30 Days (RESULTS &amp; SIDE EFFECTS)",
    "published_at": "2023-07-30T13:00:21Z",
    "transcript": "creatine is often described as the legal version of steroids making you bigger stronger and more athletic but just how big of a difference can it make for the average Joe and are there any harmful side effects you should know about me Raza our guinea pig a beginner who has never taken creatine in the next 30 days we're going to track his weight muscle size and strength to see just how much this supplement helps or hurts him my name is Raza Catal I'm 26 and I work at build a science I'm actually getting married in three days right after this challenge ends and I want to look thick and juicy in my suits I want to be looking built like my boss and my co-workers so let's see how this turns out so when you first start taking creatine it won't work right away you actually won't experience any benefit until you reach what's known as full saturation this is a point when your muscles creatine stores are completely full typically if you take one five gram scoop of creatine a day you can reach full saturation in about three weeks but you can experience the benefits faster in as little as a week if you use what's known as a loading protocol this involves taking 20 grams of creatine every day for a week however for some individuals ingesting this much creatine at once can create a lot of stomach discomfort what did you say when you warned you about taking 20 grams all at once yeah I told my mama doesn't raise much [Music] 20 grams my stomach hurts my bathroom bowel movements are really messed up the first three days of taking creatine were absolutely hell I went out for dinner with my fiance where we were chilling and relaxing and the creatine really started kicking in and I told my fiance if I don't go home in the next 20 minutes I wouldn't ship myself I got a speeding ticket because I went through a red light because I could not stop hurry up I had to quickly get home to use the restroom it was so bad day two I had stomach pains out the Wazoo it was bad I was in bed and just Agony and pain felt like something was stabbing me in the stomach and like bloated like my face felt fat and it was just a nightmare so the pseudo Ross and stomach pains we spaced out in servings throughout the day and also fully dissolved each dose with water instead of dry scooping it we also made sure he stopped taking his creatine with his pre-workout or any caffeine there's not only some evidence suggesting that taking creatine with caffeine may make it less effective but it also seems to greatly increase the odds of stomach discomfort making these fixes seemed to do all right so after the seven days of loading by now the creatine should be fully saturated in your muscles and is when it'll start working this is when you should scale back your dose to just 5 grams per day to Simply maintain your elevated creatine stores however not everyone responds to create him in fact it's estimated that about 20 to 30 percent of people are non-responders so once you do reach full saturation there's a few benefits and side effects you want to look out for to tell if it's working I gained roughly around one and a half pounds in the first week oh this is a problem it was a big oh moment because I had these suits that were tailored to my body if I don't fit into my suits my fiance will not be happy so when creatine is initially taken into a muscle cell it also draws water into that cell and often causes a slight spike in your body weight as a result on average research seems to show around a one to three pound increase in body weight before it stabilizes although this may sound like a bad thing especially if you're on a diet this water retention can actually make your muscles look and feel a lot Fuller and this is sad that the supplement is working one thing I'm really worried about is uh losing my hair it's already thinning and apparently creatine can make it worse I'll talk to Jeremy about this and see what he has to say so why is hair loss a popular concern when it comes to creatine this goes back to a study published in 2010. researchers took 20 rugby players and split them into a placebo group or creatine group where they followed the loading phase for seven days and then dropped down to maintenance afterwards now throughout this period researchers measured what's known as DHT a hormone known to contribute to male pattern baldness and hair loss in those who are genetically predisposed to it so what happened well the creatine group actually experienced a significant increase in their DHT Levels by about 56 percent after the loading phase which then reduced down to a 40 increase during the maintenance phase so does this mean hair loss is a legitimate concern well first of all the creatine group had lower than average DHT levels to begin with and they increase the experience was still within normal levels also no other study has yet to replicate the results so I honestly think it's not a concern but we will keep an eye on raza's head of hair and see if we notice any differences day 10 is when I noticed that my pull-ups were changing before taking creatine I could to about 9 5 and 5. taking creatine I was able to push out 12 11 11. that was a huge indicator for me that something is going on in my body so if you're a responder to creatine you should notice a slight strength boost across most of your exercises in fact a meta-analysis reviewing 22 creatine studies found that on average trained lifters can expect roughly an eight percent boost in strength and 14 boost in number of Reps for four less experienced lifters like Raza however seem to reap larger benefits with one study showing an average strength increase of 30 percent in untrained individuals bench press I was able to increase five pounds in all my sets shoulder press I'm able to do almost 55 60 pounds on each side and it feels like a dream seeing all this weight change but it's happening I just hit an all-time PR in low incline dumbbell pressed 60 pounds on each side for each arm now Roz has been able to increase almost all his exercises by around five pounds or so as well as do at least a couple more reps which seems to align well with the research but in addition to the strength benefits one study surveying 52 NCAA athletes found that 81 percent of them reported faster recovery from the training after taking creatine so once you do reach full saturation pay attention to how fast to recover between your workouts as that's another indicator that is working [Music] all right my man it's day 30. yeah it's exciting let's see where we're at going into J30 I did not know what to expect damn you look good man your shoulders look a bit wider arms look a bit juicier 38 centimeters so that's from 36. so two centimeters and you're not bsing it too hard okay just over 125 centimeters what I started at 120 centimeters yeah but just from this area I'm a little worried now I have to fit into my wedding suit taking creatine is not a magic pill I still had to watch my nutrition and I still had to train hard but it still gave me that little boost being a beginner and I'm definitely gonna keep taking it yo Verizon what are you doing dude I love this stuff I need more gains quicker games honestly guys even I was shocked at the results I personally don't think I'm a responder to creatine so seeing his arms and shoulders increase that much in 30 days was surprising now most of this probably is just watering his muscles but it still helped him look bigger and the creatine will definitely indirectly help with his muscle gains over time if he continues taking it I'm happy it worked for him though his wedding suit just barely fit because of his gains but he did get his wish of looking a little more thick and juicy in it and best of all he was able to keep his head of hair and according to his Barber there wasn't any noticeable change that said guys just always keep in mind proper nutrition and hard training will do so much more than taking any supplement well and here's a video you can watch next that will show you how to tweak your workouts to speed up your growth potentially even more than creatine will but if you're looking for a little more help and for a step-by-step plan to transform your body as efficiently as possible just head to buildwescience.com and take my quiz to find

    "title": "How To Pick The Best Protein Powder (CHOOSE WISELY!)",
    "published_at": "2020-12-20T17:30:53Z",
    "transcript": "if you've seen any of my supplement videos then you know i'm a big fan of protein powder because of its practicality and the various advantages and potential muscle building benefits they can provide but once you do decide that you're ready to invest in a protein powder it's important that you first get well informed of the various differences between the various types of protein powders out there as well as the things to look for and things to avoid when you compare different brands by the end of this video you'll know exactly what type of protein is right for you and how to separate the good from the not so good options out there first let's cover what type of protein powder may be best for you despite the overwhelming amount of different protein powders on the market research has made it clear that whey protein comes out on top this is because whey protein is both higher in leucine one of the most important amino acids for muscle growth and more effectively absorbed and used by the body when compared to various other protein powders and other protein sources in general casein protein does come in at a close second with a slightly less leucine and overall protein content but it is a much slower digesting protein than weight in theory this would mean that casein would be the more effective option to take as a pre-sleep meal so that we can stimulate protein synthesis overnight however recent research seems to suggest that any high quality protein such as whey would do the job just as effectively so whey seems to be the best option but whey protein can be further broken down into three different types weight concentrate whey isolate and whey hydrolysate the main differences here is that whey concentrate can range anywhere from 35 to 80 protein and typically contains the highest amount of lactose carbs and fats whereas whey isolates although typically a bit more costly have to go through an additional filtration process and are required to be at least 90 protein by weight and therefore have considerably less fats and carbs hydrolysates on the other hand are whey concentrates or isolates that have just been pre-digested to help with its absorption but have not been shown to be any more effective at increasing size or strength as the other two options yet is typically the most expensive option so essentially it's just like buying chicken whey concentrates can be thought of chicken thighs they deliver a good amount of protein but come with additional fat and calories whereas whey isolate can be thought of as chicken breast a bit more costly than thighs but pack a much higher protein content with less additional fat and calories whereas whey hydrolysate could be thought of as extra lean ground chicken breasts it goes through a bit more processing is typically the most expensive option yet it delivers the same amount of protein relative to calories fats and carbs as chicken breast does meaning that for the best bang for your buck for most people a good quality whey isolate protein is your best bet as it delivers the highest amount of protein and is slightly better for those who are lactose intolerant or just tend to have digestive issues in general now as for plant-based options this can be a good option if you do have intolerances or sensitivities to weight the problem with plant-based proteins though is that they tend to be deficient in certain essential amino acids and are less effective at promoting protein synthesis than whey is but research has shown that you can partially compensate for this by combining different plant-based protein sources for example p protein is low in the essential amino acid methionine whereas rice protein contains considerably more methionine but is lower in the essential amino acid lysine meaning that when you look for a plant-based protein powder one with a good blend of rice and pea protein would likely be the best option soy protein although subject to much controversy is another good plant-based option since it has a good amount of all the essential amino acids and is therefore something worth considering now after you've chosen the protein powder that best suits your needs the next step is learning how to separate the good brands from the not so good brands because unfortunately there's a lot of tricks that supplement companies can use to deceive you and to help us out with this is examine.com researcher bill willis who has done a considerable amount of research and work within this exact topic so bill the first thing that you recommend that we look out for is the use of something that's called proprietary blends would you mind just explaining a little bit more about what exactly that is and then what that means for us as a consumer sure yeah that's something you have to watch out for uh with any protein product the issue is that most whey proteins in particular are made of isolates and concentrates generally sometimes some protein hydrolysates and what you'll find is uh you know a proprietary blend on the listing label and in this blend uh the company doesn't really have to disclose uh the amount of anything that's in that blend so for instance uh if you look at the back of a label of whey protein powder and it's uh it's a blend of whey concentrate and isolate you know that's great concentrate can be good an effective source of protein as can isolate but the issue is is that the concentrate could be a really cheap low quality one and there could be just a tiny little trace amount of isolate so in that example let's say you an unscrupulous manufacturer put a proprietary blend in there because they got a delivery of some really cheap way concentrate that they got for a good price that was low quality in this case that weight concentrate could be you know as low as 25 or 30 total protein now uh the the claims on the label in terms of the pro the total protein content may be met with that blend you know everything might be on the up and up there but what you can look out for is the is the serving size in particular is how much protein is present per serving relative to the serving size um so you take a look at the label and let's say you're you know you're dealing with whey protein and product a is in a 35 gram total serving let's say there's 20 grams of total protein that's going to be relatively low indicating a lower quality protein on the other hand let's say for that same 35 gram serving size another type of whey has maybe 25 or even up to 28 grams in that total 35 gram serving size that one would be higher quality and that's what you want to look out for you want to get the protein with the most total protein per serving those proteins are higher purity otherwise you'll be paying for less of what you really need in a protein and more of just the junk and the fillers as far as i know even if we do look at the protein content on the back of the label there's still another loophole that companies can actually use to deceive us and this was something that's called protein spiking yeah what exactly is protein spiking and again how can us as consumers avoid falling into this trap yeah that's uh that's a dirty trick um and how dirty it is i guess depends on what exactly they do so protein spiking uh is adding uh non-protein nitrogen-containing substances to the protein powder that will be measured as protein and the thing is that the fda tests just total nitrogen levels and it's a quick and dirty way to assess protein content now the manufacturer could add extra nitrogen containing agents in there that aren't protein creatine is commonly used or maybe a cheap free-form amino acid such as glutamine and again you'll see this in like a proprietary blend you might see whey isolate weight concentrate and then uh glutamine well you know you don't know exactly how much of which is in there and that's when they do it legally when they do it in illegally they're just going to throw any extra nitrogen containing substance in there and it's not going to be stated on the label the latter is as i mentioned just a little sneakier it's a little harder to detect i guess again what you could also do is just look at the ingredients label and avoid protein blends avoid like you mentioned amino acids glutamine or amino acid matrix matrices or amino acid blends as those are potential indications that the protein has actually been spiked yeah yeah actually you have to watch for that because a lot of times the these proprietary blends or especially like the amino acid matrix will will show up in their marketing like you'll you'll be thumbing through a fitness magazine and you know you'll see this big bright shiny uh bottle of protein and you know the superhero looking like people that are you know supposedly got their physique that way and uh you know proprietary amino acid matrix um they sort of use that it's hidden in plain sight in a way um the consumer links you know this this fancy term uh to the physique of the you know whoever they're getting to endorse the product and really that's where they're hiding you know the lack of protein quality on the label so you really have to watch out for that look for brands that fully disclose the amount of amino acid or the amino acid profile rather of their protein this helps indicate that they're fully transparent about the specific amino acid content of their product and are less likely to have spiked it the last and final thing to look out for is contamination third-party testing results from a 2018 analysis by the clean label project found that among 134 tested protein powders the vast majority of them had detectable levels of heavy metals and plastic derivatives as a result of their ingredient sourcing and manufacturing practices now detectable does not mean dangerous but many of these protein powders did indeed have levels that surpass the acceptable levels which is something you'd obviously want to avoid and this is a common occurrence because supplement companies aren't required to test their products for contaminants and are instead left voluntarily to run those tests if they wish to pay the additional cost which as you'd expect many companies just don't do so to minimize your risk as a consumer simply do a little bit of digging around to see what their testing protocols are and specifically what they test for and looking for certifications such as nsf and gmp on their website are also good signs and indications that they take their quality control practices seriously so to sum the video up here are the main points to keep in mind and look out for when you purchase your protein if you're going to be investing in protein powder it's worth putting in that additional effort to ensure that what you're getting is a high quality product aligned with your specific goals for step-by-step program that applies the same

    "title": "The ONLY 2 Exercises That Built My Six Pack Abs",
    "published_at": "2024-09-08T13:00:36Z",
    "transcript": "there's over 500 ab exercises out there but only two that actually help me build my six-pack because to get welldefined abs it's not just about having low body fat that were true why is it that some people get really lean yet you still can't see their abs whereas others with just as much or even more body fat have abs that pop of course there's a genetic aspect to this but it also comes down to how you train them so back in 2017 researchers had 28 soccer players trained their abs for 10 weeks and measured how much their abs grew now the ABS exercises they used weren't the best options I'll show you later on but it still led to some pretty good results on average their upper abs grew by 2.1 mm their middle ABS by 1.9 mm and their lower abs grew the most by 2.7 mm this might not sound like much but even a few millimet can make a big difference in terms of how defined your abs are you see you can make them more B ible by reducing the layer of fat between your abs and your skin but another overlooked way is just to increase the size of your abs so they poke through that fat more this is especially useful if like me you're a hard Gainer who wasn't naturally blessed with thick ABS to begin with but here's the thing most app exercises you see online won't help you actually build your six-pack take planks or even butterfly kaks for instance these are both great core strengthening exercises but they'll do next to nothing for actually grow in your abs why well all they're really doing is stabilizing your core like they would during a compound movement trying to plank your way to bigger ABS is kind of like trying to wallit your way to bigger quads see the main function of your abs is to bring your rib cage and pelvis together by rounding the spine and so this brings us to one of the most common myths I hear about effective AB training when performing ab exercises you've got to keep your back straight take leg raises for instance for you years these were my go-to app exercise and it turns out I was doing them wrong pretty much all of the time because of this advice see if your back stays flat and all you do is you swing your legs up and down into an l-shape then your abs will contract to stabilize but really it's going to be your hip flexors that do all the work and it's not just leg raises this is a common problem with most ab exercises at least with how they're typically done but the thing is it's actually pretty easy to build your abs once you stop letting your hip flexes do all the work and the nice part is you can emphasize either your upper abs or your lower abs more based on the type of exercise you do so to keep things simple let me just share my two favorite exercises for both and the ones I really credit for building my six-pack let's start with the lower abs so a lot of new research suggests that muscle regions closest to the moving body part will grow the most so for example leg curls have been found to grow the lower hamstrings more than deadlifts which seem to emphasize the upper hamstrings more so to Target the lower abs we just want an exercise where the bottom half of our body moves towards the top half and even though I now know how to do leg raises with correct form I actually still prefer another exercise see if you've been keeping up with my recent videos especially the one where I explained how to build muscle twice as fast you know that muscles seem to grow best when they're challenged in their most stretch position and I'm actually funding and helping run a study start in this month to investigate this further but so far the evidence is quite promising but the problem with leg raises is they challenge your abs closer to the top when they're contracted we want an exercise that does the opposite so how do we accomplish that simple we can make it more difficult at the start by laying back on a bench and doing reverse crunches but you've got to remember what I just said about your hip flexors if your back stays straight they're going to be doing most of the work so instead bend your knees in towards your body and think about raising your hips up and crunching your knees towards your chest to actually round your spine think c-shape instead of l-shape go up as far as you can then slowly control the way down but I'll admit this is a tough exercise so let me first show you a more beginner friendly version followed by a more advanced version that you can gradually work up to for beginners bring your knees closer to your chest and try to just lift your tailbone Off the Bench without swinging your legs if you can do that you'll still be effectively hitting your low ABS once it get stronger try to get higher and higher and then gradually straighten your legs up more to simulate the effect of adding weight to the movement and if you want to make this even more effective then you want to increase the stretch your abs get at the bottom and for that I'd highly recommend getting an ABM and placing that between your lower back and the bench and I'll leave an Amazon link to the one I recommend in the description box down below but now let's move on to the upper abs so for the lower abs we wanted to bring the lower body up towards the Torso but now we want the opposite an exercise where we're now folding the upper body towards the lower body again I'll show a beginner version first and then a more advanced version I've personally been seeing amazing results with now the easiest way to hit the upper abs as a beginner is with crunches but again you've got to avoid the all too common mistake of flattening your spine and moving in an l-shape instead think about folding your chest down towards your pelvis into a c-shape your spine should extend out to stretch your abs and then your abs should contract to fold your chest over your pelvis now with crunches just try to get your shoulder blades off the ground any higher and it's just going to be your hip flexors taken over but again if you want even better results from each rep then you need to use an appat trust me this fixes a lot of issues with these ab exercises as it gives them enough of a stretch and challenge in that bottom position you can also always use a stability ball Bosa ball or at the very least a rolled up towel with which as you can see still lengthens the ABS just a little bit more but once crunches become too easy I'd highly recommend moving onto a rope cable Crunch and last time I'll say it but you've got to pay attention to your hip flexes with this one too if your hips are swinging back to your heels of your rep you're just using momentum and your hip flexes to move the weight again focus on the spine lock your hips at 90\u00b0 lock your arms next to your ears and then contract your upper abs as you try to fold your chest down onto your abs when done properly your hips should remain in one position while your spine extends and arches on the way up to stretch your abs and then rounds on the way down as your abs fully contract now it might take a few reps to get the hang of these if you've never done them before but once you do feel comfortable I'd highly recommend making them even more effective by turning around and crunching away from the cable now all the same tips apply you just have to get used to balancing and maybe go a little bit lighter to start out a longer rope also helps with this one but once you do get it right you should feel that the movement is now a lot harder in that beginning position exactly what we're going for but here's an important tip you should know about growing your abs train them like any other muscle hard with Progressive overload but also give them time to rest I personally recommend doing three sets of each exercise for six to 12 reps once you can do 12 Reps for all three sets then bump up the difficulty or add a little bit more weight start with training them once a week and if you're really serious bump it up to twice a week but honestly you can have the largest ABS in the world and they'll still remain hidden if they're covered by too much fat to get the best results you want to combine AB training with a proper plan to get rid of the excess bat covering your abs so give this video watch next where I cover the best science back approach to do just that but if you're looking for more guidance and just want a proven step-by-step plan that takes care of all the guest work for you just head over to build to science.com to find the best program for you and your body thanks

    "title": "The Best Meal Plan To Lose Fat Faster (EAT LIKE THIS!)",
    "published_at": "2020-04-19T16:11:34Z",
    "transcript": "if you've watched any of my past nutrition videos or even attempted a diet of your own then you're probably aware of the notion that at the end of the day for weight loss it's all about calories in versus calories out as long as you're eating at a calorie deficit and ideally having enough protein as well then you're going to successfully lose weight and strip off fat regardless of what and when you eat now while scientifically speaking this is true and it is the basic law of thermodynamics what this simplistic model fails to account for is how the various foods you put into your body actually then go about affecting these two variables because research has shown that while yes at the end of the day calories are what matter most if you want to truly lose fat as efficiently and as quickly as possible then you need to go beyond just calories and instead pay close attention to the types of foods that make up the calories you're ingesting every day and also how you go about ingesting them as that's what makes all the difference in this video i'll go through three swaps that you'll want to make in your diet that accounts for those variables and can enable you to lose fat faster and then i'll provide you with a sample meal plan that puts all this together for you the first swap you want to make with your diet is to stick them mostly with foods that have been minimally processed so for example foods like oats and multigrain bread as opposed to their refined counterparts such as cereal and white bread that have been stripped of most of their important nutrients and fiber not only are these less processed foods beneficial when dieting in the sense that they generally provide more nutrients and keep us fuller for longer but they also have another unique benefit that has to do with something called the thermic effect of food which is the amount of calories that our body burns to metabolize and actually use the foods that we ingest and one of the unique fat loss benefits about unprocessed foods is that in most cases our body burns significantly more calories when digesting unprocessed foods than it does when compared to their processed counterparts for instance one study compared the caloric burn required to digest and metabolize two minimally processed sandwiches consisting of whole grain bread and real cheddar cheese versus two highly processed sandwiches that instead consisted of white bread and processed cheese although both meals consisted of virtually the same amount of total calories and protein the more processed sandwich had a 50 lower thermic effect and as a result the body burns significantly less calories digesting it than it did with the whole grain sandwiches similarly a six week randomized controlled trial has subjects stick to a diet consisting of either less processed whole grain foods such as oats brown rice and whole grain bread versus a calorie and macronutrient equated diet consisting of more processed refined grains instead such as cereal white rice and white bread what they found is that the group that stuck with whole grain foods burned on average roughly 100 more calories per day just from digesting and metabolizing their food than the processed food group did and to put this into perspective given that the average person burns roughly 100 calories to jog a mile you'd essentially be doing the equivalent of jogging an extra mile a day just by choosing to incorporate whole grain less processed foods as opposed to more processed foods for most of your meals and if you crunch the numbers over three months this simple change would theoretically enable you to burn 2.5 pounds more fat just by making that switch so yes wild calories are what matter most and while you definitely will still burn fat despite eating processed foods as long as you're still in a calorie deficit you can further influence the calories outside of the equation and potentially speed up the fat loss process by simply swapping these foods for whole grain less processed foods instead and let them do the work for you next let's dive into how you then go about distributing your meals throughout the day because while yes again your total daily calorie intake is what matters most for fat loss it turns out that the manner in which you distribute these calories throughout the day seems to be more important than we've previously been led to believe illustrating this is a recent 2020 paper and another similarly designed 2015 paper that compared the effects of using a more front heavy distribution approach by allocating more calories to breakfast versus a back heavy approach by allocating more calories to dinner instead what the researchers found is that subjects using the front heavy approach not only experienced significantly less hunger and significantly less cravings for sweets throughout the day but they also experience greater overall energy levels meaning that they were able to adhere to the diet more easily and they likely burn more calories throughout the day from fidgeting walking and just moving more in general because of their increased energy levels and in fact this protocol was also repeated in a longitudinal weight loss study which found that subjects using a front heavy approach lost more weight decreased their waist circumference to a greater degree and reported greater hunger control over a period of 12 weeks when compared to a group that used a back heavy approach by simply swapping the breakfast and dinner calories indicating that there does seem to be some indirect fat loss benefits to allocating more calories to your meals early on in the day and this is something that i personally noticed as well i used to be someone who would save a lot of my calories from my evening meals because i knew that that's when my cravings would really hit but when i instead experimented with shifting more and more calories to early on in the day and i'm at breakfast i found that not only did my energy levels throughout the day and my gym performance considerably improved but i also just wasn't craving things as much at night because i just wasn't as hungry now obviously this does vary for the individual and may depend on when your workout takes place but regardless i would highly suggest even if you're intermittent fasting for example to at least experiment with just shifting more and more of your calories to your first meals of the day as this does seem to have some unique benefits in terms of enabling you to control your cravings to burn more calories and potentially create greater fat less results in the long run as a result now the last swap is something i've covered in my past videos and it's to not only choose mostly unprocessed foods to include in your diet but you want to also choose the ones that are highly satiating and proven to do the best job at suppressing your appetite as this will enable you to better adhere to your diet and minimize any excess snacking you may be doing throughout the day that's sabotaging your calorie deficit and based on the findings from the satiety index which examined the effects of 38 different common foods on hunger levels we can clearly see that on a calorie for calorie comparison some options are just better than others when it comes to controlling your appetite for example even with calories equated four simply swapping whole grain bread for oats instead will provide a 25 greater effect on suppressing your hunger and similarly swapping brown rice for whole grain pasta or boiled potatoes instead will provide a 30 or 60 percent boost in satiation respectively so what i'd suggest is look over the index and experiment with swapping some of these more satiated foods into your diet and just see how your body and appetite responds now to put everything together for you let's go through a sample meal plan that not only incorporates these various tips for you but also tastes great i'll use roughly 2 100 calories for this meal plan but keep in mind that you want to adjust the portion sizes based on what's needed for you to be at a calorie deficit this is going to vary for everyone so to start we'll be allocating most of the calories towards breakfast with protein pancakes made completely of highly satiated minimally processed foods for these first blend the oats to make an oat flour and then you want to add the rest of the ingredients into blend then simply cook them over a pan and top them with peanut butter sugar-free syrup sauteed apples or whatever you'd prefer [Music] for lunch we'll be tapering down the calories slightly but still sticking with satiating unprocessed foods with baked salmon boiled potatoes and a side of sauteed asparagus [Music] then to keep you going until dinner you can have an orange and can even plant in a protein shake as well depending on when your workout is and then for dinner we'll continue tapering down the calories slightly with baked chicken breasts and a side of veggies roasted in olive oil [Music] and then after dinner to help satisfy whatever sweet cravings may have popped up we'll make a simple high protein greek yogurt parfait consisting of zero percent fat plain greek yogurt mixed in with cinnamon and stevia for sweetness and then top with frozen mixed berries and a tablespoon of chia seeds super easy to make yet extremely satisfying so hopefully that meal plan gives you a little more insight into how you can start planning your meals based on what i went through while still keeping everything tasty and satisfying and just keep in mind that although some of the swaps i mentioned here can definitely help speed up the fat loss process just know that at the end of the day adhering to a calorie deficit is what's most important so experiment with your diet and stick to what you find works best for you and your lifestyle and for an all-in-one step-by-step program that not only optimizes your weekly workouts for you but also shows you how to structure and set up your diet with the right foods and in the right amount so that you can burn fat as efficiently and as easily as possible with science and simply head on over to buildwithscience.com and take the analysis quiz to discover which program is best for you and where your body is currently

    "title": "The Best Glutes Workout To Grow Your Flat Butt (GYM OR HOME!)",
    "published_at": "2021-09-06T14:32:46Z",
    "transcript": "i'm gonna show you a glutes workout with five of the best exercises to grow your butt first we'll go through some of the science behind growing your glutes to teach us the two muscles to focus on then we'll go through all the exercises which you can do either at home or at the gym by the end of this video your butt is going to be absolutely beautiful so to understand how to get a bigger butt you first need to know the muscles involved the glutes are composed of three main muscles two of which you want to focus on the glute max is the biggest most visible and most powerful glute muscle its primary function is the pushing of your hips forward the glute medius is the second biggest muscle and is located on the sides of your upper butt this muscle plays an important role in keeping our hips balanced when we move so that our bigger glute max can actually do its job it also has a unique function which is the moving of your thigh away from your body's midline so the first second and last exercise in a workout will target the glute max in three different ways the third and fourth exercise will target the glute medius as something called a superset so knowing that let's get right into exercise one the deadlift is going to be our primary heavy exercise for the glute max since it mainly involves pushing your hips forward but there's a few tweaks that we'll want to make to it to ensure that the glutes are actually doing most of the work if you only have access to dumbbells you can still apply many of these tweaks in the same way so first we're going to use a foot stance that's about hip width with the toes slightly pointed outwards this is important because too wide of a stance such as with a sumo deadlift will shorten the range of motion and limit the ability of our glutes to push the hips forward once you're in your deadlift position you're going to squeeze your glutes hard and push your knees out against your elbows you should feel more of your glute muscles turn on from doing this from here brace your core tuck your chin and then push your feet through the floor while driving your hips forward to stand up it's important to shift your thinking from pulling the bar up to pushing the floor away with your legs and driving your hips forward to get the weight up this will ensure that your glutes rather than your lower back are moving the weight on the way down we're simply going to reverse this motion with your knees slightly bent push your hips back to lower the bar but only push your hips back as far as they can before your lower back starts to round otherwise the tension will shift from your glutes to your lower back instead when done properly you should feel a deep stretch in your glutes and hamstrings as you lower the bar once the bar is just past your knees squat it down and then reset if you're using dumbbells however you'll want to instead stop just past your knees before coming back up rather than trying to go all the way down to the floor you're going to perform three sets of six heavy reps with three to four minutes of rest between each set okay so now we're going to move on to an exercise that will still demand the glute max to work hard but will add a new balance requirement on the glutes that you don't get with deadlifts body weight walking lunges are going to be our exercise of choice but with three tweaks applied to it to make it more effective than your standard lunge first tweak we're going to align your body into a position to shift more of the tension to your glutes rather than your quads this can be done by slightly leaning your upper body forward while keeping your head in line and maintain that position as you lunge tweak number two instead of simply stepping up after each lunge think about stepping forward use your front leg to propel and pull yourself forward as if there was a thin wall of glass in front of you and you're trying to lunge through to break it now the third tweak is a little bit tricky to do but will put more stretch on the glutes in the bottom position to require them to work harder for you to return to the starting position to do it at the bottom position of each lunge take your hands and apply some resistance to guide your front knee inwards then push your knee back against your resistant hand as you stand up with these tweaks applied you're gonna do two sets of ten reps on each leg with about two minutes of rest between each set alright so now it's time to have some fun we're gonna focus on the glute medius with the super set i first came across from coach paul carter where we'll perform two exercises back to back without any rest the first exercise is a slow controlled movement and it may not look like much range of motion but it's going to ensure that tension is placed on your glutes rather than your lower back to perform it put a cable setting down to its lowest notch and connect the strap around your ankle if you don't have a cable you can set up a band wrapped around both legs or looped around a fixture instead once you're set up grab a pull or any fixture for balance keep your torso upright tuck your chin and brace your core now remember our glute medius muscle it has a specific function to bring the leg away from the middle of our body so from here you're going to sweep your heel back but also slightly out to the side at roughly a 30 degree angle go only as far as you can without arching your lower back and without excessively tilting to the left or right execute this properly and you should feel a good burn in the upper side portion of your butt okay so once you're done 12 reps on the one leg you're going to immediately transition to our next exercise which will also work the glute medius but will now do so by challenging it to keep the knee and hip stable as we move you're going to grab a pair of dumbbells elevate your back leg up onto a platform or a stack of books if you're at home and get into a split stance position with the leg that you just worked with the last exercise as your front leg keep about eighty percent of your weight in your front leg and the other twenty percent in the back just for balance like a kickstand tuck your chin and bend your torso over just like we did earlier with the glute focus lunges from here drop your back knee towards the ground to get more glute involvement rather than quads as you lower self i want you to keep the shin of your front leg straight up over your foot rather than bending it forward once you reach the bottom position use your front leg to push back up and repeat for a total of 12 reps once complete you're gonna finish off your superset by using the other leg on both exercises and then repeat that two more times for a total of three supersets for each leg from the deadlifts and lunges we did earlier the glutes were challenged the most at the bottom position when the glutes were fully stretched this is one way to stimulate growth but another way to stimulate growth is with exercises that are most challenging at the top position when the glutes are fully contracted this is where our last movement comes into play i'm going to show a gym version and a home version for you to pick from so the jib version is the 45 degree hip extension to maximize glutes activation with it we're going to use a few technique tips that i covered in a previous video i made with glutes researcher brett contreras first to maximize the range of motion for your glutes set up the pads such as just below your hips brace your core tuck your chin and then bend at your hips to pull yourself down from here visualize two points at the top and bottom of your butt cheeks squeeze your butt hard to try to bring these two points together to pull yourself up when done properly you should feel a very strong contraction in your glutes at this top position so for the home version all you're going to need is a stack of books you're going to come down flatten your back against the floor brace your core and then place one foot on the stack of books and the other foot straight like this and then from here you're going to push down against the stack of books raise your other leg to 90 degrees and squeeze your glute hard hold this for about one to two seconds but avoid excessively arching your back keep a straight line and you're gonna come back down and repeat for what reps and congratulations you have just finished a great booty building workout beautiful you can implement this glutes workout once a week or implement the exercises into your other workouts throughout the week if you'd prefer either way i hope you're able to see the importance of carefully selecting your exercises as well as performing them in a way that maximizes growth for the target muscle within our built with science programs we apply that to each and every one of the workouts we provide to join today just head on

    "title": "The Best Rotator Cuff Strengthening Routine (BULLETPROOF YOUR SHOULDERS)",
    "published_at": "2019-07-14T16:23:17Z",
    "transcript": "if you want to lose your gains in the fastest way possible than is simple get injured because nothing is going to set you back more than injuries will and your quest to build muscle and lose fat with the shoulder injuries not only being one of the most common injuries lifters experience but also one of the worst injuries for your gains since it often prevents you from doing any upper body training whatsoever so how can you prevent this from happening well aside from choosing the right exercises and performing them correctly there's also a key set of four muscles surrounding the shoulder joint collectively termed the rotator cuff the lifters often unknowingly overlook leading to these muscles becoming underdeveloped and weak as a result this is detrimental since these four muscles collectively act to help stabilize your shoulder joint during the various pushing and pulling movements you perform in the gym and when these muscles become weak it causes a great deal of instability in the shoulder during your lifts which often leads to shoulder pain and pigment and eventually even rotator cuff tears and although these muscles do get indirectly worked in many of the gym exercises that you're doing they often end up getting taken over by stronger muscle groups like the delts in the chest which creates harmful imbalances and your shoulders over time meaning that you should be directly training and strengthening the rotator cuff because by doing so you'll be better able to prevent shoulder injury from occurring alleviate any shoulder pain that you're currently feeling and likely boost your strength in the gym as well but in order to best strengthen these four muscles and bulletproof your shoulders it's vital that you both choose the right exercises for each of them and perform them in the right manner and in this video with the help of current scientific literature and/or anatomical understanding of these muscles that's exactly what I'll show you how to do the first exercise is something called the full cam which is going to target the supraspinatus muscle of the rotator cuff this exercise is likely your best bet for strengthening this muscle since as shown in 2007 EMG analysis when compared to other rotator cuff exercises the full can elicits a high amount of EMG activity of the supraspinatus with the least amount of deltoid activity which is beneficial as this has been shown to reduce shear force placed on the shoulder joint and better help strengthen the rotator cuff without having the deltoid compensate by overpowering it but in order to maximize the effectiveness of this exercise it's crucial that you perform the full can exercise correctly start with your arms by your sides with a set of light weights in each hand keep your arms straight and raise them up in the scapular plane as shown here which is both 30 degrees from directly sideways point your thumbs up towards the ceiling and raise your arms up until you reach around shoulder height since research has shown that this is the range of motion where the supraspinatus is most active pause at the top position for a second or two before lowering down and as you perform the movement you want to keep your shoulder blades pinned together and pulled down as research indicates that this both increases joint space and allows you to strengthen the supraspinatus in a more mechanical advantageous position in addition as you raise avoid shrugging your shoulders up and instead keep them down with your upper traps remaining as relaxed as possible throughout each rep implementing the aforementioned tips will help you best strengthen the supraspinatus while minimizing any compensations from other stronger muscle groups i'd suggest starting out with lighter weight for two to three sets of 15 to 20 reps with a focus on form and then over time continue progressing from there the next exercise sideline external rotation is going to be used to target the to posterior rotator cuff muscles at once the infraspinatus and the teres minor and this exercise is your best bet at doing so since as shown in the following - William G grass from a 2004 analysis of the rotator cuff muscles this exercise elicits the highest and first pe\u00f1itas and Terry's minor activation when compared to several other rotator cuff exercises in addition to having the lowest strain on the shoulder joint as well but again to reap the full benefits of this exercise is vital that you performing correctly to start assume a sideline position with a towel roll pinned between your top sidearm and ribcage the towel is a really important step since research has shown that adding a towel role to the exercise boosts EMG activation of the - posterior OT - cuff muscles by roughly 20% as it helps minimize any movement compensation from occurring next pull your shoulder blades back and down and keep them this way as you start doing reps start with your arm parallel to the floor and then while keeping your elbow pinned to your side slowly externally rotate outwards by pulling your hand up towards the ceiling and then return back down to parallel and repeat you want to focus on avoiding letting the elbow drift up off your side as you raise the weight as this will start involving more of the deltoids instead keep the elbow locked in place against the towel at your side as you perform your DREV but if you struggle to do so or you feel pain at the very top position then you can start with partial reps in a pain free zone and then progressively increase the range of motion from there over time I'd suggest starting out with a lighter weight or even no way that first for two to three sets of 15 to 20 reps each side and then progressing from there as you get stronger for the last exercise we're going to move on to something called the external rotation press which is going to challenge and strengthen all four rotator cuff muscles to a certain degree now while the prior two exercises are great at strengthening the various rotator cuff muscles many of the movements lifters perform in the gym take place above shoulder height and positions where the shoulder joint becomes more vulnerable to instability and injury therefore is vital to include this exercise to enhance your shoulder stability by training the rotator cuff muscles in a more functional manner to perform it get down on one knee with an upright posture and grab either a band or a cable handle attachment set at roughly shoulder height pull the cable towards you in a rowing motion with your elbow kept high at shoulder height your hand should now be directly in front of your elbow with your arm parallel to the ground hold this position briefly and then externally rotate the shoulder by bringing the hand up towards the ceiling with the elbow still locked in the same place next press your arm up overhead and hold the top position briefly then reverse a pattern and repeat for more reps throughout the movement your rotator cuff muscles will be working hard to counteract the resistance by pulling your arm forward but as you perform each rep you'll want to avoid compensating by arching the lower back as you press up instead keep the core tight and contracted to maintain a neutral back as you perform the movement I suggest starting out with light resistance per roughly 2 to 3 sets of 10 to 15 reps with a focus on slow and controlled execution for each rep now some of you Keener's may have noticed with the previous exercise selection that one of the rotator cuff muscles the subscapularis hasn't really been emphasized as much as the other three have and this is for good reason since the subscapularis is the only rotator cuff that performs internal rotation of the shoulder which most people actually have too much of from poor posture and/or from the many pressing movements in the gym that involve internal rotation so in this case it would be best not to emphasize the subscapularis much and instead focus more so on the other three rotator cuff muscles responsible for external rotation which is exactly what we've done so with that being said here is the full rotator cuff strengthening and routine that you can do using the exercises previously discuss I'd suggest doing this routine roughly two to three times per week but it's absolutely vital that you treat your rotator cuff muscles just like any other muscle group by progressing these exercises over time as you continue to get stronger otherwise you'll honestly just be wasting your time and for a completely free downloadable PDF of this rotator cuff routine that will show you exactly how to safely progress these exercises over time how much weight to use and how to perform each exercise step-by-step then just head on over to built with science comm /r C PDF and I'll send it right over to you it's key muscle groups like the rotator cuff that are often overlooked but really are what's going to protect you from injury and enable you to progress that much faster and that's exactly why within my built with science programs there's a high priority placed on key muscle groups like a rotator cuff which is all integrated into your weekly weights routine such that you can effectively transform your body without developing imbalances in the process to join today

    "title": "How to Perform the Deadlift for Growth (5 Mistakes You\u2019re Probably Making)",
    "published_at": "2018-09-09T14:21:25Z",
    "transcript": "if you're seeking to add upper back thickness accentuate your v taper and build a powerful looking backside then deadlifts should definitely be a staple in your routine as it's one of the best compound exercises to help develop the several muscles that make up your posterior chain and as shown in this 2011 study from the journal strength and conditioning research not only does the deadlift enable you to lift more weight when compared to any other free weights exercise but research also indicates that it's an effective tool to use for improving explosive strength and vertical jump performance making it an all-around effective exercise for size strength and athleticism that should definitely be incorporated into your routine however despite the seemingly straightforward movement pattern of the deadlift if you want to maximize its effectiveness while reducing your risk of injury then there's a lot more that goes into it than simply picking a weight up off the floor chances are if you haven't been coached well on how to properly perform the deadlift then there's a high probability that you're making a mistake or two for example if you can't spot at least two of the mistakes i'm making here then chances are you're likely doing one of them therefore in this video i'll cover the five most common errors people make with a deadlift and more importantly i'll show you how to easily fix them right away one of the most common errors people make with the deadlift is essentially turning it into a squat movement pattern which is mistakenly done by positioning the hips too low and maintaining an upright back during the setup and this is problematic because when the hips are positioned too low your body is placed behind the bar to a greater extent which both creates unfavorable leverages that causes more stress on the lower back and it decreases the amount of weight you can lift since your center of gravity isn't placed in an optimal position so instead what you want to do is when you're in the starting position focus on the following two key points one while keeping your chest up and back straight ensure that your hips are positioned between your knees and your head as opposed to positioning them too low as shown here or too high as shown here the exact angle will vary based on your anatomy but this is a good guideline to follow and two ensure that the bar is positioned directly underneath your scapula if your hips are too low you'll notice that the bar is now positioned in front of the scapula which is just an indication that you should readjust your hip position sticking to these two points will help ensure that your hips are in the right position i'm sure you've all witnessed the all too common rounded deadlift at your gym which is probably the most problematic mistake that lifters make when it comes to this movement and the cute back injuries ideally throughout the deadlift and especially during the pull your spine should remain straight with your head hips and back all in line but if you're struggling with this and you're sure you're not using a weight that's too heavy for you then first off what you need to do is change the way you think of the deadlift rather than thinking about pulling the weight up from the floor think about pushing the floor away with your feet as you lift the bar similar to how you would push your feet during a leg press use this pushing cue for the first three to four inches of the pull and then after that drive your hips forward to complete the pull this subtle yet effective cue often helps people keep their hips from rising too quickly which prevents their back from rounding during the pull now in addition to this a rounded deadlift is essentially a compensation for weak hips because as shown here rounding your back actually brings your hips closer to the bar this gives them a better mechanical advantage meaning that your hips don't have to work as hard to get the weight up so to solve this you need to strengthen your hips and the best way to go about doing this is to incorporate more hip strengthening exercises into your routine like glute ham raises split squats and hip thrust for example focusing on these exercises in combination with the deadlift cue mentioned earlier will make a big difference in improving your lift [Music] in order to perform an efficient deadlift the barbell path needs to be as short as possible from start to finish and that means that it needs to ideally travel in a perfectly vertical line such that the final position of the bar should be directly over where it was on the floor however a common mistake people make is either having the bar start too far away from them when on the ground or not keeping the bar as close as possible to the body when performing a rep instead what you want to do is first place a bar over your mid foot then as you lift the weight off the floor do so by dragging it as close to your shins and thighs as possible to ensure it's being lifted in a vertical line and to most effectively accomplish this you need to focus on engaging your lats throughout the movement to do this before you pull think about essentially performing a straight arm pull down with the bar in order to engage the lats as shown here you should feel your lat muscles activated and turned on as a result of this and you want to maintain this lat engagement as you pull the bar up from the floor during each rep since this will help with your bar path and with your overall stability and if you're struggling with feeling this what you can do is attach a band to the bar and pull backwards against the band by using your lats and then perform a few light reps while keeping your lats engaged this should help you learn what it feels like to properly use your lats during the deadlift another really common mistake people make with the deadlift is jerking the weight off the floor from a relaxed position and what happens when you do this is you're not generating the muscular tension needed prior to the lift which as a result often leads to back pain or discomfort and makes the lower back more likely to round as you lift the weight to address this what you want to do is after you set up properly the last thing you should do before lifting the weight is raise your chest up while slightly pulling up on the bar to generate tension before the pull only after you do this small step should you then proceed to perform your rep [Music] the deadlifts should be finished with solid hip extension meaning that you're contracting your glutes and feeling them activate and your hips are pushed forward until the bar stops them from traveling any further what a lot of people do however is continue on by hyper-extending the lumbar spine and leaning back at the top position which is unnecessary and causes a lot of stress on the lower back and for some this may be just due to a technical error and can be fixed by simply avoiding an excessive lean back at the top but for many people it's a result of an anterior pelvic tilt or just not knowing how to properly contract the glutes and posteriorly tilt the pelvis during the deadlift in which i'd highly suggest watching my video on anterior pelvic tilt which will show you how to address these issues and for those interested i'll leave a link to this video in the description box down below that's pretty much it for the video guys so to sum everything up for you here are the main points that you'll want to take away from this video as i've said before choosing the right exercises is one thing but performing them correctly and optimally is really what makes all the difference and if you're looking for an evidence-based program that shows you exactly how to do so so you can be sure that you're maximizing your efforts then simply head on over to buildwithscience.com forward slash courses to take a look at the four programs i do have up and to choose the best one for you i'll also leave a link to these in the description box down below anyways as always if you enjoyed this video please don't forget to give it a

    "title": "The BEST Way to Use Cardio to Lose Fat (Based on Science)",
    "published_at": "2023-10-01T13:00:46Z",
    "transcript": "how much cardio should you do to lose fat some say you don't need any whereas others say you got to do it every single day but after speaking to some of the top natural bodybuilders in the industry interviewing the smartest experts in the world and reviewing the latest science here's what I found but first we need to figure out how helpful cardio actually is for fat loss and the answer might surprise you while cardio is great for heart health longevity and provides plenty of other benefits it's not nearly as effective does most people think when it comes to losing fat at least in the way most people do it you see typically you'd expect if you did 300 calories worth of cardio you'd burn 300 more calories that day but back in 2016 a researcher Herman poer publish was known as the constrained energy model proposing that the more calories you burn through cardio the more your body will try to save energy and burn less calories the rest of the day to protect its bat stores and it does this subconscious by taking fewer steps the rest of the day or little things like not moving your hands around when you're talking for example not to mention diet compensation as well some people tend to subconsciously eat more in response to doing more cardio to the point where the 300 calories of cardio you did can theoretically cancel out completely unfortunately shortly after this research came out major news outlets took interest and shared it using clickbait headlines that made it seem as if exercise was pointless for fat loss now although this is an exaggeration the compensation effect is definitely real and well documented most research has shown that people who start doing cardio without any changes to their diet tend to lose only 20 to 50% of what they'd expect from the calories they've burned but now you're probably wondering what about different types of cardio surely Sprints and hit type workouts we see all the shredded influencers doing will be great for fat loss right well Daniel Plotkin one of our built with science research recently published a study comparing all different types of cardio and fat loss here's what he found so what we did is we took all the studies that we could find that compared high-intensity training so training that was either Sprint intervals or biking intervals and compared that to low and moderate intensity aerobic exercise so that could be incline walking that could be moderate intensity cycling so we wanted to see which of these modalities created more fat loss and what we found was that there was no difference between these two modalities at all which wasn't super surprising but what was surprising is that whether it was high-intensity interval training or moderate intensity training there was essentially no fat loss effect even compared to nothing I think the magnitude of effect was .5 lb over 8 weeks of aerobic training what we can conclude from this is that at least at the doses given for the high-intensity training the average weekly minutes was 30 minutes and for the moderate intensity it was an average weekly minutes of about 120 cardio alone isn't very effective for fat loss okay but what about even higher amounts of cardio does that lead to more fat loss well in studies like this one by Ross and colleagues very high doses of cardio in this case doing 700 calories worth of cardio every single day the equivalent to about 1 to 1 and 1/2 hours of jogging does actually lead to quite a bit of fou loss so changing your diet you've probably got to do a whole lot of cardio for it to have a meaningful effect on Fat Loss which isn't a very efficient or realistic approach for most people but I didn't make this video just to tell you that cardio doesn't work because it does but only when you use it properly and to find out exactly how to do that let's take a look at this recent metod analysis which ranks several different fat loss protocols from most to least effective as expected cardio alone with no changes to diet was the least effective method but take a look at the most effective methods notice how they are all combinations of some form of exercise with a proper diet think about how much easier it is to eat 500 calories less than it is to try to burn off 500 calories every day I Illustrated this in my last video where I ate a bunch of McDonald's and figured out the hard way just how difficult it was to burn off so think of cardio not as a sole method you'll use to lose fat but rather as a supplemental tool that you can stack on top of your diet to speed things up but now that I've hopefully convinced you to start tracking and following a diet how much cardio should you then add to this well let's start by asking the only people in the world who have truly mastered the art of controlling their diet while using cardio to get them into incredible shape professional bodybuilders first I spoke to Alberto Nunes an extremely knowledgeable coach and lifetime drug-free Pro bodybuilder who's known for getting getting into insane levels of leanness I didn't use cardio at all really uh I just I'd rather died a little bit longer and rather eat less and have to go perform some other sort of exercise especially exercise that I don't necessarily enjoy but this last prep was it was nice it was nice to actually do some cardio and so I'm like oh I get to eat a little bit more because I'm I'm doing this this cardio I also feel that it helped with just some of the recovery aspects because like even though I know better like I'm PR to just after training just being garbage and just like laying around I also spoke with Lee a natural bodybuilder just a few weeks out from the show I honestly think that we could probably get through this entire prep without cardio the other alternative was again to not do cardio but then decrease calories further but you know like the lower the calorie deficit the less good essentially you're going to feel so it turns out that by using either a longer or more aggressive diet these guys didn't really need cardio to get into crazy shape but including it had its benefits now what also surprised me was the importance they placed on their daily step count and how they use it as part of their overall cardio Planet our bodies are fantastic at surviving and they will figure out ways to slow down the rate of loss I first started not this was like with my check-ins with my athlet as they were getting leaner their rooms just started to get Messier like you could see like legit the fact that they weren't doing much other been like going to work going to the gym and then just like couching it up a lot of our actual modifications are going to come through diet cardio and the steps are just kind of there're in place to make sure that you don't sloth around I'm the type of person who would either be at home playing games or be at the gym I was doing about like hardly any steps at all so like 2,000 steps per day we were just like I need to move around more um and that way we can keep your food as high as possible so we initially started with 10,000 steps per day we lost about roughly about 30 lb until we started introducing cardio but now I wanted to find out on top of their daily steps how much actual cardio is required to get to very low levels of body fat the smaller the athlete the more cardio we will have to do it it helps so they can so they can eat a little bit more which is obviously going to help with the mental component to some extent and then also with women since they're smaller systems they tend to clear up a lot of uh the fatigue that cardio might add to the situation I'm just like wow we're doing like an hour each day six days a week and you're still progressing with your training in capacity like that blows my mind Alberto also emphasized how it depends on your lifestyle I've had people do nothing nothing and usually this has to do with the occupation I mean if they don't move they just get fired servers personal trainers labor intensive jobs things like that but for most of his cents here's what he recommends 7,000 steps on average like just set there like as as a baseline you have that set I'd say most people uh on top of that to get to their goal like like we're talking about like you know like pretty freaking lean so roughly around like closing in on like 10 11 12% body fat for men could add like 10% to that for for women are going to require like four to five days of cardio a week ranging anywhere between 30 to 45 minutes there's almost no exception I feel even with the steps this seem to line up with Le's protocol as well on top of 10, steps a day and lifting weights four times a week he's also doing 30 minutes of cardio five times a week but remember this isn't just to get sixpack abs lean we're talking shredded and they also don't go from zero cardio to five times a week right away they build up to it over time and only when they need it whenever fat L is stalled and they're not making progress that's typically when they decide whether or not they should add more cardio probably not a bad idea to ask them okay what would be the least invasive thing to you like psychologically to the rest of your life so I might consider cardio or I might just consider cutting calories uh but yeah like also like appetite maybe my appetite's been like in check so I'm like all right you know what just slash those calories because that's going to be the most passive one at around six weeks out at this point I was pretty hungry so rather than decreasing calories further to increase weight loss we would decided to well less increase cardio so we burn more calories essentially now as for the type of cardio they use I found a common theme between both of them if you are going to use cardio uh things with minimal impact uh things that are just a like a Perpetual concentric like an elliptical or a bike so we started doing cardio on the elliptical machine and that's just to kind of reduce as much fatigue as we can especially since we're still trying to maintain strength or even try to Prov press inside of training now the reason they Place such an importance on their weight training isn't just because they want to look as jacked as possible as you diet your body will need to burn off something for energy it can choose from either muscle fat or a combination of both so although lifting weight doesn't burn as many calories as cardio does it does give your body a strong reason to hang on to the muscle you've got and to burn off your fat for energy instead this is probably why in The Meta analysis I showed earlier you may have noticed that combin combining diet with resistance training was one of the most effective fat loss methods performing even better than combining diet with just cardio so think of the Holy Trinity of fat loss as a combination of diet lifting weights with cardio on top of that to speed things up now as for how much cardio per week you should aim for what I'd recommend is just start with Alberto's recommendation of walking 7,000 steps a day as a baseline in combination with your diet and weight training this alone should already be enough for you to start losing fat once you're consistent with that you can add in some cardio sessions to get your heart going and just to speed up the process 2 to 3 20-minute cardio sessions per week should be a good start and although Leon Alberto recommended cycling or the elliptical you have plenty of other options I personally love variety so some days I'll do incloud walking some days I'll do cycling and sometimes I'll go swimming the key is to choose things you actually enjoy and could recover well from now from here once your body adapts and you reach a all in your progress you can choose to either eat a little bit less or add a little bit more cardio or increase your steps to continue losing fat and you basically repeat this process for as long as it takes you to reach your desired level of body fat now we did see on average how much cardio Alberto's clients do towards the tail end of their diet but remember they're getting very lean so please don't just follow that blindly the amount of cardio you'll end up needing will heavily depend on your goal your body and your lifestyle out so you have your cardio plan but I do have a word of caution the last thing you want to do is start twing a bunch of cardio during your diet and then stop cold turkey as soon as it's over that's the biggest mistake people make and it's actually when cardio becomes most important here to explain this is well-known Fitness scientist and natural bodybuilder Dr Eric CS so after a weight loss phase most people unfortunately are going to regain at least a proportion of the weight that they lost however what most people do which is a mistake is they stopped doing the exercise they were doing as part of the cutting phase you don't have to maintain all of the cardio you are doing while cutting but keeping a certain amount of activity going can prevent some of that weight regain from happening Eric explained it seems to help regulate your hunger and will also slightly increase the number of daily calories you burn there's a great uh systematic review that was recently published in 2019 and they found that doing just 150 minutes or more per week of activ generally which of course could be cardio but if you're lifting weights that counts as well is sufficient to prevent weight regain if you're already getting weightlifting and that amount then we need to look at okay well what's the maximum benefit I can get here and and some of the meta analyses that look specifically at cardio um they seem to show that there are some benefits uh that are probably maximized around getting 7 to 9,000 steps per day this is why for long-term success is so important to choose activities you can actually stick to whether it's watching a movie on the treadmill playing a sport or just going for walks to start out find something you can do regularly to get you moving remember cardio isn't just something you should do during a diet and you shouldn't do it just for the fat loss benefits do it for your overall health and well-being and for a science-based program that shows you week by week exactly what

    "title": "Slow Reps vs Fast Reps for Muscle Growth",
    "published_at": "2018-03-11T14:07:53Z",
    "transcript": "when it comes to training for muscle growth there's a lot of program variables that need to be considered but one often overlooked variable is lifting tempo or how fast you perform each repetition you've probably noticed that some people in the gym tend to perform their reps as fast as possible whereas others take a more slow and controlled approach but which method is better in terms of muscle growth well to answer this let's first take a more in-depth look at each approach the main benefit of lifting with a slower lifting tempo is that you achieve a greater time under tension simply meaning that your muscle is under strain for a longer period of time throughout the set and since a greater time under tension is generally associated with an enhanced metabolic response this theoretically leads to greater muscle growth in the long run on the other hand the main benefit of lifting reps with a faster tempo is that you can perform more reps or use a heavier weight than you can with a slower tempo and although time under tension is reduced when using a faster lifting tempo this actually doesn't seem to hinder muscle growth one 2012 study from the Journal of applied physiology compared a very slow lifting tempo with a faster lifting tempo on various lower body exercises and despite having an almost fivefold greater time under tension for the slow group they only experienced an 11% increase in muscle size compared to a thirty nine percent increase in the faster tempo group now although this is an extreme example given the unrealistically slow tempo that was used it helps illustrate that time under tension isn't the most important factor regarding muscle growth in addition the ability to lift heavier loads by using a faster tempo enables a greater overall recruitment of muscle fibres which equates a greater activation of the target muscle in fact one study from the Journal of strength and conditioning research showed that when a slow lifting tempo is used activation of the chest was reduced by up to 36% err in the benchpress when compared to lifting with a faster lifting tempo and this was seen despite both protocols being taken to failure indicating that very slow lifting fails to sufficiently stimulate or activate the higher threshold type to muscle fibers which results in less overall muscle activation and presumably less grow the target muscle so based on this it's clear that using faster tempos may be more beneficial in terms of muscle growth but exactly how fast should you be aiming for well a recent 2016 meta-analysis by Schoenfeld and colleagues is able to provide us with some insight the researchers found that based on all the studies currently published on lifting tempo which to be honest is quite limited a lifting tempo between 2 to 6 seconds per rep seems to maximize muscle growth with tempos closer to 2 seconds being slightly more favorable than 6 seconds anything slower than this seems to be suboptimal in terms of muscle growth but with that being said I'd advise you not to obsess over the exact numbers regarding your lifting tempo and instead use a following advice we know that based on experience anecdotal evidence and scientific research at a solid mind 2 muscle connection plays a very important role in muscle growth and we also know that controlling the eccentric portion of the rep seems to lead to greater muscle and strength gains while decreasing the risk of injury when compared to simply letting gravity do the work for you therefore I think the best way to approach lifting tempo would be to one use a concentric speed that's on the faster side but still enables you to feel your muscle working throughout the movement and ideally minimizes the momentum use whether this is one second or two seconds for example will completely depend on what feels best for you and to perform the eccentric portion of your reps so that you're actively controlling the weight against gravity as opposed to simply dropping the weight utilizing these two tips will help you get the most out of your lifting tempo while keeping things simple and easy-to-implement now with that being said I just want to also mention a couple limitations regarding this topic first off lifting temple becomes less applicable when you're using heavy weight for example if you're lifting close to your one rep max it becomes a lot harder to intentionally slow down or speed up your reps so it's when you're using relatively lighter loads where you have a lot more control over your lifting tempo and secondly this video was mainly geared towards muscle growth as opposed to strength gains the ideal lifting tempo for a power lifter for example will differ as they typically benefit from trying to move the bar as fast as possible and are usually less concerned with a solid mind to muscle connection during their lift but if your main goal is muscle growth then utilizing the tips mentioned in this video will likely be your best bet and finally it should also be noted that combining different lifting tempos or using specific lifting tempos for specific exercises might even be the best option but it's impossible to say at the moment since no study to date has investigated it so I'd advise experimenting yourself and seeing how your body responds that's pretty much it for the video guys I hope you enjoyed it and found it useful there's definitely a lot more research that needs to be done regarding this topic but I think there's enough for a general conclusion to be made and as always for those who are interested you can check out the written summary of this topic on my website built with science comm and I'll also leave a link to the article in the description box down below I'd also really appreciate it if you guys gave me a follow on Instagram as well where I post a lot of the studies that I come across and also various other tips that don't always make it into my

    "published_at": "2019-12-01T16:04:59Z",
    "transcript": "when it comes to building muscle and avoiding injury it's vital that you choose the right exercises to include in your routine but even the best of exercises when done improperly can quickly start to do more harm than good and that's why in this video I'll go through four such exercises that you should be included in your routine and more importantly how to avoid watching them up in the process like most people end up doing so the first exercise is a plank now although the plank is a great way for beginners to initially learn how to properly use a core and build up their endurance in a safe manner the traditional plank itself just doesn't activate the core very well instead what happens is that most people end up sagging their lower back and feeling the movement more in their shoulders and other areas as opposed to their core a much better version for strengthening the core is something called the RKC plank which a 2013 paper by Schoenfeld and colleagues found elicited roughly four times greater upper and lower abs activation and three times greater obliques activation than the traditional plank after performance you just need to apply two simple tweaks to the traditional plank first you want to move your elbows forward such that they're roughly at the level of your eyes and then you want to come up to the plank position and then initiate something called posterior pelvic tilt by forcefully squeezing your glutes and your abs which will in turn tilt your pelvis upwards resulting in an even greater core contraction when applied correctly you're gonna feel a much stronger activation of the core musculature than you did in the traditional plank the next exercise lateral raises should also be a staple in your routine for optimal shoulder development given that they've been shown in multiple studies to elicit the greatest activation of the side delts when compared to other calm and shoulder exercises but just take a look at how I'm performing them here for example which is more or less similar to how most people in the gym perform them there's three distinct things that I'm doing wrong every rep that all create excessive stress on the shoulder joint first mistake is some reason to wait too high not only to just just invite your upper traps to start taking over the movement but it also creates excessive stress on the shoulder joint and in fact a 2014 paper from the journal strength and conditioning research bout a significant positive association between performing lateral raises above shoulder height and shoulder impingement in a group of trained subjects now with the study also found though is that when combined with mistake number two which is that I'm internally rotating my shoulder by pointing my thumbs down towards the ground slightly to better target the side delts you essentially create the worst possible conditions for your shoulder joint to be in which has made even worse with mistake number three I will admit that this one is less problematic but still is suboptimal and the mistake is that I'm raising the weight directly out to my sides and what this does is it creates more stress on the EC joint and the shoulder as a whole so to fix all three of these mistakes here's what you want to do first fix your arm angle by moving your arm forward slightly into something called a scapular plane shown here and incorporate a slight bend in the elbow which multiple biomechanical analyses have found to be a much safer and stronger position to raise from next we know based on research presented earlier that to perform the lateral raise and minimize any risk of shoulder impingement you need to incorporate external rotation of the humerus as you raise the weight so to achieve this without compromising your side delt activation in the process as I've explained in past videos want to incorporate just a slight lean forward and then point the thumbs towards the ceiling very slightly which is gonna help you externally rotate the humerus and then when you raise the way just raise to shoulder height and no further and these can also be done on the incline bench to take the lower back out of the equation by either way by incorporating these three tweaks you're going to minimize the stress placed on your shoulder joint while still maximizing the activation of your side delts the next exercise like curls either lying or seated or great exercise - including routine for optimal hamstrings development this is because we know based on research from the journal strength and conditioning research the development of the upper hamstrings is maximized with what are called hip dominant exercises where there's less knee flex of all such as with deadlifts where as development of the lower hamstrings is instead maximized by knee dominant exercises where there's less hip flexion involved such as with leg curls which is why they're a good idea to include in your weekly routine for balanced development of your hamstrings despite this though there's a couple of mistakes that people make with this exercise that limits its effectiveness first off most people just aren't aware the function that the calves have during knee flexion because one of our two calf muscles the gastrocnemius is actually a two joint muscle as it crosses both the ankle and the knee meaning that it can actually assist you with your leg curls by helping hamstring flexing and essentially takes away tension from the hamstrings however given its fiber length we know that this muscle cannot be active during both knee flexion and plantar flexion therefore a really quick and easy way to shift more of the tension onto your hamstrings is to simply point your toes away from you as you perform your leg curls because doing so will help you inactivate the gastrocnemius and instead lead to greater Hampshire activation which you're likely gonna feel right away secondly though and more importantly is how the body compensates when you start to fatigue with this exercise and squeeze out those last few reps and it does so by putting more pressure on your lower back because with both the seated line and even a standing leg curl once you begin to fatigue your body will try its best to both shorten the range of motion and make the movement easier on your hamstrings but given that your hips are locked in a fixed position it can't effectively do this and it resorts to bringing the butt up and arching the lower back instead which is why you may have experienced lower back soreness a day or two after performing the leg curl I mean I'm not even going heavy here at all but you can clearly see my lower back start to compensate now to mitigate this one option is to simply lighten the weight and avoid really pushing through close to failure but in my opinion an even better option would be to incorporate exercises like the glute ham race or the Swiss ball leg curl as these both effectively incorporate the knee flexion function of the Hampshire without that lower back compensation problem that most leg crow machines have the last exercise is a seated row now this exercise or any horizontal rowing movement for that matter should be a staple in your routine given that they've been shown to provide similar levels of lat activation as vertical pulling movements like a lot of pull downs but with more activation in the mid-back meaning that incorporating some form of a horizontal row would be good idea to maximize your back thickness and overall development but despite this being a seemingly straightforward exercise to perform given that you control the weight and avoid excessive momentum most people still end up making a very subtle yet crucial mistake with it and that mistake is simply letting the shoulder roll forward at the end position of the pole what this does is it not only puts the shoulder in a compromised position but it also prevents the back muscles like the mid traps and even a lot from fully contracting to the best of their ability this is because from the point out of which his shoulder starts to compensate by rolling forward your back is no longer fully working to pull the weight and you've effectively shortened the range of motion which as a result compromises your back development and this doesn't just happen on the seated row but can even happen on other horizontal row and movements like machine rows in the barbell row for example and to fix this you need to pay closer attention to how your shoulder blades move is you pull because what often happens when you let your shoulder roll forward at the in position is that your scapula tends to elevate and your traps will shrug up as well which both take away from your back involvement in the movement so instead you need to focus on keeping your back muscles involved even at the end range of the movement by keeping your shoulder blades down and back as you pull which you can do most effectively by first pulling your shoulders down and away from your ears and then squeezing your shoulder blades together as you pull the weight towards you by contracting both your lats and especially those mid-back muscles this is going to in turn keep your shoulder pinned back in a safer position and result in a much greater back contraction which you're gonna feel right away all in all guys I hope you're able to see that if you want to build muscle most effectively without getting injured in the process it's a matter of both not only choosing the right exercises to include in your routine but also then making sure that you take the time to learn how to execute them properly as that's what makes all the difference and for a step-by-step program that puts this all together for you by not only showing you what exercises to perform every week but also how to properly execute them in order to build muscles in the most effective and safest way possible then simply

    "transcript": "i'm going to show you how to lose stubborn belly fat for good with a four week plan during each week we'll implement one of four things that have been found in research to be the key to losing fat and keep it at all we'll show you how to properly assess and monitor your fat loss progress give examples on food swaps to kickstart fat loss talk about a few exercises to speed it up and then combine everything with the bonus tip for those who are really serious by the end of this video you'll have a full plan that you can get started with immediately and to follow consistently will help you finally lose that stubborn belly fat in week one you need to start weighing yourself every day but you need to do so with a specific method that's going to significantly improve the accuracy of your weigh-ins consistently tracking weight has been shown in several studies to be a major predictor for those who successfully lose weight and keep that weight off before moving on to the diet tweaks that we're going to do to kick start fat loss in the next step you need to get this right to do so weigh yourself every morning after waking up and after using the bathroom don't drink or eat anything before you weigh yourself after seven days take an average of your weight this seven day average will then be your weight for that week every week you're going to repeat this process you're then going to compare these weekly averages to assess how much fat you're losing with what we'll implement next in weeks two to four it's important to weigh yourself in this fashion because your weight will fluctuate day-to-day factors such as the timing of your weigh-in how much you've slept the night before how hydrated you are how much you ate during the weekend and even the timing of your last meal can all affect your weight by even up to 10 pounds so if you're just weighing yourself randomly whenever you feel like it then these fluctuations will make it next to impossible to assess if you're actually losing fat or not as for what to look for with your weekly average weight a reasonable goal is to lose weight at a rate of around 0.5 to 1 of your body weight per week for most people this will amount to about 0.5 to 1 kilogram of weight loss a week if you were to lose more weight than this you may be doing too much too soon and putting yourself at a risk of losing muscle and making adherence difficult if you lose less than this however then you can consider stepping up what you're going to do in the next three weeks so during the second week in addition to tracking your weight we need to close the gap between how many calories you can eat to lose fat and how many calories you're currently eating this is what's going to help kick-start the fat loss process which were they going to speed up in weeks three and four first figure out roughly how many calories you can eat to kick-start fat loss in our business science programs which i'll talk about later on this video we've developed software that automates this whole process for you so for now a really simple method to get you started is to take your body weight and then multiply that by either 13 or 29 depending on if you're using pounds or kilograms write that number down and then what we have to do is figure out how much calories you're actually eating at and to do so download a food tracking app such as myfitnesspal and start vlogging every single thing that you eat throughout the day by the end of the first day you'll be able to see roughly how many calories you're eating you can do this for a few more days to improve its accuracy what you'll notice is that this number will most likely be higher than the number of calories you can eat to lose fat we need to close this gap to kickstart fat loss to do so once you have your calorie goal research shows that almost any diet can be effective as long as it's sustainable avoid eliminating foods from your diet as that has been correlated with less fat loss and less dieting success instead use a flexible approach where you more or less continue eating what you want but gradually make swabs to reduce your calorie intake i've made a recent video on this very topic which i'll show at the end of this video but some examples are to swap bad year meats to leaner meats swap cooking oil to spray oil swap bacon for turkey bacon swab dairy milk for almond milk and swap peanut butter for pb2 these are just some of many easy swaps that you can make to significantly drop your calorie intake to kickstart fat loss without making drastic changes to what you're currently eating but take this step at your own pace it may take you longer than a week to implement which is perfectly fine this is going to serve as the foundation for losing that stubborn fat and when paired with the next two steps you'll be able to speed up that process to ensure that you're being active enough starting in week three we're going to track something called neat and we're going to work on boosting this to burn more calories every day so any activity that you perform outside of your scheduled workouts is referred to as neat it may not seem like it but daily activities like walking fidgeting washing dishes and folding your laundry they all increase how many calories you burn today and can make a big difference when it comes to fat loss for example taking 10 000 steps a day can burn well over 500 calories alone which equates to roughly one pound of fat loss a week in addition research shows that having very low levels of knee can make it more difficult to control your calorie intake for example in individuals with very low knee levels who only take a few thousand steps a day hunger signals are not well regulated and they're more likely to overeat as a result but once activity levels are increased your body seems to start doing a much better job at regulating your hunger levels and the calories you consume now the easiest way to track your general activity is through your step count most phones and smart watches nowadays can track this with high accuracy as for how many steps to aim for the greatest benefit seems to occur in the range of 7 000 to 9 000 steps per day and that's a good minimum that you'll want to aim for if you're well below this number then gradually increase your current step count by about 10 of the time until you're within that range and this can be as easy as adding in a 10 minute walk in the morning and evening or after each meal once you've nailed this down then you can finally move on to week four to further speed up the process so during week four you need to start implementing a structured exercise routine but you need to use the right amount and the right type of exercise as a recommendation you should aim for a minimum of 30 minutes of exercise three times per week if you can step this up to at least 60 minutes four to five days per week then that's even better for reference research has shown that people getting at least 150 minutes of exercise per week we're able to lose twice as much weight as people getting 75 minutes of exercise per week to add to this when exercise is combined with your diet that we established back in week 2 it's even more effective for losing weight than either method by itself as for the type of exercise to do while people often gravitate towards an all or nothing approach to doing either weights or cardio a combination of both is going to get you the best fat loss results weight training will ensure you maintain or increase your muscle mass while cardio is a much more efficient way to burn additional calories what we recommend within our build with science programs that have worked wonders for thousands of our members is to start with a foundation of about three to five weight training days per week once you're consistent with that add in 20 to 30 minute cardio sessions to help you hit the weight loss targets that we established back in week one now for those who are eager combining all of this with the next bonus tip can indirectly help with the results even more so although you can't target fat loss specifically from your belly you can grow your abs just like any other muscle by training them with weights and getting them stronger as they grow they can pop through your skin a little bit more and can make them more visible even if you haven't quite yet lost all the stubborn belly fat to do this train your abs with weighted movements regularly two to three times a week weighted cable crunches weighted reverse crunches and weighted sit-ups are all great options i do have a video on weighted dive training specifically which i'll link at the end of this video as well and for those looking to take this one step further with a program that puts all this together for you such that you know exactly how to train and what to eat week after week to lose stubborn fat for good and build lean muscle just

for 9 weeks while another group did only hit thrust now before we show the result pause the video and comment below what exercise you think came out on top now don't be disappointed if you didn't get it right because even I was surprised you see while squats grew the quads and inner thighs more both exercises led to similar growth in the glutes which means two things one if you want to grow your butt without growing your legs then spam the heck out of hip thrust and two since hip thrusts are usually less tirey than heavy back squats you can do them more often and with more sets I'll show you the best way to also use squats for go growth later on the video but what I person do is I start my workout with hip thrust this way I can isolate my glutes really well so that in my next two exercises I actually feel them working but proper form is key I'll show you guys how to do this with a barbell first and then I'll show you another version that's way easier to set up I remember the first time I ever tried to hip thrust my hamstrings literally seized up my lower back was on fire and I barely felt my glutes working this is why first off if your feet are placed too far away from you you're going to feel it in your hamstrings whereas if your feet are positioned too close you're going to feel it in your thighs to get the most glutes position your feet such that at the very top position your shins make a straight line right on top of your foot once you got that nail down you can grab a small plate to note your foot position and then you can start using a bar now the movement is actually pretty simple just drive your hips towards the ceiling but a big mistake people make is sticking their stomach out and arching their back to fix this brace your core as if someone was about to punch your stomach then squeeze your glutes hard imagine if you had a $100 bill between your butt cheing and you really wanted to buy some new gym clothes but I was trying to steal that money away from you if you do this properly at the top position your back should be completely flat and you should feel a strong burn in in your glutes and one last thing to keep in mind is that your glutes actually don't do very much in the bottom half of the mbit so if you want to really isolate your glutes stick to doing just a top half of each rep with the 1 to 2 second BS of the top now effective as a barell hip thrust is it's a pain in the butt to set up it's it takes 10 minutes of cardio just to put everything together and just when you think you're in the clear the B decides I want the moon walk away from you so now you're on a scavenger hunt for some weights to build a Contraption to stop the slipping and let's not forget the Golden Rule avoid eye contact trust me it's like the don't stare directly at the S of the gym world I got my own gym but even making eye contact with myself in the mirror still just feels plain wrong so instead of the standard hip thrust I've been doing an exercise that takes literally 30 seconds to set up and works just as well single leg dumbbell hip thrust you just put the dumbbell across your working leg and thress one leg at a time while keeping your other leg slightly lifted off the floor the most common mistake here however is letting your hips drop to one side so even your hips by keeping your core brace just like I showed you with a barbell version and focus on really squeezing the glute of your planted leg now hip shouldn't be the only glute exercise you do you see they challenge your glutes mostly at the top position when they're fully contracted but to maximize growth plenty research suggests that it's probably best to include an exercise that really stretches the glutes and challenges them the most at the bottom so let's now move on to one of the key exercises in our bit with science programs that's helped grow even the flattest of butts Bulgarian split squats now before I show you the proper form I got to be honest these are brutal yeah budy it'll feel like you're doing three exercises in one and I personally have to tell myself all sorts of crazy things just to make it through reset come on Jeremy if you don't do eight reps you you have to chop your dick off but they have done wonders for grow M glutes so just remind yourself we're all suffering here and you just got to push through the pain to build your buns oh man that's not fun all right guys so just like with the hip thrust proper form with the Bulgarian split Squad it starts with your foot position and T's going to help us out here so you just sit down on a bench like she's doing extend your leg forward so where your front foot ends up that's roughly how far away you want that front foot to be from the batch but you do want to double check this and to do that t just add up and then come down to the bottom position of the buer ASA squat now what you can see here is her Shin is angled forwards right that's great for the quads but for more glutes involvement you actually want to bring your foot further away from the bench so that your shin is now directly over her foot that's going to Target the glutes a lot more so once you find that you can actually put a small weight plate or a marker just so you know how far away foot should be and then just try to do a few reps nice now at first if you're not used to movement you're going to be wobbling around and you're going to have a hard time balancing that's perfectly normal don't be afraid to grab on to someone or something for balance until you get the hang of it and then once you do get the hang of it there's one more tip you want to apply for even more glutes so typically if you want to hit the quads you want to think about going straight down and straight up but for your glutes what you actually want to think about is d driving your hips backwards and down nice and then driving it forwards right and on the way down you can see how she's leaning her torso forwards that helps stretch the glutes a lot more at the bottom and'll help you work them a lot more now if you're still really struggling with the movement try placing your back leg onto something lower like one or two weight plates or start out with a simple reverse Lodge just remember to apply the same for to we talked about earlier with foot position and leaning over your torso okay so far we've activated the glutes and we've worked them in a really deep stretch but there's one more exercise I've been throwing into the end of my workout that's been making all the difference squats now I know some of you might be thinking squats at the end of the workout well like many others I would always do heavy back squats in the beginning of my leg days but I usually end up feeling them more in my lower back or other muscles instead of my glutes also after just a few heavy sets I'd be gassed for the rest of the workout hip thrusts were far better at isolating my glutes without taxing other part parts of my body then by moving squats to last I don't need to go nearly as heavy yet my glutes are still working just as hard if not harder however and this is very important this only works if you nail down your forearm now you can do these with either a barbell or even a dumbbell since you're not going that heavy but the key to targeting the glutes is using a fairly wider stance pointing your toes out and then taking it slow on the way down set your hips back and lean your torso forward just like we did in the bul area split squat after the most glute growth how deep you go is important a study from back in 2019 compared the glute growth you get from doing half squats versus full squats the full squat group experienced over three times the growth so try to get low enough such that at the bottom position you're upper thighs parallel with the ground so now let's break down the full workout for hip thrust I recommend doing at least one set to failure just to really get your glutes activated I'll personally do anywhere from 1 to four sets depending on how much booty I'm looking to gain but always with relatively lighter weight for about 10 to 20 reps to really focus on that mind to muscle connection then for Bulgarian split squats since you're working one leg at a time it'll feel like double the work so here I'm usually just doing two to three sets per side with around 8 to 12 reps per set and lastly I'll finish it off with three sets of light back squats but performed really slow and controlled for about 6 to 10 reps per set and if you're wondering why there's a fourth exercise it's because to fully round out your leg development I'd highly recommend adding in some kind of hamstring exercise like leg curls since none of the other exercises in this workout really work this area but guys while we've looked at effective ways to build your glutes you can develop a really nice physique by pairing them with welldeveloped shoulders I recently have been using a size Spas workoutat that's been growing my shoulders like nothing else before so give this video watch next where I'll show you exactly how to use this workoutat to blow up your shoulders but if you're

    "title": "3 Muscle Imbalances SLOWING Your Gains (Stop Neglecting These!)",
    "published_at": "2019-12-08T16:35:23Z",
    "transcript": "when it comes to building muscle most of us put all of our attention on our mere muscles as these are the muscles that we and others can actually see and they visually demand the most attention unfortunately as a result of this the various muscles that we can't see or don't even know exist get neglected in the process which over time leads to crucial muscle imbalances and weaknesses that people only care about when it starts to catch up to them whether it be through an injury postural imbalance or an inability to perform a lift for example so this video I'll go through three of the most common muscle imbalances that your routine is likely creating why they matter and how to then correct them right away the first muscle you're neglecting are the all-important lower traps which are simply the lower fibers of your trapezius muscle now well though this muscle doesn't do much in terms of improving the aesthetics of your back they do play a very important role in scapular stability to help you properly move and rotate your scapula and when the lower traps are weak or unbalanced compared to your other muscles the instability that this creates can not only put you at a greater risk for shoulder injury but it also negatively affects your ability to execute various movements such as press and weight overhead or even maintaining a stable basis of Porcher in the bench press for example meaning that keeping this muscle strong relative to your other muscles is crucial it's something that most people just don't do because although it does play a role in various back exercises like rows and pull downs you're more powerful muscle groups like the upper traps and lats often tend to take over instead so if you aren't allocating time to directly train this muscle with lower traps exercises is very likely it'll end up weak over time and in fact a 20-17 paper provides evidence supporting this what they found is that when compared to the strength of a group of untrained subjects trained lifters has significantly greater strength in all of their larger muscle groups except for the lower traps which instead had the same strength as well as the untrained subjects which is a finding that's been documented in other papers as well so how can you best avoid developing this imbalance or start to correct it you can start by simply incorporating a few lower traps specific exercises into your routine to first activate it and then gradually build up its strength so what I'd recommend starting with are something called wall slides where you stand with your back against the wall ideally with your lower back flat against the wall then you simply slide your arms up mimicking a shoulder press movement pattern as far as you're capable of doing and you want to avoid arching your back and losing contact with the wall as you raise your arms and if you're unable to do so you can take a few steps forward to make the movement easier and during each rep you should feel a strong activation in the middle of your back as opposed to your upper traps which will try to take over if you struggle with that though you can always try it with scapular pull-ups instead where you first hang from a bar you let your shoulders relax and then you simply pull your body up by bringing your shoulders down towards the floor without allowing your elbows to bend again here you should feel a strong contraction in those lower trap muscles and then once you get the activation of your lower traps down you can then move on to strengthen it with something like the prone Y raise which has been found to elicit significantly higher lower trap activation when compared to other common lower traps exercises and for these you simply want to lay on an incline bench and raise your arms and a Y position with your thumbs pointed up and as you raise I want you to think about extending your arms as far forward as you can and avoid the tendency of tensing up those upper traps when done properly you should again feel a strong contraction in the middle of your back and with these you want to start with no weight and then you want to very gradually add weight as your lower trap strength improves but by simply performing a couple of these lower trap exercises 2-3 times a week and overloading it over time it's going to help prevent or correct an imbalance with this muscle and improve your strength and stability during your lifts as a result the next muscle you're not focusing on enough are the hamstrings which often tend to be significantly weaker and overpowered by the quadriceps that most people put a lot more emphasis on and this is detrimental because we know that a weak hamstring the quadriceps ratio is a major risk factor for both future hamstring and knee pain and can also become a limiting factor in strength and keyless and various athletic abilities such as your sprint performance for example despite this though a lot of people unfortunately still develop this imbalance by failing to devote enough attention to their hamstrings within their routines take a look at the following leg workout for example which is more or less the go-to leg workout for most gym goers and now let's take a closer look at how much the hamsters are actually involved in this workout so starting out with squats the hamstrings simply act as a stabilizer here and aren't very involved in fact based on EMG analyses the ham shakes only elicits roughly 20 to 30 percent activation during the squats whereas the quads are about three times more activated then moving on to the leg press I think gets even worse again the hamstrings here mainly act as a stabilizer and aren't evolved much the EMG analysis have shown that during the leg press the quads are roughly four times more activated than the hamstrings and then not two like extensions which we already know is virtually all quads compared to hamstrings and then you finally make it to like curls which does sufficiently work the hamstrings Bullets be honest here you just have a C's since you're already so beat up from the previous exercises and this is how so many people unknowingly let the hamstrings get imbalanced and overpowered by their quads so instead to ensure you're training your hamstrings in a balanced manner what I'd recommend is the following first we know that research has indicated that the best develop the upper and lower regions of the hamstrings you need to include both hip dominant exercises like deadlifts as well as knee dominant exercises like the glute ham race so you want to make sure that you have both of those included in some way within your leg workout or your overall routine secondly research also indicates that it's the e centric strengthening of the hamstrings that seems to be the most important for enhancing athletic performance and preventing injury meaning that you not only want to make sure you control the way down of each rep during your hamstring exercises but you should also be incorporating more eccentric focus variations such as a Romanian deadlift or even do some eccentric focus sets to your other movements for example and lastly soon we know that exercise is done early on a workout a more effective for growth you should at least occasionally switch up your routine such at your hamstrings are trained early on when you're less fatigued but by incorporating these three simple tweaks you'll be able to better avoid potentially creating or worsening it and bounce in your hamstrings which will pay its dividends in the long run and the last muscle group that you're neglecting are the external rotators of your shoulder which make up three of your four rotator cuff muscles and these three muscles are crucial that you keep strengthen as they're the main muscles responsible for externally rotating the arm whereas your bigger and more powerful muscles like your chest your front delts and your lats they all contribute to internal rotation instead and the problem is that the vast majority of the movements that you do in the gym train these internal rotators and leave the all-important external rotators neglected unless you train them directly and over time this can lead to a massive imbalance in the shoulder joint which reduces the stability of your shoulder during a key lift and can eventually contribute to shoulder impingement that'll cause pain whenever you try to perform most of your pressing movements which then obviously requires you to take some time off and limits your gains in the process illustrating the importance of this is a 2014 paper from the journal strength and conditioning research which found an inverse relationship between external rotators strength and shoulder pain and the pinch bit and in fact that researchers also found that in their group of 46 trained lifters of the ones who regularly performed external rotators strengthening exercises only 2% exhibited shoulder pain and/or impingement compared to roughly an 18 to 20 percent incidence rate and those who did not directly train their external rotators so if you currently aren't devoting much attention to these muscles it would likely be in your best interest to start doing so it's not difficult to do at all for example within your back and/or shoulder workouts simply add in a few sets of face pulls with a focus on external rotation at the end of the movement by keeping those fists up high is a great way to start to prioritize and strengthen those external rotators a little more in addition exercises like the full can and sidelines and external rotation for example are also great movements that you should sprinkle into your routine as well just to ensure that you're strengthening all three of your external rotators and I do cover these moves in a lot more depth in my rotator cuff video which I'll link in the description box down below for you to check out but by making the following adjustments and changes into your training routine you're going to effectively correct and prevent these common imbalances from occurring which will in turn minimize your risk of injury boost your strength and indirectly speed up your gains of the process anyways guys I hope you were able to see there's the little muscles that you can't see or maybe don't even know exist that often go overlooked but really are what will enable you to build muscle most effectively and protect you from injury in the process and for a step-by-step program that puts this all together for you by showing you exactly how to train to build muscle without developing imbalances or weaknesses in the process then simply have them over to build with science calm and take the analysis quiz to discover which science-based program is best for you and your specific body anyways guys I hope you enjoyed this one please don't forget to show you support by giving the video a like leave any

    "title": "Why Your Delts Aren&#39;t Growing (ONE FIX!)",
    "published_at": "2020-09-13T16:16:41Z",
    "transcript": "the delts from any are an extremely stubborn muscle group to develop more specifically though most of us have no problem developing our front delts from all the pressing we do the side delts however is where we struggle which is frustrating because this is the region of the delts that gives us that wide tapered look most of us are after but in theory training decide Dallas is actually quite simple lateral raises have been shown time and time again to generally be the most effective option to develop this area in fact most of you watching likely already do some form of a lot of worries in your routines but the reason you're still not seeing the growth or after has to do with your execution of the seemingly simple movement very rarely do we see lifters in the gym actually execute this movement properly and instead they end up training other muscle groups instead of the target the side delts now aside from using too much momentum and swinging front back and side to side during the movement one of the Lesser known culprits that we don't even realize is taking over is the upper traps based on the anatomy and function of this muscle and the fact that many of us already have overactive upper traps from being in this hunched over position most of the day it makes it very easy for it to steal tension away from the side delts whenever you perform a lateral raise to better illustrate this as shown here the upper traps function to elevate the shoulder whereas the side delts function to raise the arm out to the side so what a lot of us would do during a lateral raises especially during the initial and very last part of the rep is we'll shrug our traps up to assist the weaker side delts with the reason that weight up when this happens while yes you're still moving the dumbbell from the same point A to point B the side delts now become far less involved and are never really put in their fully shortened position like they should be in this movement and the problem is that many of us now just do this subconsciously and over time had developed this pattern of automatically firing the upper traps whenever we raise our arms out to the sides now yes the traps will inevitably be evolved to some extent during your lateral raises but if your main goal is to grow your side delts with this exercise which it is then you need to minimize the involvement of the upper traps so how exactly can we do this well to start art we want to use a mindful exercise that will help teach your body to get out of the habit of recruiting the upper traps whenever you raise your arms out to the side to perform it take a seat and hold the five pound double in one hand or even just use no weight at all to start out place your other hand on your upper trap all I want you to do now is very slowly raise the weight up at about a 45 degree angle in front of you but as you do so feel your upper traps to make sure they remain soft and relaxed and don't tense up as soon as they start to tense up get back to the starting position and try again so as you raise think about actively pushing your shoulder down and depressing your traps as you raise the weight up if you stand up and place a band of round your traps and feet like so this can help you know what this should feel like since the band will help actively press your traps down as you raise the main goal of this exercise is to be able to do a full rep up to parallel successfully without tensing up the upper traps many give you even with very light weights will only be able to do a quarter of the raise in this fashion before your traps really start kicking in which is perfectly fine just keep practicing and focus on gradually increasing this range and eventually increasing the load in small increments then only once you're ready move to the standard dumbbell lateral raise with two arms raising out simultaneously while still applying the same tips and mindfulness as we just practiced and as you do so there's a few additional helpful tips and cues that you can experiment with to further maximize side Delta activation while minimizing the involvement of the upper traps first imagine that you had a level bar sitting on top of your delt right where the delt meets a trap so try not to let that bar push up as you raise your arm up so the higher your hand gets throughout the raise the more you'll want to consciously push your shoulder down to prevent it from Raising that invisible bar second instead of thinking about raising the weight up which tends to get the trash perhaps involved think about pushing the dumbbell out to your side as much as possible the weight should only go up as a result of you actively pushing sideways and lastly just some general tips are to grip the dumbbell lightly experiment with a thumbless grip and raise the weight in the scapular plane which is around 45 degrees in front of your body as these will all tend to help you maximize your side does recruitment what many of you will now find after implementing all this is that by involving the traps considerably less your weaker side delts will be much more involved and will start to fatigue very easily and as a result you won't be able to do nearly as much weight as you could do before which is a good thing and expect it since we're now actually providing tension to the Target muscle rather than compensated with other muzzles so take your ego out of the door use lighter weights and avoid falling back to the old patterns that we just work very hard on correcting now in addition to this there are other lateral raise variations that you can experiment with that manipulate your body position to help minimize the involvement of the upper traps the first one is something I've shown past videos and is an incline lateral raise where you lay on an incline bench and raise your arms up at about a 45 degree angle the bench helps provide you with a little bit more stability and the resulting body position you're in puts the upper traps in a less favorable position which both result in more side deltse involvement and less over traps again though go light on these many of you will find that even just 5 or 10 pounds when executed properly is more than enough weight the second exercise you can try out is the line cable lateral raise as shown in the study assessing the activation of the upper traps in different body positions lying down during upper body movements helps decrease the upper traps activation as a postural muscle since it doesn't have to work against gravity like it has to do during the standing lateral raise so by performing this ladder we raise lying down with cables we're able to favor the side delts a little more while providing a constant resistance through the whole range of motion of the side delts but even here just as we did earlier focus on actively depressing your traps as you raise your arms out to the side of your rep so to sum this all up into an action plan for you what I'd suggest is start with the first mindful exercise that we did and replace your lateral raises in your routine with that drill for the time being master that while increasing the load very gradually over time and then once you're ready you can transition to the standard lateral raise given that you're able able to successfully perform your reps with minimal compensation of the upper traps and then from here you can experiment with some of the other exercises I mentioned and take a look at some of my other delts videos to implement some more variation and add more volume to your delts once you're ready to do so the main thing we want to avoid though is getting back into your old pattern of excessively recruiting the upper traps whenever you raise your arms out so take it slow and use lighter weights yes there is a time a place where cheating can be useful with your lateral raises but we need to first get you to a point where you can actually perform the movement with minimal compensations elsewhere but all in all you need to realize that if you're struggling to grow certain muscle groups then odds are it's a result of the various competitions that you're unknowingly making whenever you attempt to train that muscle and for step-by-step program that addresses this by using science to not only show you what to work out week after week but then shows you exactly how to perform each and every exercise size for maximal Activation and growth while pairing this with a nutrition plan to support your recovery and simply head on over

    "title": "We Tested 17 Glute Exercises, These Are Best For Growth",
    "published_at": "2022-12-28T14:00:10Z",
    "transcript": "we tested 17 the most popular glute exercises on four subjects male and female to find out which ones are the best at building a powerful well-rounded but at the end we're going to use these results to create a simple glute workout perfect for you and guaranteed to transform your butt so we tested the exercises using Betty a 12 000 EMG machine that measures muscle activation here's how the most popular glute exercise the hip thrust performs well out of all the exercises we tested it led to the highest activation in both the lower and the upper glutes but despite the high activation there's actually other exercises that would very likely grow your glutes better than hip thrusters before I share why that is and what they are let me first explain what exactly we tested so the glutes are actually an extremely complex muscle to measure I needed all the help I could get luckily biomechanics expert coach casim who has run several of these experiments in the past offered to help out based on his advice to see if certain exercises favor different parts of the glutes I decided to put a sensor on the lower glute the upper glute and another muscle located in the upper side of the butt called the glute medius now to make sure the sensor is stuck to our booties each of us needed a smooth hairless butt fortunately only one of us needed some work done stop clench to be honest Raza could have had it worse apparently some studies take it to the extreme and rub sandpaper on the butt now before testing there's a couple variables we need to control for the more challenging an exercise is the more muscle fibers you'll use and the higher activation that it will read so a few days before testing we all spent a whole day in our gym to figure out how much weight we'd use on each exercise to make them equally as challenging finally before our first measurement we need to get the MVC or maximum voluntary contractions yes yes believe we need to figure out the maximum activation each of our butt muscles can reach in order to accurately compare the exercises we do relative to our own bodies with that out of the way we're ready to test we did one set of each glute exercises and took a five minute break between each set after a long day we were finally done with measuring sure you got a nice view of the kahunas I'm tired of this before I dive into the results it's important to understand that more activation doesn't always mean more growth for example even though the hip thrust led to the highest activation the downside is that it works the glutes the most at the top position when your butt is fully contracted whereas Recent research has shown that exercises that challenge muscles at the bottom position when they're fully stretched tend to be better for growth so while it is a great exercise to help you really feel your glutes working and is something I'm going to throw into the sample glute workout I'll show at the end of the video it's not the only glute exercise you should be doing this is especially true because basing the data it seems like different exercises targeted different parts of the glutes let's start with the lower glutes there were two types of exercises that targeted this region very well the first type were lower body presses these are exercises where your foot is pressing against the floor to raise your body up so we tested barbell squats step UPS different types of lunges and of course Bulgarian split squats and for each of these exercises we used a slight Lean Forward at the Torso and tried to keep the shin vertical over the foot rather than letting the knee trap before it this form seemed to help activate the glutes even more by reducing the involvement of the Quad muscles and I actually covered this form in more depth in this past glue's video I did I'll link it in the description box down below and you can check it out after this one if you want to learn how to properly execute some of these exercises now although these did favor the lower glutes more there was one unique type of lunge that performed surprisingly well for the upper glutes and we'll talk about that later on what's important to note that the lower body prices we tested varied in difficulty Raza a beginner had had a hard time doing the more complex variations such as Bulgarian split squats and front foot elevated reverse lunges these variations are great for growth because they stretch the glutes at the bottom position even more than regular lunges do but they're challenging so for beginners I'd highly recommend that you stick to a basic reverse lunge or split squat master that and then over time start progressing to these more challenging exercises now the second type of exercise that did very well for the lower glutes was deadlifts we tested both the conventional deadlift and the glute focused Romanian deadlift anyways both types of deadlifts maybe the glutes quite well and if you remember from our last back video deadlifts also performed very well at activating the whole back making it a great choice to work the whole back side of your body at once now one thing I did find really interesting was how similar the results were between us males and Tony the female a big misconception is that females need to train completely differently than men do and vice versa but the best glute exercises for women will also be the best for men the difference comes with how you program those exercises in for example if you wanted to prioritize your glutes then you do more volume and exercises for them compared to other muscles and for those who want a done for you science-based program that shows you exactly how to train based on your goals then after this video just head over to builtwithscience.com and take our analysis quiz so far based on the data it seems like exercises where your butt is moving backwards and then forwards also known as hip extension will favor the lower glutes but what about the upper and side glutes aka the Brazilian butt lift well this part of the glutes primarily helps with the motion called adduction which involves moving your leg away from the middle of your body and there's a few exercises that seem to work really well for this let's start with cable Kickbacks so we tested this with the leg lifted straight back or out at about a 30 degree angle theoretically since the leg travels out to the side the angled version should better line up the tension with the upper and side glutes result well for all four subjects the angle version did lead to better activation of the upper glutes as well as the glue radius next abduction movements these are exercises that directly train the function of the upper inside glutes we tested seated and standing banded abductions and even the seated machine abduction which we had to borrow from another gym all of these variations favored the upper glutes and the glute media significantly more than the lower glutes but we also tested a unique type of lunch I learned from coach casim that ended up activating both the upper glutes and the glute medius very well we used just a small step up for the front foot turn the toe in slightly and then we took a step directly back and slightly to the side behind the body this puts the upper Loop fabrics and the glute medius into a deeper stretch than traditional lunges do I've honestly never done these in my own training but I'm definitely adding them in after seeing just how well they performed okay so let's put these exercises together into a well-rounded glute workout to do that I'd recommend first starting off with the toughest Movement by taking a hip extension dominant exercise to favor the lower glutes this exercise will also be the most important one for growth so it's a good idea to do it while you're fresh but after that I throw in hip thrust for some extra overall glute work which isn't as tiring on the body then to finish it off I'd recommend adding one to two exercises from the upper glutes list depending on how much you want to prioritize this region I've also put the full workout into a free downloadable PDF you can get over at builtwithscience.com glutespdf now a nice pair of glutes wouldn't be complete without a muscular defined back as well so to find out which exercises were best for growing the back click here to give that video a watch next I'll see you next time"

    "transcript": "is it possible to lose stubborn belly fat three times faster and make months of progress in just one week for the next 7 days I'll be following a size back plan designed to do just that I want to see how my body reacts and if this can be an easy way to shred down for the summer dude holy [\u00a0__\u00a0] that is crazy so to get the most accurate measurements possible I'm here at the University of British Columbia and I'm going to be getting a dexa scan but I'm also going to get an ultrasound of belly while my initial dexas scan came in a little higher than I want at 15.6% body fat the ultrasound will actually be the most valuable measurement not to see if I'm pregnant but to measure the exact thickness of my upper belly fat middle belly fat and the most stubborn area my lower belly fat after 7 days we'll come back and see just how much these measurements have changed damn so that's that's crazy day one breakfast is served Egg Way omelette cery see how it tastes that tastes like 100% pure protein so on a typical diet I'll usually aim for a calorie deficit of roughly 500 calories which results in about 1 pound of fat loss per week with this diet however I'm eating just 1,200 calories creating a deficit of 1,500 calories less than my body needs every day it's going to be sad 7 days it's extreme but if I can stick to it this should lead to boat 3 lbs of pure fat loss in just a week the diet is called the protein spraying modified diet and it's definitely not a diet that is for everyone this is Alberto Nunes in the natural bodybuilding Community Alberto is known as the go-to man to get you absolutely shredded I figured if there's one person who would know the best approach to losing as much belly fat as possible it's him what are you really eating nothing other than than protein really it's be chicken breast Galore can tuna maybe you can sneak in like some leaner cuts of beef somewhere in there so on a typical diet I usually aimed to consume roughly 1 g of protein per pound in my body weight to prevent any muscle loss but with how extreme this diet is that wasn't going to be enough I'd say anywhere between a gram and a half up to like 1.75 is a nice safe place but also there's a just a big deficit in place so you're very limited in regards to what you can eat so when I ran this calculation on myself I real realiz I would have to eat a bare minimum of 250 g of protein per day on a budget of just 1,200 calories it's not a pleasant diet by by any means but that's kind of what you're signing up for so here's my daily meal plan egg white omelet with celery for breakfast a post-workout build a size protein shake two chicken breasts with light veggies for lunch more chicken and veg for dinner and guess what's for dessert yep more chicken breast now if I want to make sure that I don't lose any muscle throat this week then simply eating high protein it's not going to be enough I still need to provide my body with a reason to keep my muscles rather than burn them off for energy which means I got to keep lifting but I can't lift the way that I usually do your weight training should probably be something that lasts no longer than like 20 30 minutes ideally I wouldn't recommend someone do a whole lot of Ario at all I think steps and some basic weight training now research has shown that it only takes about a third of the volume to maintain your existing muscle compared to build it this means rather than doing three sets per exercise I could do just one hard set and that should be enough to protect my muscles from being burned off without being too much for my body to recover from first workout is in the books and honestly I don't want to speak too soon but that felt really good my strength was solid energy was solid and I was fueled just by egg whites which is weird but apparently it works in fact my first three days on the program actually went pretty smooth I was definitely more hungry than normal but it was manageable and with the lower workout volume my strength and Recovery was still feeling really good though I did have some pretty strange caraban hit me in the evening Jeremy what are you eating what starting so I'm drinking some pickle juice it's satisfying whatever is that's happening right now so it's all that matters you're on day one what's going to happen on day seven I don't know we'll find out so who knows maybe I am pregnant now even though I'm not getting all the nutrition I need because of my strict calorie limit I'm trying to use a few key supplements to fill in the gaps including the multivitamin Omega-3s and some clutch recommendations I got from Alberto caffeine is going to help tremendously not just with energy but some people it does suppress their their appetite quite a bit protein shakes they're a little bit more satiating I think than people give them credit for luckily every scoop of my buwi size protein contains a whopping 29 g of protein with only 100 30 calories which means it can easily fit within my calorie budget and was definitely a nice treat to look forward to and I've left the link in the description box down below for those interested in try to out and you can use code belly fat for 10% off all right guys so we are 3 days in and I'm not going to lie I am feeling pretty good my energy levels are solid I've been getting my sleep in I've been having my meals I had my egg whes for breakfast this morning I honestly think that I'm going to make it the 7 Days anyone who's done this before will tell you oh the first 3 days especially coming off a period where you're eating quite a bit it's like this feels great but by day three or 4 your body is really starting to bug you and it it it's like how about we not move it's day four okay as you can tell my brain is not quite working and we've reached that point in the day night where uh it's pretty tough like I don't want to move I don't want to think hope hope I can make it the next few days [\u00a0__\u00a0] four I was definitely starting to feel a rapid energy drop going into the second half of the week oh man just feels like I'm I don't have much in the tank every workout was now a battle to finish thank the Lord that is over this is officially reached a new level of hard as for food cravings I was trying to do my best to keep my diet together while life was going on around me but the longer I went into the diet the crazier those Cravings Paquet my dinner that's better and jeffy's dinner oh my God oh my God oh my God I can taste it from here I vividly remember yeah right around day three like spinach was starting to taste sweet to me I think I'm violently starting to understand what Alberto meant about his spinach tast tasting sweet M it tastes like the sugar stick celery's got some sweetness to it so when your body experiences a serious drop in calories it starts to do whatever it can to tell you to eat not only can you taste and smell become heightened but your leptin levels can decrease dramatically now what's leptin well it's a hormone that tells your body it's full after a meal and after just a few days in an extreme calorie deficit leptin production can drop by up to 50% meaning Not only was my stomach physically feeling empty but even the signals of my body meant to regulate my Hunger were starting to go Haywire so I just woke up and a horrible sleep I honestly just can't wait for this to be over so to take my mind off the hunger I tried purchasing a video game but by this point I was feeling so mentally depleted that I couldn't even pass the aru robot test without asking for help my brain is is not I can't do this right now can you do it for me feeling absolutely depleted the only thing left to find out is was it all worth it so I headed back to the lab to get my day7 results oh those stairs are hurt but before I find out I already know this isn't a plan I'm going to be repeating while it was fascinating to see my belly fat literally melting away despite barely working out and doing zero cardio it came at a cost trying something so extreme had me feel exhausted unmotivated and like I was completely depleted and when I did get to actually enjoy Real Food again I actually had to spend the next few days resisting the urge to eat everything in sight diets like this are exactly what caus so many people to yo-yo diet and even develop Eating Disorders you get fast results basically by not eating and eventually binge eat it all back to truly lose belly fat and keep it off you need patience consistency and a sustainable diet that you can stick to for several weeks and I've helped thousands of people do just that by using diets they actually enjoy it and can stick to long term if you want more guidance then after this video you can check out our personalized programs over at builtwith size.com but please regardless of what the results show in the scans do not try to copy what I did in this video okay as for my results my dexa scan showed that my body fat dropped from 15.6% to 14.7% damn so that's that's pretty crazy it doesn't sound like much but usually it would take me at least 3 to 4 weeks to diet in to achieve that but what's interesting is the ultrasound although my upper and middle belly fat didn't change much since I didn't have too much to lose there my lower belly fat which is the most stubborn area dropped by over 30% in fact the thickness of the lower belly fat dropped by half a cmet which explains why I noticed my lower abs starting to pop out a little more but despite the results I wanted to get even leaner so I decided to continue dieting for the next 6 weeks this time using a more sustainable approach and here's how things are currently looking my plan is to head back to the lab for one more scan to see just how much more belly fat I was able to lose and then make a video for you guys revealing everything I did to easily lose that fat so keep an eye out now although this diet isn't something I'd recommend to 99% of people it does show you just how important your nutrition is for losing fat which is why I've created a quick healthy budget-friendly fat loss meal Pine you can get started with today and you can click here to give that video watch next and again if you need more personalized workout and nutrition Guidance just head

    "transcript": "bacon trail mix pasta turkey bacon strawberries and this big thing would you guess that each of these portions contain 200 calories probably not and as you can see this can be a problem when people first start out with a diet they are totally unaware of just how calorie dense typical food options that they're used to eating really are and this is one of the main reasons why many who eat clean or work hard still struggle with losing fat and seeing results this is kelly she is our lead dietitian and i wanted her to share some of the common problems that she finds working with clients who are struggling to lose fat so most people think that when they go to a dietitian that we're going to change everything that they eat and that's not true part of our job is actually to figure out exactly what you enjoy eating and then make a plan for actually how you can incorporate it into your day while still hitting your goal so one of the biggest things that i found with working with hundreds of our clients is that people make poor food choices this makes it extremely difficult to not only achieve a calorie deficit which is the thing that you need to lose fat but it also makes adhering to that deficit even more challenging especially when hunger and fatigue that's often later in the diet so to help you out with this in this video we're going to showcase what 200 calories looks like in the most commonly reported problem foods found from our team of dietitians so you can see just how easy it is to overeat with these foods we'll then show you what 200 calories looks like with much better options so you can see visually just how much more food you could be eating and calories you could be saving with the right swaps in place so we'll start off by looking at some of the most common problematic protein sources that were reported from clients of our dietitians we have ground beef pork chop bacon and fattier cuts of steaks such as new york strip these protein sources are packed with a ton of additional fat and hence bring up their calorie counts quite a bit you can see that for 200 calories you're not getting much at all and is what makes these meats very easy to unknowingly overeat with some better options would be to sub the ground beef for something like extra lean ground turkey sub the pork chop for chicken breast sub the bacon for turkey bacon and just be mindful of how many calories fatty or cuts of steak can quickly add up to in addition some other excellent leaner protein options are egg whites and most seafood like shrimp for example which both bring in a ton more volume for just 200 calories you can see just how much more of these leaner protein sources you'd be able to eat for an equivalent amount of calories and can definitely be made just as tasty with the right seasoning and cooking methods in place next are carbs some of the most problematic snacks that we found with clients were foods like oreos potato chips and cereal for 200 calories you're either getting a few oreos or a smaller serving of chips than you've probably ever had in your life or a very minuscule bowl of cereal when used in moderation these foods are perfectly fine but let's be honest when you're snacking on these foods there is no way that you're stopping at these serving sizes which just goes to show you how quickly the calories can add up without you being aware of it not to mention that the impact that these foods will have on your hunger will be minimal if anything they're just going to make you even more hungry after eating them in comparison here's what 200 calories of strawberries look like here's what 200 calories of carrots look like here's what 200 calories of air popped popcorn looks like and here's what 200 calories of puff wheats looks like you can see just how much more volume you're getting with these foods instead and why they're much better options to actually keep you satiated and prevent you from overeating and yes while these swaps may be bland on their own there's endless ways that you can make these just as satisfying if you just get creative with it which leads me to another big problem food that most clients had trouble giving up with ice cream and i don't blame them it's delicious but the calories they add up very easily for example here is what 200 calories of ben and jerry's peanut butter cup ice cream looks like again this serving of ice cream is likely smaller than any servant of ice cream that you've ever had in fact this right here which looks like a normal serving that most people would go for amounts to about 750 calories and with the whole tub which isn't very much at all it'll amount to a whopping 1500 calories which for many would almost be a full day's worth of the required calories instead a much better option that's my personal go-to and still actually satisfying would be something like two servings of fat-free greek yogurt sweetened with cinnamon and a sugar-free sweetener for 200 calories you're getting not only more volume but a ton of protein as well and here's what a 200 calorie bowl of greek yogurt with strawberries puff wheats and sugar-free syrup looks like as well which adds even more volume and flavor which just goes to show you how much better the volume and quality of calories can be when you make these smarter food options in addition to these snacks some other notable carb sources that can be problematic for some are foods like pasta and rice now these food sources aren't quote unquote bad at all but they are very easy to unknowingly overeat for example when i'm personally trying to gain weight and add more size i'll incorporate more rice and pasta into my diet since it makes eating enough calories easier and doesn't impact my hunger as much but when i'm dieting and watching my calorie intake i'll have less of these foods because you don't get much volume at all relative to the amount of calories and fullness that they provide i mean me being half filipino i grew up eating rice every single day and whenever i'd have it there is no way that i'd willingly be stopping at 200 calories worth of rice i would and could easily consume triple that amount very easily and still not be very full for very long for example here's 200 calories of rice and here's 200 calories of cooked pasta and in comparison here is 200 calories of cauliflower which you could very easily chop up or grind up to make cauliflower rice and here is what 200 calories of zucchini noodles looks like which even surprised me again you can see just how much more volume and fullness these swaps would provide even if you just replaced half of the original with half of the swap which is what many of our clients are doing lastly we have the most problematic food group fats now all fats in general even healthy sources will be very dense in calories but this doesn't mean that you should avoid them since we do need a minimum amount of fat for our bodies to properly function but it does mean that you need to be more mindful of your portions whenever you eat them because of how easy they are to overeat for example here is what 200 calories of avocado looks like here is what 200 calories of peanut butter looks like and here is what 200 calories of trail mix looks like good sources of fat but as you can see very easy to overeat with especially when you just eyeball how much you're actually eating or casually snack on these throughout the day chances are that you're eating way more than what you thought was just a servant of peanut butter or served in a trail mix which is why for these foods it's important to not only get yourself familiar with their servant sizes but actually spend the time to weigh out these foods when you consume them just to ensure that you're not overeating similarly here is what 200 calories of olive oil looks like and here is what 200 calories of butter looks like many clients of our dietitians would regularly add what they thought was an insignificant amount of oil and butter to their foods when cooking them without realizing that this was adding up to several hundreds or even thousands of calories every single day instead some better options would be to use cooking spray which contains minimal calories or use a paper towel to coat your pan with a dab of oil or butter instead of dousing it another option is to even invest in an airfryer which is an awesome and quick way to make crispy tasty foods while using minimal fat when cooking now one more problematic fat i want to talk about is salad dressings as you can see oil-based dressings don't provide much at all for 200 calories in fact many of you likely use twice or even triple this amount whenever you have a salad which turns what you thought was a low-calorie meal into the equivalent of a couple slices of pizza instead either again measure these dressings when you use them or just opt for lower calorie salad dressing options for example this calorie wise dressing from crafts is just five calories per serving compared to another very similar dressing by kraft that's 40 calories per serving which is honestly on the low end as far as calories go for salad dressings but it just goes to show you how easy it is to save a few hundred calories from salad dressings alone by making wiser choices and some other almost calorie free options to use for dressing or things like mustard lemon or lime or even rice vinegar so to wrap everything up for you here is what 2 000 calories or a full day's worth of calories for many of you watching would look like with the more calorie dense options whereas on the other hand here is what 2 000 calories would look like with the more calorie friendly food swaps we just went through you can see just how much more food you're able to eat and how much easier it would be to suppress hunger and adhere to your diet by simply making smarter food choices you can also see just how easy it is to essentially sabotage all the progress that you may have made dieting throughout the week by letting loose on the weekends and unknowingly consuming thousands of additional calories from these more calorie dense foods so consider these swaps but more importantly just be mindful of your portions with certain foods there's no real good or bad foods just smarter food options depending on what your goal is and to help you guys out with making some of these swaps into your diet our dietitians have created a free fat loss foods index guide for you guys to download and use for reference it goes through what some of the best options are for your proteins your carbs and your fats it also provides a list of similar calorie alternatives that you can simply swap in for the original recommendation to download it just head on over to builtwithscience.com forward slash fat loss index and we'll send it right over to you and i'll also leave a link to this in the description

    "title": "What Happens To Your Body After 100 Push-Ups a Day For 30 Days",
    "published_at": "2022-07-31T16:22:36Z",
    "transcript": "push-ups are one of the most effective exercises to increase your strength and build up your upper body muscles like the chest the shoulders and the triceps some people take this exercise to the extreme and commit to doing 100 push-ups a day and seem to get impressive results heck even SAA did it from one punch man and you saw just how well it worked out for him 100 push-ups do it every single day but what really happens to your body if you do 100 push-ups a day for 30 days what muscles will grow and by how much how much will your strength improve are there any side effects you should know about what happens after the 30 Days Are Over is it even worth your time and effort today we'll cover all that and more first off to maximize your gains and minimize injury from doing 100 push-ups a day it's important to make sure that you do them with proper form but provided that your form is in check what kind of growth can you expect from doing 100 push-ups a day to answer that let's take a look at the following 2015 paper where researchers measured muscle activity levels during the push-up the highest activated muscles were the chest the triceps the front of the shoulders the core and another muscle called the seratus anterior these are likely where you'll experience mostly the improvements in terms of size and definition as for how much of an improvement to expect in these muscles although we're going to dive into the specifics later on in this video I do want to highlight a study published in the Journal of exercise and Fitness in 2017 that shows just how effective itive push-ups can be the researchers measured muscle size and strength in two groups of untrained subjects one group used only push-ups during the workouts whereas the other group used the bench press after 8 weeks the authors found similar size and strength increases in the chest and triceps muscles of both groups suggesting that at least for beginners push-ups can be just as effective as a bench press now although this may seem promising there are various side effects to doing 100 push-ups a day that you want to be aware of starting with week one so based on Norms provided by the Canadian Society for exercise physiology men who rank fair in terms of their Fitness on average can do about 15 to 20 push-ups in a row this means you'll likely need to do several sets of push-ups to get to a total of 100 in fact during the first few days or even the first whole week of the challenge many of you may not even have the strength to reach a total of 100 luckily this is when something called neural adaptations will kick in help out this this is a phenomenon where although your muscles won't have yet grown your brain will have improved its ability to recruit the right pushup muscles and as a result your push-up strength should improve quite rapidly throughout this week in addition to this the most noticeable effect you'll experience to week one is what's called Doms which stands for delayed onset muscle soreness this refers to the tenderness and soreness you'll experience in your muscles 1 to 2 days after exercise since in this case your body isn't used to doing 100 push-ups a day week one is when you'll experience the highest amount of soreness in your chest your shoulders and your Arms This is perfectly normal and should die down towards the end of week one if you're feeling it in your traps and your lower back however then that's a sign that your form may be off now while those soras should die down by week two there is another side effect that will start to creep up and potentially slow down your progress by the way guys before we dive into the next side effect I'm curious have any of you actually given this challenge a shot if you have after watching the video leave a comment down below sharing how your experience went and how the results you got compared to what I'll go through later on for now let's move on to what to expect in weeks 2 and three it might sound counterintuitive but whenever you work out you're actually breaking down muscle not building it it's during rest when your body recovers and builds your muscles up to be bigger and stronger back in 1997 a group of researchers tried to determine just how long this recovery process takes they found that our muscles continue to recover and grow for even up to 48 hours after we work out based on this paper as well as other similar studies this 48 hour time frame seems to be the average time that it takes a muscle to fully recover so in the case of doing 100 push-ups a day since you're training the same muscles every single workout they aren't getting a long enough break to fully recover because of this you'll likely start to experience quite a bit of fatigue in weeks 2 and three your body and muscles may start to feel more exhausted than normal and as a result you're push performance may even start to decrease this combined with the next side effects you'll start to feel in week four can make continue to do 100 push-ups a day extremely difficult and as we'll talk about later on potentially not even worth it so by the time week four rolls around your body will have taken a beating from The High Frequency and high volume push-ups we'll cover how much you can expect your muscles to grow after this week but before that you may start to notice two things the first thing has to do with muscle imbalances push-ups are great at training the front pushing muscles of your body but your back isn't involved at all if you regularly train your front muscles without training your back muscles then the stronger front muscles will over time start to pull your body forward into a hunch over position with your shoulders rounded forward ideally to balance this out you want to perform plenty of back work focus on the muscles that'll help you keep you upright and shoulders healthy now the other thing you'll notice has to do with your joints even with proper form the repetitive motion of push-ups can create a lot of strain especially on your wrists and elbows your wrists not only need a high amount of Mobility to perform push-ups on the floor but they will also be loaded with quite a bit of weight that you probably aren't used to because of this your wrist will be one of the first areas where you notice discomfort to mitigate this you can try to do push-ups with handles or dumbbells anything that allows you to grip it instead of placing your hands flat on the floor as for your elbows pay attention to the bottom position of your push-up if they don't remain aligned directly on top of your wrist as you perform the push-up then you're creating more stress in your elbow joints normally this is okay but if you're doing 100 push-ups a day and not allowing your joints to rest it'll very quickly start to take its toll in your elbows so you've successfully made it through the 30 days what kind of growth and other benefits can you expect to see is it even worth your time and effort let's see what the science has to say so in the push-up study I mentioned in the beginning of this video the subjects weren't doing anywhere near 100 push-ups a day instead they were assigned to three sets of push-ups to failure twice a week given that the max number of push-ups they could do in a row was around 30 reps this would equate to roughly 90 push-ups being done each session a total of roughly 180 push-ups per week now although this sounds like nothing compared to 100 push-ups a day they still experience significant growth over the course of8 weeks they experienced an 18.3% increase in the muscle thickness of their chest which equated to about a 3 mm increase in thickness their triceps also experien a 99.5% increase in growth which also equated to about a 3mm increase and the researchers mentioned that this rate of growth is similar to other past studies so if you have these numbers you can get a rough sense as the kind of growth you can experience after a month of doing push-ups just twice a week if you were to do 100 push-ups a day would you experience more growth well I'd expect it to be similar or perhaps even less less because you're not giving your body adequate time to recover and grow in addition to that keep in mind that after these 30 days if your body gets stronger then it's going to need more of a challenge to continue growing eventually standard push-ups just won't be enough and you'll have to start incorporating bands or added weight now as for whether this is all worth it or not honestly I would not recommend the standard approach of 100 push-ups every single day without rest it just causes too many recovery issues and lacks of progression you need to continue seeing results past those 30 days one benefit it does provide however is it gets you in the habit of exercising it's a great way to get your foot in the door and build momentum that said this routine can definitely be made far better with a few tweaks it has the ability to provide even more growth with less effort and less strain on your body I will be working on a video that shows you a better way to execute the 100 100 push-ups a day challenge and I'll link that at the end of this video when it's done in the meantime if you're looking for a pro been a science-based program that guides you every step of the way to your dream body just head on over to build science.com and take my analysis quiz to discover the best approach for you and your specific body but that is it for today I'd highly recommend that you give this video watched next to learn how to properly perform the pushup for more gains and less injury thanks so much for watching don't forget to give the video a like subscribe to the channel for more and I'll see you next time"

    "title": "How to Lose Fat AND Gain Muscle at the Same Time (3 Simple Steps)",
    "published_at": "2020-05-31T16:08:00Z",
    "transcript": "how do you get your body looking from this to this well one option is to go on a bulk to focus on building muscle and putting it on more size first and then focus on losing weight to strip off the excess fat afterwards another option is to do the reverse so focus on leaning down by stripping off the excess fat first and then focus on building muscle afterwards but what if we could take a short cut what if we could instead just build muscle and put on more size while simultaneously getting leaner in the process and this is the whole idea behind what's known as body recomposition which is the holy grail when it comes to body transformations especially for those with a skinny fat or higher body fat physique since with one process you'll be able to build muscle while stripping off excess fat which are the two exact things that your body needs to aesthetically look the best however body recomposition does come with a cache because the basic law of thermodynamics tells us that we need to be at a calorie deficit in order to lose weight and strip off fat but the drawback with being at a calorie deficit is that it severely compromises our ability to build muscle now only does our performance in the gym tend to suffer but multiple papers have also shown that muscle protein synthesis significantly reduces by about 20 to 30 percent as we just aren't providing an adequate fuel for our muscles to recover and grow bigger which just makes building muscle while losing fat very difficult for your body to physiologically do when it's in a calorie deficit however this does not mean it's impossible as there does seem to be a loophole to this because with the protocols that go through in this video the body has actually been shown to be able to metabolize and use your own body fat to now provide the necessary energy it needs to recover and grow your muscles despite being in a calorie deficit hence enabling you to build muscle and lose fat at the same time with that being said though research does indicate that certain individuals are more likely to experience this and would therefore benefit the most from the protocol that I'm going to go through in this video and these individuals include the following beginner lifters with no or minimal experience D trained individuals who have spent some time off from the gym those are quite a high body fat for example anything over 25% and lastly slackers who have never taken their training and nutrition seriously or never really been consistent with it now although trained experienced individuals are less likely to experience a body recomposition it's nonetheless still occurred countless times in the research and my own experience and in my opinion is definitely still highly possible especially with proper execution of the protocol that I'm going to share with you today so with that being said if you fit into one of the four categories that are previously mentioned or you simply just want to give this protocol a shot and here's what you want to do the first thing you need to do is set up your diet which is going to be the most important factor of achieving a body composition although yes we do want to be at a calorie deficit to enable fat loss to occur research has shown that the larger the calorie deficit the greater the reduction in protein synthesis and therefore the less likely you'll be able to experience muscle growth as you strip off fat so for this reason what you want to do is eat at a very slight deficit of roughly 5 percent to a maximum of 20% which for most individuals equates to about around a hundred to 500 calories but low maintenance calories if you're at a higher body fat percentage item for the higher end and vice-versa for those at a lower body fat percentage this way your body will one have the sufficient energy and needs for optimal performance in the gym or recovery to won't experience nearly as dramatic of a decrease in protein synthesis for muscle growth and 3 it's going to be adequately fueled and hence be able to achieve further fat loss through better exercise expenditure a faster metabolic rate and higher levels of need in other words you're gonna burn more calories per day by being more subconsciously active since you're better field so what I recommend to start is simply multiply your body weight in pounds by 14 to 16 depending on your body fat to get a rough idea as to what maintenance calories is for you and then subtracting that number by a hundred to 500 calories to get your suggested daily calorie intake then as for your macros protein is where you want to place most of your attention illustrating this importance are two recent protein studies that compare the effects of a higher versus lower protein intake on body composition both studies found that despite being in quite an aggressive calorie deficit the subjects in the higher protein groups were able to build muscle and lose fat simultaneously whereas the lower protein groups failed to do so and instead lost muscle mass therefore what I'd recommend is aim for a protein intake of around one gram per pound of your body weight with the possibility that's shooting even higher than this may in fact boost the likelihood of your ability to build muscle lose fat at the same time especially if you're on the leaner side and therefore the rest of your calories you simply fill them up with carbs and fats I would however personally recommend a relatively higher carb and lower fat approach to again better fuel your body for a performance of gym next we're gonna dive into your training now what we want to do here is first ensure that we're here into an optimal training plan that as I've discussed in my past videos should ideally train each of your muscles at a frequency of at least two times per week with sufficient volume of around 10 to 20 sets per muscle per week going beyond this though what I'd advise you to do is actually switch up your routine for example swishing up to a new training split increasing or decrease in your muscle training frequency and/or switching up some of your exercises or the manner in which you perform them what this is gonna do and is shown in past training frequency research is it's gonna provide a novel stimulus to your muscles that will increase the likelihood that you can spark new muscle growth as you continue to lose fat especially if you've been stuck using the same routine for the past a little while and if you're unsure as to what to switch up I'll leave links in the description box down below to three different free routines that have released that you can consider transitioning to in order to introduce that novel stimulus to your muscles and then simply use your new routine consistently and focus on gradually getting stronger and progressively overloading it week after week to continue stimulating your muscles for growth next we need to optimize our nutrient timing which you should ideally already be doing but need to start taking more seriously if you like to increase your chances of badi recomposition and there's two things that we want to do here first you need to ensure that you're evenly spreading out your daily protein intake into about three to five meals throughout the day in order to keep your protein synthesis levels elevated and optimized throughout the day to best help your muscles recover and grow despite being in a calorie deficit illustrating the importance of this is a 2020 paper released just last month that compared the effects of evenly spread now once daily protein intake into three meals throughout the day as opposed to skew in most of the protein it's just two meals a day calories and total daily protein intake were both equated and controlled for what they found was that after 12 weeks of this combined with regular resistance training and despite both groups even at around maintenance calories the evenly distributed protein group managed to achieve a body recomposition and gained a few pounds of muscle while simultaneously dropping their body fat by half a percent whereas the other group gained less muscle and actually ended up experiencing a slight increase in their body fat percentage which the researchers attributed to the better 24-hour muscle protein synthesis levels and those who evenly distributed their protein compared to those who did not even though both were still consuming the same amount of protein calories by the end of the day so take your daily protein intake and ensure that you're spreading this out as best as possible into at least three meals per day now taking this one step further we also want to optimize some meals that we eat around our workouts because when you're in a calorie deficit we can not only experience a decrease in protein synthesis levels but we also see a rise in cortisol levels especially when we train which can negatively impact our resulting muscle growth and recovery a research has shown that by ingesting adequate protein around our work out with a post-workout shake for example we're able to blunt the cortisol response and significantly increased protein synthesis compared to if we didn't adjust anything or just didn't adjust enough protein thus increasing the chances that we can build muscle despite being in a deficit and in fact a study and trained lifters put this to the test they had one group of subjects optimize their pre and post-workout nutrition by having sufficient carbs and protein before and after the workouts whereas the other group of subjects instead had the exact same pre and post workout meals but much earlier before and much later on after their workout after 10 weeks what they found was that the group that time their meals around their workouts were able to significantly increase their strength and muscle gains while dropping their body fat percentage by one percent whereas the other group ended up gaining less strength and less muscle mass and failed to lose any fat therefore failing to achieve a body recomposition despite all other variables being held equal meaning that if you want to maximize your chances of experience about every composition then you should not only optimize your protein distribution throughout the day but also aim to optimize the meals around your workouts by having adequate carbs and protein shortly before and shortly after you train so to some of the steps for you here's what I recommend is an action plan as you implement these steps and progress throughout the week so take measurements to assess your results if your weight is more or less remaining the same your waist circumference is decreasing your muscle measurements are increasing you're getting stronger in the gym and you visually look better and these are all signs that you are indeed successfully achieving a body recomposition alone although guys a part of your composition honestly isn't for everyone but in the cases that I went through and with the protocol that I previously outlined it can be an effective way for you to essentially shortcut your transformation and take advantage of the current situation that you're in but in the long run you'll likely eventually want to transition to a dedicated muscle building or fat loss period and prioritize one or the other and for an all-in-one step-by-step program that shows you not only how to successfully achieve a body recomposition but also then shows you exactly what to do afterwards that you can continue to strip off fat and build lean muscle as efficiently as possible with sides just like countless other members have done with their both science programs and simply head on over to build science comm and take the analysis quiz to discover which program is best for you and where you body is currently out anyways guys that's it for today thank you so much for watching hope you

    "title": "Targeting Belly Fat Is POSSIBLE?! (New Study)",
    "published_at": "2024-04-14T13:30:00Z",
    "transcript": "everyone wants to lose that stubborn belly fat problem is you can't choose where your body burns fat from every time you work out or at least I didn't think you could according to a new study targeting belly fat may not only be possible but also much easier than we all thought in this video I'll share exactly what researchers have found and how you can apply it to your own training now my belly has always been the hardest area to lose fat from even when I lose weight it seemed like the fat there just wouldn't budge but this got me wondering why is belly fat so stubborn in the first place well I looked into it and I'm glad that I did because once you understand this all the new research makes a lot more sense you see to burn fat your body first needs to release it from the fat cell a process known as mobilization once you mobilized the fat it can then be burned off for energy but how exactly do you go about mobilizing it well when you strength train you don't just strengthen your muscles you also increase blood flow to the fat that surrounds the muscle you're working and this is one Theory why belly fat can be so hard to get rid of compared to the fat in other areas of your body it tends to receive very little blood flow not to venture we also tend to train our ABS less frequently than other muscles think about it your quads and hamstrings are used all the time running squatting walking you name it they're some of the largest muscles in your body and so they receive a large increase in blood flow when you're working out but your belly well not so much so this go researchers thinking if you can boost blood flow FL to your abs could you then specifically Target belly fat during exercise and if it could Target your belly why stop there theoretically by increasing blood flow to the right spots you could reduce fat in any area that you chose theoretically to find out I reached out to my good friend Dr Bill Campell who runs a lab dedicated to Fat Loss out of the University of South Florida I've been asked a lot Can you spot reduce and my answer has always been no the research that exists is is not very strong and most of the research that's been done on this has suggested or reported that it's not possible after digging through endless research papers I've come across all sorts of funny and in some cases just play out weird experiments researchers have tried to get to the bottom of this question one study had participants do over 5,000 sit-ups in 27 days which honestly might be more than the rest of us have done in our entire lives another one had participants do 12 weeks of high-intensity leg pressing on one leg all to answer the question can you choose where your bare fat but neither study found a notable difference in fat loss and because of this most researchers including Bill were skeptical about the idea of spa reduction people would let's say do you know hundreds and hundreds of crunches and they would say well now I'm going to have a defined midsection and my response would be well that's not really how it works however as it turns out there was one thing that pretty pretty much all of these studies overlooked remember how it said you need to mobilize bat before it can be burned off well there's two parts to this process first mobilizing it and then burning it it all the issue with the past studies such as the 5,000 situps one is that while they may have mobilized belly fat this doesn't necessarily lean to burning it at all but this is where a 2023 study comes into the picture they wanted to test a routine that could do both yeah so the results did surprise me just relying on my past knowledge I I my thoughts were I don't expect any type of spot reduction outcome to be reported but that's exactly what was reported and the the design was good basically researchers divided 16 overweight men into two groups one focused on Spa reduction and the other the control group both followed a 4-day workout plan for 10 weeks the control group did 45 minutes on the treadmill each session meanwhile the spark reduction group had a shorter 27-minute treadmill workout followed by two ab exercises course orientations and machine crunches now this study was unique because it was also the first of its kind to make sure that the same amounts of calories were burned in both horo groups and this is a big problem with a lot of Prior research if you don't equate the calories being burned you don't have much faith in whatever body fat outcomes are being reported because it could be that they just burn more calories and of course they're going to lose more fat so what happened well after the 10 weeks both groups lost a relatively similar amount of total body fat but what was surprising was that The Spar reduction group lost 2 and 1 half times more fat from around their belly compared to the control group what's also interesting is that the treadmill only group also lost more fat from their legs than The Spar reduction group and if The Spar reduction theory holds true well then this result makes sense since it did more R it but of course the study doesn't come without its limitations one of the criticisms of the study was well they had more fat to start with which they did but they still lost like 3% more total fat in the trunk area was like 7% versus 4% so even when you account for the fact that this spot reduction group had more fat to start with they still lost significantly more fat even accounting for Baseline levels and although the workouts were tightly controlled the nutrition wasn't personally I don't think this is too too big of a concern given that both groups lost a relatively similar amount of overall fat but it is something that would have made the study a lost shoger but hey it's not just a study other recent studies on spot reduction have also shown promising results in 2017 there was a similar experiment researchers had one group perform an upper body workout Then followed up with 30 minutes of cardio and another group did a lower body workout followed by the same 30 minutes of cardio now both groups perform the same number of exercises sets and Reps and and they did this three times per week after 12 weeks both groups lost a near identical amount of total body fat but again what was interesting was that the upper body group lost more fat in their upper body and the lower body workout group lost more fat in their low body and more recently in 2021 another study found something similar just like the 2023 study their idea was to use ABS exercises to mobilize belly fat and then combine it with cardio to burn the fattest Fuel and they too found promising results mainly in the upper belly area again the studies do have their limitations all studies do but this research is still exciting to see and I'm sure a lot more will be done in this area and what's nice is that the results of these studies still offer some practical takeaways which you can immediately start using in your workouts before I get to them though let me say this if losing belly fat is your goal then you need to be in a calorie deficit to get the best results it's highly unlikely you're going to be able to gain weight while simultaneously spot reducing fat in your belly what the studies do suggest though is that if you're doing ab work you should probably combine it with some form of cardio either shortly before or after to get the most bag for your buck yeah yeah there's there it has to be of such an intensity and or duration that it actually causes an an increase in what we call oxidation where you're actually burning the fat as an example you couldn't perform these studies and go for a 3 minute walk and come back and think oh I should have spot reduction the other thing is that if spot reduction does work then it seems like some ABS exercises are better than others I don't see planks as as targeting the abdominal region the the abdominal muscles as much as crunches in abdominal torso rotation I would suggest and again being a scientist rely on the data that we have both use crunches and one used crunches and abdominal torso rot rotation so I would think yes the the the abdominal exercise does matter so if I was designing a routine to better Target belly fat I'd use direct weighted ABS exercises combined with low to moderate intensity cardio which could look something like this I'll be honest though I'm still not 100% convinced and neither was Bill when I spoke to him these latest Studies have definitely opened my mind to spot reduction being possible and it seems like future research could be promising but it's definitely not enough for me to go about planning Spa reduction into most people's routines that said on my recovery days I have been using those two ABS exercises and slapping on some cardio either before or after who knows maybe this is giving me the spa reduction effect maybe it's stopped but even if it's not I still highly recommend that you regularly train your abs and with weight once I started training them consistently they seem to appear more visible even during bulks where my body fat was increasing and after all they're just like any other muscle group and growing them can help with definition but guys just remember that most of your results will still come from the basics and losing belly fat heavily depends on your diet in fact most people completely underestimate just how many calories are in their usual food choices and this is why even people who eat clean and work hard still struggle to shed their belly fat to help with this I worked with our lead dietician Kelly to show you how you can eat twice as much food while keeping the calories as samee and you can check out that video If here and for those who want more step-by-step Guidance with both their training and nutrition just head on over to builtwith science.com to take

    "title": "Best vs Worst Workout Splits to Build Muscle",
    "published_at": "2024-11-24T13:30:08Z",
    "transcript": "what are the best and worst workout splits for muscle growth in this video I'll be ranking seven of the most popular routines to find the top performers all the way down to the ones that are wasting your time and at the end I'll add a bonus Factor time efficiency to see which split gets in the most gains in the least time now to make sure your worker routine doesn't end up at the bottom it has to perform well on what I call the hypertrophy score a measure of how well it builds muscle to calculate the score I teamed up with PhD researcher Eric Trexler together we used the latest research to build a predictive growth equation focused on two key factors frequency how often each muscle gets trained per week and volume the number of sets each muscle is worked with the best workout split will strike the perfect balance of both let's start with the classic the push pull leg split where you train all your pushing muscles the first day your pulling muscles the next day and your legs on the third day but the unique thing about this split is you can run it once so you're only training 3 days a week or you can run through it twice for a total of six training days per week I'll score the three-day per week version first which came up to a hypertophy score of 6.7 and while it does take the top spot on the leaderboard for now the next split is definitely going to give it a run for its money it's the 3-day full body workout split now unlike the 3-day Push Pull leg split which hits each muscle just once per week the full body split trains every muscle three times per week and this gives it a major advantage because based on a recent metal analysis by Josh pel and colleagues they found that training a muscle three times per week can boost strength gains by about 50% compared to training it just once per week even with the same weekly volume so for example if your bench went from 100 lb to 15 lb on the pushable leg split switching to full body could push it to 175 lb in the same time frame it's why I personally recommend the split for beginners who should focus on mastering and progressing their main exercises before worrying about adding more volume but how much does this help with muscle growth well while the latest data suggests frequency doesn't seem to be as important for growth it still helps provide a small boost and in this case it's enough of a boost for it to take the top spot with a hyperv score of 8.1 next up we're moving to a 4 day routine with the classic upper lower split where two days focus on upper body and two on lower body now unlike the full body split which trains each muscle three times per week here each muscle is hit just twice per week however this split does allow for an extra workout Day meaning you can fit in more volume and that may be a bigger driver of growth for example take a look at the grassp from a recent study comparing the effect of frequency and volume on muscle growth the frequency graph is quite flat meaning you get just a small boost and growth as you train each muscle more frequently whereas the volume graph moves up and to the right suggesting that higher volumes continue to push more growth because of this the upper lower split scores quite well with an 8.4 just enough for it to earn the top spot but now it's time to set things up with 5day splits starting with my personal favorite and the routine I'm currently following the upper lower Push Pull leg split the beauty about this hyd R is that it allows you to fit in more volume than the 4day upper lower split but it doesn't come with the big time commitment of something like a sixday pushable leg split and with a hypertrophy score of 9.0 it takes the top spot on our leaderboard but will this be enough to beat the rest of our splits or will I end up finding something even better than what I've been doing let's find out by moving on to the classic 5day bro split unlike any of the splits we've covered so far the Bro split involves dedicating a whole workout to each muscle group this is what makes it a favorite among bodybuilders like Arnold who loved working each muscle to exhaustion with tons of volume however since you're only training each muscle group once per week it's probably not the best way to distribute your weekly volume in fact one criticism of the Bro split is the idea of junk volume because you're doing so much volume per workout for just one muscle by the time you reach your third or fourth exercises in your workout your performance drops considerably some believe that those exercises now become a waste of time and will be better off move to another workout day when your muscle has recover but we definitely need more research to see just how much of a difference this would make for now let's see how it scores is it enough to beat my personal favorite split not quite it slides into a close second place with a score of 8.8 next up we have the 5-day full body worker routine an ultra high frequency split that trains each muscle five times per week now although this sounds like a bad idea in each workout you're only doing a few sets per muscle allowing you to push hard during those sets yet still recover well even if you're training that same muscle the very next day but what's really interesting is this style of training May provide additional benefits for growth especially as you get more advanced basically every time you lift weights you're signaling your muscle to grow something known as the muscle protein synthesis response but here's the thing in beginner research has shown this response lasts quite long about 48 to 72 hours which means you only really need to train each muscle two Max three times per week in order to keep the protein synthesis response elevated throughout the whole week and in vance lifters however this changes the protein synthesis response shortens and can last just 12 to 24 hours because of this Advanced lifters May benefit from higher frequency splits to keep stimulating muscle growth throughout the week and avoid any down times where muscles aren't being signal to grow but this is all just theoretical the real question is does this really lead to more growth well one study published back in 2019 put this split to the test instead of using beginners they took well-trained lifters split them into two groups and had them follow nearly identical workout routines with the same exercises and the same amount of sets and Reps the only difference one group did the exercises using a 5-day full body workout split whereas the other group used a 5-day bro split so what happened well after 8 weeks almost every muscle they measured grew more with the full body workout split compared to the Bro split and as for its hypertrophy score after crunching the numbers it scores an all-time high of 10.0 taking the top spot by a long shot but it's not over yet there's still one more split left to cover that just might take the win and it's every gim Bros favorite routine the 6 day Push Pull leg split now although this routine trains each muscle only twice per week less than half as often as a previous 5-day full body split you are able to fit in a ton of volume because of how many days you're in the gym but is this going to be enough for it to take the number one spot well after crunch the numbers comes in at a close second with a score of 9.7 so here's how I rank all the splits purely based on muscle growth but unless you're someone who would live eat and sleep in the gym if it meant more gains you should also consider time efficiency and I don't just mean how many days a week you work out there's other factors you need to consider like warmup sets full body workouts are usually longer because you have to take time warming up both your upper and lower body it's one of the reasons why despite the 5-day full body routine having the highest H pry score I personally still choose not to use it so the real question becomes which split offers the best gains for the least time commitment and to answer that Eric and I calculated the weekly time investment you'd spend on each split and compared it to its hypertrophy score and we found one routine that gives you 85% of the gains of the top split but with 30% less time in the gym every week and that split is the 4day upper lower split but to help you guys out I've created a free downloadable PDF for both the 5-day full body and the 4day upper lower routines I will be making updated YouTube videos for some of these routines

    "title": "The Best Pre-Workout Meal for Muscle Gain",
    "published_at": "2017-10-22T15:52:11Z",
    "transcript": "if you're looking to maximize your performance in the gym and enhance muscle recovery after your workout then pre-workout nutrition is definitely something you should not take for granted in fact researchers are starting to view pre working nutrition as being even more important than post workout nutrition when it comes to building muscle mainly due to greater muscle protein synthesis during and after the workout when an adequate pre-workout meal is ingested so in this video I'm going to show you guys the most optimized pre-workout meal for muscle growth based on current scientific literature and our understanding of the various functions of protein carbs and fat before we get started let's briefly cover what exactly the pre welcome meal is and its benefits the pre-workout meal should be considered any meal you eat within roughly two hours before your workout and it has two main goals one to provide more energy during your workout which translates into better performance strength wise and two to adequately supply your muscles with amino acids to maximize muscle growth and minimize muscle catabolism during and after your workout with keeping this in mind let's take a look at what the optimal amount of protein carbs and fat looks like the main function of protein in a pre-workout meal is to elevate your plasma amino acid levels in order to maximize muscle recovery and growth in several studies that included protein as part of the pre-workout meal of the subjects protein synthesis was elevated significantly more than if a placebo was used but how exactly does this relate to muscle growth and strength well one study by Johnson and Al showed that in 33 male subjects pre exercise supplementation of 20 grams of whey protein and 6 grams of leucine resulted in a greater increase in maximal strength and lower body resistance training over a period of eight weeks when compared to a placebo and although the researchers didn't find a significant change in muscle growth between the groups we'll see later on that when protein and carbohydrates are combined in the pre-workout meal it seems to provide the best results for muscle growth and as for the best type of protein to ingest in your pre-workout meal I suggest a fast digesting protein that contains a high amount of leucine this is because as shown in this study by Callie ere at I'll a fast digesting protein is deal to rapidly spiked amino acid levels for your workout leucine seems to be the best amino acid at doing this some various foods that meet this criteria are away protein and egg whites now as for carbs their main function with regards to pre-workout nutrition are to maintain muscle glycogen levels but more importantly to boost your performance in the gym in addition it seems that when protein and carbs are combined in a pre-workout meal it creates the most optimal anabolic environment for muscle growth during and after the workout for example this study by Wolfe it I'll examine the effect of ingesting a multi nutrient supplement consisting of mainly protein and carbs with a little bit of fat 30 minutes prior to training the researchers found that the supplement group significantly improved their vertical jump power and number of repetitions performed at 80 percent of their one rep max when compared to the placebo group in addition the supplement group exhibited significantly higher serum levels of both growth hormone and total testosterone during and after exercise indicating that pre exercise ingestion of protein and carbs may also create a favorable anabolic hormone environment in addition to its performance enhancing effects and as shown in this extensive review by Harvey Al this likely leads to more muscle growth since protein synthesis testosterone and growth hormone are all elevated to a greater extent and as for the best type of carbs for this purpose is still a controversial topic but researchers seems to suggest higher glycemic index foods are best before a weight training workout and lower glycemic index foods are best for lengthy endurance type workouts but I recommend experimenting with both types and seeing which you respond better to and some examples of higher glycemic index carbs are things like rice cakes white potatoes bananas and so on and you should also keep in mind that you probably want to minimize fiber intake before your workout in order to prevent a feeling of fullness which can negatively affect your performance so to keep it simple fats play virtually no role in contributing to your workout and as stated in an extensive review by researchers at Deakin University fats have no beneficial effect on exercise performance unlike carbs they take a while to digest and won't boost your muscle glycogen levels nor will they aid in protein synthesis therefore since adding in fat's will likely just make you feel more full I'd suggest keeping them relatively low in your pre-workout meal and instead ingest them during other meals throughout the day but what does a meal optimize for performance and muscle growth based on these studies look like well it's a satisfy the criteria of a fast digesting leucine containing protein 20 grams of protein from egg whites is perfect and to satisfy the criteria of a moderate to high glycemic index carbohydrate with minimal fiber 50 grams of carbs from a few plain rice cakes topped with a banana will do for most people 20 grams of protein and around 40 to 50 grams of carbs is enough to maximize protein synthesis based on the research I reviewed but you can increase these numbers if you're on the heavier side and feel free to add some toppings to make it more tasty just don't go too crazy with it if you guys are looking for other options for pre-workout meals take a look at the following two lists and mix and match a protein with the carb as you wish although whey and egg whites are basically the only options for a fast digesting protein if you prefer other protein sources like chicken turkey and so on then feel free to use them instead as it likely won't make much of a difference now finally as for fasted training the pre-workout meal is likely to enhance your performance and strength so it's ideal when you're bulking and you want to maximize strength and muscle gains whatever fasted training has been shown to provide anabolic effects as well so it's hard to say which one is better but ultimately you should decide based on whether you perform better and lift heavier when you're in a fed state or a fasted state as I know this varies for everyone thanks for watching guys I hope you enjoyed the video I'm sorry that it took me so long to release another video since my last one but for those who don't know I'm in my last semester of a kinesiology degree in university so as you can imagine I'm pretty swamped with schoolwork and exams but with that being said I'm going to try my best to release at least one video every week and next week as I'm going to be releasing my chest video which I'm really excited for so stay tuned for that I just really wanted to give you guys a huge thank you for all the support that you've been showing me by liking my videos leaving positive comments and to share my videos around it's crazy to see how much my channel has grown just in the past couple weeks alone and it really motivates me to continue doing this it also just goes to show you the need there is for fitness content that's actually backed by research rather than making claims without any evidence behind it anyways again thank you guys so much for all your support if you guys enjoyed this video then please don't forget to give it a like leave a comment and don't forget to subscribe if

    "title": "The WORST Stretches For Low Back Pain (And What To Do Instead) Ft. Dr. Stuart McGill",
    "published_at": "2020-10-18T16:23:12Z",
    "transcript": "one of the first solutions people struggling with back pain seek are lower back stretches to relieve their pain but the truth is many of these stretches are just short-term fixes that actually end up doing more harm than good you know the opposite of what people should be doing to adapt changes that permanently eliminate their back pain for example common stretches like toe touches pulling your knees to your chest and other similar stretches they trigger what's called a stretch reflex which is a neurological phenomenon that temporarily reduces pain sensitivity meaning that after you perform these stretches you'll often experience about 15 to 20 minutes of pain relief which many would obviously perceive as beneficial but the problem is that in putting your spine in these flex positions you end up re-aggravating your discs and after you've experienced temporarily relief the pain will return much often worse than before which just creates a vicious cycle of thinking that these stretches are doing good and are the only solution for relief yet in reality are just contributing to the pain the key is to break this cycle if those stretches cured you then you wouldn't be watching this video so instead of focusing your energy on stretches that bend the spine focus your effort on movements and stretches for other parts of the body that can actually aid you on your road to being pain free rather than make the pain worse and within this video with the help of dr stuart mcgill one of the most respected experienced and knowledgeable experts in the world on treating back pain will share four such moves that can help do just that so to just start out our mobilizing routine what would be the first move that you'd recommend well based on the findings of our research where we assessed the stresses in the spinal discs we found the cat and camel was the very best way to reduce the friction in the spine and prepare the person to move the position for beginning the cat camel is on all fours knees are under the hips hands are over the shoulders most people need to spread their knees a little bit apart to free the hips so the move is full spinal flexion including the ball and socket joints of the head and shoulders and full spinal extension also you want to avoid pushing the end of each range as this is not a stretch and it's a simple movement of the spine that's most important now dr stewart mcgill measured spine stress on patients performed this movement and he found that only 7 to 8 cycles were all that was needed to help reduce spine friction and resistance in fact he found that further cycles could even undo the value of this exercise as we measured people performing the cat camel back and forth we measured the reduction in friction or the gooeyness of the joint if you want to consider it that and with within each cycle the person reduces that friction and they asymptote meaning that they don't remove any more friction after seven or eight cycles so that's all you need more cycles is not better once you've done six or seven so that's the warm-up recommendation so stick with that recommendation and avoid overdoing it after completing the cat camel and reducing a bit of friction in the spine we're now ready to move on to some mobilization drills for other problematic areas within the body that may be contributing to your back pain the first drill will target one of our major hip flexor muscles the psoas although this muscle is already pretty tight in most individuals due to prolonged sitting which puts this muscle in a shortened position much of dr mcgill's emg research showed that back pain actually tends to tighten this muscle even further which is problematic because as you can see here the psoas attaches to the lumbar spine so when this muscle becomes tightened it can actually pull your pelvis forward and down into an anteriorly tilted position which can increase the compressive force on your lower back and just worsen the pain that you might be experiencing stretching this muscle and taking it out of the shortened position it's in all day can therefore help provide some relief to that lower back tension however dr stewart mcgill's research has shown that your standard hip flexor stretch will not access this muscle due to its unique anatomy instead there's a unique move that we can do that helps to specifically stretch this muscle so i also know that based on research you found that the traditional hip flexor stretch it just doesn't really target the soils very well instead there's actually a special stretch that you recommend can you briefly just take us through how to perform it well jeremy as we've uh discussed in the past the traditional lunge stretches the hip flexors it's true but it doesn't target the psoas the syllabus is a very special hip flexor in that anatomically it travels up the lateral spine to the level of the diaphragm and if i adopt the lunge position i feel general hip flexor stress but it's not the psoas but when i raise my hand up very strictly over my head and push and lean my shoulder into the forward leg and i drop the shoulder back all of a sudden i feel that psoas tendon become tight and now for the first time i'm getting a true sewa stretch and i'll hold that for two or three seconds and then i'll lunge go to the other side i can feel the softness in the tendon push my arm up with effort very strictly drop the shoulder back and now i can really feel the soa stretch for the first time and i will go through six cycles per side and really enjoy the newfound mobility next we want to move on to a drill that will help us further mobilize and open up the hips while strengthening some of the important hip muscles that tend to be weak and inhibited in those experiencing back pain this is important to do because dr mcgill's research has shown that stiff and weak hips cause more motion to be transferred to the spine whenever we move for exercise and can therefore worsen the back pain that you're experiencing to improve this we're going to use a mobilization drill that's called hip airplanes so for these assume a single leg stance brace your core and grip the floor with your planted foot then place your hands on your hips and rotate your torso forward over your planted leg while kicking your back leg behind you you want to keep the back leg completely straight and your planted leg knee in a slightly bent position next rotate your hips in towards your planted leg and then transition to rotating it away from your planted leg a cue that may help out is to think about simply moving your belly button towards your planted leg and then away to the side you want to rotate only as far in and out as you're capable of doing at the moment and build upon this range of motion over time as you improve and you want the movement to come from your hips as opposed to simply twisting your upper body so just be mindful of that and aim for a total of three sets of three controlled reps with the movement if needed you could hold on to something for balance initially to get more familiar with the movement but eventually the goal is to progress this to the full hip airplanes with the arms spread out straight to the sides in order to add another dimension of difficulty to the movement so the last move is going to help with the daily upkeep of your back most of us sit for quite a bit throughout the day and all the sitting especially when done in a poor posture creates a lot of built up stress on the discs in our back this corrective drill here was designed by dr stewart mcgill to help combat that stress from sitting that can often worsen our back discomfort people complain that sitting at the computer causes back pain and as much as they try to sit upright sooner or later after an hour or so in front of the computer they are sitting in this cashew like position the antidote as we have measured it is to stand up and there is a stress that's been built up in the posterior part of the fist simply stand put the hands behind the back and relax and now we're going to measurably and progressively dispel that stress putting the hands over the head and just allowing that to dissipate some of the posterior stress in the disc and then put the hands as far back as possible comfortably possible and then fully and deeply inhale jacking the diaphragm up off the pelvic floor into full gentle extension and then putting the arms down and if we were to re-measure the stress that they had built up in their discs it would be measurably dispelled by breaking up every 20 to 30 minutes of prolonged sitting with this drill you'll be able to prevent an excessive buildup of stress on your lower back and will be better able to prepare your back for each period of sitting so as a summary if you're experiencing back pain then try to replace the bad stretches that do more harm than good with these moves instead and do them regularly ideally you want to do these daily or even multiple times a day just to break up your sitting if you're quite sedentary and you sit throughout the day if this helps alleviate your pain and discomfort then that's a sign that you're on the right track and it's an indication that you'll want to continue performing these stretches at the same time though just keep in mind that back pain is specific to you and your situation and there isn't a general fix for everyone luckily dr stewart mcgill has created a book a back mechanic that guides you through a self-assessment and then teaches you a solution matched to your specific pain i personally read through it and i would highly recommend it one side of the pain here also has other books that can help you then focus more on performance and i'll just leave the links to his books in the description box down below and for those of you who are looking for a complete step-by-step program that uses science to show you how to properly train and eat week after week to transform your body in the most efficient way possible then simply head on over to buildwithscience.com to take our analysis quiz

    "transcript": "there's something I need to tell you guys something I've been hiding for a long time now but really felt that I need to share with you growing up I struggled a lot with my confidence I was skinny weak my mom is Filipino Chinese so honestly I thought it was my genetics just holding me back but she's also a doctor which of course meant I was destined to be a doctor too but growing up I was able to see firsthand how she was using science to guide her decisions and completely change people's lives and so I wondered why can't I do that too and once I learned where to look I uncovered a ton of studies that were buried away because most gim Bros didn't care about them let alone knew they existed and as soon as I used what I learned my body completely transformed I knew I had to share this with the world but the bigger the channel got the more the pressure grew to feed the algorithm to keep up with the stream of new Juiced up Fitness influencers to get bigger and leaner of course these days everyone seems to be jumping on the juice come on guys did you really think I was joining the dark side no but with every new subscriber I did feel a deeper responsibility to find a more powerful way to help you guys more than my videos ever could so back in 2019 I set out to create something that could give you the personalized coaching experience you deserve now guys I thought this project would be easy but it's been hands down the most difficult thing I have ever done but I was stubborn with my vision because I knew if we could do it properly sticking to science back principles it would be a GameChanger for you it wasn't about rushing the market it was about making something worthwhile so now after six grueling years of sleepless nights stress and tears I'm excited I'm nervous but very proud to show you guys for the very first time our brand new app built with science plus the world's smartest Fitness coach every feature is designed to make your fitness journey simpler smarter and more effective and there's so much in there guys a 100% personalized and fully customizable training and nutrition program built around your body and the latest advancements in scientific research smart workout coaching that tells you exactly how much weight and how many reps to do every single workout a built-in diet coach that adjusts your diet as your metabolism changes an AI powered meal scanner no more we ingredients and scanning barcodes just take a picture of your plate and get a full nutrition breakdown log straight into the app now I'll run through all the amazing features in more detail but first probably wonder what truly sets built with science plus apart from all the thousands of fitness apps out there over promising and underd delivering well it's the same thing that sets this channel apart everything is backed by science every single element down to the Bare Bones we spent years combining Cutting Edge science with the personalization and guidance you need to succeed and to make that happen I brought in some of the smartest Minds in the field we worked with Dr Eric Trexler a leading health and Metabolism research from Duke University who's published over 80 peer-reviewed papers our head dietitian along with other top scientists and coaches helped us design every aspect of the app we built our in-house Tech te team led by the main man Kevin who you may have seen in some of my videos to create the app from the ground up so we didn't have to compromise on anything having Kevin and the team also means we can keep the app constantly up to date with the latest science so it will only get smarter and better especially with your guys' feedback so now let's get into what makes it so special it truly is an all-in-one Fitness and Nutrition solution all your workout and diet advice is here in one super smart but simple pth package which is important because exercise doesn't work alone yes it improves your health and can help with building strength but exercise alone actually doesn't do very much for fat loss and muscle growth it mostly comes down to your diet that's why my goal with build science plus was to combine everything you need in one app workouts nutrition tracking and personalized coaching all working together to keep you on track this way you don't need to toggle between different apps or gather information from different sources all you need need is built with science plus to simplify the whole process for you just tell it your body stats and we'll tell you exactly what workouts to do and what nutrition plan to follow all you have to do is show up now your workout plan should reflect you your goals your experience your equipment your schedule it's not just about doing what's optimal or what's worth for somebody else it's about what's best for you so maybe you only have dumbbells for your workouts or maybe you only have 30 minutes to train that's why built with nice Plus provid highly personalized workout plans that are actually based on your body and lifestyle we spend the time asking questions and learning about you personally so the app can build a perfect science-based workout plan just for you but more importantly one you will actually stick to most fitness programs hand you a plan and that's it you're on your own and that's where built with science plus is different it's there with you every step of the way it doesn't just give you a plan it evolves with you every single word go it'll tell you exactly how much weight to lift how many rests to do as if I was right there with you keeping you on track build with science plus takes the guesswork out of it so you can just focus on your workouts but if it's worth doing it's worth doing right most people in gym have terrible form because they're learning from coaches and influencers who learned from outdated textbooks but guys this is one of the most important factors you need to get right in order to get results that's why within the buildt with science Plus app app every single exercise in your routine comes with a highly detailed science-backed exercise for and video that's been written and designed using the latest scientific research it'll show you exactly where to put your hands how to place your feet and all the important details you need to know in order to get the most out of each exercise and avoid injuring yourself you guys have seen my exercise videos on YouTube so you know how detailed I get and we apply that same level of detail to over 200 exercises in the built with science Plus app plus they'll be continuously updated to reflect any new research that comes out now have you ever noticed that after about 3 to 4 weeks on a diet plan it stops working most people don't know this but your metabolism changes as you progress so your diet also needs to adapt that's why built with science plus doesn't just track all your meals it will adjust your nutrition plan every week to suit your goals your feedback and how your body is responding so you never get stuck and because nutrition is so important I wanted to make it as easy as possible for you guys to stay consistent and if you've ever tracked your calories before you know how tedious it can get most tracking apps require you to wave scan or log every single ingredient which becomes very difficult as soon as you leave the house so imagine this what if accurately tracking your meals was as easy as taking a picture that's how our new AI meal scanner works one quick snap and the app identifies every ingredient and the portion of sizes automatically it's super quick scary accurate and it'll just get better as you guys teach it now one of the limitations of YouTube is that it's static once my videos are up they just sit there aging they don't keep up with the latest science that was actually one of the main reasons I wanted to create the build with science Plus app it's always evolving with science research is always advancing we're always learning and so is built with science plus if we find a new exercise or dieting method that turns out to be more effective we can update the app instantly so you'll always have access to the most effective personalized science back strategies and that is honestly what excites me the most everything I've done with the channel has led up to here but this isn't the end of the journey it's actually just the next step the same way your feedback helps shape my YouTube videos and web-based programs it'll help shape this app too in

    "title": "The #1 Method to Lose Love Handles (FOR GOOD!)",
    "published_at": "2023-07-16T13:00:12Z",
    "transcript": "love handles are one of the toughest areas to get rid of but losing them is actually quite simple Fatality and no you don't need to starve yourself using the latest science I'll show you five easy steps that I guarantee will get rid of them and keep them off for good but first you need to understand how you develop your low panels to begin with and the cold hard truth is from overeating not from one night but from several months or even years of eating more calories than your body needs and guess what our bodies prefer to store excess calories as fat around the abdomen this is especially true for men as well as women after menopause and to make matters worse usually wherever the body stores fat first is where it will lose fat from last this is what makes belly fat lower back fat and love handles so easy to gain yet so tough to lose these areas build up slowly over time without you really noticing and then can seem almost impossible to lose no matter what you try but don't worry love animals are just like any other fat use the right approach and eventually they will go away but this starts with the most important step nutrition they've probably heard that you need to be in a deficit to lose fat right well while a calorie deficit is key it's not actually going to cause much fat loss in your love handles right away nope your body will prioritize other areas of your body like the fat around your face shoulders chest and arms before prioritizes stubborn areas like your love handles one of our build with science members Archie is a perfect example of this in the first few months although his belly and love handles didn't change much if you look closely you'll notice improvements in his face chest shoulders and upper stomach it wasn't until after this point did he finally start to see some progress in his love handles and he simply had to keep going until they eventually came off this is why you must use a calorie deficit that isn't too aggressive something you can stick to consistently month after month without feeling like you're about to drop dead most people try to rush it and while they may see some initial results they can't stick their diet for long enough for fat loss to love house or as soon as they do they gain it all back again instead for most people a good General Target is to aim to lose about a pound of fat a week which means you'll need to eat around 500 calories less than your body Burns every day but don't be afraid to take it even slower than this if you need to in fact if you had to build to a science.com calculator you can input your stats and it'll tell you roughly how many calories you should eat to lose fat but it'll also give you a slower option that'll be easier to follow now the next steps I'm about to show you can definitely speed this process up but just remember you're not in a rush it took years for your love handles to build up so don't expect to lose them overnight so the next two steps cover what exercises you should be doing first up is lifting weights now while this won't directly help get rid of your love handles it will help indirectly in many ways first of all increasing the size of your upper back and shoulder muscles can help create the illusion of a smaller waist and less noticeable love handles and second of all if you don't lift weights while your body is in a calorie deficit more of the weight you lose will be from muscle rather than fat this can not only negatively impact your metabolism but the more muscle you lose during a Diet also seems to be directly correlated with How likely you'll be to regain the fat afterwards so think of lifting weights as a way of making you notches look better after you've lost the fat but also as a safety guard to prevent fat regain in the future and if you need a lifting routine to get started with in the description box I'll put links to a free three day four day and six day per week routine you can pick from however if your main goal right now is to lose your love handles then you actually don't need much work or volume Studies have shown that as little as three to six hard sets per muscle per week is likely all you need to maintain your muscle with older individuals likely needing the top end of that range so one strategy especially if you struggle with consistency is rather than lifting weights five to six times per week consider for now bringing it down to four or even just three times a week or consider reducing your overall number of sets and of exercises and use that freed up time and energy towards the next step alright step 3 so although lifting weights is great for building muscle it does have a downside lifting weights has been shown to burn on average about 1.7 calories per minute for women and around 3 calories per minute per meth which amounts to roughly 70 to 200 calories burned from an hour-long workout now while this can be quite a bit higher for bigger stronger individuals it's still just not a very efficient way to burn calories jogging or cycling for example burns on average about 10 to 20 calories per minute depending on your weight so you could potentially burn the same amounts of calories as you do from an hour-long weightlifting session in just 10 to 15 minutes of moderate intensity cardio and the importance of this goes back to creating a calorie deficit although you should primarily create a deficit through your diet you should also aim to increase the calories you burn through exercise part of this will be through lifting weights but most of this should be with cardio now I know the very thought of cardio might scare you away but as you'll see cardio doesn't have to be grueling running sessions and you don't have to do crazy amounts of it I'll show you an easy yet effective weekly cardio routine that you can get started with right away but first let me explain why most people need it so some individuals will be able to get really lean and lose their love handles without any cardio at all but typically these are people who are already active and on their feet all day in fact if you use our calorie calculator you'll see there's almost a 700 calorie difference in daily calories burned from someone who sits all day compared to someone with a very active job and on their feet all day so unless you have coin act and job or lifestyle without any cardio you're going to have to eat quite a low amount of calories in order to lose fat and as I'll explain in The Next Step this amount will only get lower and lower as you get closer to losing your love handles plus one unique benefit of cardio is that regardless of if you lose weight or not it'll help reduce your visceral fat the Deep dangerous fat in your belly this is obviously great for your health but also might even make a small difference with losing love paddles by reducing the overall size of your belly but it's important you do the right type and the right amount of cardio just like your diet you need something you can stick to week after week so what I'd recommend is just start with walking Track on average how many steps a day you're currently taking and aim to bump that up by 2 000 steps a day once you can do that bump it up a little more and keep doing that until you reach around eight thousand to ten thousand steps a day that alone will make a massive difference in your daily calorie burn and might honestly be all that you need in addition to that you can also consider adding some low to moderate intensity cardio to your routine but again only will you enjoy and can stick to consistently if you hate running and you're not going to stick to it then don't rot here is a great example of this from one of our built to a science members Camp he had always struggled with his left handles but finally started seeing some progress after simply adding 20 to 30 minutes of incline walking after each of his workouts combined with taking longer walks with his dog so try cycling swimming incline on walk-in spike ball anything that gets you moving counts start out with 50 to 20 minutes two to three times a week and from there use will show you the next step to determine if you need to increase this further alright now the plan I'm giving you so far will work wonders if you stick to it but chances are at some point you'll get stuck you see as you lose weight your body Burns fewer calories part of this is due to you just carrying less Mass but part of it is also due to you subconsciously just moving less to preserve your fat stores as a result research has shown that a 10 drop in body weight is typically accompanied by 20 to 25 decrease in 24-hour energy expenditure now while being consistent with your steps and activity from step three can definitely help prevent this it's still likely you'll reach a point where what used to work is no longer working and you can tell if you've reached this point if you haven't noticed any fat loss or much drop in your body weight for at least two to three weeks but when this happens it's important not to make drastic changes to your plant generally there's two things you can do option number one is to drop your calorie intake now this is a good option if you're already quite active and feel like eating just a little bit less every day wouldn't be very difficult to stick to and typically a decrease of just a hundred calories or so per day is all that's needed now option two is to go the other way and to increase your activity and the average calories you burn every day but again only a small change is needed this can be as simple as bumping up your daily steps or adding another 20 to 30 minutes of low to moderate intensity cardio into your weekly routine now if you stay consistent with everything I've shown you so far I guarantee you'll lose your love handles but honestly the last step is to consider whether or not it's even worth it you see to completely lose your love panels you have to get very late a level of leanness that for most people including myself is very difficult to sustain and I've seen many people fall into the Trap of being so obsessed over losing their love handles that they Overlook all the progress they've made elsewhere and don't all realize how great they already look for example here's some of our bill size members Saran and Dexter both look incredible and as you can see in Dexter's case he's already made a ton of progress with losing his love handles yet both are still fixated on completely burning them all and honestly to do so they just have to continue pushing and dieting to a point where they just may not be able to maintain afterwards believe me I know we all want to look like all the shredded guys on social media but most of these guys have incredible genetics often are natural and also just don't share with you how difficult it is to maintain that shape and how crappy and low energy can make you feel day-to-day so don't worry if you still have a little bit of love handles or lower belly fat embrace all the progress you've already made take breaks and just maintain whatever you need to and realize that the extra push just might not be worth the trade-off and if you want a done for you plan that'll guide you step by step throughout the whole process just head over to builtwoodscience.com and take the quiz to find the best program for you and your body highly recommend giving this video watch next to learn about what to eat to further help lose that stubborn fat

    "title": "Why You Can&#39;t Lose Stubborn Fat (4 Things Stopping You)",
    "published_at": "2020-09-20T16:17:19Z",
    "transcript": "if you've attempted to die in the past then you probably noticed that some areas on your body lose fat quickly while other areas that just don't seem to budge for most of us it's the lower belly love handles and lower back fat that we just can't seem to get rid of regardless of what we do and how hard we work and as i've explained in my past videos there is a scientific explanation to this simply put these areas receive less blood flow and contain fat cells that are more stubborn to burn off when compared to other areas of our body in fact our glutes are known as the toughest place to lose fat and have been shown to be 10 to 20 times more stubborn to get rid of them belly fat so if you think that you have a heart just imagine what pro bodybuilders have to go through in order to get striations and their glutes to start showing now i'm just going to assume that you're probably not after the shredded glutes levelliness but nonetheless getting rid of stubborn fat in the belly and lower back will still require a great deal of patience and perseverance as these areas are generally the last to go take trevor here for example one of our beloved science members who recently lost an incredible 80 plus pounds over the course of nine months on this program now if you take a look at his pictures a little more closely you'll notice that throughout the course of his journey despite losing almost 60 pounds his stubborn areas like his lower belly fat and love handles were still hanging on it wasn't until he broke past this point did he start to see more and more progress in these problem areas and eventually by simply being patient and sticking to his calorie deficit he managed to lose those problem areas altogether however the problem with stubborn fat is that staying patient and adhering to your calorie deficit will get more and more difficult to do as you get leaner and leaner our body fights back and as a result most of us get stuck right around here and is why so few actually end up successfully burning off these stubborn areas in fact this is where trevor mentioned that he had the most difficult time to break through and that is exactly what this video is about where i'll cover four habits that you need to break that are preventing you from breaking through that sticking point fix these and just like trevor did you'll be able to finally burn off those stubborn areas the first thing preventing you from losing that stubborn fat is you're too aggressive and impatient with your approach what most people don't realize is that your rate of weight loss throughout the weeks will and should slow down because when you're at a higher body fat percentage research has shown that you're able to lose fat at a faster rate with less risk of muscle loss but this ability diminishes as you get leaner and leaner yet the second that people stop losing one to two pounds a week and their weight loss begins to slow down they get worried and they try to speed it up by drastically cutting down their calories and using unsustainable approaches this can then lead to rebounding altogether or too much weight being lost too quickly which then comes at the cost of muscle loss something that we want to avoid at all costs since as covered in my past interview with dr eric trexler muscle loss seems to be highly correlated with increased hunger levels which doesn't seem to recover back to normal until that muscle mass is restored which is problematic because this then makes dieting that much harder to the point where you just can't stick to it for long enough for fat loss to reach those stubborn areas so instead stick to a rate of weight loss of around 0.5 to 1 percent of your body weight per week starting out if you're at a higher body fat percentage you can stick to the higher end of the range since you can afford to lose more weight per week but as you get leaner and leaner and your body fat lowers you want to then slow this rate down to minimize the risk of muscle loss as long as you're not completely stolen for example you might initially be losing two to three pounds a week yet only losing around half a pound a week once you do get pretty lean and as you can see in trevor's weight loss graph here he applied this concept and slowed his weight loss down especially as he got considerably leaner towards the end so just like trevor did don't get discouraged stay patient and trust the process the next habit you need to break is poor calorie tracking to achieve the level of leanness needed for stubborn fat to come off you're going to want to not only be tracking your daily calorie intake but doing so accurately in order to ensure that you're actually eating at a calorie deficit because most of us are horrible at just estimating our food intake in fact the data shows us that people tend to under report their daily calorie intake by anywhere from 300 to even over a thousand calories per day even dietitians have been shown to under report their calories by an average of 223 calories per day i mean take for example people who eat a serving of peanut butter if you actually wait it out it can easily double or triple the calories you thought you were consuming but even if you are tracking you may not be doing so accurately many people overlook the little things like condiments creamers and sauces that you use throughout the day and fail to realize how small the serving sizes are for these and how easily it can rack up hundreds of additional calories throughout the day and when you then throw in the dinners out the social events or the weekends where most people just end up letting loose or just loosely tracking their calories that can easily rack up to thousands of additional calories that will completely offset the hard work that you put in all week in fact one study actually showed that subjects who were monitored on their diet tended to lose weight during the weekdays but would end up plateauing or even gaining weight back during the weekends due to overeating so again just realize that sacrifices will have to be made be diligent with your tracking and try to prioritize cooking more meals at home so that you know exactly what's going into your meals and when you do go out for dinners or social events on the weekends for example plan ahead so you can actually have a good time and enjoy yourself without sabotaging your progress for example if you know that you have a big social event on saturday then simply cut down your calorie intake by another 100 calories or so during the week in preparation then on the day of the event stick to mainly protein and veggies leading up to it so you can save more calories for that meal you can easily save an additional 2000 calories or so to spend at that event if you simply plan ahead the third habit you need to break is poor calorie management in the beginning of your diet you can get away with being more flexible with your food choices skipping meals and fitting in more treats as long as by the end of the day you're still eating at a calorie deficit however as you get deeper into your diet and you get leaner and leaner and are now also likely eating less calories than you were in the beginning of your diet you have much less wiggle room at this point your body is going to be doing everything that it can to fight back to prevent us from continuing to lose fat you'll be hungrier you'll be more fatigued and while as a result you'll have a much harder time adhering to your calorie deficit which means that if you want to break past this point then you need to now start managing your daily calories better although yes your daily calorie intake is what matters most for weight loss the way you spend these calories every day has a major impact on your hunger levels and recovery so instead of spending or saving your daily calories to fit in convenient less nutritious high calorie foods that won't do much in terms of your hunger you're going to have to make some sacrifices here and instead opt for high volume nutrient dense low calorie foods that will provide the best bang for your buck in terms of suppressing your hunger boosting your daily energy levels and speeding up your recovery as you get leaner you're going to have to accept that you will be hungrier than you were when you were carrying around more body fat and managing that hunger with the right foods really is going to be key for you to continue making progress i mean yes you can still fit in treats here and there and use and if it fits your macros approach but the frequency at which you do so will have to decrease as you get leaner and leaner and adhere into your calorie deficit becomes more difficult the last thing that is preventing you from losing that stubborn fat is that you've gone lazier you've been dieting for a while things are getting tough and the initial excitement of starting your diet is gone this is when people start to overlook little things they start to be less active they start to skip out on walks and they'll just move less throughout the day than they used to in fact research has consistently found this to be true when dieting since your body tries to preserve its energy in response which is detrimental for fat loss since these subtle movements actually do burn a significant amount of calories every day this in combination with the fact that you just weigh less now than you did at the start of your diet can result in you now unknowingly burning hundreds of calories less than you did before which can easily put fat loss at a hold so to account for this drop in calories burned you do have a couple options you can either bump up your overall activity levels a little bit more and or slightly reduce your calorie intake but in order to minimize the extent to which you have to do those two things just make it a habit to move more throughout the day keep track of your daily step count aim to hit a target and be consistent with that target throughout your diet so you don't end up unknowingly burning significantly fewer calories especially as you get leaner and leaner but all in all when it comes to losing stubborn fat the more variables that you can control and keep track of the better as it's often an oversight in any of these variables i mentioned that cause people to stall and prevent fat loss from ever reaching those stubborn areas that's exactly why within our built with science programs we not only guide you week after week of the workouts of nutrition but we've also included tracking software that'll enable you to see how your weight and the daily calories you burn change throughout the weeks this is how our members like trevor were finally able to get rid of that stubborn fat after countless unsuccessful attempts to get started today just simply head on over to buildwithscience.com and take a free analysis quiz that will determine what program is best for you

    "title": "The PERFECT 10 Minute HIIT Cardio Workout To Lose Fat (Gym or Home)",
    "published_at": "2021-03-21T17:19:21Z",
    "transcript": "high intensity interval training or hit is one of the biggest fitness buzzwords that's come along in the past decade in fact 1996 is when hit became famous in the general fitness world when researcher dr tabata released a paper describing a new interval training regimen that he developed where he performed several rounds of alternating between short high intensity exercise intervals followed by a brief rest period he found that this delivers superior results in terms of cardiovascular fitness yet in far less time than steady state cardio since then researchers have found that in most cases hit can provide superior or at least similar improvements in cardiovascular fitness athletic performance and weight loss as traditional longer less intense cardio sessions do yet in a fraction of the time for example you can do 40 minutes of steady state cardio or do around 10 minutes of hit and experience superior cardiovascular benefits which is so beneficial because we know that lack of time is one of if not the most cited barrier to exercise adherence the problem now though is that this research opened the floodgates to people claiming five-minute hit workouts with promises of melted fat hit has since been abused by the industry and it's used totally out of context i mean most hip workouts that you find on the internet and probably experimented with are not true hit and won't deliver the unique benefits that hit really has to offer in today's video though i'll show you how to design a true hit workout for you to use whether it's at home with no equipment or the gym and then we're going to go through how to properly implement it to maximize your results with the routine maintaining a high enough intensity and an elevated heart rate is by far the single most important factor there is when performing hit and it's why most people who are doing what they think is hit aren't really doing hit at all as emphasized by dr tabata himself in a recent 2019 paper too much thought is put on the protocol with too little emphasis put on the actual intensity they perform it at so to ensure you're working hard enough there's two things that you want to do here first during your work intervals push as hard as you can or close enough to it being tired simply isn't enough the goal for each of your work intervals is to get your heart rate to around at least 85 percent of your max heart rate so let's say you're 25 years old this would equate to a heart rate of at least 165 beats per minute now if you don't have any sort of heart rate monitor handy then a simple test to determine if you're truly working hard enough is as follows if you can say more than a few words without pausing for a breath during or shortly after your work interval then you're not working hard enough dude it's simple but it correlates very well with intensity second during your rest intervals keep moving at a moderate intensity this will not only help increase your overall oxygen consumption which ultimately leads to more calories burned and greater physiological improvements but will also ensure that your average heart rate remains high enough throughout the whole hit session but at the same time just don't overdo it some studies even use just plain old brisk walking as a rest period the key is to keep moving at a pace that will help you recover for your next work interval rather than hinder it next we need to choose an appropriate work to rest ratio now there's no set protocol for hit nor is there a perfect ratio for your work to rest intervals as numerous studies have found that various different intervals can be used to elicit significant physiological changes as long as the intensity is still there when reviewing the literature though it does seem as though a two to one work to rest ratio is the most time efficient as that was generally the minimum amount of time that subjects needed to sufficiently recover between their work intervals so this could look something like a 30 second sprint with a 15 second brisk walk in between but keep in mind that your current level of fitness is what's going to govern what work to rest ratio is most appropriate for you the only real downside with using longer rest periods is that the workout will take longer to complete but intensity again is what's most important so if you find that you're way too gassed during your work intervals you'd be better off using a little longer of a rest interval or shorter work interval something like a one to two work to rest ratio would be a good starting point which can eventually be progressed to a one-to-one work-to-rest ratio and then even a two-to-one work-to-breast ratio if appropriate choose what's most appropriate for you and your current level of fitness and focus more so on intensity and elevating the heart rate now that we've got the intensity and structure of the workout nail down it's time to pick your exercises you want to use exercises that suit your level of fitness equipment availability and do a good job of elevating your heart rate but again intensity is what's most important so you have a lot of freedom when it comes to exercise selection if you're at the gym a simple yet effective option are sprints on an exercise bike it's low impact it's easy on the joints and has the lowest risk of injury but you can essentially use any modality that you have available and perform your hit workout on that just be aware that some exercises like all those sprints on a treadmill will cause more stress on your joints and will have a higher risk of injury and then for rest intervals you would simply perform that exercise but just at a slower pace now if you're at home with no equipment or if you just want to switch things up then all you need is your body weight as long as you pick the right exercises for instance one study compared the same hip protocol on all else cycle sprints versus burpees and found that if able to maintain the same intensities both exercises were just as effective at inducing physiological benefits in fact studies have shown that burpees can produce an average heart rate of 170 beats per minute which is similar to what you typically get with an all-out sprint but in addition to burpees which i know we all love some other effective body weight exercises that have been successfully used in various hit studies include squat jumps [Music] jump lunges running in place [Music] mountain climbers rope [Music] star jumps [Music] and shadow boxing [Music] you could simply use one of these exercises for your work intervals or a combination of them for some variety and for your rest periods slow jogging in place or jumping jacks at a slow pace would work perfectly but the exercises that you want to avoid using are strength training exercises like weighted squats push-ups or even abs exercises like sit-ups those are going to be tough to reach your target heart rate with safely and in my opinion are better off done in a separate strength training workout so lastly you need to determine the duration of your workout and how many rounds you want to commit to after you're properly warmed up and this ultimately depends on your goals and why you're doing hit if you're trying to improve or maintain your cardiovascular fitness then research has shown that a hit workout as short as eight minutes with a one-to-one work-to-rest ratio is adequate but if you're wanting to burn more calories for fat loss then you're gonna need to work a little bit longer since hit was primarily designed to increase performance rather than shed belly fat by burning a ton of calories to put this into perspective a study which used only squat jumps and a 20 second work to 10 second rest period found that after a round of four minutes of this female subjects burned an average of 54 calories so if you took a brief rest between each of these 4-minute workouts and accumulated 20 minutes in total you could expect to burn just over 200 calories and potentially even more depending on your body weight similarly a study on mostly male subjects found similar results with a 16-minute hit cycling session on average burning 209 calories and the highest numbers that i personally saw in the research range from 240 to 360 calories for a 20 minute body wave hit workout in male subjects so obviously the range is going to vary depending primarily on your body weight but generally if you do a hit to boost your performance then a shorter eight minute session will likely do the trick but if you want to also burn a decent amount of calories to aid in your fat loss efforts then adding more rounds to get you up to at least 20 minutes would be best so to put this all together for you here is an example 10 minute home hit workout and here is an example cycling workout both using a one to one work to rest ratio feel free to tweak the work to rest ratio and durations to better suit your fitness levels as mentioned previously if you want to just focus on improving your cardiovascular fitness then do one round of this if you want to burn more calories however then take a quick break after a round if needed then repeat for another round for a total of 20 minutes just don't forget about doing an adequate warm-up and cool down as well as for how often to do these hit workouts this is gonna totally depend on your goals generally i'd recommend between one to three times per week as they are quite intense and will require adequate recovery all in all i hope you're able to see what a true hit workout really entails and how to structure one based on your needs just keep in mind though that when it comes to transforming your body hit is just one tool in the toolbox and it has its place but knowing how to also properly incorporate steady state cardio weight training sessions and your nutrition into your overall plan is what's key to transforming your body as efficiently as possible and for a step-by-step program that uses science to guide you every step of the way to a lean muscular physique then simply head on over to buildwithscience.com and take our

    "title": "The Easiest Way to Calculate Your Lean Bulk Macros (Step By Step)",
    "published_at": "2016-11-01T01:13:05Z",
    "transcript": "what's up guys this Jeremy from hit your body and today we're going to calculate our macros for lean bulking so this is a question I get asked a lot by my clients and it's basically how can you calculate your Macros and your calories when it comes to lean bulking and first of all what lean bulking is is it's a type of bulk where you want to minimize the amount of fat that you put on so that you can stay relatively lean throughout your bulk and we do this by using just a small caloric Surplus so we're going to get started with the calories and then we're going to go through each macronutrient protein fat and carbohydrates so for calories you're going to get your total daily energy expenditure which is how many calories you burn every day and to do this I need you guys to click the link in my description um I put a link to a TDE calculator and that will give you the number of calories that you burn a day based on several factors so in this this case let's say we have 2,500 as our TDE we're simply going to add 250 calories to that and this will give us 2750 calories and this is the amount of calories we need to be eating at every day uh for our lean bolt um and this will allow us to gain 0.5 lb per week of weight and this may not seem like a big number guys but it does add up over time and the good thing about a lean bulk is this number is at a higher percentage of muscle compared to Fat um than if we were to gain let's say one pound per week so now we're going to calculate our protein needs and for this guys we're going to stick with a range of 0.8 to 1 G per pound of body weight so a lot of recent studies on protein intake on athletes show that 0.82 g per pound of body weight is all that your body really needs so we're just going to stick with this overall range um and now we want to calculate range based in GRS of protein so an example for somebody who is 160 lb we want to multiply the body weight so in this case 160 lb times the lower end of the range so 160 * 0.8 and do the same with the higher end of the range so 160 * 1 and this will give us a range of 128 G to 160 g of protein so should you be at the higher or lower end of this range well it really depends on a variety of factors um it depends on your personal preference do you personally enjoy eating a lot of protein a lot of meat um I personally do so I like to stick to the higher end of the range I typically eat around 1 G per uh pound of body weight and it also depends on your body do you function better on high protein low protein you really just got to test it out so now we're going to talk about fat and your fat calories should be around 20 to 30% of your total calories so we're going to go from a percent of fat calories to uh actual fat calories and then we're going to go to grams of fat so how we do that is we take the total number of calories we need to eat we multiply that by2 which will give us 550 calories of fat and then we do the same with 30% so 2750 times3 and this will give us 825 fat calories so this is our fat calorie range in terms of calories and now we're going to go to GRS of fat and to do this we just simply divide by n because fat has n calories per gram so this will give us a range of 61 to 92 G of fat so should you be at the high or lower end well the answer is similar to that of protein it really depends on your personal preference I personally find that I perform better in the gym with a higher intake of carbs so I will stick with a lower um at the lower end of the range of fat so that I can put more calories into my carbohydrates and if you feel the same way then you can go ahead and stick to the lower lower end of the range or if you personally pref prefer eating a lot of fat in your diet um as opposed to carbs and you can stick to the higher end of the range or you can start in the middle and just see um what you would prefer to do so now we're going to get into the carbohydrates so the carbs is basically Bally what you have left over after you calculate your protein and your fat so here is the total amount of calories we're eating we're going to minus that by the um amount of calories we have from protein so here we have 160 I just assume that this person will pick the 160 G um of protein the higher end of the protein range and we're going to multiply that by four because protein has four calories per gram so this will give us the amount of calories we get from protein we're going to minus that also by um the amount of calories we get from fat so in this case I'm just going to assume he get he picks 550 calories um so we minus these both from the total calories which will give us, 1500 60 calories of carbs that we have left to play with and we're going to divide that by four because carbs also have uh 4 calories per gam and this will give us 390 G of carb so all in all this person will have a total caloric intake of 2750 calories he will eat 160 g of protein uh 61 G of fat and 390 G of carbs so there you go guys I hope it was easy for you to do don't be intimidated by the Numbers it really is an easy process if you go through it step by step and at the end of it you'll have a full macronutrient guide and you'll know your caloric needs and I really encourage enage you to play around with the numbers play around with the ranges and see how your body performs best so if you enjoyed this video If it helped you out then please do me a favor like comment and subscribe and I'll see you next time guys thank you"

    "title": "How to Get Bigger Biceps (5 Mistakes You\u2019re Probably Making)",
    "published_at": "2018-05-06T14:06:26Z",
    "transcript": "when it comes to which muscle groups contribute the most to an aesthetic and attractive physique the biceps are definitely among the top of the list the biceps when well developed will help contribute to the overall fullness of the arm and creates a prominent peak when flexed but despite the biceps being probably the most trained muscle by most people it's also one of the more stubborn muscle groups to develop why is this well mainly because aimlessly picking up a dumbbell and curling it likely isn't going to be enough to provide you with the biceps development you're looking for instead you need to pay close attention to how exactly you're performing your biceps exercises and use a more methodological approach when training them take this video of me curling for example if you can't spot at least two of the mistakes and making then chances are you're probably doing one of them which might very well be the mistake sabotaging your growth therefore in this video I'll go through five of the most common mistakes people make that hinders biceps growth the first and probably the most common mistake is letting other muscles take over and steal tension from the biceps during your curling exercises which is something that I was unknowingly doing for a very long time and the three main culprits for this are the front delts upper traps and forearms but luckily these can all be quickly fixed with simple tweaks in your form you can easily tell if your front delts are taking over if your elbows move forward as you curl although a few degrees of movement is normal and expected during a curl since the biceps also weakly assist in shoulder flexion once it becomes excessive is when it becomes a major problem since it takes tension away from the biceps so what you want to do instead is lower the weight and ensure that you're keeping your elbow locked in place and pinned to your side throughout the curl like so which will allow your biceps to take on almost the entire load and minimize the involvement of the front delts another option if you're still struggling with this is to perform the curl with your back and elbows against the wall which will physically force your elbows to stay locked in place the next muscle the upper traps is a little more subtle to catch but it's just as common you can tell if your traps are taking over the curl if you're shrugging your shoulders up towards your ears every time you curl this once again takes a lot of the tension away from the biceps and is an indication that you should probably lower the weight instead you want to depress your traps by bringing your shoulders down and away from your ears before your curl and keep them in this depressed position throughout the movement doing so will instantly shift a lot of the tension back to the biceps and finally letting your forearms take over happens when you flex your wrist as you curl the weight it's not only shift tension away from the biceps but also puts your wrists at a mechanical disadvantage instead you want to keep the wrist in a neutral or slightly extended position to both increased wrist ability and place more tension on the biceps although as mentioned in my biceps peak video a partial range of motion can be used to target specific regions of the biceps generally you want to use a full range of motion to optimize overall development of the biceps this is because several studies have favored the use of full range of motion over partial range of motion for both strength and muscle growth for example one 2012 study by Pinto and colleagues found that in 40 male subjects using a full range of motion during the biceps curl led to significantly greater growth of the biceps and a 25% increase in strength as opposed to just 16% in the partial range of motion group you can implement this when curling by contracting the triceps at the bottom of every rep to ensure that the biceps are fully lengthened before each rep which will also help maximize biceps recruitment in the following rep due to the concept of reciprocal inhibition although the previous tip will dramatically improve the tension place on the biceps it's also important that you actually feel and focus on the biceps working during your exercises and yes this will make a huge difference in your growth for example one very recent 2018 study by Schoenfeld and colleagues found that subjects who use this mind to muscle idea by focusing on squeezing the biceps during each rep of a curl experience almost double the muscle growth in their biceps compared to subjects who were instructed to just simply get the weight up so instead of just trying to curl the weight up you need to focus on really feeling the biceps working which often will require you to set your ego aside and lighten the weight that you use and one helpful cue to think about as a girl is to think about squeezing the bar into your body so think about squeezing your biceps to move the bar towards your body as opposed to thinking about just simply lifting the weight doing so will help enhance a contraction of your biceps during each rep I've made this point clear in a few of my past videos that in order to get well-rounded development of the biceps you need to train both the short head and the long head we can emphasize the short head more about utilizing biceps exercises where the elbows are moved in front of the body which causes the long head to enter active insufficiency exercises that accomplish this our spider curls preacher curls chin ups and so on and on the other hand we can emphasize the long head more by utilizing biceps exercises where the elbows are moved behind the body exercises that accomplish this or incline dumbbell curls behind the body cable curls and drag curls but rather than trying to perform all these exercises I suggest that for those past the beginner stage you can include one to two exercises for the short head and one to two exercises for the long head in your overall routine and focus on progressing these movements over time one of the first things people do if a muscle isn't responding well is increase the volume for that muscle group and although we know based on Brad Schoenfeld 2016 meta-analysis that up to a certain point more volume does mean more growth you have to be aware of how your volume is accumulating through other movements for example on your back or pull days your biceps are heavily involved in almost every single exercise you typically do adding in tons of isolation exercises on top of this will very likely lead to the opposite effect you're looking for this is especially true in the case of non-responders since research shows that they typically exhibit a magnified inflammatory response to training compared to high responders simply meaning that they exhibit more inflammation and muscle damage than usual after training and indicates that a lower volume approach may in fact be ideal so instead if you aren't seeing the results that you want despite increasing volume take a step back and decrease the volume dedicated to your biceps and see how they respond instead of for example adding in four or more by isolation exercises to your overall routine stick to just a couple and focus on progressively overloading those as well as your main pulling movements it's very likely that you'll find your biceps respond much better to this adjusted level of volume that's pretty much it for the video guys to sum up the video here are the main points that I want you to take away if you've been struggling with growing your biceps then it's very likely that at least one of the following mistakes is a reason why choosing the right exercises is one thing but perform them correctly and properly incorporating them into your routine is what makes all the difference anyways as always for those interested you can check out the written summary of this video on my

    "transcript": "so i just got the keys um yesterday and we're about to do the first first walk through hey guys thank you so much for watching for those of you that don't know i'm jeremy i'm a personal trainer and kinesiologist executing these exercises in the right manner is really what's key to maximizing the growth that you're going to experience from what's going on guys so as you probably already noticed i'm not wearing my blue tank and that means we're doing something different today so in honor of hitting 3 million subscribers just recently and again thank you guys so much for helping me reach that milestone i thought it'd be a good idea to give you guys a more personal update on what's been going on with myself and my company built with science since i never really did that ever since i hit 1 million subscribers which was about a year and a half ago and let me just tell you within that year and a half a lot has happened so first off we've been getting a ton of publicity i think that men's health has actually picked up and featured um about 10 of our built with science transformation so far which is which is crazy but they also as many of you would have seen on my instagram they featured me on their magazine and their youtube channel as well which was crazy and this alone was such a cool experience for me because like many of you guys watching i've looked up to men's health and follow them ever since i was a kid so for them to not only feature myself but also being built besides programs and my biblical science members that alone is just it's so cool and it really was such a humbling experience in addition that i also did some live interviews with yahoo ktla morning news and some other news stations that some of you guys actually managed to catch live in your tvs so again just really really cool and really uh surreal experiences for me and just a great opportunity to put not only myself but also built with science on the map so those are really great now aside from that another really exciting thing that's happened is just the growth of the build science team i mean just a year and a half ago when i did that 1 million subscriber video i was pretty much a one-man army trying to do everything and i mean you guys just see the youtube videos but behind the scenes there is so much stuff that goes on not only to put out those videos and the research behind it but also with the company but with science and the programs and you know just trying to grow the company and manage everything it was it was crazy but thankfully along the way i've been lucky enough to get some really talented people on the build of science team to help with their mission from my video editor and you guys know how awesome he is so shout out to sebio and our web designer our videographer and actually most recently my younger brother ethan who now works full-time with built with science and this man is incredible not only is he you know just extremely talented but he is just as dedicated to the biblical science mission as i am and to be honest what i found is that there are so many shady people out there so to have somebody who i can not only 100 trust but is just as talented and dedicated as ethan is it's been it's been a blessing so ethan i'm i'm grateful for you man so another thing that's really grown the team is the launch and growth of our built with science three on one coaching program where we now have a strong team of extremely talented coaches and dietitians who manage clients from all over the world but yeah overall it's just been really exciting to see this grow to something bigger than just me and just slowly creating a team that that really does see the vision that i have for built with science and really does care about changing lives as much as i do that's something that i've always wanted so it's great to see this come to life now last but not least the most exciting update i don't think you guys have seen me this excited or emotional ever which is kind of weird but it's for good reason because we just secured our built with science headquarters just a few weeks ago [Music] all right let's get one let's give them a little tour first floor is warehouse and this is going to be jungle it's going to be the gym and upstairs which i'll show you later that's going to be the office the layout for the warehouse so this space right here from is kind of like ikea you know when you walk in there's like a kitchen and then a living room and then you walk somewhere else and it's like a different living room i already create like a home workout setting here so that i can film all my homework videos i'm not sure when the new quite yet i might put like a picture frame at least or something to make it feel like it's at home and then soon as we cross as soon as we cross this wall right here that is where this is where the match is so this is where the gym is going to be i'm going to have all the stream equipment i actually just put the deposit down for um a bunch of equipment by atlantis so that's going to come in a few months and they're going to help me on the layout of all the equipment i'm super excited their equipment is awesome and we have a bunch of cool stuff coming and it's honestly like it was like christmas i was just picking different machines at one and gave them the wish list and i was just like a little kid on christmas it's awesome right now it looks like a really bare bones and even i am having a hard time like envisioning full you know finished product but it's going to be really exciting to see it come to life and i i'm so excited so one thing in canada is soda open winter bc is actually not as bad as the rest of hannah but it's still cold and we usually film early morning so whenever we used to go to the gym early morning it would be just like freezing cold and i'd take like shots of my shirt off and i'd literally be like nipples are super hard but we got a heater so i'm going to try to hook that up with my phone so that by the time we get here it's just nice and toasty that's just it's a little things like that make all the difference we need something where the down light in this like you know makes you look ten times bigger than you really were so keep in mind right now uh since we just got the place there's actually tenants up tenants here so while we're doing randoms downstairs you're gonna be working up here and then once you're done right now is downstairs once the gym's ready then they're gonna leave and we're gonna start doing whatever rhinos in the actual office and all the stuff will be moved up wow jeremy yeah look at all this gym stuff this is gonna be like ehq because we have a lot of people who work for built with science here in vancouver bc and my brothers yeah two of my brothers they actually work closely with me so this is gonna be like just where we work throughout the day then we get a workout in then we come back and work it's going to be awesome and then also all of our build with science coaches a lot of them are local too so it's just going to be cool for everybody to get together have an actual place where the team can get together i think it makes a huge difference oh and one really cool thing so this right here if you were to break it then you'd go right into the gym so what we're planning on doing hopefully we can do this is like putting two windows that overlook the gym so that you can watch people working out like a little creep that is pretty much it yeah it's crazy because like just a few years ago when i was first starting uh youtube i was it was literally just a kid and his tripod his camera and i remember i'd have to go to this private gym to film my videos when nobody was there and i'd have to wait until you know midnight every time i wanted to film and i'd be up until two or three and just the only one in that gym filming and i was crying and hustling but i loved it which is crazy to see how like just a few years later that i literally have my own space my own place where i can just be totally free and creative and it just goes to show you that if you're truly passionate about something and you put in the work and you believe in yourself and you just consistently do the right thing and you focus on helping others that anything anything that you dream you can bring to reality so really humbling humbling experience and i'm just i'm honestly i'm grateful grateful anyways that's pretty much it guys again i just i just really quickly want to say thank you so much for your continued support and not only your continued support but just the positivity that you guys spread i mean if you look at my youtube videos you look at the comment section and you see all the positive comments and just the overall positivity that is rare to see on youtube and social media in general so thank you so much that is what i'm all about um it's your it's your continued support it's your loyalty and it's your word of mouth that really is making all this possible for me and it's what's enabling me to carry out my mission of just changing as many laughs as possible and spreading the truth yes there's a lot happening and a lot of new projects coming out but these are all just steps towards helping me create better and better content and products for you guys which is what i love doing the most and is where my true passion lies so thank you thank you thank you i can't see it enough and i'll see you next time guys"

    "title": "I Made Him Eat Like Me for 30 Days (INSANE Results)",
    "published_at": "2024-11-03T13:00:25Z",
    "transcript": "recently I shred down to 11% body fat with a meal plan I thought was pretty easy to follow but then Kevin our head engineer here came up to me and asked yo think if I ate what you ate I'd get the same results which got me thinking can the same meal plan really work for two people with totally different body types and Lifestyles to find out for the next 30 days Kevin's going to follow my exact meal plan I will see just how much fat he loses and how you can use this plan is a cheat code for burd and fat are you curious to see what's under these hoods yes your breakfast for the next 30 days is what is that this was my stable breakfast oats mixed with water I pop it in the microwave and then I put it in the fridge overnight to harden and then top with Greek yogurt and some of our vanilla protein powder nice okay so I should probably mention Kevin is actually an incredible cook he's even helped us shape the flavor profile on our most popular protein powder so as I'm about to have Kevin rank my meal plan I'm honestly pretty nervous it actually kind of tastes like pudding you know like banana pudding out of 10 you want heard my feelings six six okay thankfully Kevin did seem to actually enjoy the rest of my meals including chicken rrap with veggies for lunch chicken salad with with an apple for an afternoon stack my personal favorite peanut butter pad tie for dinner and then my Greek yogurt parfait for dessert believe it or not this is more than I thought than what I would get to eat all right Kevin let get your measurements Kevin's starting weight is 229 lb and based on his current activity levels this diet should put him in a deficit of 600 calories a day hopefully resulting in 4 to 6 lbs of weight loss in 30 days but we'll also o be tracking Kevin's waist circumference as researchers found once you reduce your waistline by at least 5 cm you unlock several health and cardiovascular benefits and while 5 cm is probably too ambitious for a 30-day goal I want to set Kevin up for long-term success even after this diet is over day one of Jeremy's meal plan I'm going try one of his healthy pasas first week was like I think the hardest is your body obviously is adjusting to a whole lot of different things your calorie intake obviously probably dropping more on carbs so you feel a bit more lethargic especially during workouts so the first week workouts were like terrible this is rough squats are rough I think squats are like probably the the worst so part of Kevin's early struggles were my fault because he wasn't a fan of the first overnight oats I made him the first two batches that Jeremy made me it was like I don't know there was like a ton of stevia in there it was it tastes like a dessert Kevin was consistently choosing to skip breakfast which means not only was Kevin in a higher calorie deficit than we were intending but he was missing out on a big chunk of his daily carbs to fuel his workout and the rest of the day after about a week the carb stores in his muscles and liver will start getting depleted this eventually leads to what's known dieing as hid in the wall where energy levels drop and you experience high levels of muscle fatigue and reduced performance in the gym today is literally one week yeah I can feel it cliffing CU I Just cting Energy just had lunch honestly I'm really really tired and I'm just trying to eat some carrots to TI the over I am just so low energy right now it was now urgent I found a way to get Kevin to actually integrate breakfast Into His Mornings otherwise there's no way he's going to be able to make it through the full 30 days but this wasn't going to be easy remember when Kevin said this I think this would be more than what I would get to eat well it turns out this meal plan was way more food than Kevin's used to eating as a busy engineer once he starts coating he doesn't even think about food until he gets home time to eat I kind of just only had Fair life Shake uh for lunch and then for dinner I would kind of eat whatever so not only did I need to find a way to change Kevin's habits around eating I needed to create a breakfast he actually enjoyed so I decided to put my chef hat back on and test out some more overnight oats recipes we're going to go with the apple cinnamon flavor we're also going to use my bill salted caramel protein powder wow I give this is 10 and by using members of our bu SI team to make sure Kevin was remembered to eat every morning Kevin was quickly having his energy bounce back while continuing to lose wait the whole thing yeah the whole thing the whole thing wow the whole thing that's a lot of food that's more than you used to wow damn 222 on the dot so that's almost 7 lb in 2 weeks now at this point you're probably wondering how the heck does someone switch from eating one meal a day to now eating five meals a day with way more food yet end up losing weight well it's all about picking the rap foods that have a low calorie density and also fit your lifestyle and personal preferences and here at bill with science myself and our team of dietitians have worked years on creating a completely

the best shape of their lives without cutting out Foods they actually enjoy so if you're interested in joining today then after this video just head over to build twist size.com take our quiz to discover the best program for your body and use code Kevin at checkout for 15% off I'll also leave a link to this in the description box down below in the past couple of weeks you mentioned that you've been kind of just avoiding e yeah I no I've been avoiding going out Al together I've just played a lot more video games at home you know just you're hanging out with the cat I I don't know man it's just kind of and that's that's an area where we definitely want to improve because again like what is sustainable for you in the long run are you just going to live in a cave and not go out and sacrifice everything for it not it I'm sure you can relate to Kevin's struggle of sticking to his diet on the weekends in fact research shows that even when people stay on track during the week often times they end up overeating so much on the weekends that they gain all the way back so I understand Kevin's reservations about going out but rather than say no to all social events every single weekend I want to give Kevin a few of the secrets I use to personally enjoy going out without seeing all my progress disappear so the first thing is just like give yourself the permission to have that meal and enjoy yourself you know what I mean you definitely want to avoid going out to a socially eaten occasion and being just ravenously hungry cuz this is where it sets you up for failure so one of the things that you can do is pre-load your stomach with protein and some fruit and vegetables you're already pretty satisfied so it's going to reduce the likelihood that you actually go and try to eat everything we're just at a sushi restaurant downstairs from our flight this tastes so good and that honestly I really miss it okay this is the last order I promise right right yeah last order okay so with Kevin now having the ability to enjoy his weekends while continuing to make progress on the scale there's something else we've been neglecting that will be key to Kevin's long-term success if you look at the research comparing diet versus exercise for fat loss diet is a clear winner in fact in the past 15 days we didn't change anything to Kevin's activity level Kevin literally sits on his computer 10 hours a day every single day yet the fat was quickly melting off just from his diet changes but if we continue to neglect this it's going to come back to bite us just being more active taking more steps per day it's not as good for fat loss as most people realize it's actually not very effective but it has been shown to be extremely effective for preventing weight regain but in addition to getting Kevin moving around more there's one more piece of the puzzle to sure he doesn't regain the weight he loses see I couldn't possibly expect Kevin to stick to the exact same Meals forever even after the 30 days were up this is why strict meal plans only work in the short term until you can't stand what you're eating anymore I really really don't like chicken research suggests you get the best success when your diet is tailored to your individual preferences and luckily with Kevin skills in the kitchen he was already one step ahead of me so first thing was I looked for the cleanest proteins that was not chicken breast I like seafood a lot so I got some tuna and I got some shrimp both of which are pretty clean I think that was the best swap I did that on day two and if I didn't do that on day two I would probably be like ah screw this cuz the chicken breast tastes like sandpaper to me let's go this is the lobster bis it's just carrots tomatoes the lobster water and some Greek yogurt I've been a nasty girl nasty nasty I mean you know I'm filming right so week three and four it didn't feel like a meal plan or anything like that it doesn't feel like you know I flipped my life upside down just to do this you know I can still get my work done it's like oh you know I'll just bring my lunch to work now before I reveal the final results if you guys want to give this same meal p a shot yourself I've created a free downloadable PDF of the full meal plan as well as a list of substitutes you can use for each ingredient just like Kevin did you can download it in the link in the description box down below or just head to builtwith size.com diet plan all right it's time for the final weigh in top 26.4 holy crap so that's down 12 lb in 30 days now while usually I wouldn't recommend losing weight so quickly a lot of this is going to be water weight and also once we actually fix Kevin's diet his rate of weight loss slowed down to a consistent 2 lb per week what's even more impressive is Kevin actually lost an entire 5 cm across his waistline in just 30 days which is a great indicator that the weight he did lose was mostly fat rather than muscle and the visual results are pretty striking look closely at his face jaw and neck he's literally starting to look like a different human nice freaking go dude like realistically I don't think this is an end I think this is like you guys filmed the start I'm going to continue personally working with Kevin on this transformation but he's going to need all the support he can get so drop a go Kevin in the

    "title": "How to Grow Your Rear Delts FAST (3 Simple Techniques)",
    "published_at": "2021-12-19T17:04:54Z",
    "transcript": "today i'm going to show you how to grow your rear delts fast with three simple tips that you can apply right away let's first break down what exactly the rear delts are and why yours are probably lagging behind so as the name implies the rear delts are the rear head or back muscle of the three-headed shoulder muscle they're the key to rounding out the shoulders by adding an impressive cap to the back of them most people's rear delts however they look like this underdeveloped with the front delts being disproportionately over developed in comparison and this happens because we do a ton of pressing work that develops a front delts but very little work for the back side of our shoulders and the exercises we do choose when we decide to work them like reverse flies they just aren't very effective why is this the case and what exercises should you do instead let's figure that out with tip number one so if you're like most lifters then you probably rely on reverse flies the reverse fly machine and face pulls to grow your rear delts but while these will train the rear delts to some extent they just aren't the best options this is because during these movements your arm is held straight out to the sides which creates two problems the first problem is that this horizontal arm position lines up much better with the upper back muscle fibers like the mid traps than it does the rear delts which run more diagonally second of all the further the elbow can move behind the body the better the rear delts can be activated with a horizontal arm position your elbow can't get very far back so to maximally activate the rear delts we need to find an arm position that lines up perfectly with the rear delts and allows the elbows to travel further behind the body anatomically this is where your upper arm is perpendicular to the spine of your scapula which will be slightly different for everyone an easy way to find this position though without dissecting your insides is to use a quick test i learned from coach castle pull your elbows back as if you were doing a row and then do a chicken dance until you find the sweet spot where your elbows feel like they can travel furthest behind your body for most people this is going to be an angle of about 45 degrees away from your body and the beauty about this is that once you've found this arm position you can apply it to pretty much any pulling exercise to instantly make it more rear delts focus i will be showing you a couple of my personal favorites later on in this video but some quick examples are to apply this to one arm dumbbell rows barbell rows cable pulls and more okay so we got arm positioned down the next two tips will show you how to apply it into your routine to instantly speed up your rear delt gains now most people don't train the rear delts with enough volume nor with enough effort often leaving them as an afterthought towards the end of a workout when they're already quite fatigued to see quick improvements in your rear delt development here's my recommendation so chances are you're doing some kind of upper body workout pull day or back day in your routine during these workouts you can tweak your programming to add some more volume to your rear delt to do so whenever you do some kind of row in movement take the last one to two sets and replace them with the rear delt focus rope but if you're using a cable machine ditch the narrow v-bar attachment trying to use this to hit your rear delts will limit how much you can open up your elbows and how far back they could travel behind the body instead find a wider handle attachment like the lat pull down one and wrapping two handles on top of the bar can help make it even better and comfortable next grip the bar wide and pull your elbows back behind the body while keeping them at the roughly 45 degree angle you found earlier pause at the end of each rep briefly where you should feel a very strong contraction in your rear delts and repeat if you don't have a suitable bar using a single cable can work as well and the same can be done on many back machines by just using a wider grip and using that sweet spot arm angle and if you don't have access to cables or machines then you can always replicate the same movement using bands now while this simple tweak in your programming will help ensure that you're working your rear delts while you're fresh and training them with relatively heavy weights in addition to this you'll want to also work them with lighter weights that are focused more so on quality reps rather than weight this is where the next tip comes in what other muscles or areas do you struggle with growing comment down below and i'm going to look for the most liked comments to see what area i should cover next so part of the reason your rear delts may not be growing very well is because of sub optimal exercise selection but it's also because other muscles are taking over as a result of you using too much weight when you train them to avoid this we're now going to use a more isolation type of rear delts exercise and focus on quality reps the exercise i'm about to show you i call the better reverse fly and by the way it's just one of several great shoulder exercises that i'll be including in an upcoming shoulder video that i'm working on to perform this exercise set up a bench to a 30 degree incline grab a pair of dumbbells and lay your chest on the bench then pull your elbows back as far as you can while keeping them in that roughly 45 degree angle that you found earlier if however you're unable to pull your elbow back behind the body very far you can't maintain that roughly 45 degree arm angle or you're forced to use momentum then these are all signs that the weight is just too heavy if so lighten the weight and focus on quality form and really feeling that mind to muscle connection with your rear delts every single rep then once you have this down to progress this exercise over time you want to avoid increasing the weight too quickly we can prevent this by choosing a light enough weight that allows you to do about 15 reps each set with good form then as you get stronger focus on increasing your reps up to about 25 reps only once you reach that should you then move up to the next heaviest weight and repeat the process implement these three tips into your routine and you'll not only feel the difference but you'll see the growth very quickly but chances are you're making similar mistakes with other muscle groups as well to prevent this from holding

    "published_at": "2023-03-19T13:00:22Z",
    "transcript": "forward head rounded shoulders and a Donald Duck Butt look familiar honestly you don't realize how bad your posture has become until someone stabs a pic of you don't worry use my new and approved five minute posture routine and I guarantee you'll fix this in no time let's talk about how you got here in the first place so studies revealed that most people sit on average for at least six to eight hours a day and when they do they're sitting like this but don't feel the need to straighten up just because I said that this slouching position isn't necessarily bad some studies suggest it might even help you focus more in fact I'm slouching right now as I write the script for this video the problem is most people stay locked in this hunched over posture for hours on end every single day and your body is an adaptation machine over time it'll tighten up certain muscles and weaken others in order to become more efficient at keeping this hunched over posture there's five simple yet extreme the effective exercises we'll use to reverse this starting with the upper body the first exercise will help open up your tight chest and shoulder muscles I'll show you how to make this work with a towel blanket or broomstick but I'd highly suggest you use a band and I'll leave a link in the description box to the one I'm using start with your hands inside the band with your palms facing away from the sides of your thighs but if you're using a towel or broomstick grab it with a very wide overhand grip in front of your thighs keep your arms straight and move your arms in the circle up and behind your body let your shoulder blades and traps shrug up slightly on the way up and then let your shoulder blades come down and back as your arms travel behind your body the benefit of using the band is you can widen it by pulling it apart during the spots where your tight is but if you're really tight your body will try to cheat by arching the lower back prevent this by keeping your core engaged you may also notice some clicking in your shoulder or that you can't keep one of your arms fully straight that's completely normal and it will improve over time but once your initial grip gets too easy you can deepen the stretch by looping the band around your palms to shorten it or take a narrower grip if you're using a stick or towel as for how many sets and Reps to do at the end of this video I'll show you the full routine written out for now just focus on the form for each exercise next before we get to strengthening your weakened upper body muscles we need to unlock your tight mid and upper back start on all fours with your hands under your shoulders and knees under your hips to make the stretch more effective place a foam roller ball or folded up pillow between your legs and squeeze it together engage your core to straighten your back and push the four away to straighten your arms then take a big exhale as you reach your left arm under and across your body as far as you can you can allow your right arm to bend slightly as you do this you should feel a deep stretch in your mid and upper back and maybe even your lats from here bring your left hand back behind your neck push the floor away with your right hand and follow your elbow with your eyes as you rotate it up towards the ceiling only as far as you can you should feel some of your mid and upper back muscles working as you do this hold the top briefly then come back down and try to reach a bit further than last time once you do both sides you may notice that one feels a lot tighter than the other that's perfectly normal just do this consistently and it'll help correct that imbalance over time not so the first two exercises will temporarily open up your tight upper body muscles but to keep those results and fix your posture for good you need to pair that with a strengthening exercise the one we're using today strengthens your weakened back and shoulder muscles to help pull you upward lay on your stomach with your forehead on the floor or held just above it and hands behind your head pull your elbows back imagine squeezing your shoulder blades together once you've gone as far as you can extend your arms straight out to make a capital y shape with your palms facing the floor keep your arms straight and held as high as you can above the floor and begin to slowly move them in a big circle around your body you should feel your mid back and shoulder muscles working as you do this as your arms come below a t-shape start to internally rotate your arms so that your palms now face the ceiling once your hands are close to your legs bend your elbows and place the back of your hands on your low Back Lean one hand on top of the other then reverse the circle by extending your arms and slowly move them back into the y shape and then to the started position with your hands on the back of your head I'll be honest this is quite a difficult exercise so if you're having troubles with it for now try this just keep your arms in that t-shape with your thumbs facing up and use your mid back muscles to raise your arms as high as possible hold that top position for a few seconds while squeezing your shoulder blades together and do both 5 to 10 reps of this until you build the strength to do the full exercise okay so before we move on to the lower body it's important you don't just do this five minute routine and go right back to sitting in your chair for the rest of the day this routine will work wonders if you do it consistently but to fix your posture for good and honestly just feel better day to day you need to make an effort to move more break up your sitting with standing go for more walks or check out some of my workout videos to get you in the gym in fact Studies have shown lifting weights can improve flexibility just as much as stretching does a precise-based program that shows you exactly how to work out week after week to transform your body while improving your posture mobility and overall health after this video go to build with science.com and take my analysis quiz to find the best program for you and your body but for now it's time to move on to your lower body so the main lower body muscle you need to strengthen is the glutes these often become weak in those who sit for most of the day but before we get to that it's important to first loosen up your hip flexors some research suggests that if this muscle is tight it can inhibit glutes activation start on all fours and set your right knee close to a wall or an elevated piece of furniture like a bench couch or chair use your hands to help put your back foot up on the wall or bench the closer your knee is to the wall or bench the more stretch you'll create in your quads so if you're pretty tight then just start out with your knee further away once you've set your back foot step your other foot forward so your shin is vertical and straighten your hips in front of you the then use your hands to help you get into the half kneeling position from here breathe your core and level your hips as if it was a bowl of water and you were preventing the water from spilling forward at this point you should already feel a deep stretch in the quads and hip flexor of the back leg the intensity of this stretch should ideally feel like a four or five out of ten so the lessen the stretch Lean Forward whereas to deepen it push your butt back towards your back foot just make sure that you don't arch your lower back as you do so now you're ready to strengthen the glutes the exercise we'll use is simple but to maximize activation it's important you do it right lay on your back with your knees bent and feet flat on the floor angle your elbows away from you and push them down into the ground engage your core to flatten your lower back against the floor without arching your back squeeze your butt muscles hard and then lift your hips up while keeping your glutes contracted at the top avoid arching your lower back instead keep your core engaged and tilt your hips back by squeezing the glutes hard as if you had a hundred dollar bill between them and you were trying to prevent it from falling out hold this for five seconds before coming down for another rep now if you feel this more in your quads rather than your glutes try walking your feet out further away from you whereas if you feel this more in your hamstrings move your feet a bit closer in and over time to make this move more difficult and to help correct any strength imbalances you might have in your glutes you can progress to working one leg at a time here is the full five minute routine you can also download this routine onto your phone completely free over at buildtooth science.com posture fix try to do this routine at least twice a day and again just make an effort to move more good luck and give this video watch next for what I believe is the most underrated exercise to lose belly fat that you can literally start doing right now"

    "title": "How To Squat Properly: 3 Mistakes Harming Your Lower Back (FIX THESE!)",
    "published_at": "2020-02-16T17:32:09Z",
    "transcript": "when it comes to lower body strength and size there's no doubt that squats are kinked but at the same time the squat is one of the more quote unquote risky exercises in the gym in fact research and train lifters often finds that squats are the most commonly cited injury causing exercise performed in the gym more specifically though it seems that of these squatting injuries the lower back tends to come up as the most frequent site of injury which is simply because the spine is biomechanically the most vulnerable of the joints when squatting now this doesn't mean that the squat is a dangerous exercise that you should avoid because it's not and it's actually a great strengthening movement for your lower body but this does mean that you need to take careful consideration to how you execute the squat as there's a few common mistakes that people make with it that can contribute to lower back pain and injury over time and in this video i'll go through exactly what those mistakes are and how to fix them so you can avoid injury and build up a stronger pain-free squat the first mistake you're making has to do with something called butt wink which is a term used to describe when someone gets close to the bottom of their squat and their pelvis starts to posteriorly tilt and their tailbone tucks under them creating a little bit of rounding or flexion in the lumbar spine and although there is some controversy behind this research does seem to indicate that this subtle rounding of the lumbar spine is associated with spinal disc injuries and can become problematic over time especially when it's done repeatedly with heavy loads as we do in the weighted squat so instead we ideally want the pelvis to remain as neutral as possible as opposed to rounded at the bottom position of the squat now although some individuals just can't change the amount of butt weight they experience due to anatomy issues where the femur actually only has so much available range of motion and means that deep squats just wouldn't be best for them most individuals instead experience this but wink due to mobility issues with the most common issue being a lack of sufficient ankle mobility in fact in two recent papers that analyze the effect of ankle mobility on the squat they both found that when the ankle mobility in subjects was put in a restricted condition to simulate poor ankle mobility there was an increase in lower back stress as well as a greater amount of lumbar flexion or butt wink scene when compared to subjects who were unrestricted in their ankle mobility during the squat and we can clearly see why this happens here with skeletor because when you have adequate ankle mobility your knee is able to travel forward more as you descend and you can reach proper depth without your lower back and pelvis having to compensate but on the other hand if your ankle mobility is restricted your knee can't travel forward as much so in this case if you wanted to reach proper depth in the squat you just wouldn't be able to because your body would fall backwards since your center of gravity has shifted back so to compensate to prevent this from happening what the body does is it's gonna round the back of the pelvis so that you can achieve proper depth without tipping backwards which is why having tight ankles is often the culprit to this butt wing problem i mean i personally have very tight ankles and for example when i do a barefoot squat without warming up you can clearly see beltwink occurring but if i then raise my heels up on some plates as i squat the butt wing completely disappears because the lift helps with my ankle mobility so what i suggest is that you film yourself and try out this little experiment to see if this is indeed the case for you as well and if it is then what you want to do is simply start incorporating ankle mobility stretches daily and before you squat as that's been shown to significantly improve ankle mobility restrictions so exercises like various weighted ankle stretches wall ankle stretches and just holding the deep squat are all great daily movements that you should be doing to quickly improve your ankle mobility in addition to this though some quick fixes are the one use a wider stance as this is going to enable you to squat deeper with less ankle mobility since the knees don't have to travel forward as much and 2 invest in lifting shoes as these provide a heel lift which helps with your ankle mobility and i'll leave a link down below to the ones that i use and recommend but regardless until you improve that excessive butt wink in your squat it would be best to either limit your death during heavy squats to parallel or however deep you can go without that excessive rounding to avoid any potential issues from arising over time the next crucial mistake you're making with your squat is very subtle to catch yet is a big problem when it comes to lower back stress and pain so ideally when you rise out of the bottom of the squat your chest and your hips should rise at approximately the same rate in one fluid motion which enables the bar to travel straight up and down as you squat but what some people do instead is something termed as a good morning squat which is when the hips shoot up first and rise at a much faster rate than the chest does which causes the bar to now shift forward and the upper body to lean forward excessively out of the bottom position and this is problematic because we know that greater forward lean and forward bar movement during the squat increases the lumbar forces and shear stress experience at the spine so instead to minimize these dangerous forces on the lower back as you squat you need to focus on keeping that chest upright during the ascent and ensuring that your hips aren't shooting back behind you especially as you fatigue later on during your sets and if you struggle with this this likely has to do with both your motor coordination and potentially a weakness in your quadriceps because if your quadriceps are weak at the bottom position your body will compensate by relying more on your relatively stronger glutes and lower back to now carry the load and which is why we see the hip shoot back and in fact multiple research papers like this one from the spine journal are in support of this and found that when subjects pre-fatigued their quadriceps so that they'd be relatively weaker before performing a squat they tended to now lift with the stooping squat pattern discussed earlier to decrease the demand placed on their quadriceps now to correct this the best course of action would be to lighten the weight and start incorporating pause squats instead where you'll want to briefly pause at the bottom position of the squat come up to about halfway up pause again and then come back to the top and during each rep you need to ensure that your hips and your chest are rising at the same rate it's also useful to use various cues to help you with this such as thinking about driving your chest up as you come out of the bottom position of the squat but performing pause squats in this banner will help force your quads to remain involved during the most difficult parts of the squat and will help you nail down that much needed coordination and then as you get better and stronger with this you can start transitioning back to the normal squats and overloading them as long as you can maintain that new proper form now the last mistake has to do with how you actually breathe during your squat which is something that most people overlook so i'm sure many of you have been advised to breathe in on the way down and breathe out on the way up for exercises although this is fine to do for most exercises and sets that are less strenuous when it comes to your more fatiguing and heavy sets of barbell squats doing this is going to result in a ton of instability as you lift so instead you need to use a breathing technique that increases something called your intra-abdominal pressure within your abdomen as you squat which has been shown in multiple papers to stabilize and protect your lower back when squatting by significantly reducing the spinal compression and lumbar load that experiences and to do so you want to think about it as if you were going under water every time you squat so to start take a big breath into your abdomen and then brace your core as if someone were about to punch your stomach then you keep bracing and hold this breath as you go underwater going down in the back up during your rep and then exhale and reset at the top position as you come out of the water it does take some practicing to get used to but is essential that you do as it will lead to a stronger more stable squat and better ensure that your lower back is protected as you start working with heavier weights so to sum the video up here is the exact action plan you want to take with your squats i would highly recommend that you actually take the time to film yourself from the side or just get someone to film for you just to see if you're making any of these mistakes but by being aware of these key points as you're squatting and implementing the necessary fixes for them you'll be able to both alleviate any lower back pain you may be experiencing when squatting and better protect your lower back from injury in the long run and if you're looking for a science-based plan that optimizes your exercises and all the various aspects of your program for you in an easy to follow manner such that you can quickly build strength and size as effectively and as safely as possible with science and simply head on over to buildwithscience.com to take the analysis quiz to discover which

    "title": "The Best Science-Based Post Workout Meal To Build Muscle (EAT THIS!)",
    "published_at": "2019-05-26T15:05:41Z",
    "transcript": "[Music] [Music] i remember when i first started lifting i was always told that the post-workout meal was crucial if i didn't have one shortly after my workout i'd feel as if my gains would slowly wither away and that the workout was basically a write-off fortunately over the years i was able to realize that post-workout nutrition isn't as crucial as i made it out to be but it still does have its merits since by consuming the right foods in the right amounts after your workouts you'll be able to better improve your performance and recovery and build muscle that much faster to start though let's first cover what exactly a post-workout meal is and what it aims to accomplish so a post-workout meal is simply the meal you have shortly after a resistance training workout or even an intense cardio session but for example a stroll in the park or any very low intensity activity wouldn't require a post-workout meal and this meal seeks to accomplish two major goals one to replenish glycogen stores that have been depleted during your workout this helps keep you energized for the rest of the day provides your muscle with fuel for your next workouts and can also help prevent muscle breakdown and two to increase protein synthesis while decreasing protein breakdown which is just a rebuilding process of repairing any damage caused by your workout and putting your body in an anabolic state to now build muscle so how can we design our post-workout meal to best accomplish these two goals well in this video that's exactly what i'll cover by going through what research has deemed as the optimal post-workout meal along with various easy to make meal examples that you can implement right away let's start with protein protein is going to be the most important macronutrient that you'll want to include in your post-workout meal since it will be responsible for kick-starting muscle protein synthesis and the recovery and growth process for your muscles as for the best types of protein to include in your post-workout meal you'll want to ideally stick with fast digesting protein sources since research has indicated that they promote post-exercise anabolism to a greater degree and does so much faster than slower digesting protein sources therefore your best option here would simply be whey or plant protein powders but lean meats and egg whites are definitely viable options as well and as for the ideal amount of protein to have a 2016 paper by mcnaughton and colleagues found that 20 grams of a high quality protein such as whey is able to elicit a near maximal protein synthesis response following a workout however they also found that doubling the amount to 40 grams was able to significantly boost protein synthesis by 20 what i'd recommend though is simply aim to get at least 20 grams in your post-workout meal and aim for 40 grams if you're on the heavier side or if you would just like to ensure that you're stimulating maximum protein synthesis or if this is going to be your last meal before bed since this will better improve protein synthesis overnight just know that the difference in muscle growth this will make in the long run though is likely negligible given that your daily protein intake is sufficient now as for carbs as mentioned earlier they'll mainly serve to replenish any muscle glycogen that's been depleted from your workout in order to improve your performance and energy levels for your next workout and they seem to best accomplish this when consumed within the post-workout window in fact a study from the international journal of sports medicine found that there's a super compensation of glycogen stores when carbohydrates are consumed shortly post-exercise and delaying their consumption by just two hours reduces the rate of muscle glycogen re-synthesis by as much as 50 percent but this is likely only really useful if you were to train again in the same day since research has also shown that so long as you eat enough carbs and the rest of your meals your body will eventually fill its glycogen stores back up regardless of whether you have them post-workout or not however despite this i would still advise including carbs in your post-workout meal since as shown in a 2007 paper from the journal of the international society of sports nutrition ingesting carbohydrates with protein following exercise increases growth hormone levels to a greater extent than when compared to ingesting protein alone which the researchers stated leads to a more favorable anabolic environment for recovery therefore including carbs as part of your post-workout meal is likely optimal and as for the best types of carbs to include research such as this paper from the journal of applied physiology indicates that high glycemic index carbs result in the most rapid increase in muscle glycogen following intense exercise and are thus ideal options some examples include white potatoes or sweet potatoes rice cakes white rice and so on and fruits are actually a good option to include as well since research indicates that they seem to enhance digestion and fluid delivery when combined with glucose from carb sources that aren't fruit just make sure that you're not only consuming fruit since they replenish liver glycogen rather than the much needed muscle glycogen for your workouts however what's even more important than the type of carbohydrate you ingest is the amount you ingest within your post-workout meal a good idea is to get roughly 20 to 30 percent of your total daily carb intake within that meal or at least 25 to 30 grams of carbohydrates in order to best replenish your glycogen levels and support an anabolic environment for growth and lastly as for fats research is relatively unclear as to their benefits and drawbacks regarding post-workout nutrition we do know that adding fats to a post-workout meal does not further boost protein synthesis but certain types may actually delay the digestion of carbohydrates which does indicate that minimizing fat post-workout may be ideal to replenish glycogen and promote anabolism the fastest while keeping the risk of gi distress low but in my honest opinion i'd say just do what you want with fats post-workout because the difference between including them or not is likely insignificant now as for the timing of your post-workout meal this is something i'll have to cover more in depth in a future video but for now just know that if you've had a pre-workout meal with adequate protein and carbs at least a few hours before your workout then the timing of your post-workout meal now becomes less important and can be within even two to three hours after your workout however if you have not had a pre-workout meal within that time frame or you're simply working out fasted then in this case you'll want to ingest your post-workout meal as soon as possible following your workout so now that we know exactly what a post-workout meal should consist of let's take a look at a few quick to make yet effective meal ideas that implements exactly what i've covered [Music] [Music] now just keep in mind that post-workout nutrition is just one of many aspects that you want to get right in order to build muscle most effectively you simply aren't going to see the results that you're after if you're not optimizing all aspects of your training and your nutrition as well this is exactly why within my build with science programs i not only cover training but i also show you exactly what when and how much to eat based on your goal and your current body stats such that you can build muscle and lose fat in the fastest manner possible and to get started today you can simply head on over to builtwithscience.com and take the body type analysis quiz which is just gonna determine what program and what approach is best for you anyways as always if you haven't already i'd really appreciate a follow on instagram i post a lot of the daily meals that i

    "title": "Fix &quot;Anterior Pelvic Tilt&quot; in 10 Minutes/Day (Daily Exercise Routine)",
    "published_at": "2018-02-18T14:03:01Z",
    "transcript": "what's up guys it's Jeremy here back with a highly requested video to add to my posture series in this video we're gonna talk about anterior pelvic tilt also known as lower cross syndrome I'm gonna show you guys what exactly anterior pelvic tilt is and what causes it but more importantly I'll show you guys a four-step solution as well as provide you with a corrective routine at the end that you guys can implement and get started with right away I'll also provide you guys with a free pdf routine that you guys can download and I'll leave a link to it in the description box down below and I'll talk more about this at the end of the video so for now enjoy the video guys those were unaware anterior pelvic tilt is a postural pattern characterized by a forward tipped pelvis that causes the hips to get pushed out back in the abdomen to stick out forward which creates a slight curve in the lower back now the root cause of this can be from a variety of factors but as nowadays most commonly due to extended periods of sitting while in this posture but it's important to note that a slight anterior pelvic tilt is perfectly normal research tends to show that about 85% of healthy males and 75% of healthy females exhibit a slight anterior pelvic tilt but with that being said problems can start to arise and those who have a more prominent anterior pelvic tilt and lift weights because as soon as you start performing loaded movements like the squat and the deadlift with an anterior pelvic tilt it creates a lot more stress on your lower back and inhibits your force production in the long run this commonly results in lower back tightness and pain and prevents you from lifting heavier weights or properly activating the glutes therefore if this is a case for you then it's definitely something that you want to look into correcting but before we dive into the corrective routine it's important to know the reasoning behind it research has indicated that anterior pelvic tilt is often the result of some muscles that have gradually become under active and other muscles that have become overactive typically it's the abdominals and the glutes that have become weakened and it's a hip flexors and the erector spinae that become overactive so to solve this you want to focus on stretching the overactive muscles primarily the hip flexors while strengthening the weakened muscles which are the abdominals and the glutes but the routine alper value and other routines you may have seen line will be of little help if you don't first learn how to properly maneuver your pelvis which leads me into step one of the video since you've been stuck in anterior pelvic tilt you need to first learn how to properly posteriorly tilt your pelvis otherwise your body will just cheat when performing corrective stretches and exercises one easy way to learn this is by practicing pelvic tilts on the ground simply lie on your back with your knees up you'll probably notice that there's a space between your lower back and the ground what you want to do is flatten your lower back into the ground by tilting your pelvis this action is called posterior pelvic tilt and when you go back to the position where there's a gap between your lower back in the floor this is when you're in anterior pelvic tilt so go back and forth between the two positions for around ten reps to get comfortable with tilting your pelvis next you want to progress to doing the exact same thing but standing simply contract your abdominals and squeeze your gluts to come into posterior pelvic tilt and again go back and forth between these two positions for around ten reps now that you've hopefully learned how to posture really tilt your pelvis we want to carry that over into strengthening exercises for both your underactive glutes and abdominals the first exercise is the hip thrust and will mainly target your glutes but the key is to do them properly basically all you're doing is driving your hips towards the ceiling you want your shoulder blades to stay on the bench and your feet place so that your shins are vertical when you're in the top position but your body will probably try to compensate by arching your lower back as you perform the movement which takes the glutes out of the equation you can tell if you're doing it wrong if your lower back is arched and your belly button is the closest thing to the ceiling at the top position so instead you want to use what you learned in step 1 by posteriorly tilting your pelvis throughout the whole movement this means that at the top position you should be able to draw a straight line from your head to your knees and you should be squeezing the glutes and feeling them contract you can also try glute bridges instead where your back is on the floor and you apply the same protocol that I mentioned and over time you'll want to start adding weight to these movements for better glute development next we're gonna strengthen the abdominals although there are several ab exercises out there for those with anterior pelvic tilts you need to focus on ab exercises that minimize involvement of the hip flexors since they're overactive one great exercise to accomplish this is something called rkc planks which look like a standard plank but EMG analysis by Brett Contreras show they exhibit much greater abdominal and glute activation than the standard plank which is especially beneficial for those with anterior pelvic tilt basically you're going to set up how you would in a standard plank but with your hands interlocked and your feet slightly wider than normal activate your abdominals by thinking about drawing your belly button towards your spine and then again using what we learned in step 1 you want to posteriorly tilt your pelvis by squeezing your glutes and keeping them contracted throughout the movement hold this position for as long as possible without letting your lower back arch next we're going to stretch your overactive hip flexors which has been shown in multiple studies to help reduce the degree of anterior pelvic tilt over time the first one is called the lunge stretch for the psoas muscle which is a stretch most people know of yet don't perform correctly the goal is to feel a deep stretch in the front of your back leg sort of performing simply get into a lunge position with both knees at 90 degrees next you want to contract your abdominals by drawing your belly button towards your spine and move your hips into posterior pelvic tilt for a lot of you if done properly this position will already provide a sufficient stretch but if you want an even deeper stretch simply lean forward while maintaining your posterior pelvic tilt as you shift forward you can also rotate your upper body to the opposite side for more of a stretch hold each side for around 10 deep breaths the second stretch is going to specifically target the rectus femoris which is another hip flexor muscle and is often the tighter muscle in those with anterior pelvic tilt simply place your back foot up on a bench or couch with your other foot planted forward again you'll want to contract your abdominals and move your hips into posterior pelvic tilt you should feel a deep stretch down the front of your thigh you can move forward slightly for less of a stretch or move closer to the bench for more of a stretch this can also be done without the use of a bench by holding on to something for balance and then pulling your back leg up towards your butt hold each side for around 10 deep breaths so to sum the video up here is a corrective routine utilizing all of the exercises I previously discussed and as I mentioned earlier I've compiled this information into a free pdf routine including all the exercises as well as visuals and extra tips to make sure you're doing it correctly to get a copy of this simply click the link I put in the description and I'll send it over to your email and keep in mind that when it comes to correcting anterior pelvic tilt frequency is the most important factor that will determine your success in correcting it all of these exercises can be done at home so try your best to do these daily and you'll quickly start to notice significant improvements that's pretty much it for the video guys thank you so much for watching I hope you enjoyed it and found it useful another thing I want to mention though is that you should always be aware of your posture is during your day-to-day life and also in your training you want to try your best to use what you learn today in order to maintain a neutral pelvis when sitting or standing for long periods throughout the day so just constantly be aware of it and it'll make a big difference in the long run anyways if you guys like this video then please give it a like leave a comment and don't forget to subscribe to my channel if you haven't already thank you guys so much for all your support I really do appreciate it I'll see you guys next time [Music] you you"

    "title": "How To Get WIDER/THICKER Looking Biceps (Full Biceps Workout)",
    "published_at": "2018-12-23T16:39:34Z",
    "transcript": "when it comes to building the biceps I think it's fair to say that most of us don't just want a well-developed biceps peak more importantly we want biceps that are full and thick looking such that they not only look good from the side or when flex but also look well-developed from the front view or in a t-shirt for example and if you seeking to improve this then what you're aiming to do is actually increase the width of your biceps but is this even possible in the first place well although it's true that genetics will play some role in this and have bigger biceps in general often results in wider biceps as well there are a few key things you can do to further improve the width of your biceps and to learn what these things are we need to first take a look at the anatomy of the biceps the biceps as the name suggests is a two-headed muscle consisting of a short head in a long head the short head is located more on the inside and the long head is located more on the outside and this shot of the biceps anatomy alone should already make you realize that you definitely can improve the width of the biceps you can do so by emphasizing the biceps head that is currently less developed on you for example the short head of my biceps has always been far more developed in my long head and it wasn't until I started prioritizing the long head that I started to see a considerable and improvement in the overall width of my biceps since the outer head was now larger in fact I recently ran a poll on my instagram asking which head people thought was less developed on them from the front view with 58% answering the long head and 42% answer in the short head so it's clear that the long head does tend to be less developed with others as well but there is still quite a bit of variation therefore in this video I'll show you exactly what to do in either case before we dive into the workout there is one even more important muscle you should be prioritizing for width and it's called the brachialis which actually lies underneath the long head of the biceps and this muscle is not only responsible for some of the mass of the outer arm but it also anatomically pushes up the biceps which all creates the illusion of a wider appear in our so with that being said let's take a look at it work out you can do to improve your biceps with my first prioritizing the brachialis and then working on your less developed biceps head unlike the biceps the brachialis muscle only has one purpose and that is to flex the arm therefore in order to target it and is recommended in this EMG analysis by NATO and colleagues you want to flex your arm with a pronated or neutral grip when curling which will shift some of the work away from the biceps and all into the brachialis and one great exercise that implements this is dumbbell hammer curls where you perform a curl with a neutral grip however taking this even one step further we can implement the findings of this paper from the American College of Sports Medicine which found that by slowing down the eccentric portion of the movement you're actually able to further decrease the involvement of the biceps and increase that of the brachialis which the researchers speculate is due to the structural and fiber type differences between the brachialis and the biceps therefore when you perform your hammer curls you can apply the protocol they use by simply implementing a five-second eccentric during the way down of each rep which will just enable you to isolate the brachialis that much more next if your long head is lagging behind then what you want to do is start implementing exercises that preferentially target this head and it's stated in my other biceps videos any biceps exercise where the upper arm is held behind the body such as here with the incline dumbbell curl will favor the long head since it crosses over the shoulder joint whereas the short head does not so this exercise is a great way to emphasize the long head but as shown in this 2009 paper from the Journal of sports science and medicine during the incline dumbbell curl the biceps are most active in the final 1/3 of the movement when the arm is fully flexed since there is less resistance during the beginning portion of the movement due to the position of the arm relative to gravity therefore by pairing this exercise with the behind the body cable curl which has a more complete resistance curve due to the constant tension from the cable you're able to maximize the growth of the long now in terms of emphasizing the short head we simply reverse what we did for the long head given that the short head does not cross the shoulder joint this now means that any biceps exercise where the arms are held in front of the body will preferentially target the short head more while lesson in that of the long head for example concentration curls where the arm is placed in front of the body as shown here is a great exercise that accomplishes this but in addition of particular importance for the short head we know based on GMG analysis that activation of the short head is maximized with combined flexion and supination so to further preferentially hit the short head you want to ensure that you're actively supinating your wrist like soldier in each rep which you can do by simply thinking about twisting your pinkies towards the ceiling as you curl another similar movement you can incorporate is spider curls where you lay on an incline bench and let your arms hang in front of your body again focus on locking the elbows in place and supinating your wrist as you curl in order to best hit the short head now as for how to combine this all into a biceps width workout that you can get started with right away I'd suggest the following if your long head is lagging which seems to be the case for most people then stick with this routine whereas if your short head is lagging stick with this routine you can either perform this as a workout on its own or simply replace your current biceps isolation exercises with these instead either way by implementing this into your routine you'll be able to successfully add the much-needed width and thickness to your biceps that you're after that's pretty much it for the video guys I hope at the very least I was able to give you some insight as to how to improve your current biceps routine and if you're looking for a step-by-step program that uses both scientific research and our knowledge of the human anatomy to transform your body as efficiently as possible the way you can do is simply head on over to built with science comm and take my starting point quiz I have up in order to discover which program and which approach is best for you honestly

    "title": "The Best Science-Based Upper Body Workout for Growth (Chest/Back/Arms/Shoulders)",
    "published_at": "2018-03-18T13:47:37Z",
    "transcript": "[Music] when it comes to choosing a workout split that optimizes muscle growth there's a lot of factors that need to be considered but due to the optimal training frequency and realistic time commitment of an upper lower split it makes it a very effective choice for many lifters and can be easily adjusted based on your training experience so in this video i'll show you exactly how to organize and choose exercises for your upper body workouts based on current scientific literature and or anatomical understanding of the upper body muscles but first off for those who are unaware an upper lower split simply involves splitting up your workouts into upper body days and lower body days often two of each being performed every week ideally you'd want to organize the split like so and although the exact days for each workout isn't important it's best to include a rest day after two consecutive days of training to allow sufficient recovery now as for the best exercises to include in your upper body workouts a good way to set it up is by sticking to the following guideline choosing your exercises in this fashion ensures that your upper body muscles are worked in a balanced manner which helps prevent muscle imbalances from developing and helps target all of the upper body musculature so with that being said let's take a look at what the optimal upper body workout might look like through the added shoulder flexion of this movement incline dumbbell presses will put more emphasis on the clavicular head of the pecs also known as the upper chest which is more often than not a weak point for most people one emg analysis by brett contreras found that out of 15 different chest exercises incline dumbbell presses were found to be the most effective compound movement for upper chest activation therefore by starting with this exercise you're able to effectively prioritize the upper chest and since utilizing dumbbells as opposed to a barbell more effectively prevents muscle imbalances from occurring and allows a greater range of motion it makes incline dumbbell presses the ideal option for the horizontal push exercise of this workout now as for the best incline setting research tends to show that the optimal bench angle is somewhere between 30 to 56 degrees for most people i've personally found the best activation with a 30 degree incline but experiment with it and see what best activates your chest next you want to move on to a horizontal rowing movement my personal favorite is a chest supported row which will effectively target pretty much all of the upper back musculature one study by laymen and colleagues found that rowing movements provide similar levels of lat activation as lat pulldowns but more activation in other areas of the back like the traps and rhomboids therefore it's essential to include at least one rowing exercise in your routine to help with both back width and thickness but with that being said i personally suggest using some form of a chest supported row in this workout because it helps minimize the involvement of the lower back which as you'll see will be heavily involved in the next exercise and as i'll make note of later on in this video exercises like the barbell row do have their place for back development but given that research shows that they elicit high lower back involvement relative to other back exercises their inclusion in a workout needs to be carefully thought out next you want to move on to a vertical pressing movement the overhead press is an ideal choice due to the ability to easily overload it with weight and targets several muscles at once it mainly targets the anterior deltoid with some involvement of the lateral and posterior heads as well as heavily stresses the core the triceps and the serratus anterior muscle to help push and stabilize the weight overhead and as explained in my shoulder video since this exercise has been shown in studies like this one by baron and buskies to be the best exercise for the anterior deltoid and was even shown to outperform dumbbell front raises by 41 i'd argue it's the only exercise you need to include in your regimen that emphasizes the front delt [Music] finally you want to move on to a vertical pulling movement for those who are capable i'd suggest adding in pull-ups given that they pretty much work all of your back musculature and also heavily involve your shoulder and scapular stabilizers one study by ness and colleagues found that pull-ups elicit similar lat activation as lat pull-downs but more biceps involvement in addition one study from the journal of strength and conditioning research showed that subjects were able to pull 25 percent greater total weight with pull-ups as compared to lat pull-downs therefore one could make a case for the superiority of pull-ups to lat pull-downs but given that pull-ups are generally a lot more fatiguing lat pull-downs might be the better option here given that the previous exercises are quite energy demanding so it's really up to you which you prefer but again including both in your weekly routine is definitely the best option [Music] next you want to move on to some accessory movements for the biceps my go-to choice would be the incline dumbbell curl since it preferentially emphasizes the long hair of the biceps which often doesn't get as much attention and as shown in this study from the journal of sports science and medicine it enables the biceps to be active throughout the whole range of motion rather than just the beginning or just the end which is the case for many bicep exercises making it in my opinion one of the best choices for biceps development especially for the long head and then on your other upper body day you could simply choose a biceps exercise that emphasizes the short head of the biceps more for balanced development of both heads over time [Music] similar to the biceps due to the flex position of the shoulder this exercise is going to emphasize the long head of the triceps which doesn't get much attention otherwise dumbbell extensions on an incline bench is something that i recommend as it helps prevent muscle imbalances from occurring and minimizes the momentum use and by using an incline bench it helps put the shoulder into an even more flexed position to further target the long head but just also be aware that any triceps exercise that puts your shoulder in an extended position will effectively target the long head and there's many exercises that do this so just play around with them and see which one you like best so to sum the video up if you're a more intermediate or advanced lifter here's what your upper body day 1 routine could look like you could also add face pulls or chest flies as an additional exercise if you feel that your rear delts or chest needs more work on the other hand if you're a beginner and just starting out in the gym then this routine will likely be excessive in volume for you research has shown that for beginners isolation exercises don't provide more muscle growth when compound movements are already used therefore rather than performing the two or three extra isolation movements i'd simply stick to the four main compound exercises like so and as for your second upper body workout during the week you want to stick to the same general outline i showed earlier in this video but switch up the exercises for example these exercises are a good option for your next upper body workout during the week as they complement the ones i mentioned in this video and as i've done with some of my other videos i've compiled all of this information into an easy to follow free pdf so that you guys can have it with you when you're at the gym it shows you the full workout exercise tips with visuals and a progression scheme for each exercise to help ensure you're progressing over time to get a copy of this sent to your email just simply follow the link i've put in the description box down below and i've also pinned a comment down below that provides the link as well that's pretty much it for the video guys thank you so much for watching make sure to get your copy of the pdf routine that i mentioned by following this link i think you guys will really find it useful and let me know in the comments down below if you'd like me to do a video on the lower body days for this workout routine or just any other topics that you'd like to see in the future and if you guys could do me a huge favor by giving me a follow on instagram where i provide a lot more informative content on a regular basis i would really appreciate it and as always if you enjoyed this video please don't forget to give it a like leave a comment

    "title": "How to Get V-Cut Abs (Adonis Belt): The 3 BEST Exercises",
    "published_at": "2017-06-25T17:43:49Z",
    "transcript": "Udonis belt also known as the V lions are the two grooves on the abdomen to run down towards the pubis and it's the key to completing an attractive physique but unfortunately if you're not born with decent genetics and you may find that your Adonis belt isn't very visible at the moment take a look at these two individuals for example they're around the same level of body fat yet you can see the jurassic differences in their p lines the one on the left doesn't have a very prominent Damas belt the one on the right however has a very defined and well-formed adonis belt but i guarantee you that the one on the right doesn't do specific training to make his adonis belt more visible and he likely had it before he even started working out this is how powerful genetics can be in determining certain features of your physique but even if you haven't been blessed with a gradation at exterior Donna's belt it doesn't mean that you can't build the muscles around it to make it more visible as this is something that I've done myself you should also keep in mind that your first priority should be getting down to a low enough level of body fat in order to see your videos in the first place below 12% is ideal although with good genetics some people may see it at a higher body fat percentage it looks much more aesthetic and appealing at a lower level of body fat now let's first get started with understanding what exactly the adonis belt is and the concept behind training it technically everyone has that v-line since was created by something called the inguinal ligament but how visible it is initially will highly vary based on genetics and is something that we can't change however this line becomes more visible through hypertrophy of the obliques and the transversus abdominus which is due to the internal oblique muscle this is because the obliques attached to the inguinal ligament so when the transversus abdominus grows it kind of pushes up from underneath to make a suspect more visible long story short to make your adonis bill more visible you want to work out and strengthen your obliques and your transversus abdominus so how exactly do we do this well the main action of the transversus abdominus is stabilization of the spine such as during heavy squats and deadlifts and during certain ab exercises on the other hand the main actions of the obliques are lateral flexion and work of the trunk so logically the best way to develop these muscles is through performing heavy compound movements as well as ab exercises that require a lot of civilization and rotation of the trunk so what exactly are the best ab exercises for this purpose well the first exercise is side planks side planks require a lot of stabilization and thus activation of the transversus abdominus as well as involvement of the obliques in order to keep your body upright the main key for this exercise is not to let your hips draw towards the floor to try to hold this position for around one minute on each side and perform three or four sets of it when this gets too easy you can always hold some weight in your other hand to make it a little harder for you the second exercise is hanging leg raises this exercise mainly targets the transversus abdominus but you can also twist your legs when raising them to activate your obliques as well try to do around eight to twelve reps of the straight leg raises and twisted leg raises for three to four sets each and don't be afraid to add some weight by holding it in between your feet if this gets too easy and the third exercise is something called cable woodchoppers which will do wonders for your obliques you want to focus on pulling the handle across and down your body by using your obliques you want to keep your hips nice and straight and don't let them rotate to ensure that you're using your obliques to move the way perform four sets of around eight to twelve reps and increase the weight as it gets easier so for the best results you can perform these three exercises in a circuit routine one to two times a week or you can just add it to your current adverting and you want to train these muscles like you would any other muscle or we load it with the weight when it gets easy in order to elicit hypertrophy of these muscles and that's basically it guys the key is to drop your body fat below 12% perform heavy compound movements and perform these ab exercises that activate your obliques and transversus abdominus I hope this helps out if you have any questions and leave a comment down below and please like the video and subscribe to my channel if you found it useful Cheers [Music]"

    "title": "The 3 WORST Workout Routine Mistakes (GAIN KILLERS!)",
    "published_at": "2021-05-23T16:19:34Z",
    "transcript": "how many workout routines have you tried one five ten more but are you again and again left dissatisfied with the lack of muscle growth that you get from those routines well listen up because i'm going to show you three gain killers that your workout routine is likely guilty of and how to fix each one you've heard of add gain killer number one is called hadd hypertrophic attention deficit disorder people who have hadd they switch up their exercises too often and have no long-term focus why is long-term focus so important because guys who do the same boring exercises over and over do them well and get stronger on them simply build more muscle than guys who switch it up for whatever reason for instance it's monday chest day you pop up your phone and find the latest best chest workout routine from your favorite influencer and decide to follow that next week one of your buddies is at the gym and also training chest so you hop in on his workout sound familiar well if you're serious about maximizing growth and actually seeing results then you need to instead go into every one of your workouts with the game plan written out rather than aimlessly following a random workout every single week you need specifics on what exercises you're doing how many sets you're doing and the amount of reps and weight that you're going to aim to lift to try to beat your last workout otherwise how are you going to know if you're actually making progress with your workouts and getting stronger instead of just getting a good pump you're not to illustrate this a 2019 study had participants perform an eight-week resistance training program using either a structured exercise program or having the exercises randomly generated every session by an app although the differences between groups did not yet reach statistical significance the structured group had almost twice as much muscle growth a greater increase in back squat and bench press strength and a slight decline in body fat percentage what this suggests is that had this study been carried out longer or had more subjects there likely would have been a clear advantage to the structured program the reason for this is pretty straightforward it's well known that new exercises cause the most muscle damage but after a while you adapt and less damage occurs so while you may feel a lot more soreness from these random workouts they actually don't provide as much growth as sticking to the same set of exercises and focusing on progressing those with more weight and or reps over time in fact a research shows that early on much of the increase in protein synthesis response that you get from training is directed towards repairing rather than building muscle due to the excessive muscle damage it experiences from the normal exercises only after a few weeks into a program is your body able to attenuate the muscle damage and focus more so on building new muscle meaning that you likely need to do an exercise consistently for at least two to three weeks before you can really start to get the best growth possible out of it in addition to this during your workout at a minimum you should be recording the exercises the sets the reps and the weight that you're using it's also a good idea to write down your effort on each of these sets and the settings that you were using on a machine or cable or any modifications that you made to your workout this is going to allow you to control as many variables as possible such that in your future workouts you can more accurately determine if you actually made progress or not it also just serves as a plan of attack for your next workout for example if you see that last week you did bicep curls for an easy 3 sets of 10 reps using 35 pounds in each hand you now know that you're capable of doing more so this week you'll know that you should at least aim to do 40 pounds or 45 pounds instead of 35 pounds or just aim for one to two more reps per set if you didn't have this information written down that you wouldn't have an effective plan of attack for your next workout and trust me even if you think that you'll remember week after week i know how easy it is to forget especially the minor details which are what matter the most it's why so many people who go to the gym consistently week after week fail to actually progress so track your progress and track it properly gain killer number two junk volume doing more sets than you should do in a single session rather than doing just enough to maximize growth most people are unaware that you only have a certain amount of productive steps you can do in a single session adding sets above this threshold will not help you gain additional muscle but rather seems to just increase damage and lengthen your recovery hence the term junk volume feature this on a chest day you perform four sets of bench press four sets of chest press four sets of dumbbell press four sets of chest dips and then four sets of flats by the time that you make it to the flies your chest will be exhausted and experiencing much less tension than it was earlier on in your workout by this point you've likely reached and surpassed your productive limit for that session and all you're doing now is getting a half decent pump at the expense of prolonging your recovery so how do you know what your limit is well just like total weekly training volume it's actually very individual some can handle more and still grow whereas others just can't based on the current evidence though and an analysis done by researcher james krieger as long as sets are being performed to or near failure it seems that the limit is around 10 sets per muscle per workout once again this is highly variable but it does suggest that if you greatly exceed this theoretical limit by regularly doing 15 to 20 plus sets for muscle group in one single session then you're probably doing more harm than good this is especially true if you just haven't been progressing very well despite all of this volume a practical solution is to distribute that volume into more than one session per week instead of doing 18 sets of chests in a single workout split it up and do nine sets in one workout and nine sets in another or if you wanted to train your upper body three times a week split up the 18 sets into six sets during each of these three workouts you can imagine just how much better quality those success would be and the increased amount of weight and reps you'd be able to lift for those sets rather than by trying to do them all in one single workout gain killer number three redundant exercises to continue from our last point if you only have a certain amount of productive sets you can do per workout then you want to make sure that you're getting the most bang for your buck out of these sets most people don't by making the wrong exercise choices for these sets by doing exercises that do pretty much the exact same thing but just have different names for example take these two sample chest workouts in workout a you do three sets of bench press three sets of flat dumbbell press and three sets of a flat machine press in workout b you do three sets of bench press three sets of an incline dumbbell press and three sets of a cable flat which one do you think would be a better use of nine sets well if you look at workout a you're actually performing pretty much the same one exercise for all nine sets whereas in workout b you're working several different parts of the chest with exercises that have varied angles and different resistance profiles so for the same amount of work you'd be able to provide much more stimulus to your chest with workout b and as a result get more gains out of those nine sets the same goes for an arm workout for example doing three sets of a standing barbell curl then three sets of a standing dumbbell curl and three sets of a standing cable curl will all provide a very similar stimulus and target the same area of your biceps whereas three sets of a preacher curl three sets of an incline dumbbell curl and three sets of hammer curl instead would enable you to target different regions of your biceps and hence provide a greater overall stimulus for the same amount of sets meaning that for your overall workout routine just think carefully about the chosen exercises you're using for each muscle in your workouts are you essentially performing the same one exercise over and over again just with different names if so then consider swapping some of them for other exercises that are biomechanically different and challenge the muscle at different angles and ranges of motion by doing so you'll be able to get much more stimulus and more gains for the same amount of work overall if you're going to spend time and effort doing your workouts then it would be in your best interest to ensure that you're getting the most out of it what i went through in this video are just a few ways that you can do just that but for a complete step-by-step science based program that shows you exactly how to train and how to eat week after week such that with the effort you put in

    "title": "How to Use Creatine Effectively: 6 Things You Need to Know",
    "published_at": "2017-04-30T16:59:16Z",
    "transcript": "hey what's up guys it's Jeremy here and today we're going to be talking about creatine and throughout the video we're going to be going through the six most important things that you need to know when it comes to taking creatine most effectively so let's first take a look at what exactly creatine does so for those of you that may not know ATP is a molecule in our body that is the main form of energy for our muscles it's what our muscles use for energy whenever we exercise so when we lift weights and we start Contracting our muscles we use up this ATP for energy and eventually we deplete our ATP storage to the point where we fatigue and this is part of what prevents us from performing more reps after we reach our point of exhaustion this is where creatine comes in so creatine is already found in our body and it's responsible for regenerating ATP to maintain our ATP stores and when we supplement with creatine we enhance our ability to regenerate ATP and this allows our ATP store to be better maintained during short-term intense exercise and ultimately allows us to perform that extra reper to when we're lifting weights which leads to Greater strength improvements in the long run you should also keep in mind that there are responders and non-responders to creatine so for some people it works great and for others it doesn't work at all one study actually indicated that responders typically had a high percentage of type two muscle fibers and a low initial muscle creatin content on the other hand non-responders had a lower percentage of type 2 muscle fibers and a higher initial muscle creatine content implicating that there is an upper limit with regards to creatine and its effects since further increasing creatine content was not beneficial for non-responders so the first thing we're going to take a look at is what type of creatine should you get and this is probably the most common question that I get asked about creatine now there are a variety of different types of creatine there's creatine citrate creatine Esther etc etc however most studies actually show that creatin monohydrate is able to raise muscle Creatine level as much or even more than the other forms of creatine so we can conclude that the other forms of creatine are basically just marketing gimmicks to get you to spend more money however one study of Interest actually showed that polyethylene glycosilated creatine was actually able to have the same effect on strength as creatin monohydrate but you only needed to take 75% less creatine than that with [\u00a0__\u00a0] monohydrate which indicates that this molecule may be better absorbed by the body but more research needs to be done in order to come up with a definite answer so the next thing we're going to talk about is what should you take a creatine with and this is another really common question that I get asked and many Studies have shown that taking creatine with 93 G of carbohydrates or with an equivalent of 47 G of carbohydrates and 50 g of protein we're able to raise muscle creatine levels by 60% more than if you were to just take creatine with water and this 60% increase in MUSC muscle creatine levels actually led to a slight Improvement in muscle hypertrophy and one R max strength also research towards ingesting creatine with carbs and protein seems more promising than carbohydrates alone so I think the best and most convenient option is to take your creatine with a post-workout meal as this will likely provide close to the 47 G of carbs and 50 g of protein suggested within studies to provide a more enhanced absorption another option is to take creatine with your post-workout Shake especially if you use milk as this will likely provide a decent level of carbs and protein and will likely enhance its absorption as opposed to taking it with just water and this brings me to my next point which is when should you take your creatine so the short answer is it doesn't really matter because creatine doesn't have an immediate effect it can take up to a few weeks even longer than that to have an effect on your body but like I said before if you tend to have a big post-workout shake or a big post-workout meal and I would suggest taking it with that one study that I found actually compared taking creatine pre-workout versus post-workout they found that taking a post-workout actually led to um a slight Improvement in strength and body composition compared to taking a pre-workout so we can conclude based on the findings of the study that uh taking it post-workout may be slightly more beneficial than taking it pre-workout so the next point I want to cover is what protocol should you use to take your creatine you basically have three three options when it comes to taking your creatine you can use the loading phase you can do no loading phase or you can cycle your creatine so I'm going to be going through the differences of each protocol and the benefits of each as well so loading requires you to ingest around 0.3 G of creatine per kilogram of your body weight per day and this often comes out to around 20 G per day so we do this for 5 to 7 days and then you ingest 3 to 5 G per day after that 3 G is likely sufficient enough to maintain the elevated creatine stores but you can always do 5 G per day to be safe and on the other hand doing it with no loading faves involves just taking three to 5 gram of creatine every day right from the start and research shows that the two methods are equally effective in raising muscle creatin levels but the loading protocol is able to provide faster initial effects than without a loading phase and on the other hand cycling protocols do not appear to be more effective than the other two protocols so really it's up to you whether you want do the loading or non-loading protocol in the long run it doesn't make a difference so the next point I'm going to go through very briefly and it's how long should you take creatine for and the question I most often get asked is should you take creatine when you're bulking or when you're cutting and personally what I suggest is if you're a responder and it's helping out with your strength then there's no real reason to stop taking it regardless of whether you're bulking or cutting however some people do claim that they get bloated when they take creatine so when you're cutting and you want to look as lean as possible then this may be a reason why you shouldn't take creatine when you're cutting otherwise I would just continue taking it and the last point I want to go through is should you stack creatine with any other supplement and basically this means should you take creatine with another supplement and recent Studies have shown that taking beta alanine with creatine appears to create a synergistic effect one study I looked at actually found that taking creatine and beta lanine together led to better improvements in strength and changes lean body mass compared to just taking creatine alone or a placebo so you can implement this by just adding 3 G of beta alanine to your daily creatine intake so to sum up the video use creatine monohydrate have it with your post-workout shake or your post-workout meal use the loading phase protocol if you'd like to see faster initial effects and if not just use a non-loading phase protocol as these will both provide the same long-term effects take it regardless of if you're bulking or cutting if you're responding to it and finally you can take creatine with 3 G of beta alanine which may provide enhanced benefits thank you so much for watching I hope you guys enjoyed the video and found it useful I just want to say that moving forward with my channel I really want to make an effort to clear up a lot of the BS that's currently in the fitness industry I'm going to continue making videos that are backed by scientific research so please help me out and

    "title": "The Best Science-Based Cardio Routine to Lose Fat FASTER (Without Losing Muscle!)",
    "published_at": "2018-07-01T13:49:39Z",
    "transcript": "when it comes to fat loss and how to best achieve it cardio seems to be an area of confusion for most people now although cardio is by no means necessary for fat loss given that you're creating a calorie deficit through your diet it definitely can be a good idea to incorporate why well aside from the obvious cardiovascular health benefits it provides it can also one help enhance the rate of your fat loss especially once you reach low levels of body fat and especially if you're sedentary for most of the day and - rather than creating an energy deficit entirely by just eating less food incorporating some cardio enables you to eat a bit more while dieting which can help you better stick to your diet in the long run however one thing to keep in mind is that even if your main goal is fat loss it's vital that you focus on maintaining as much muscle as possible throughout the process to avoid winding up skinny fat by the end of it and unfortunately one of the downsides of cardio is something called the interference effect which as summarized in this 2011 meta-analysis from the Journal of strength and conditioning research simply means that the more cardio and individual performs and the longer the duration of each session the more it interferes with muscle size and strength gains there also seems to be specific forms of cardio that are better than others at retaining muscle while maximizing fat loss therefore it's clear that in this case more is not better and not all forms of cardio are created equally so it's vital that you set up your car your routine appropriately in order to see the best results and in this video I'll guide you through exactly how to do so for those who are unaware high-intensity interval training or hit simply refers to a cardio protocol in which you alternate between short periods of almost all out effort with longer periods of rest it has been shown to be superior at improving vo2 max various cardiovascular health markers and insulin sensitivity when compared to less intense forms of cardio and in terms of fat loss aside from the fact that hid workouts enable you to burn more calories in a shorter period of time when compared to lower intensity cardio the main reason I do recommend incorporate in some hit is because of its potential muscle sparing properties for example the amended analysis I mentioned earlier found that high-intensity cardio interferes less with muscle and strength gains than lower intensity forms of cardio do so for this reason it would likely be the better option over extended amounts of steady-state cardio as for which exercise modality to use for hit I'd suggest mainly starting out with cycling since multiple studies have shown that when compared to other forms of hit cycling best minimises muscle soreness and damage after a session therefore making it easier to recover from especially if you aren't used to intense exercise in addition as noted in this 2009 paper from the journal strength and conditioning research the range of motion you use when cycling is very similar to common weight training exercises like squatting and like pressing for example and therefore it can help better maintain or increase your strength in those lifts as you're dieting but with that being said running and rowing are two other viable exercise modalities for hits since they also mimic common weight training exercises and have been shown to be effective for maintaining strength so ultimately choose what you enjoy the most or have the most experience with now as for when to perform your hit workouts I'd suggest following the recommendations from this 2016 paper from the Journal of strength and conditioning research which concluded that performing your hit sessions on a rest day or at least after your weights workout rather than before is ideal to prevent a reduced performance in your weight training workouts and as for how many hit workouts to do per week I'd advise starting with one session per week and then if needed you can gradually increase to a maximum of two or so sessions per week since going passes will likely start to negatively interfere with the recovery from your weight lifting workouts which should always remain your priority now the main downside with hit is that it's quite taxing both mentally and physically and therefore can't be used too often which is why you should ideally combine it with some form of low intensity steady-state cardio as well and your options when it comes to steady-state cardio are pretty much endless it can be anything from brisk walking and swimming light cycling and so on as long as you're working at a perceived effort of around four or so on a scale of 10 as for what's optimal though based on the findings of this 2009 meta-analysis for similar reasons as discussed earlier cycling seems to be the ideal option for minimizing muscle loss and although there's no formal research on this yet I'd also think that the Stairmaster would be a viable choice as well since it does mimic lower body exercises quite well and doesn't cause much muscle damage but ultimately choose whatever activity you enjoy the most and will be most consistent with because in the long run that's what's going to provide you with the best results and again as with your hip workouts stick to performing your steady-state cardio sessions ideally on a rest day or at least after your weight lifting workouts as opposed to before that suggests starting with one to two low intensity cardio sessions of around 20 to 30 minutes each and then increasing the frequency and/or duration of these sessions if needed as you progress throughout the weeks so to sum the video up here's what an initial weekly cardio routine of both hit and steady-state cardio could look like for you keep in mind though that the optimal amount of cardio will vary for everyone and depends on your overall activity level but this is definitely a good starting point and then once your fat loss progress begins to stall which will happen more often as you get leaner you can start adding more cardio as per my previous recommendations but unsure to do so gradually your goal should be to lose roughly 0.7 percent of your body weight per week so make adjustments based on that and you'll be headed in the right direction and if you're interested in seeing examples of various hit workouts you can be doing I posted an example of workout on my Instagram which I'll link in the description box down below thanks so much for watching guys yes I'm back on YouTube after being m.i.a for the past few weeks I've just been really focused on getting my online programs done and getting them perfect I'm hoping to have them released sometime in August but I'll keep you all updated so stay tuned for that but with that being said I hope you found this video useful please do keep in mind though that when it comes to fat loss your focus needs to be on your diet and your weight lifting workouts cardio is an effective tool to use but if you don't prioritize your nutrition and your weight lifting workouts then cardio will do more harm than good so just keep that in mind anyways as always for those interested you can find the written summary of this video on my website built with science calm and I'll leave a link to the article in the description box down below and if you found this video useful please don't forget to give it a like leave a comment down below subscribe to my channel and turn on

    "title": "FIX Your Knee Pain: Stop Ignoring This Muscle! (Full Exercise Routine)",
    "published_at": "2018-11-04T17:14:03Z",
    "transcript": "if you currently experience a nagging pain in your knee during exercise then you already know the extent to which this can negatively affect your workout and overall progress it's also likely that you've tried to address the problem by either avoiding certain exercises altogether or focusing just on strengthening the structures around the knee but the truth is although there's several causes of knee pain it's often due to a commonly overlooked aspect within most people's training routines strengthening the glute medius this is because the glute medius which is one of the lesser known glute muscles plays a vital role in key movements at the hip and when the glute medius is weak you're unable to properly control your femur and as a result it slightly rotates inward to compensate which happens anytime you stand walk or perform lower body exercises for example and this inward rotation creates excessive stress on the knees in different areas hence creating the knee pain you might be feeling and not only do multiple studies agree with this and show a strong positive correlation between a weak glute medius and result in knee pain but studies also indicate that strengthening a weak glute medius seems to drastically reduce knee pain and joint loading with one 2011 study by dalek and colleagues demonstrating a 43% reduction in knee pain in just four weeks after incorporating glute medius strengthening exercises so it's clear that if your glute medius is in fact underdeveloped which is likely the case if you sit for most of the day or don't exclusively train this muscle then strengthening it should be your priority when it comes to alleviating knee pain and regardless of if you feel pain or not it's still a crucial muscle to train since it aids in lower body exercises boosts performance and prevents future problems like lower back pain and IT band issues from arising therefore in this video I'll first cover how to test for glute medius weakness the best exercises to strengthen it and then how to combine this all into a routine for you to follow one easy and quick method to indicate if you have a prominent weakness new glute medius is something called the tread Limburg test simply stand with your feet shoulder width apart and lift one foot off the ground normally your pelvis should remain neutral or very slightly raised up like so and you should be able to comfortably stay in this position however if either your hip drops towards you lifted leg or you have to excessively lean your upper body towards your planted leg in order to hold the position then it's likely that your glute medius on the planted leg side may be weak another simple indication is assessing how your knee tracks during lower body exercises if for example during single leg movements like lunges or their Bulgarian split squat your knee tends to track inwards as you perform them or you tend to compensate with excessive leaning over as you perform your reps this is another good indication that the glute medius may be weak and not doing its job and lastly if you've never exclusively trained your glute medius and feel a strong intense burn and the hips when performing the exercises I'll provide then there's a good chance that is in fact underdeveloped now as for the best exercises to strengthen the glute medius to recent large systematic reviews have compared the activation of the glute medius during a variety of different exercises but rather than simply performing the highest activating exercises right away it's best in your case to gradually strengthen the glute medius by progressing from lower to higher demanding exercises and one simple yet suitable non weight-bearing exercise to start out with is something called sidelined hip abductions to do them simply lay on your side with your leg straight and feet together in a controlled manner lift your top leg to roughly 45 degrees without any rotation of your pelvis it should instead stay pointing straight away from you you also don't want to rotate your toes towards the ceiling to compensate instead keep them neutral or slightly pointed towards the floor in order to better activate the glute medius when done properly you should feel a strong contraction in the glue medius of the leg of raising up as shown here and to increase the strength of this contraction you can simply place a band around your knees or ankles and perform the movement like so once you feel comfortable with this you can then move on to an excellent weight bearing exercise lateral band walks for these simply place a band around your knees get into an athletic stance and take small control lateral steps without excessively swaying your upper body your pelvis and toes should remain facing straight and if you were walking to the right for example you'd want to feel a strong contraction in your right glute medius as shown here in addition as shown in this 2015 systematic review glute medius activation during this exercise increases as you move the band from the knees to the ankles to the feet which is just a good way to progress it over time the last exercise and the final progression is something called side plank hip abductions and was shown in both of the systematic reviews mentioned earlier to elicit the highest activation of the glute medius to perform them simply get into a side plank position by raising your hips up and then lift your top leg up just how we did with the sideline hip abductions mentioned earlier the same key points apply for this exercise as well and again you can add a band around your knees or ankles during this movement to further progress it so sum all these exercises up here's what you can do to get started start out with the sideline hip abductions for three to four sets a few times a week focus on first really feeling your glute medius work before progressing it by adding a resistance band to the movement then once you feel comfortable with that you can then progress to the other two more difficult exercises which if needed can then be progress even further by using a band again perform these two exercises a few times a week either at home or with in your leg workouts but regardless they should remain a staple in your weekly routine and finally if you're eventually able to do so without pain an excellent way to ensure you're firing your glute medius during movements like the squat is to place a band around your knees like so forcing your knees to push out against this inward resistance will help you feel what it's like to properly use this muscle during the squat and if you currently don't have any resistance bands I would highly suggest that you invest in some for those interested I do have built with science many resistance bands available on my site which are the ones I used in this video and to leave a link to these in the description box down below that's pretty much it for this video everyone I hope you were able to learn something from it as you can see often-overlooked muscles like the glute medius really can cause a lot of trouble if you don't dress them properly and if you're looking for a truly evidence-based program that takes every little detail like this into account to ensure that you can transform your body not only efficiently but also safely then simply head on over to built with science comm forward-slash courses where you can choose the best program for you anyways that's it for now for those who haven't already I'd really appreciate it if you gave me a

    "title": "BIGGER BICEPS: 5 Techniques To Speed Up Growth",
    "published_at": "2022-09-25T15:44:39Z",
    "transcript": "there's nothing that can shatter your confidence more than having twig leg arms trust me I've been there and I know exactly how it feels but the good news is I grow in your arms into big sleeve hugging biceps as possible you just need to get smarter with how you train them there's five techniques in particular that the latest science suggests can help speed up biceps growth dramatically today I'll share what those are and how to use them to get your biceps growing faster than they ever have before the first technique actually has to do with your back training whenever you train your back with exercises such as rows lat pull Downs or pull-ups your biceps will be heavily involved because of this some people say that's all you really need to grow your biceps a 2021 study put this Theory to the test they compared the growth of the biceps from dumbbell rows versus dumbbell curls after eight weeks although the dumbbell rows did lead to significant growth of the biceps dumbbell curls led to over double the growth these findings mean two things one you will still experience a lot of your biceps growth from your big back exercises so don't overlook their importance for big arms get stronger with your back training and your biceps will grow as well two to maximize biceps growth it's important to train them directly with one to two exercises after you're bacteria this is especially true because as we'll explain the next tip back exercises have a downside when it comes to biceps growth that said it's important to pick the right bicep exercises recent evidence suggests that certain bicep exercises may be better options than others this is where the next tip comes in one of the most exciting areas of recent research has to do with something called stretch mediated hypertrophy to explain what this fancy term means let's take a look at a recent 2021 paper researchers had two groups of subjects perform the preacher curl twice a week but either only the bottom half or the top half of the curl after five weeks they assess the growth in the biceps the subjects that performed only the bottom half of the curl experienced almost three times the biceps growth as those who only perform the top half the reason for this seems to be the result of a powerful muscle building stimulus that happens when a muscle is fully stretched under load such as at the bottom position of a bicep curl now although I will admit this study design does have its flaws the findings are consistent with other similar studies on the biceps as well as with research on other muscle groups like the hamstrings as for how to apply this to speed up your biceps growth there's three things you can do first you need to use a full range of motion on all your bicep exercise especially at the bottom position this means fully extending your arm at the bottom position to get a full stretch on your biceps each rep next you should choose bicep exercises that challenge the biceps the most when it's in a fully stretched position which is especially important because it's something that the back exercises we mentioned earlier just can't do the best options here are the slight incline dumbbell curl and the behind the body cable curl later on in this video I'll explain how often to do these exercises and lastly for an even more powerful muscle building stimulus after your last set for these exercises once you've reached failure or very close to it perform half reps of just the bottom part of the curl this will allow you to push past your normal point to failure and will further prioritize this all-important fully stretched position the next tip has to do with your workout volume there's a good chance that as long as you don't overdo it a small increase in your weekly bicep volume will be met with faster gains illustrating this phenomenon is a 2015 paper within a subjects all trained three tasks per week but were split into groups that performed a weekly total of either three sets nine sets or 15 sets of bicep curls after six months of this there is a clear dose response relationship with 15 bicep sets per week providing the most bicep gains however you don't want to overdo this especially if you're a beginner my recommendation is to use 15 sets of direct bicep training as more of an upper limit instead of jumping straight to that take a look at how many weekly bicep sets you're doing right now and add a couple sets to that if you don't feel overworked and your performance stays higher than great keep doing that increased volume and in the future consider increasing it even further to see if it helps speed up your gains I would however recommend splitting these sets out so you're not doing it all in one session this could for example look like three sets of two bicep exercises on one day during the week and then another three sets of two bicep exercises on another day during the week that said as you perform mid sets it's important to apply the next tip if you want to experience the most growth of them I think the biggest mistake is that you go to gym and you go through the motion but you don't really have your mind inside the muscle old school bodybuilders have long preached the benefits of focusing on feeling your muscle working as you train it not until fairly recently in a 2018 paper has this method been actually put to the test researchers had one group of subjects perform the bicep curl while really focusing on squeezing the biceps and really feeling the muscle work the other group was simply instructed to lift the weight after eight weeks of this the group that focused on feeling their biceps working experienced almost double the bicep gains to apply this method to potentially speed up your bicep gains whenever you do curls try to really feel your biceps doing the work it can help to think about pulling the bar or dumbbell into your body rather than just lifting the weight up however as you apply this tip it's important that you don't end up sabotaging your biceps growth in the process this leads me to my final tip in order for a muscle to grow you need to continuously challenge them with more than they're used to it sounds simple but most people don't do this when they're treating their biceps they forget about this concept completely and only focus on getting a good pump instead to force your biceps to grow every week first pick two to three bicep exercises that you'll stick to week after week here's a few that I recommend based on what we talked about earlier then whenever you do a workout write down how much weight you used and how many reps you did use these numbers as a goal to beat during your next workout by trying to do one to two more reps than you did last time or add a little bit more weight compared to your big compound exercises progression with your bicep exercises will be slow but focus on tracking your progress and making small improvements week after week and over time you'll notice a huge difference in your biceps growth apply these five techniques and you'll notice faster biceps growth almost immediately but guys it's important that you take the same size based detailed approach to every single muscle you train not just your biceps that's exactly what I show you how to do in my step-by-step programs over at buildwithscience.com these programs have worked for thousands of others and it'll work for you so head over there and take the quick analysis quiz and I'll let you know which program is best for you

    "title": "The Best 1-Minute Exercise For Faster Gains (DO THIS PRE-WORKOUT!)",
    "published_at": "2020-07-26T14:54:50Z",
    "transcript": "today i want to talk about one exercise an exercise that literally just takes one minute to do yet for many of you watching if done before your workouts and consistently over time can not only help potentially speed up your gains but also help minimize your risk of injury and potentially even alleviate some of the back pain you may be experiencing although what i mentioned may sound too good to be true such an exercise does exist because most people overlook this muscle and they don't train it properly even when they think they are as a result this muscle gets weakened over time especially if you spend a lot of time sitting throughout the day which can create all sorts of problems both in and outside of the gym so what exactly is this muscle well it's one of our key muscles in our core and it's the transversus abdominis so this muscle actually sits behind your rectus abdominus or your abs and it wraps horizontally around your lower abdomen to stabilize your spine almost like a weight belt and you use this muscle or should be using this muscle in combination with your other core muscles whenever you move your arms or legs and whenever you perform your exercises especially in lifts like the squat the deadlift ups and overhead press and the stronger this muscle is the more stable you'll be and the more strength and power you can put into your exercises that require a lot of stability and hence potentially speed up your gains as a result but the problem is that this muscle is weak as hell in a lot of people and as a result it can easily become the limiting factor in your exercises and the progress that you're making in the gym and the reason why this muscle commonly gets weak is because your typical abs exercises like crunches they just don't cut it when it comes to this muscle as this muscle is instead best strengthened by using isometric exercises that are built to enhance both muscular endurance and coordination but what exactly does this look like though and what is this exercise that you've all been patiently waiting to hear it's something called the dead bug which is an exercise that's been shown and used in several studies aiming to improve transversus abdominis activation and just overall core stability since it seems to best activate these muscles and is therefore something that i'd highly recommend you include in your routine so this exercise is actually what's termed as an anti-extension exercise which just means that you're simply bracing your core and your deep abdominal muscles while you move your arms and legs and although this may sound and look simple many people struggle with executing this basic movement pattern properly and as a result this is the reason why a lot of people struggle with moving their hips without excessively activating their lower back and it's also why a lot of people can't move their arms overhead without excessively arching the lower back which then creates a lot of risk for injury and also creates a lot of inefficiencies in your exercises and your lips so what the dead bug does is it helps address these issues by teaching you how to move at your arms and legs without compensating at your spine now some of you may have seen this exercise before even tried it out but i guarantee that you haven't done it properly and in a way that actually strengthens the transversus abdominis to the greatest degree because the main goal of this exercise is not to simply extend the arms and legs is to isometrically brace and stabilize the core while moving at the extremities but this version i'm showing here is a more advanced progression that when done properly will honestly already be too difficult for most of you so to start here's what i want you to do instead simply lay on your back with your knees bent like so then take a deep breath into your belly a deep breath out and when you near maximal exhalation draw your belly button into your spine to brace your core and flatten your lower back onto the ground you want to brace yourself as if someone were about to drop a ball in your stomach and this should create a feeling of firmness around your entire midsection and lower back so feel your stomach and your sides and make sure that there's tension there if you don't brace properly you'll only activate your rectus abdominus or your six-pack instead which is what we want to avoid once you get this down continue breathing as you maintain the bracing in your core and then bring your arms straight up and your knees bent to 90 degrees your lower back should still be flat against the ground and you should still be bracing as if someone were just waiting to drop that ball in your stomach at this point you should already be feeling your core working hard to maintain that position i'll be honest if you can't hold this position with your core brace and breathing through it for at least 60 seconds then how the hell do you expect to hold this up in a set of squats deadlifts or pull-ups where you're now placing a lot greater demands on your core and even loading the movement with weight it's simple you're not and this is exactly why a weakness here is such a common reason for plateaus and injuries so start here nail this down for at least 60 seconds and then when you're ready you want to progress it to do so you can start by again bracing properly and then just bring one arm up at a time like so [Music] then from here you can move on to one leg up at the time then from here you can move your way up to the full dead bug with the opposite arms and legs being extended simultaneously and then from here you can even move on to something like hollow body holds where both your arms and legs remain elevated while you keep your lower back flat against the floor but throughout all these guys you need to be keeping that belly button drawn in your lower back flat constant 360 bracing your core and breathing properly throughout them you want to execute whatever progression you choose to do in a way such that if someone were holding the ball right over your stomach your core would be ready and braced for that ball to hit any moment during your reps you can even experiment with keeping a resistance band under your lower back like so as you do the movement to ensure that you're keeping it flat against the ground otherwise the band is gonna slip out as soon as you lose that bracing which as you're gonna find is not easy to do at all it was for when and how exactly to apply this what i'd recommend is to first pick the progression that best suits your current level of core strength and one that you can do properly for about a minute without absolutely fatiguing yourself and you want to do this as part of your warm-up routine shortly before you go into your workout especially if that workout involves exercises where core stability demands are high so exercises like pull-ups push-ups squats and deadlifts for example and what this is going to do is it's not only going to gradually improve your core stability and your endurance over time but it's also going to immediately enhance your proprioception and activation of your core in your exercises for that workout and this over time can then translate to more strength and more reps especially in exercises where there's a lot of core stability requirements i'd even recommend that if your core is quite weak right now you can even periodically do this exercise in between sets of your main exercise just to again get in the habit of learning how to properly fire and use your core in your main exercise and although this will limit the amount of weight that you want to use in your main exercise and you definitely don't want to go to fatigue it is in the long run going to help improve the coordination and endurance of your core and hence lead to better strength and more gains in the long run but i hope you're able to see that it's muscles like these that we tend to unknowingly neglect that very easily start to hinder our progress and put us at a greater risk for injury which is why it's so important that you don't overlook them in your training for a step-by-step program that puts all of this together for you by showing you exactly how and why to train these overlooked muscles and how to combine them with your main workouts week after week so that you can build muscle as efficiently and as safely as possible and simply head on over to buildwithscience.com and take the analysis quiz to discover which science based program will be best for you

    "title": "How To Fix Rounded Shoulders FAST (10 Minute Science-Based Corrective Routine)",
    "published_at": "2019-09-22T15:48:28Z",
    "transcript": "if your posture currently looks more like the photo on the left and you desperately want your posture to look more like the photo on the right and fast and you've come to the right place forward rounded shoulders like the posture I'm demonstrating here which is admittedly exactly what my Pasha used to look like as a student has become increasingly common and is often developed from sustained periods of slouching and or the result of an unbalanced training routine in fact a recent 2017 paper actually found that regular weight lifters exhibited significantly greater values of forward rounded shoulders when compared to untrained individuals due to the various imbalances created by their training routines and this is a problem not only because it's just generally aesthetically unappealing but also because it can negatively affect your ability to perform certain exercises in the gym and can potentially put you at a higher risk of developing shoulder pain and injuries but before we dive into the most effective way to correct this we need to first take a look at the specific muscle imbalances responsible for creating this posture and based on the analysis of multiple papers you can confidently conclude that this posture is a combination of two things one overactive muscles that have become tight and are pulling the shoulders into this forward position with the main culprits often being the pecs and the upper traps and combination with the general lack of thoracic mobility and two under active muscles that have become weak and are failing to pull the shoulders backwards into its neutral position with the main culprits often being the mid and lower traps and the serratus anterior and what's interesting is that research actually shows that these muscles tend to become weak over time partly due to the overactive muscles that previously mentioned actually preventing us from being able to turn on these underactive muscles in the first place and therefore for the fastest results we're going to use a two-part corrective routine that first involves stretching the overactive muscles and then moves on to turning on and strengthening the underactive ones using the most effective exercises based on current scientific literature the first exercise for step one is going to be thoracic extensions which have been shown in case studies to be an effective drill to improve your thoracic mobility to open up the restricted area contributing to your rounded shoulders we want to do here is place a foam roller across your upper mid-back area with your hands placed behind your head then exhale while letting your upper back extend over the foam roller and make sure you avoid compensating during this by excessively arching your lower back you want to hold this position for a few deep breaths and then repeat this a couple more times further down your upper back and if you don't have a foam roller I'll leave a link in the description box to a couple that I personally use and would recommend for now though a decent alternative is simply performing the same movement seated or with your back on a chair again focus on extending the upper back and avoiding arching your lower back to compensate next we want to move on to band / and backs to stretch out the overactive muscles we talked about earlier that are pulling the shoulders forward what you want to do is grab a band or any kind of stick and hold it straight out in front of your chest with an overhand grip pull the band apart slightly to create some tension and then without bending your elbows you want to slowly raise the band up over your head and behind your back as far as you're capable of doing in a controlled manner and then as you get behind your back you want to focus on pulling the band apart rather than just losing all the tension in the band try your best to avoid shrugging and tensing the upper traps as you perform the movement and instead keep your shoulders pulled down and away from your ears throughout each rep and to progress this exercise what I'd suggest is starting out with a wider grip and not coming all the way back at first and then you gradually narrow your grip and go further down your back as your mobility improves as you perform the movement you should feel a deep stretch in your pecs your shoulders and your upper traps which are the exact muscles that we're trying to lengthen and if you don't have a band I'd highly suggest getting one and I'll leave a link in the description box to the one that I'm using here but in the meantime a decent alternative is simply the standing chest opener stretch where you clasp your hands behind your back squeeze your shoulder blades together and pull your arms up to deepen the stretch for these you want to hold the back position for about five deep breaths at a time now although we have done a good job with stretching out the tighten muscles it's crucial that we move on to step two of the routine - now strengthen the three key muscles that have become weak over time and are failing to pull the shoulders back and in fact key studies analyzing rounded shoulder posture have found that this step actually provides significantly greater corrective results in the stretching that we previously did and proving this point is a 2010 clinical trial on 28 individuals struggling with rounded shoulder posture the study found that activating and strengthening these three under active muscles in the subjects was key to successfully decreasing the extent of their rounded shoulder posture and thus illustrates the importance of the step and to start we'll focus on first strengthening the mid traps with the bad pull apart which has been shown in case that is to be an effective exercise that doing so to perform it what you'll want to do is hold the bat like so with your thumbs pointing up and arms directly in front of your chest then you want to pull the band apart slowly and with control while twisting your hands such that your thumbs point behind you at the end position you want to squeeze your shoulder blades together as you pull back to engage the mid traps which you should feel working during each rep and then after a few sets of the band pull apart we'll want to then slightly modify it to hit the lower traps instead by changing the line of pulley using a Y raise to perform it simply set up how we previously did with the band pull apart but this time what you want to do is push your fist forward slightly to protract your shoulder blades and pull the bat apart slightly to create some tension and then from here all you want to do is slowly raise your arms up to make a Y overhead and again try your best to avoid any shrugging or tensing up your upper traps as you do so when done properly as you raise your arms up you should feel a strong contraction in the lower traps shown here don't worry if you're not feeling too much in that area right now as your ability to turn on the lower traps will improve over time from both consistently practicing the movement as well as stretching out the overactive muscles from step one of the routine now again I'd highly suggest investing in a batch for these exercises but in the mean time for those without access to one you can instead perform these two movements on a bench or stability ball to hit the mid and lower traps respectively and I show how to perform these two exercises in more detail in my traps workout video which I'll link in the description box down below lastly we're going to work on strengthening the Sabrina Santiago all the push up Plus which has been shown to be extremely effective by doing so for those with rounded posture since it not only elicits high EMG activity but it also minimizes the involvement of the overactive upper traps when compared to other exercises and to perform at you simply want to get into the end of a push up position with your arms fully extended and then from here push your hands into the ground to protract your shoulder blades lifting your upper back towards the ceiling briefly hold the top position and then come back down to the starting position with your shoulder blades now retracted and then repeat for more reps you can also perform these on your knees if this is more doable for you it's a very subtle movement and you only move a couple inches upwards but you should feel the Serena's muscle working and to further intensify this contraction I'd recommend the externally rotating shoulders by twisting your hands outwards before you form the movement as to EMG analyses have shown that this modification leads to significantly greater serratus anterior activation than the standard grip with all these exercises it's vital that you make each rep count which means performing each rep slow and controlled with proper form and focus on engaging the right muscles that I went through so now let's put this all into a corrective routine that will only take you roughly 10 minutes to do get it's gonna work wonders for your posture but with this routine consistency and frequency really are key if you want to correct your posture as quickly as possible so if you can do so consistently then perform this routine every day otherwise I'd aim for at least 3 to 4 times per week for the best results and keep in mind guys that for long-term results you need to not only always be aware of how your posture is throughout the day and correct it accordingly but you'll also need to ensure that your training program is structured in a way that prevents these muscle imbalances from developing and that's exactly why within my built with science programs we've taken the time to carefully select each and every exercise included in your

    "published_at": "2025-01-12T13:30:34Z",
    "transcript": "I feel like I've had this my entire life this is Cam a YouTuber who's been on a big fat loss Journey after his wife told him this weren't you doing a video to like build the muscle well if I'm being honest you bulk without the muscle so for the next 90 days I'm going to see if I can use the best science-backed workout and Di strategies home run to help Karen get sixpack abs for the first time in his life damn holy sh here we go yo what up man how you doing you excited to get started ready to rock let's do it on day one cam is starting out at 160 lb and according to a dexa scan 25% body fat but to get visible six-pack abs he'll need to get down to at least 15% body fat a level of leanness achieved by less than 2% of the average population at these odds Cam's actually more likely to become a millionaire but here's the plan instead of relying on exercise alone our first priority is dialing in his diet it's kind of feels like an intervention doesn't it I know I was going to say I feel like I'm like in the principal's office or something again on average Cam's eaten about 2600 calories a day now it's not terrible it's actually pretty close to what someone his size would need to maintain their weight but it wasn't low enough to start losing fat to shed around 1 pound of fat per week we needed to bring that down to about 2100 100 calories but rather than completely overhauling his diet I wanted to focus on strategic food swabs this it's 210 calories okay so you could have the equivalent of four of these guys that's crazy the goal was to cut calories without making it feel like he was sacrificing the Foody Lu especially when it came to snacks and for that I had a secret weapon up my sleeve so you told me that you like ice cream love ice it can take anything like a bland protein shake and it will make it like into beautiful ice cream you're going to be eating ice cream every single night while getting shredded that's my dream man that's my dream with our game plan for Camp's diet in place it was time to start training engage your abs and use that to round your spine perfect that looks really good while C's goal is to get a six-pack focusing on ab exercises alone won't cut it see when you're in a calorie deficit your body looks for energy and without training it can burn muscle along with fat the result a skinny look instead of a lean muscular physique to prevent that we're implementing a well structured training program that targets all his major muscle groups and since cam hasn't trained or died in properly before he's in the perfect position to build muscle while losing fat and by broadening his back and shoulder muscles will create that Vaper look to complement his six-pack and achieve a truly aesthetic transformation so not only am I going to be training with Jeremy on and off every few weeks but I'm also set up now to test Jeremy's built with science Plus app which I'm going to be logging all of my nutrition in my weight each morning and every rep and weight that I do as I'm training so not only do I get Jeremy in person training me but I get a little little pocket Siz Jeremy to come along with me okay I'm done I'm done I'm done so for my pull-ups training this man has me doing three sets of band assisted pull-ups which which I am supposed to take to pretty much failure on top of that he has me doing two sets of negatives which I don't know if you've done that many pull-ups but those negatives dude are brutal as for the progress on his diet he was figuring it out [Music] oh Moment of Truth no no way bro what the heck this right here is an absolute Game Changer bro that is crazy what the heck with Cam now logging most of his meals into the app he was staying right on track with a daily Target of 2100 calories and his weight in the scale was quickly moving in the right direction I am 30 days into this training program and I am down 5 lbs everything is actually going better than I expected and I just hope this progress can like keep going as I move forward because yeah just 30 days in like this is going really really well while this is a great start getting down to 15% body fat means cam will have to lose more weight than he anticipated in fact after crunching the numbers based on his current muscle mass he'll need to drop all the way down to 139 lb that might sound surprisingly light for someone to his height but the truth is most of the shredded physiques you see online at heavier body weights are often the result of performance enhance of drugs genetic advantages or Decades of smart training for example my good friend Lee is incredibly muscular but to achieve competition level conditioning he diets down to just 129 lbs so as I'm working with Cam I'm curious to see just how far he's willing to push before the diet starts to wear him down more Let Go count control the way down now explode explode explode nice at a boy so what's the biggest difference training with Jeremy it's like it just feels more intense like every exercise feels like it's harder but I feel like in a way I'm doing less like less reps but it just feels more focused more controlled slower back back more painful then thrust them forward it's good though it's good it's definitely like making me work this forward there you go got you that was your best rep so far dude and while cam was making good progress in the gym and with this diet you may be thinking there's one thing we've overlooked cardio but think of it like the cherry on top the weights tell your body to keep your muscle the diet does most of the hard work of losing the fat and the cardio can just help speed up the process and rather than forcing cam to do cring cardio sessions he'd never stick to long term I wanted to find something he actually enjoyed so today we're play basketball and to measure how many calories he burns we're going to put this mask on I want to show Cam that you can burn a ton of calories without traditional boring cardio in the gym and you can get a six-pack doing stuff you actually enjoy hell yeah woo so basketball clearly isn't my strong suit but it was fun and the best part is you don't even feel like you're working in fact in just 25 minutes of gameplay cam burned over 300 calories which isn't bad at all but here's the thing if Cam wanted to rely on cardio alone to lose the same amount of fat he's been losing through his diet he'd need to play nearly an hour of basketball every single day so when it comes to Fat Loss a combination of both is key and in Cam's case it was just enough to speed up his progress without affecting his strength of the gym every every single set improved by one rep this time from last week which is not a lot but Improvement is Improvement so I will take that and when he checked back in after 90 days oh damn dude look at these guns dude the arms are way more defined yeah it's definitely like you got veins and as for K's progress in trying to go sixpack dude you have abs man in 90 days cam lost 11 lbs and shaved 3 and 1/2 CM off his waistline but while his progress has been incredible he's not quite at full six-pack abs yet he's sitting somewhere around 18 to 20% of body fat and that's perfectly fine getting lean and staying lean is a marathon not a Sprint and because we've taken a sustainable Approach cam was eager to keep pushing to see just how lean he could get but now that he's proven his dedication it's time to take things up a notch with my favorite science-based exercises to make his abs really pop so for the ABS we want an exercise where it's hardest when they're fully stretched like this right and what we can do here is instead of facing this way when you do the crunch you're just going to turn around and do them this way all right good how that feel good yeah that stretch feels good and to Target his lower abs we're going with reverse crunches but rather than doing these with straight legs we're going to do them with knees bent and focusing on lifting his pelvis Off the Bench Shifting the focus from his hip flexors to his lower abs try to come up a little bit higher there slow on the way down do you feel the difference oh my gosh yeah where where do you feel it the most just like tension here here it's nice yeah dudee that's nuts okay and finally my favorite ab exercise leg raise nice my gosh we're hitting the stubborn fat away come on what the let's go come on and Home Run Okay so maybe this one isn't science base you can take this at home and give it to your wife to dude smack you around with but to make up for my prank on cam I wanted to see if I could help him with one of the biggest challenges that he's faced in his fat loss Journey the biggest thing for me is I feel like you get invited out to like a friend's place or like to an event or I do some like volunteering where they feed you and so it's like like huh I don't really know what to do that fortunately this is a problem my incredible team and I have built with science have been working hard to solve so it is lunchtime and my brother just ordered a burrito bowl from Chipotle so I feel like this is a good time to try this like meal scanner uh in the app apparently you just take a photo and it will like recognize what it's supposed to be how the hell did it know that bro that is insane that's nuts I'm genuinely Blown Away by that with Cam now able to easily log his meals he was continuing to see progress on the scale with some strong evidence suggesting the weight he was losing was coming from all the right places it's great seeing the number on the scale go down but like there are other areas where the weight loss is just like genuinely mind-blowing for instance these pants used to fit me I used to wear these pants without a belt now can fit almost like another me in there but this is where most people get stuck they drop to under 20% body fat and then progress all of a sudden stalls why well your metabolism adapts as you lose weight research shows that losing just 10% of your body weight can cause your body to burn up to 200 to 400 fewer calories per day so when cam first started he needed to eat around 2100 calories per day to lose a pound of fat each week but now after losing 15 lbs we've adjusted this target to 1900 calories to keep the fat loss going but I didn't have to touch a thing that's where his built with science Plus app came in it's built-in diet coach automatically adapts your nutrition plan each week as your metabolism changes so for cam the app could sense whenever his metabolism dropped and would adjust his nutrition plan so he never got stuck however as Cam's weight started dropping into the 140s you started noticing some serious side effects I think it's finally happening last night I slept for 10 hours 10 hours I don't know when the last time it was that I slept for 10 hours I wasn't up late didn't do anything out of the normal 10 hours the last three workouts that I've done have felt just bad man strength been going up going up going up and then it drops off drops off like everything is just getting worse what Cam's experiencing is actually rooted in our survival back in the day having too little body fat meant you couldn't stay warm and you're at risk of starvation during famines so if your body senses that your fat levels are getting too low it fights back and here's how it works your fat cells produce a hormone called leptin leptin signals your body hey we've got plenty of fat to work with feel free to use it for activity and let's also lower the hunger signals but as you lose fat your body produces less leptin in response your body cranks up Hunger signals and tries to conserve energy by decreasing your desire to move which can also start to affect your strength in the gym but I also just kind of feel like trash like just feel trash Jeremy talked about hitting a wall at a certain point I think it's safe to say I've hit the wall cuz this this doesn't feel as fun as it used to and so after 150 days of Cam's fat loss Journey we decided to stop his diet here the extra push just wouldn't be worth it especially if it meant he wouldn't be able to maintain his shape afterwards but now it's time to check in on his final results oh yeah dude I can already see the definition is popping all right take it off bro damn yeah let's go holy [\u00a0__\u00a0] look at this boom boom boom so when you started out you were at 25.2% body fat yeah [Music] today it's 14.6% no way dude let's go czy let's go in 150 days cam lost 17 lbs and saw his total body fat drop by over 10% and the best part is okay throughout the process you gained 5 lbs of muscle yeah no way let's go dude dude that's crazy let's go I'm so proud of you man I'm so proud of you bro and as impressive as a visual changing Cam's appearan is is perhaps the reaction he got at home that was his biggest win Hillary can you can you please just repeat what you just said to me I said you look like a great god wow this works I saw it on Tik Tok don't fall for the Bro Science guys getting the six-pack or any meanful transformation it's a marathon not a Sprint but the key is a sustainable plan you can actually stick to long term and what's crazy is I only worked with Cam in person a handful of times throughout his journey the rest that was all thanks to our brand new app built with science plus it's just like having me as your personal coach guiding you every step of the way with science back

    "published_at": "2018-06-10T14:12:52Z",
    "transcript": "when it comes to fat loss there's no doubt that your diet is the most important factor that you have to get right even if your training is on point and consistent you're simply not going to see the results you want without a proper nutrition strategy but this is where most people fail and I honestly don't blame them we're constantly overwhelmed with new diets that are supposedly the new best way to lose fat so what becomes extremely difficult to know which approach to take but the real truth is every single diet or dieting method out there works the exact same way they all achieve fat loss by causing you to eat at a caloric deficit meaning that you're eating less calories and you're burning every day research has proven time and time again that whether it's keto intermittent fasting and so on although these diets may each have certain psychological and physiological benefits none of these diets or methods have any special fat loss effect the instead work by making it easier for you to eat less calories simply meaning that the best diet for fat loss is really the one that you personally enjoy the most and will be most consistent with however with that being said regardless of what approach you choose there are a few factors that you need to get right in order to optimize your diet for fat loss and are mainly how many total calories protein carbs and fats are consuming on a daily basis so as for your calorie intake if you want to maximize fat loss while minimizing muscle loss then you have to pay close attention to how many calories you're in taking research indicates that this is best done with a moderate caloric deficit that enables you to lose around 0.7 percent of your body weight per week which is around 1 pound of weight loss per week for most people in fact a more aggressive calorie deficit was actually shown to hinder fat loss as opposed to accelerated and if you're unaware of what your calorie intake should be a good starting point and something recommended from a 2014 paper from Eric Helms and colleagues is to simply multiply your body weight by 13 although this won't be spot-on for everyone you can start with that and then increase or decrease your calories based on how your weight loss progresses throughout the next little while as for protein it's the most important macro new you want to keep track of since research has repeatedly shown that it plays a major role in maintaining muscle while you're in a caloric deficit and although how much protein you should intake will always be a highly debated topic a recent 2018 meta-analysis from the Journal of Sports Medicine found that in taking at least 0.73 grams of protein per pound of body weight is enough to maximize muscle growth and maintenance however I personally find that in taking a little more than this is beneficial when restricting calories since we know that protein is the most satiated macronutrient so it can better help keep you full throughout the day and it just acts as a buffer to help minimize any potential muscle loss now as for carbs and fats despite the ongoing debate between low fat versus low carb diets a recent 2018 year-long randomized clinical trial with over 600 subjects found that one protein is the same both low-fat and low-carb diets are equally as effective for fat loss so in reality these two factors can be adjusted based on what kinds of foods you enjoy but generally the literature recommends a fat intake of around 0.25 to 0.5 grams per pound of body weight from healthy fats and then the rest of your calories minus your protein of course coming from carbs research does also suggest that females might do better sticking to the higher end of that fat range so that's something to keep in mind as well now that you've learned the basics regarding setting up and optimizing your diet for fat loss let's take a look at what a typical day of eating for fat loss looks like for me so before we get started with the first meal here are the main goals I try to achieve with my diet goal one is what I previously discussed and currently my main focus is to intake roughly 2,300 calories and around 165 grams of protein a day goal 2 is to help keep me full since fruits and veggies are often low in calories and they help me minimize any micronutrient or fiber deficiencies go 3 is a good idea for optimizing daily protein intake since as shown in Bradshaw in Fell's 2018 study in order to maximize muscle anabolism your daily protein intake should ideally be spread across a minimum of four meals throughout the day and goal four is just vital for my overall well-being and adherence to the diet so with that being said let's start with meal one so my breakfast usually consists of a smoothie with the following ingredients fruits and flax seed from my micronutrients fiber and omega-3 intake cashew milk since it's much lower in calories and dairy milk yet still provides calcium and vitamin D whey isolate protein to contribute to my daily protein intake and a few grams of cinnamon which helps add taste and has quite a bit of research supporting its ability to improve insulin sensitivity and with my smoothie I usually have rice cakes and the other half of the banana I preferred this as my pre-workout meal since it consists of a fast digesting protein and high glycemic index carbs which as explained in my previous video seems to be ideal for performance based on the literature now as for your post-workout meal contrary to popular belief and as shown in this 2013 literature review on the topic consuming a meal immediately post-workout doesn't seem to be very important if you've had a pre-workout meal with sufficient protein but since you do ideally want to space out your protein intake having another meal at least within a few hours after your workout would be recommended I personally prefer keeping it simple with baked sweet potato baked chicken breasts and a large salad on the side with low-calorie dressing again simply stick into unprocessed foods that help contribute to my overall micronutrient intake for the day throughout the day I usually have a few more servings of various fruits and vegetables and a combination of black coffee and green tea these are all quite low in calories it helped keep me full until the next meal and the caffeine found in green tea and coffee is a natural appetite suppressant and has actually been shown to increase your caloric expenditure research from the Journal of Clinical Nutrition suggests that a couple cups of coffee can lead to an additional 80 or so more calories burned throughout the day and the fact that research also shows that caffeine may increase fat usage by the body makes it something I'd recommend incorporating in your if you enjoy it sushi is by far my favorite food so I tend to have it quite often the great thing about knowing how much you should be eating is that you're able to fit in foods that you enjoy without it affecting your progress now aside from being a relatively low calorie high protein choice the salmon helps provide the important omega-3 fatty acids DHA and EPA which have recently been shown in a 20-18 literature review to possibly help with anabolic signaling and muscle repair and growth so in taking a few servings of fish per week and supplementing with Omega threes is something and highly recommend this is something I'll typically have shortly before bed since I personally enjoy going to bed feeling full and it doesn't impact my sleep it's usually a combination of eggs egg whites toast peanut butter topped with stevia sweetener and a salad with zero calorie dressing and for those against eating this late the literature has shown time and time again that eating carbs or even food in general late at night will not contribute to fat gain given that you're still staying at a caloric deficit something I do want to mention though is that for very calorie dense foods like peanut butter I would highly recommend that you take the time and effort to at least measure or even better way out how much you're using several studies have shown that underreporting calories is a very common reason why overweight individuals struggle to lose fat despite dieting which is probably because it's so easy to do for example here's 300 calories worth of peanut butter compared to 100 calories the difference is almost unnoticeable if this can easily be the factor that's inhibiting your fat loss so if you have any measuring tools I'd suggest you use those otherwise I'll leave a link in the description box down below to a very affordable scale that I personally use myself but that's pretty much what a day of eating for fat loss looks like for me hopefully this provides you with some insight as to how to approach and optimize your diet for fat loss the key is really to incorporate foods you personally enjoy eating in order to create the diet that you can adhere to the best now as for any supplements you should be taking I've got a little giveaway planned for you guys thanks for watching guys so I have a huge surprise for you as a way of giving back since I did just

    "published_at": "2019-03-10T16:34:55Z",
    "transcript": "[Music] we finally did it everyone we've hit 1 million subscribers and I'm honestly just so grateful and truly humbled as to how fast we've been able to hit this milestone now many of you out there are a longtime subscribers who've been following me since some of my first videos and many of you are also relatively new to the channel but regardless I've never really shared much about me personally and how everything kind of led to words out today so I thought that in honor of hitting this amazing milestone I'd do something a little bit more personal and share with you more about my story and who exactly Jeremy at t is so first off since I get this asked all the time I'm half french-canadian and I'm half Filipino and I currently live in Vancouver Canada when my dad is actually french-canadian and he's from Sudbury Ontario and my mom is Filipino and she's from the vows and like most people in this industry I was always heavily involved in sports growing up and I quickly developed a passion for fitness my dad was actually the one who first brought me to the gym when I think I was around 14 or 15 years old but growing up and at this time I was extremely skinny and I had a very hard time at in size which I was always really insecure about but over the next couple years of working out I actually did start to make pretty decent progress but let me tell you at the same time I made every single mistake in the book and pretty much everything I did was heavily guided by bro science which I didn't even realize was detrimental until later on and I truly think that it was this experience and just knowing that I could have saved so much more time prevented injuries and imbalances and just be faster progress back then and I followed a better approach which is what now drives my passion for science and just helping others weed out the BS that this industry is honestly just full of because the last thing I want is you guys out there for you worked it out making the same mistakes I did when they're fully preventable anyways I chugged along and does a lot of research on my own and I eventually got my NASM personal training certification at 18 along with a few other various certifications and I worked as a trainer at biggest gyms after this for a while and then eventually moved on to privately trained class on my own and during this time I was also studying kinesiology University which I actually really enjoyed and is where my passion for training and coaching kind of took off it's also where I learned a lot about rehabilitation mechanics my learn from experienced coaches in the industry and basically just learned all about the current research behind training and nutrition I eventually graduated with my bachelor's degree and I continued to work as a kinesiologist for a little while after that as for where YouTube comes into the picture most of you probably don't know this but I've been putting out content way before I even started this channel back in around 2014 when I was studying and working as a trainers when I first started to put on content online and I initially just started putting out workouts and recipe videos on Instagram which believe it or not I actually built to a decent size following despite the piss-poor production value and same monotone voice but during this time I also started a couple fitness blogs and I did a lot of content writing for big Fitness brands like elite FTS box rocks and so on you can actually still read some of these articles as they're still up on the sites and then there finally came YouTube where I initially experimented with one or two channels and posted a ton of quite embarrassing videos my name is Jeremy I'm a personal trainer and kinesiologist what's up guys before I finally found my groove with this current channel where things eventually just took off to where it is today and looking back now at all my old content is all admit it's it's very embarrassing but it just reminds me of the passion I had ever since the beginning for science-based Fitness explaining the whys behind everything I advocate and just providing as much free value as possible to help you the viewer so the thing that this is all led to me now making this video in honor of reaching 1 million subscribers is it's just a truly humbling experience to me and I owe it all to you guys I mean don't get me wrong there's been a lot of ups and downs and stress along the way that I don't really talk about a share but just know that it's your positivity and seeing that I truly am impacting lives through the countless transformations I've received from those following my content or my build with SAS programs that makes everything worth it for me and just motivates me to keep on pushing and keep doing this and just keep getting better and better at what I do I mean I'll be the first to admit that I'm not the biggest I am NOT the leanest I am NOT the smartest and let's face it we all know I'm not the most entertaining guy out there but what I am and always will be is 100% dedicated to providing you as much value as possible with each and every piece of content I put out the fact that 1 million of you have shown your appreciation for that by hitting that subscribe button it truly it truly does mean the world to me so here is a huge and sincere thank you to each and every one of you free support along the way 1 million really is just the beginning but before I end this video one thing you can do to help me out and continue driving this channel forward is just comment below what topics or video series you think a lot of you would like to see covered applying about my concept for the next a little while so I just love to hear some of your ideas anyways that is it for today thank you all so much once again I kind of express my gratitude towards all your support and I see you next time [Music]"

    "published_at": "2021-08-08T15:48:16Z",
    "transcript": "i'm going to show you how to straighten your back posture with five simply and effective exercises we'll cover a few causes go through some corrective exercises and combine this all into a 10-minute routine with instructions by the end of this video you should feel immediate relief and we'll have a 10-minute go-to routine to keep these improvements for life first we need to cover where this back posture came from your body is an adaptation machine in as little as three months of prolonged sitting and standing in hunched over positions your body will adapt to become more efficient at being in that position all day combine this with the fact that we tend to worsen the problem when we work out we focus on training the muscles that we can see in the mirror while neglecting the ones that we can't this leads to a really tight front side that pulls your back forward and a really weak back side that can straighten it out to fix this we're going to use a method that's been proven effective in multiple papers the method is a 10 minute corrective routine that involves two parts part one will focus on mobility exercises to loosen up the back the first exercise will extend the back upright the second will rotate the back and the third will teach your body how to move in this new upright position then in part two to maintain this new posture long term immediately after the mobility we'll use two exercises to activate and strengthen the weakened muscles in our back the routine works either on its own if done consistently at least two to three times a week or even as a warm up right before your upper body workouts as long as you implement it while making an effort to get up and move frequently the rest of the day alrighty so let's dive into the first mobility exercise which is going to help us extend the back upright you're going to get down with your knees underneath your hips and then find yourself either a bench or a couch place your elbows on top of it with your hands together from here take a deep breath into your nose and then as you exhale drop your upper back and head down towards the floor while bringing your hands to the back of your head here you should feel a deep stretch in your upper back and your lats as you do so though avoid excessively arching your lower back instead the stretch comes from your upper back and your lats then from here take another deep breath in and then exhale and see if you can get just a little bit deeper and then from here push your elbows against the bench to open up your shoulder blades and then you're going to come back down for another rep and then repeat this for a total of 10 reps [Music] now we're going to use a rotation exercise to loosen the back even more grab a pillow or foam roller get on all fours with your knees under your hips and your hands under your shoulders and squeeze the pillow or foam roller between your legs this is going to help prevent you from cheating then place one hand behind your head and try to touch your elbow to the opposite wrist continue squeezing the pillow or foam roller as you do so you should feel a deep stretch in your mid-back from here push away from the floor with your planted hand as you rotate your upper back to drive your elbow and head towards the ceiling in this top position you should feel your mid back muscles really working to open up your chest and then come back down to complete your first rep also note that breathing throughout each rep is essential for fully opening up your upper back so make sure to inhale on the way down and exhale on the way up rather than holding your breath repeat this for a total of six reps before switching sides alright so now that our upper back is in a better position from the last two exercises we then want to re-teach you how to stay and move in this new upright posture with the last mobility exercise by the way guys if you want to fix your muscle balance and posture while at the same time lose unwanted fat and build lean muscle our build with science programs will help you do just that within our programs we've developed a system that uses science to transform your body into a lean attractive physique it's worked for thousands of people all over the world if you take a free one minute quiz at builtwithscience.com it's going to ask you a few questions to determine which of our programs will best suit you and your fitness goals i hope to see you in there but for now let's move on to the exercise stand with your legs under your hips squeeze your butt and lightly brace your core take a band and push the band apart with your palms facing away from each other and pink is up if you don't have a band you can use a bed sheet instead with an overhand grip from there bring your arms overhead and down towards your butt and then back overhead to the starting position to complete a rep you should feel a deep stretch in your chest and your upper back muscles working to stabilize your arms repeat this for a total of 10 reps and avoid arching your lower back and sticking out your gut as you do so now that our back is mobilized we need to activate and strengthen our weak back muscles to help us maintain this good posture all right for the first exercise you're going to stand with your feet hip width apart you're going to squeeze your glutes squeeze your core you're gonna take a band put one side behind your neck hold the other side straight out with your arms straight and then what you're gonna do is just drive your elbows apart by squeezing your upper back together you're gonna hold this in position for three seconds and then you can come back and repeat for a total of 10 reps but as you do so you want to avoid arching your lower back as you pull keep that core braced and you also want to avoid shrugging your shoulders up when you do this properly you should feel your mid-back muscles really working you can think as if you wanted to pinch a pencil between your shoulder blades to better activate your mid-back muscles now if you don't have a band you can perform the scarecrow instead place your head on a chair table or significant other's butt for support bend over at your hips and then drive your elbows out and back keeping them at 90 degrees hold that for three seconds without excessively arching your lower back then rotate your hands up as far as you can and hold that in position for another three seconds before coming down and repeating for a total of five reps now we'll add a little bit more difficulty lay down on your stomach squeeze your butt and flatten your stomach against the floor move your arms into a wide position overhead with your thumbs pointing up then lift your hands off the ground by about an inch and then pull your shoulders down and away from your ears from here pull your elbows down towards your hips while squeezing your upper back until your arms form the shape of a w hold this for two seconds you should feel your mid and lower trap muscles in your back working to maintain this position then extend your arms out to the side as you maintain the back tension to create the shape of a t as you do this part you're going to feel yourself fighting the urge to let go of the upper back tension and letting your shoulders shrug up avoid doing so once you get to the t-shape hold this for two seconds and then pull your arms back into the w and then finally slide your hands back up into the y try not to allow your arms and hands to touch the ground and repeat this for a total of six reps okay so now you've got your corrective routine to straighten your back but maybe you need help with other muscle imbalances or maybe you could use some help with losing fat and building the muscle to check out our training and nutrition programs that will help you do just that head over to buildwithscience.com and take our free quiz to find out which of our programs

    "title": "How To Get Bigger Triceps (3 Training Mistakes You\u2019re Probably Making)",
    "published_at": "2018-12-16T16:38:46Z",
    "transcript": "if you're seeking to build big impressive looking arms then there's no doubt that you have to prioritize the triceps this is especially true since they actually make up most of the size of your arms but in order to best grow this muscle you need to pay close attention to how exactly you're performing your triceps exercises and the approach you use to train them for example let's take a look at bob on the left and billy on the right although bob may do the exact same amount of sets and reps as billy does and maybe even lifting more weight than him i can guarantee you that over time billy will see better triceps growth due to the various technical aspects of the movement that he's taking the time to fix and optimize and these fixes may be exactly what you need in order to take your triceps development to the next level therefore in this video i'll go through the most common mistakes people make that hinders triceps growth and more importantly i'll show you exactly how to fix them right away the first and probably the most common mistake is letting other muscles take over and steal tension from the triceps during push-downs for example and the three main culprits for this are the lats shoulders and forearms but luckily these can all be quickly fixed with simple tweaks in your form if you're letting your elbows excessively sway forward and back during the movement then all you're doing is evolving more of the lats since they are mainly responsible for shoulder extension now this isn't necessarily a bad thing but it is something you want to avoid if you want to prioritize triceps development given that this takes tension away from the triceps during the movement so what you want to do instead is lower the weight bring your elbows down to your side and keep them locked and pinned to your side throughout the movement you can now visually see how the triceps take on the majority of the load while the involvement of the lats is minimized letting the forearms take over is a little harder to catch but it's just as common especially when the bar attachment is used and this happens when you flex your wrist as you push the weight down which not only shifts tension away from the triceps but also puts your wrists at a mechanical disadvantage and stresses the elbow joint as well instead you want to keep the wrist in a neutral position relative to your forearms in order to both increase wrist stability and elicit a stronger contraction from the triceps and finally another common error people make is slowly leaning forward and rounding their back as they begin to fatigue or when they use a weight that's too heavy this actually causes the elbows to widen which not only creates a favorable leverage to make each rep easier for you but it also shifts tension away from the triceps and more so onto the shoulders and even the chest instead you want to properly set up by sticking your chest up and out retract your shoulder blades pin your elbows to the side and maintain this position as you perform each rep [Music] another costly yet common mistake is failing to maximize the tension placed on the triceps during your exercises which just comes down to how exactly you perform them for example during lying overhead extensions or skull crushers if you're performing the movement with your arms locked directly overhead then you're not maximizing the tension that's placed on the triceps in fact the triceps experience very little tension at the top part of the movement due to the position that your arms are in relative to gravity so instead applying the findings from this 2006 biomechanical analysis that greater degrees of shoulder elevation provides a greater stretch on the long head of the triceps you want to move your arms slightly back lock your arms here and then proceed to perform your reps this way you provide more stretch on the long head of the triceps and enable the muscle as a whole to be active throughout the whole range of motion and similarly during tricep push downs a lot of people tend to stand too close to the cables with their body position completely upright but with this setup your range of motion is now compromised and becomes limited since your hips get in the way at the bottom position and in addition the tension of the triceps at the bottom becomes minimal due to the direction of the cable relative to the forearm thus leading to a sub-optimal contraction of the triceps especially of the long head so what you want to do instead is very simple just take one or two small steps away from the cable slightly hinge at the hips and then perform the movement with your elbows pinned to your side doing so will slightly increase the range of motion of the exercise and enable the triceps to reach their peak contraction when you're at the bottom position [Music] although isolation exercises for the triceps like the ones previously discussed are great for development there's no doubt that heavy compound pressing exercises will provide the most bang for your buck this is mainly because you're able to overload them more effectively and lift much heavier loads with them when compared to isolation exercises and this is especially important for triceps growth since research indicates that the triceps are composed mostly of type 2 muscle fibers which are theorized to be best stimulated by using heavy weight and two great pressing exercises that you should incorporate and prioritize for these reasons are the close grip bench press and the barbell overhead press the close grip bench press is a great option because as shown in this 2005 paper from the journal of strength and conditioning research the bench press on its own already elicits very high triceps activity but by narrowing your hand spacing you're able to shift more of the load to the triceps and hence produce even greater triceps muscle activity however just note that going too close often does more harm than good so sticking to roughly shoulder-width apart would be the best option to avoid discomfort while still maximizing triceps activation the barbell overhead press is another great exercise you should be prioritizing for triceps development in fact it was shown in this 2013 paper from the journal strength and conditioning research to elicit the greatest triceps activity when compared to other shoulder press variations while also being the exercise where the most weight could be lifted thus proving that if prioritized it will be one of the main contributors to triceps development over time with that being said weighted dips are another great exercise that could definitely be added to this list as well but the main point here is that for the best results start your workouts with heavy movements like these and really strive to progress them over time and then as needed use isolation exercises afterwards to fit in more triceps volume to further stimulate growth by using this approach in combination with the various technique fixes previously discussed i guarantee that you'll begin to see a major difference in your triceps development over time and that's pretty much it for the video these little training tips may not seem like much but trust me they really are what's going to make all the difference in the long run and enable you to progress that much faster and if you're

    "title": "The 4 BEST Supplements To Build Muscle Faster (And How Much They Help) ft. Dr. Brad Schoenfeld",
    "published_at": "2020-11-29T17:00:02Z",
    "transcript": "i remember the very first time i walked into a supplement store i was completely overwhelmed with all the different options but luckily i had the sales rep there right by my side to guide me 10 minutes later and i was set with 400 worth of different supplements that i was promised would get me and i quote absolutely jacked a month later though all i had to show for my investment was an empty wallet fast forward to now and i've learned through research that the vast majority of muscle building supplements out there do absolutely nothing or use and market it totally out of context to take advantage of those who don't know any better that being said there are a handful of supplements that when used properly actually do live up to their claims and can help speed up results in this video i'll cover four such supplements and go through not only how they work but also the results that you can expect from each of them just to give you some realistic expectations protein powder is by far the most widely consumed supplement in the industry whey protein powder in particular has been shown to rank as the highest quality protein source when compared to several other protein sources mainly because of its high leucine content one of the main factors that determines the quality of a protein source but this does not make it some magical muscle building supplement despite what your supplement stores sales rep says protein powder does not seem to directly help you build muscle faster consistently eating enough protein does and you don't need protein powder to get there as whole foods alone can do this for you just fine but for a few reasons protein powder can help you do this more efficiently first off it's typically very low in fat and carbs and instead very high in protein content which makes it very calorie and macro friendly when compared to various other protein sources second it's convenient and can be used in many different ways to both save you time and add some more life into your diet instead of relying on the same boring protein sources every day and lastly it's actually quite affordable when viewed at a price per gram basis with the average cost of whey protein being comparable to that of chicken breast and this all just makes it easier for you to consistently reach the optimal daily protein intake that otherwise can be a struggle to hit which is exactly how protein powder can indirectly speed up your growth in fact one-man analysis showed that in subjects who were ingesting only around 1.2 grams of protein per kilogram of their body weight per day added in 50 grams of protein into their diet mainly through the use of protein powder they experience significantly faster gains in muscle size and strength another meta-analysis found similar results indicating that protein supplementation is generally associated with about a 38 faster gain of muscle and 33 greater increase in strength if you're currently not hitting the optimal protein intake so if you're currently having a hard time getting sufficient quality protein through whole food sources alone then whey protein is definitely a good option to help you reap those extra gains that you're missing out on next is creatine which is probably the most well researched and science-backed supplement on the market so creatine is a substance that's already naturally found in our bodies and how it works is actually very simple whenever we lift weights we use something called atp the main energy source of our muscles as we lift we deplete these atp stores to the point where we fatigue it can no longer perform any more reps or lift the weight up and this is where creatine comes in it improves our strength and muscle endurance by facilitating a faster regeneration of atp and thus ultimately enabling us to perform that extra wrap or two or lift slightly more weight during our workouts in fact a meta-analysis reviewing 22 creatine studies found that creatine supplementation provided a boost of roughly eight percent greater strength and 14 greater risk performed when compared to no supplementation now this doesn't sound like much of a boost but these small gains do add up over time and have been shown to speed up the rate of muscle and strength gains as a result but just be wary that there does seem to be quite a bit of variation with regards to the response to creatine with vegetarians vegans and those who are just naturally low in creatine levels experiencing the most benefit and lastly i just want to emphasize that creatine does not simply do the work for you the benefits that you get from supplementing with it only apply if you're actually pushing yourself harder in your workouts as a result next is caffeine another well-researched and well-known substance that can indirectly speed up our growth research has shown that caffeine ingestion prior to our workouts not only enhances our muscle contractions but can also enable us to perform more reps by altering our pain thresholds and our perception of how hard we're working as for how much of a benefit you can expect a recent analysis found little to no benefit of caffeine ingestion on strength or the amount of weight you're able to lift in an exercise but did find quite a significant and consistent effect on muscular endurance and the number of reps you're able to perform on average caffeine ingestion enabled subjects to perform around two to three more reps per set leading to about a ten to twenty percent boost in their total arrest performed in their workout as a result researchers speculate that these effects likely speed up growth over time due to the increased volume that subjects are able to achieve by ingesting caffeine prior to their workouts however the benefits that we see with caffeine supplementation seem to favor lower body workouts more than upper body workouts likely because they're just generally more strenuous and require more effort and we also see a greater effect when it's used during early morning workouts if you're not accustomed to doing them as well as during workouts where your sleep deprived from a poor night's sleep the night before and one more consideration that you want to take into account is your habitual caffeine intake because those who consume caffeine on a regular basis tend to see somewhat of a blunted response to its ergogenic effects so what i'd recommend to avoid becoming overdependent on the supplement and to avoid developing a caffeine tolerance too quickly is to preserve its use for workouts where you'll reap the most benefit from it so lower body workouts early morning workouts or days where you just need that extra kick are typically going to provide the best opportunity for you to reap the most benefit from caffeine as for dosage most studies found a beneficial effect only when using roughly three to six milligrams of caffeine per kilogram of body weight which can be delivered through a pre-workout supplement coffee or caffeine supplement however do keep in mind that this range is quite high especially if you aren't accustomed to taking caffeine so what i'd recommend is start on the very low conservative end and just increase as needed now here to help us with the last supplement of beta alanine is internationally renowned fitness expert and researcher dr brad schoenfeld who has done a considerable amount of work within the field of supplements in the fitness industry in general so brad aside from the three other supplements that we've previously covered there's actually one more that you'd also add to the list and it's beta alanine would you mind just briefly explaining how exactly the supplement works yeah sure beta alanine is an amino acid and it increases muscle levels of a substance called carnosine and it actually increases carnosine more than taking carnosine itself carnosine is a hydrogen ion buffer and hydrogen ions are acids in the body and you feel that when you get the a burn when that burn starts to build up uh when the hydrogen ions in turn start building up you're gonna it's gonna interfere with your ability to continue training and the buffering effect of carnosine allows you to get additional reps based on the research you've covered um how much of a benefit can you average lift to expect to get in terms of actual performance benefits and additional gains from digging the supplement i would say that from what we have you get an extra couple of reps it might enhance you to enhance your ability and it is specific to higher rep training so training with let's say 10 reps and above if you're doing let's say a set of three reps 3rm it's going to be primarily in your atp system your atp phospho-creating system so it really isn't going to help you in that respect you're not going to get much acidic buildup and thus the buffering doesn't really affect it so when you're training with 10 reps 15 reps 20 wraps that's when you're going to see this benefit to buffering the acids and potentially allowing you to get an additional couple reps and then i guess those additional couple reps would just add up over time in terms of increased volume and then potentially increase muscle growth as a result correct there's really not a lot of longitudinal work to look at it does that actually enhance your muscle building effect but logically that would be the case where if you're able to increase the volume load at a given loading range then it would enhance your ability to build more muscle lastly how exactly does one go about safely taking the supplement to maximize its benefit it takes several weeks usually three to four weeks before its full effects come into play and uh the general consensus from the literature is about four to six grams a day and you'd want to spread out the dosages so it's generally less effective if you're taking one lump sum of let's say if you're taking five grams at once it's better to spread it out into less two or less grams per per serving so let's say three servings of two grams spread out in the morning afternoon and evening the symptoms that you get are the side effects generally you're a tingly sensation and some people kind of like that but it can be i think kind of annoying and spreading out when you're taking it in the larger dosages the effects of the tingling sensation are magnified so when you're spreading out the dosage it will reduce the tingly sensation so hopefully you're able to see that supplements are not magic you still need to put in the work and even then they aren't extremely effective but the little boost that you do get from each of these supplements can add up to a meaningful difference over time especially when you do combine them with the right training and nutrition program and for step-by-step program that uses science to guide you week after week with your training your nutrition and even your supplementation so you can truly maximize your results and simply head on over to buildwithscience.com and take our analysis quiz to discover the best program for you and

    "title": "The 3 WORST (And Best) Chest Exercises For Growth",
    "published_at": "2021-08-01T15:43:08Z",
    "transcript": "in this video i'm going to show you three common chest exercises that are slowing your gains and what you should be doing instead i'm going to give you much more effective options than the common incline bench press dumbbell fly and pinch press to grow your chest start using the exercises we'll cover in this video and you'll be able to grow your chest faster than you ever have before for well-developed chest you need to focus on growing the upper chest it's what fills out your chest and gives it a proportionate look despite this one of the most popular upper chest exercises the incline bench press may be leaving gains on the table because of the angle of the bench and the angle of your elbows in a 2020 study researchers had participants perform the incline bench press at 15 30 45 and 60 degrees and measured how active different parts of the chest and shoulder were what they found is that activation of the upper chest was maximized at a bench angle of about 30 degrees which is shown here at angles higher than this the front delts began to take over whereas upper chest activation began to decrease in addition to this although reducing the bench angle from 30 degrees down to about 50 degrees shown here resulted in a very small decrease in activation of the upper chest it did provide a major boost in the activation of the middle and lower parts of the chest these results suggest that contrary to common practice to target the upper chest you don't need a very high bench check at all so where does this leave the incline bench press unfortunately most incline benches are preset at too high of an angle of about 30 degrees with some even as high as 45 degrees so a good alternative is to use one of my personal favorites that i include in all of my built with science programs a low incline double press set to roughly 15 degrees which is generally the first or second notch up on the bench we're using dumbbells instead of barbells here as well because several muscle activation papers have found that keeping the elbows tucked to 45 degrees as you press helps significantly increase upper chest activity and since with dumbbells you can adjust your wrist position to whatever feels best rather than being locked into the barbell you're able to achieve this elbow angle without stressing your joints as a fan of arnold i used to love the dumbbell fly it wasn't until i learned more about the science behind the chest involvement during the dumbbell fly that i realized there was a better option so the dumbbell fly seems a great option because it really does isolate the chest but it only really works the chest at the bottom position when your arms are fully extended to your sides but as soon as you pass this bottom position the chest becomes less and less involved which is less effective for overall chest growth in fact once you reach the top position there's virtually no tension placed in the chest you can hang around here all day that being said we still want to do some kind of fly movement for our chest we're going to do that by making one big change to your flies that will keep constant tension on your chest and work it through its full range of motion keep the bench but move it upright and place it between two cables that are set at about the height of your chest grab the handles sit between them and perform your flies there if you don't have cables handy you can mimic a similar setup by wrapping a band around your hands and performing the dumbbell fly like so this will help keep a little bit of tension on the chest throughout the whole movement all right by the way guys hopefully by now you're seeing the importance of not only choosing the right exercises but actually doing them properly as well i know that's what makes all the difference and that's exactly why within my build science programs i've taken the time to not only carefully pick out each exercise that's included in your routine but i've also made in-depth instructional videos for how to perform each of those exercises for the most benefit so for example i'm just in the program right now i'm going to pull up one of the tutorials for pull-ups and as you can see it's all the little details that we cover in these tutorials that make all the difference and it's how thousands of our members have been able to go from stuck not seeing results to completely transforming their bodies in a matter of months take the quiz over at buildwithscience.com i hope to see you in there but for now let's move on to the next chest exercise an instagram famous chest exercise is this squeezy pushy thing that i'm just gonna call the pinch press and it's where you either grab a plate between your hands or two dumbbells and you squeeze it together and then bring your arms out and in it's typically used to target more of the inner chest now don't get me wrong when you do this exercise you will feel your chest activating quite well but the problem here is that all the chest is doing is keeping the weight squeezed together this type of contraction on the chest is what's called an isometric contraction which isn't very effective for building muscle the front delts and triceps are what's actually moving the weight out and in and are benefiting more from this exercise than the chest is so what can you do instead well a good spot for this exercise is the cross body press using either a machine or cable this is still going to allow you to get the same strong activation and squeeze on the chest as you get with the pinch press but by using your chest to push the weight away from you rather than just holding the weight in place you'll now be providing your chest with the right type of contraction to grow the performance exercise as opposed to getting set up to push your arms in front of your body you're going to get set up at a 90 degree angle so that you can push across your body one arm at a time and if you don't have a machine handy you can do the same thing with the cable by putting a handle attachment on and pushing across your body this can be done with the band as well all right so now you've got some new chest exercises but maybe you need help with improving your bench press form or maybe you need some help growing your shoulders you can click somewhere here to do those videos to check out my training programs you can head to buildwithscience.com and take our free quiz to find the best plan for your body thanks for watching and see you next time"

    "title": "How To Build Muscle WITHOUT Lifting Heavier (5 Science-Based Hacks)",
    "published_at": "2020-05-24T16:25:48Z",
    "transcript": "when it comes to building muscle we all know the importance of progressive overload if we can go from curling 20 pound dumbbells for 8 reps to now curling 40 pound dumbbells for 8 reps with all things being equal your arms will be considerably bigger as a result of that progressive overload well most of us fail to realize is that progressive overload is not limited to just adding more weight to an exercise by definition it simply means doing more than you've done before which just places greater tension on your muscles over time and that's what causes them to grow and there's a variety of ways to accomplish this to continue stimulating it and maximizing growth but without the need to add all more weight which can be beneficial if you have various equipment limitations or if you just tend to experience joint aches and pains once you do start working with heavier weight and so in this video I'll show you five ways that you can do just that and continue maximizing growth without having to lift any heavier the first thing we can do to stimulate more growth without any more weight is to vary our repetition duration or in other words or lifting tempo which simply represents how fast or how slow we perform our reps because by simply slowing down our reps our muscles will now experience greater time under tension to stimulate more growth even though we haven't added any additional weight however there is a threshold beyond which slowing down the speed of your lifts has a detrimental effect on hypertrophy because in the event that you do go too slow during your reps although your muscles do experience far greater time under tension you're gonna pay the price in terms of fully activating the motor units of your target muscle in fact research has shown that reducing the tempo down to a slow with 10 seconds per rep so for example 5 seconds up and then 5 seconds down resulted in a 36 percent decrease in chest activation when done in the bench press I would likely lead to diminish growth as a result and this is why research suggests that a lifting tempo of roughly 0.5 to 3 seconds for the concentric and eccentric portions of your reps is best for growth wish to be honest if you think about is quite a wide leeway with respect to how fast you can lift I mean if you think about it most of us likely take just about a second on the way up and the way down of each read meaning that instead of adding more weight to an exercise you can simply slow your reps down considerably in order to listen more tension on the muscle without compromising its activation and hand stimulate more growth without the need for added weight another way that we can build more muscle without having to add more load is by using the same load and performing the same amount of reps but with more efficiency meaning that you're lifting the same load but now with better form more control and with better activation of the target muscle because to be honest many of us lie to ourselves and we pretend that we've gotten stronger on our movements but instead we've just gotten sloppier with our execution I mean I've been guilty of this on countless occasions and I'm sure many of you have as well so with someone like the bench press or even push-ups if you went from performing let's say 10 reps at a certain load to now performing those same 10 reps with the same load but now with better form and a better mind to muscle connection with your chest that for muscle growth that is just as effective since the target muscle will still experience an increase in tension comparable to if you would have added more weight to the movement the next thing we can do is shorten the rest periods that we take between our sets because if we can go from performing let's say a dumbbell shoulder press for 10 reps a certain weight with 3 minutes of rest in between sets to now performing the same reps in the same weight but now just two minutes of rest in between sets will now again be able to stimulate more growth without the need to add more load due to the added metabolic stress your shoulders are going to experience from the short and rest times however at the same time we don't want to shorten the rest half to the point where our volume and our reps perform suffer and decrease significantly as a result as this is going to counteract the benefits of the added metabolic stress that we get from the short and rest periods and based on the currency of the research it seems that for your main compound movements in the gym and even compound bodyweight movements like pull-ups and hard sets of push-ups for example you typically would not want to decrease your rest times to shorter than 2 minutes between sets if you want to maximize growth whereas for isolation movements like curls for example you have a only way and can decrease your rest periods they're down to even just 60 to 90 seconds as these movements don't show the same decrements and performance from shorter rest periods as compound exercises do another thing that we can do is alter the range of motion of our exercises because we know based on research that for the most part performing our exercises with a full range of motion tends to lead to greater growth which is true for many exercises like the squat benchpress pull-ups and push-ups for example and a people form these various exercises with the same amount of weight yet simply increase the range of motion of the exercise you can effectively increase both the stretch and the time under tension that your muscle experiences during each rep and as a result stimulate more growth without having to add in the additional load for instance instead of adding ten pounds to your squat another option to stimulate more growth will be to simply squat an inch or two deeper during each of your reps or instead of trying to add more weight to your push-ups you can instead perform them as a deficit by stacking your hands on dumbbells or stack of books if you get creative with it there are countless ways that you can apply this concept to all your exercises to take them past their usual range of motion limits and as a result increase the muscle growth stimulus without having to add more weight as I've explained in past videos it's been shown on numerous occasions the lifting light weights with a higher rep range builds comparable muscle growth as heavier weights with a lower rep range do as long as you're taking each set close enough to failure so rather than adding more weight to a movement we can instead just simply increase the number of reps that we perform per set to get the same effect as for how high reps ago there is a threshold to this which seems to be right around 30 reps or so meaning that if you're working with a certain weight you have the freedom to increase the number of reps that you perform with that weight all the way up to 30 reps per set before you want to then either add more weight or overload the movement further by using another one of the tips that I covered in this video in order to continue maximizing growth so as for how to best implement these five methods what I'd recommend is always start with efficient before moving on to the other methods so for example let's say that you can perform 3 sets of 15 reps of a way to push up and you're now ready to overload it to stimulate some more growth to do so you should first start by aiming to perform those 3 sets of 15 reps with better form and with better activation of your chest and only once you nail that down should you then move on to the various other methods I discussed to make the movement even more difficult but while still ensuring that your form and your efficiency don't get compromised as a result all in all though guys tension is tension and your muscles can't tell whether you apply that extra tension on your muscle by lifting heavier or by using some of the methods that I went through in this video and although there doesn't come a point where it just becomes more convenient to overload your movements by adding more weight I hope you're able to see that nonetheless there still are many viable ways so you can continue simulating growth without the need to lift heavier and for a step by step all in one program that shows you exactly how to train an e to build muscle and lean down most effectively with sides then simply head on over to built with science comm and take the analysis quiz to discover what program is best for you and where your body is currently at and again guys I do have the recently launched home workout programs up and running on the site as well so regardless of what equipment you may or may not have right now you'll be able to

    "title": "How To Build MORE Muscle With Home Workouts (4 Science-Based Methods)",
    "published_at": "2020-05-03T15:03:40Z",
    "transcript": "one of the biggest challenges with home workouts is that if we don't have the right equipment or access to a good amount of weights then it becomes increasingly difficult to get the same level of muscle stimulation and growth that we get at the gym with heavy weights and if you're not a complete beginner anymore and instead have some training experience under your belt then this can become even more problematic if you're seeking to maintain or even continue building muscle at home or whenever you're limited in terms of your equipment why exactly is this the case though well there's one main reason why training in the gym with heavier weights is typically quote unquote superior for muscle growth when compared to home workouts and that has to do with something called mechanical tension which we know is the main driver of muscle growth now in order to maximize mechanical tension and the resulting growth from an exercise you need to be able to recruit as many muscle fibers in your muscle as possible as you perform that exercise and the beauty about having access to heavier weights in the gym is that you're able to maximally activate your muscle fibers by simply performing a relatively challenging set of 8 to 12 reps for example whereas if you're just training with your body weight or lighter weights then you aren't eliciting nearly as much tension on your muscles as you are with heavier weights and as a result your muscle fibers won't become fully recruited unless you really push to take your sets to near failure by performing a ton of reps and even then research has shown that if the weight of resistance used just isn't challenging enough and your rep range per set gets too high as a result then muscle growth will be compromised however don't lose hope as there are a couple solutions to this because although it does become more difficult to fully activate our muscles with lighter weights there are ways that we can manipulate our sets and exercises to ensure that we're still able to fully stimulate our muscles without having to do a ridiculous number of reps every single set and on a similar note although as i mentioned earlier mechanical tension is a primary driver of muscle growth metabolic stress is another pathway for growth that we can now take advantage of and emphasize in several ways and in this video that's exactly what i'll show you how to do with four science-based methods that when properly applied will enable you to build muscle more effectively with your home workouts the first method is something called overcoming isometrics a brutal home workout method that was first brought to my attention by coach eugene teo all you need is a towel and a box of tissues to wipe the tears off your face after the screaming sets but basically here's how it works let's say you're about to perform a set of banded or lightweight squats that wouldn't typically challenge you as much as squats in the gym with heavyweights would what you can do to compensate for this is first perform a squat isometric before you go into your set so simply wrap a towel or bed sheet under your feet and wrap it around each of your hands then use your legs to push up with maximal effort against the immovable resistance and keep this up for 20-30 seconds you can even elevate your heels onto books to increase the demands placed on the quads then after you just can't stand it anymore immediately go right into your set of lightweight squats chances are you're not going to be able to perform nearly as many reps as you normally would be able to as a result of the added fatigue and metabolic stress in the legs from that overcoming isometric we did prior this isn't just limited to squats you could perform this before any lighter leg exercise you do at home and can even perform these overcoming isometrics with other muscle groups as well for example before your lateral raises you can perform a shoulder isometric like so before your biceps curls you can perform a biceps isometric like so and before your back movements you can perform a back rowing isometric like so it works for virtually every one of your muscle groups and is just an effective way of ensuring that you're able to activate all of your muscle fibers and accumulate more metabolic stress during your sets with lighter weights in order to boost the growth you experience from those sets next is a method that has to do with how we go about executing our sets and is something called rest pause sets which when compared to traditional sets over a period of six weeks have been shown to provide a slight benefit to muscle growth especially for the lower body and the researchers suggest this is because rest pause sets help us push closer to failure during our exercises and also boost the level of metabolic stress that we experience in our sets and how it works is as follows so traditionally what we do with our sets is we perform a set of 10 reps for example then rest for a couple minutes then proceed to our next set rest again and then proceed to our last set if we're doing a total of let's say three sets with rest pause sets however what you do instead is basically perform just one extended set instead of three total sets so you perform your first set until failure or close enough to it and then jot down how many reps you got in this case let's say you got 20 reps then you would stop and rest for just 20 seconds and then go right back into the exercise and again take it as close to failure as you can and note down how many reps you got there then you keep repeating the short rest and work cycle until you manage to match the number of reps you got in your first set so in this case 20. the benefit of executing your sets in this fashion is not only that it saves time but for many individuals it mentally pushes you to get closer to true failure than you would have otherwise while considerably boosting the metabolic stress in your muscles both of which being important for muscle growth especially when working with lighter weights now i wouldn't typically advise you to perform your heavy compound movements in the gym in this fashion as it does get risky and counterproductive there but for home workouts where you're limited to lighter weights and minimal equipment it's a viable way to increase the difficulty of your sets and the growth you experience as result the next method has to do with boosting the activation of your muscles during your chest because although we may not be able to add more weight to an exercise to provide more attention to the muscles we can instead increase the demands of the muscle by mindfully squeezing the target muscle as hard as possible both during and even in between each rep depending on the exercise what this does is it helps elicit a little bit more metabolic stress fatigue and tension to that muscle in order to signal it to get bigger despite using the same load and in fact illustrating the power of this method is a 2016 study which had subjects perform curls with one of their arms with no weight and were instead instructed to contract their biceps as hard as possible in a curling motion for four sets of 20 reps three times a week whereas in the other arm they use the weight equivalent to 70 percent of their one rep max and perform that for four sets of eight to twelve reps three times a week after six weeks the researchers measured the growth in each of their arms and found that both subjects experience the same amount of growth and as stated by the researchers the high levels of muscle activation in the biceps produced from the repeated strong contractions seem to provide sufficient stimulation of their muscles for growth even when no weight was used now although these were untrained subjects it still goes to show you the potential power of forcefully contracting your target muscles as you train them especially when you're limited to just lighter weights so what i'd suggest is with something like curls rather than just mindfully curling the weight up focus instead on contracting your biceps as hard as possible as you do so for something like split squats or dumbbell squats focus on squeezing the quads forcefully throughout your squat and at the top position between each rep what you'll notice is that when properly applied to your various exercises you're not going to be able to do nearly as many reps as you could do previously due to the heightened level of fatigue and metabolic stress in your target muscle which will as a result lead to better growth from both sets the fourth and final method is to combine the various equipment you have available because odds are most of you have light weights and some kind of bad laying around at home and although the light weights on their own may not be challenging enough for growth by throwing a band into the mix it now becomes increasingly challenging to the point where you're now able to fatigue your muscles to a greater degree despite using lighter weights and the added benefit about using baths to accomplish this is that they complement the resistance curve of many of your exercises very well by providing a progressively increasing resistance to provide resistance in parts of the exercises where they normally would be none so get creative with it and implement bands wherever you can for example here's how you can do so with weighted squats [Music] here's how you can do so with split squats here's how you can do so with a dumbbell floor press [Music] and here's how you can do so with a romanian deadlift remember tension is tension and your muscles are going to respond and grow in the same way regardless of whether you add more tension with a band or add more tension by using heavier weight so as an action plan for you what i'd recommend is experiment with implementing some of these methods into your home workouts as you see fit especially in exercises where you're quite limited in terms of your equipment and struggling to make them challenging enough on your muscles and if you're feeling up to the challenge or just have a weird thing for pain feel free to even combine all four of these methods into your sets just please make sure you have a kleenex handy but hopefully you're able to see that regardless of how limited you are with your home workouts there are ways that you can manipulate the way in which you perform them in order to increase the level of growth that you experience from them and on that note i do have an exciting announcement as i've just launched my homework out program bundle that consists of a dumbbell only program a resistance band only program and a body weight only program they're all designed so that regardless of what equipment you may or may not have available you can continue maximizing results and building muscle while working out at home and for a limited time only given this crazy time in our lives i've decided that with the purchase of any of my main built with science gym based programs i'll be throwing in this three program homework go bundle in for free just so that you can use these home workout programs for the time being and then seamlessly transition to the gym based programs once gyms reopen if you wish to do so and to find out which program will be best for you simply head on over to buildwithscience.com and take the analysis quiz which will guide you to the best program for your body and where you're currently at anyways that's it for today thank you so

    "title": "FIX Forward Head Posture! (Daily Corrective Routine)",
    "published_at": "2017-12-03T17:07:53Z",
    "transcript": "what's going on guys is Jeremy here back with another video and today we're going to be talking about forward head posture which is something that is honestly becoming a lot more prominent nowadays due to increased technology use and time spent sedentary and we usually see this posture associated with rounding of the shoulders and rounding of the upper back and this isn't always a case but regardless we need to address the issue of what's happening at the neck because it's thinking forward of the head causes a considerable increase in the amount of pressure that is placed on your spine and over time this can lead to neck pain breathing problems and a lot more serious health issues and you're also just going to look healthier taller and just overall more confident when you get this posture corrected ideally if you were to draw a straight line down from the top of your head down to your hips everything should be aligned like so instead of your head protruding forward and the reason your head does this is one due to weakened muscles mainly the deep cervical flexors that are supposed to keep your head in this neutral position and too overactive and tight muscles that are causing your head to protrude forward so what you need to do to fix this is stretch the muscles that are tight and strengthen the muscles that are weak which has actually been shown in clinical studies like this one by Butler at Elle to be a very effective method in correcting forward head posture if properly implemented in this video I'm going to show you guys a daily routine that you can use consisting of stretches for the tight muscles strengthening exercises for the weak muscles and tips to prevent your forward head posture from coming back or worsening the three main muscles we need to focus on stretching and releasing are the sternocleidomastoid the anterior scalenes and the suboccipital as a result of hours of looking down at our phones or computer every day these muscles become stuck in a shortened position which creates the forward head posture that you see the first stretch is going to lengthen the sternocleidomastoid you can do this either sitting or standing but make sure that you keep your back straight and neck in line with your spine as you perform the stretch to stretch the left side using your left hand to press your chest a little bit to create some traction rotate your head to the opposite side and then bring your head all the way back until you feel a stretch you should feel a nice pull in the front of neck hold this for 30 to 60 seconds or 10 deep breaths and then switch to the other side the second stretch is very similar but is going to target the anterior scalenes to stretch the left side use your left hand to depress your chest bring your right ear to the right shoulder then rotate your head to the left and then point your chin up towards the ceiling again you should feel a nice stretch in the front of your neck hold this for 30 to 60 seconds or 10 deep breaths and then switch to the other side the third muscle we're going to target are these sub occipital which are located in the back of the neck we are going to release them by using a tennis ball or lacrosse ball and placing the ball on one side of the back of the neck while lying on the ground and tucking the chin up and down you can hold the ball with your other hand to prevent it from slipping do this for about 10 deep breaths on each side now we are going to work on strengthening weakened muscles in our neck which is just as important as stretching the tighten muscles as we previously did for this we are going to use chin tucks which active both strengthen the weakened muscles and lengthen the tight ones to start do these while lying on your back with your knees bent like so tuck your chin by activating the muscles below your chin in the front of your neck and hold this for a second or two and repeat think about trying to give yourself a double chin and you can also use two fingers to guide and cue your chin through the movement perform about 15 reps of these once these get easy for you you can progress it by just very slightly lifting your head off the floor by a centimeter and then performing the chin tucks with your head elevated again focus on activating the muscles in the front of your neck which you should feel working throughout the movement and these don't necessarily have to be performed just on the ground they can be done sitting or standing with your back straight against a wall or even when you're driving or just standing throughout the day try to get around 30 to 40 reps of these throughout the day now finally in addition to these exercises you need to be aware of your neck alignment throughout the day and during lifts you perform in the gym when sitting or working on the computer always try to keep your head and neck in a neutral position with your back and when it comes to exercises in the gym something I see a lot is sticking the head forward during every rep especially during pressing and pulling movements this is only going to worsen your head position over time so be aware of this and instead keep your head aligned with your back during all of your lifts instead of protruding it forward so to sum the video up here is a sample routine that you can use ideally two to three times every day when it comes to postural Corrections frequency is the most important factor so try to do these at least a couple times a day and you'll start to see improvements in your posture very quickly that's pretty much it for the video guys I hope you enjoyed it and found it useful if you did like the video of them please don't forget to give the video a like share it around with some friends who you think would benefit from this and also don't forget to subscribe to my channel for more content and don't forget to turn notifications on for my channel as well I would really appreciate all that and one thing to keep in mind guys is that this posture took literally hundreds of hours to develop so it's not something that's just going to fix itself overnight but if you adhere to as they consistent with the routine that I mentioned in this video then you're going to see a lot of major improvements really quickly however that being said forward head posture more often than not is a company with upper cross syndrome or rounding of the shoulders and the upper back so if you guys are struggling with that as well and I highly suggest that you check out this video that I made on that topic as I think you guys will find really useful anyways that's it for this video guys I will see you next time [Music]"

    "title": "Best VS Worst Fat Loss Exercises (Ranked By Science)",
    "published_at": "2024-06-23T13:30:09Z",
    "transcript": "what are the best and worst exercises for fat loss today my friend Kevin and I are putting on the world's most accurate calorie truck and together we're going to rank 50 different exercises at the end we'll reveal one as the most effective fat loss exercise but we'll also discover which exercises burn the most calories with the least effort and which ones are high effort but don't actually burn very many calories using these bindings I'll create the perfect Fat Loss plan guarant to help you shred body fat starting off with what all the data tells me is the most effective for calorie burning high intensity training beginning first with 60 seconds of Sprints go because of workouts are so intense Kevin was already starting to feel it before the 60 seconds were finished that was brutal your hurry went up to 185 I go to that water fountain over there for the dogs and  first exercise done I'm a little word for Kevin we're asking a lot for him today but he's a champ in case you're wondering Kevin is a programmer here at bill with science and he's currently working towards his own fat loss Journey my hope is that doing these workouts together will give me the data I need to help Kevin optimize his fat loss Journey next up were 60 seconds of burpees and then 60 seconds of mountain climbers as fast as you can just like with a Sprint Kevin was struggling to make it the full 60 seconds keep go keep go I remember why I hated those so much with three exercises down Sprints had taken an early lead at an average of 15 calories burned per minute and burpees coming in second with an average of 12.5 now these values were lower than I expected but we'll explain why that is later on but so far all three exercises have been exhausting how would you rank your perceived exertion on burpees on a 1 to 10 scale 10 11 how about on the Sprints 12 10 10 10 for me the Sprints were like eight or nine the burpees were like they exceeded the scale so if I want to help Kevin build a program that burns a ton of calories without feeling like he's dying we're going to have to keep searching fortunately we still have 47 exercises left the test that's good as we continue testing high-intensity exercises the data showed we were burning through our calories but just like with the previous exercises training at high intensity it's not easy I would not I would not choose this and with Kevin still struggling to make it through some of the exercises I had to find a way to continue pushing him to collect the best data possible so as I finished my circuit on the assault bike I decided to make Kevin an offer he couldn't refuse if you can beat my total of 34 calories in a minute I'll give you $500 I'm okay with not let's go now some of you data nerds may be wondering how the assault bike could tell me I burned 34 calories in a minute when the best exercise we tested so far didn't even burn half of that well that's why we're relying on the pooi mask for all of our data basically it measures the amount of oxygen we use and the carbon dioxide release and it combines us with our heart rate to get the exact number of calories we're burning so while Kevin was catching up to my 34 calorie total I was skeptical about the accuracy for more insight I reached out to Dr Eric Helms a pearl bodybuilder and host of the mass research review YouTube channel cardio machines are really a bit of a black box there is some equation that goes in there it's definitely not like a peer-reviewed equation and it's certainly not going to be as accurate as gas exchange like you're measuring with the masks the only way that I would use the energy expenditure on a cardio machine is if you're comparing a previous session on that same machine entering the same measurements as a relative difference if you burned 30 on that machine last time and this time you burned 60 you probably did about twice as much work but beyond that I wouldn't put much stock into those values even though I learned you can't always trust a cardio machine's calorie tracker for this challenge a deal is a [Music] deal don't pass out don't pass out don't pass out all right Kevin gets a fat bonus I was not expecting that instead of 34 plus calories per minute we actually burned around 12 and 13 and to avoid skewing results we'd make sure to wait for our heart rates to return to Baseline before moving on to the next exercise but when I checked in on Kevin I realized we had a problem all right let's get Kevin out of his death bed got tap out of that you're going to tap out yeah I'm going to tap out of that turned out that even though I had tried to select the most optimized workout for fat loss nearly every exercise so far was leaving Kevin absolutely exhausted and that's no way to sustain a program which means we're going to have to find a new approach low intensity exercise first up incline walking so we started with 3 mph and a two incline which burned around 6 calories per minute oh this is so nice coming bumping the speed up to 3.5 in the incline up to six led to a pretty impressive 30% jump in calorie burn but you know how people at the gym tend to lean on the cardio machines or hold on to the rails when incline walking yeah so we tested that next and it dro the calorie burn by 20% Which aligns with the findings of a 2014 study that tested the exact same thing if you are leaning on the treadmill unloading some of your mass you're essentially reducing your body weight then you're basically only walking with the part of your body is where does that sounds and therefore burning fewer calories so much easier but what's true of all of our walk-in was that Kevin was able to get through without feeling like he was going to collapse which meant the switch to low intensity training was definitely a step in the right direction longboarding an activity I love doing as a kid was winning in my calorie battle for low intensity exercise burning an oppressive 11 calories per minute beating the elliptical stair master and other forms of cardio that I just don't really enjoy and although Kevin didn't feel comfortable hopping on the board basketball was working out really well for him and it looked like he was having fun doing it so I think the first thing you want to do is establish do you have the fitness level that high-intensity training is on the table if yes do you enjoy it great if you enjoy it equally to a moderate intensity then you can choose when you want to do it based upon your time availability if you don't enjoy it don't do it for me it always comes down to what's practical what's sustainable and do they have the fitness level so it's not a potential risk of doing this very high intensity activity and time you're dude getting easier man to and after catching our second wind with low intensity we moved into strength training to find out how it Compares a cardio surprisingly unless the weights got really heavy strength training was burning significantly less calories in cardio not to mention we could just barely make it to a minute on most exercises he strength training is even higher intensity than many forms of quote unquote high-intensity cardio it's so high intensity that instead of going all right I'm going to go a minute on 2 minute off like you might with cardio you're typically doing 5 to 12 reps which is going to take less than a minute that's typically going to be completed in 20 to 30 seconds and if you're training to failure then you may need to rest you know 1 2 or 3 minutes before you can then perform at your best afterwards you're spending more time resting during a weight training workout than you are actually lifting weights so weight training is great for maintaining muscle mass and ensuring that the weight you lose is primarily body fat but it's not a great tool for a fat loss itself from an energy expenditure perspective we also tested ABS exercises like crunches which ended up burning the fewest calories of all the exercises we've tested so far at this rate you'd have to do 17 hours worth of crunches to burn the calories equivalent of 1 lb of fat after our first day of testing it felt like I had pretty much everything I needed to create the perfect fat loss workout plan to help Kevin until I presented some of that data to Eric I think an important perspective for the viewer is that if they go in and they absolutely crush it with say a bunch of interval work for 45 minutes three times per week the impact of that will be a whole lot less than if they say went from having 3 to 4,000 steps per day being relatively sedentary up to getting 7 to 9,000 steps per day the latter would have a far greater impact on their total daily energy expenditure and their ease of getting into a calorie deficit and seeing sufficient successful weight loss over time than those three 45 minute allout sessions talking to Eric I realized that just testing exercise to creating an optimized workout wasn't going to be enough it turns out what we do outside of the gym can have a far greater effect when it comes to fat loss and to find out just how much I had to keep testing that means testing every chore activ video you can do with your free time whether it's vacuuming reading or folding the laundry and starting right off with standing just simply standing as for cabin he was going through the same circuit of test downstairs testing average calories burn standing sitting sitting while fidgeting and sitting while playing a video game right Kev that's a Mane no I'm burning calories man [Music] and Not only was I earning boyfriend of the Year award by taking care of all the housework I was finally starting to build a clear picture of all the ways you can maximize calorie burn through the course of the day for example just walking outside Burns an impressive 6 calories per minute for Kevin although that's almost a third of what he burned doing sprints I'm pretty sure he'd much rather go for a 30-minute walk than suffer through 10 minutes of Sprints two one that was hard burpees or dishes Jeremy dishes all day every day but the one thing I still haven't found in our testing was a high calorie burning exercise that Kevin actually enjoyed so I started searching online to find other exercises that claim to burn a shocking number of calories in hopes of finally finding one that's a great fit for Kevin's training beginning first with boxing medicine ball slams and power walking at least one foot on the ground all times just try to go as fast as you can I guess you just look like a bunch of angry moms out there you know what's incredible how much Burns off energy is playing chess can burn up to 6,000 calories a day while playing in a tournament okay so I don't actually know how to play chess but to testa's claim Kevin and I will be playing a game of high stakes Checkers remember the $500 I lost challenging Kevin on the assault bike well now we're going double or nothing if Kevin beats me again he's getting ,000 bonus so I do not want to lose are you sure about that one I don't know but since this could take a while let's take a look at some other tests so we'll just go right to the single leg burpies what the turn to Tik Tok that's one of the highest calorie burners but we'll see so what was the actual calorie burn from Kettle bu Wings well not anywhere close to some of the other special EXT exercises we tested but what can you expect taking advice from Tik Tok anyways just like the assault bike challenge the Checker match was neck and neck with Kevin once again getting the best of me as for the calorie burn although my brain probably wasn't working quite as hard as a master chess player it didn't burn nearly as much as I anticipated 2.2 calories per minute just a touch higher than S I have no doubt that um being intensely intellectually active burns more more calories than say just chilling you probably burn more calories playing chess than listening to Joe Rogan I'm sure the uh the first is a lot more intellectually challenging and stimulating but I don't think it's probably as high as 6,000 calories a day if I had to guess and even though I was now $1,000 poorer than when I started the challenge I had all the data I needed from each exercise including a shocking first place exercise to reveal to Kevin what exercise do you think burned the most calories well OB obiously like burpees I don't want to be number one like any any of the burpees I don't care what you tell me if it was the highest I I still wouldn't do them so your number one alltime highest calorie burning exercise was boxing oh wow that's surprised me too boxing and you said you had some fun doing it right I think it was fun it just felt like we were like goofing off at that point in fact Kevin and I had the same top three sprinting boxing and the devil's press burn more calories than any other exercise and although Sprints when average up between us came out as number one boxing was the one that burned the most calories compared to our perceived exertion which is enough to make it the winner in my books as for the low intensity exercises that still burn a surprising amount of calories long boarding shooting hoops and even just plain old walk-in worked great so depending on your conditioning you can pair any of these exercises with consistent strength training and you should be well on your way to losing fat cuz ultimately it's about finding the workouts that you enjoy and can stick with in the long run and thankfully that's exactly what we were able to find for Kevin though maybe we could use a coach now in the description box down below I posted a link to a list of all 50 exercises ranked from highest to lowest based on calorie bir while finding the right workout plan is a great first step to tr succeed in your fat loss Journey you can't neglect your nutrition and that's why

    "title": "Steroids vs Natural: 100 Day Transformation",
    "published_at": "2024-10-06T13:00:57Z",
    "transcript": "steroids versus Naturals does a Natty lifter really stand the chance to find out I've set up an experiments Brandon will train naturally using my science back strategies hit the head hit the head while Todd is hopping on steroids over the next 100 days we'll track their progress to see who comes out on top holy dude first we need starting points and to get the best data possible we're not only using dexa scans to measure overall fat and muscle mass but we're also getting ultrasounds across all major muscle groups to know exactly where each person experiences the most growth so on day one Todd is coming in at 183 lb and 19% body fat while Brandon weighs only 148 lb but scores a lean 13.6% body fat now compared to Todd we actually have two major advantages first off Brandon is lean which means we can focus on gaining weight to maximize growth whereas Todd an aspiring bodybuilder will soon begin dieing down for his competition second while Brandon isn't a complete beginner he's not as serious of a lifter as Todd in normal circumstances this means Todd would build muscle about three times slower than Brandon but these aren't normal circumstances and I'll need to use every science-based tool I know to help Brandon supercharges train it okay so the main thing I'm seeing instead of your forearms keeping in like this going to keep them out 90\u00b0 angle controlling the way down into that stretch because I'm seeing so many new lifters immediately hop on gear I want to prove you don't need steroids to make amazing progress and to help Brandon maximize his growth with his training I'm going to be choosing exercises that challenge his muscles most in the stretch for example back in 2022 researchers compared normal push Downs to overhead tricep extensions which provide a deeper stretch the result overhead extensions grew the triceps 1.4 times faster so with Brandon we're choosing exercises that maximize the challenge in this stretch position across all his major muscle groups gone control all the way down full stretch Todd should be scared but that's not going to be enough we need to combine these exercises with my second science based principle let's go what was that teaching Brandon how to actually train to failure every single rep closer to failure on average it leads to more growth right so if you're stopping once you can't get up here and you're racking it like you have so much more I want you to keep going as far as you can even if it's just half reps and then I want you to shrug your mid traps together one more shrug one more shrug and Todd's done let's go that is a good set that's T training with Jeremy is extremely hard like five times as painful soz I'm doing like five six reps more than I would usually do and like all the the exercises he gave me was hardest in this fresh position which is the most painful as well were your optimism levels about keep eating now more optimistic I've seen Todd before and he's already like a big guy and trains really hard but Jeremy being there pushing me and telling me to do like partials at the end keep going definitely more optimistic now there you go good how' that feel does not feel good feels great but while I was pushing Brandon with his workouts Todd's chemical Hat's body was now performing at a completely different level than it used to how long would you say like a workout is for you generally one one and a half in to 2 hours 2 hours 2 hours yeah wow was that like that before as well or before is only one so once steroids make their way into your muscle cells they bind to a powerful Androgen receptor once bound they alter your muscle genetics to dramatically increase the rates of protein synthesis and recovery so all though it pushed Brandon's workout volume and intensity to his natural limit let's go up it's feeling kind of heavy today not only does every workout Todd do now lead to more muscle growth but he can also train longer and harder than Brandon yet still be able to recover from it but how much of a difference will this all make after 100 days well based on prior research beginner natural lifters can expect to put on about 3.7 lbs of muscle after 100 days of hard training enhanced lifters however gain muscle about three times faster resulting in over 13 pounds of muscle gain within a similar time period after just 30 days I was already witnessing just how powerful steroids really are holy dude Todd had already added 2 cm to his shoulders as for Brandon about the same 16 but despite all the progress Todd was seeing there was still one person who wasn't s satisfied with his results I feel like I'm a skinny I'm small fat and skinny that's why I am I don't have like I don't I don't look big I don't I'm not sure maybe just body this Mor we or something like that see not enough never enough so Jeremy recommended that I eat around 3,000 calories a day I generally have a pretty hard time putting on Sid so I'm hoping this new nutrition plan really helps now while Todd definitely had us beat the first month he's now spending the rest of his time deding for show which may slow down his muscle growth just enough for Brandon and I to close the gap luckily since Brandon's less experience to the gym his muscles are more sensitive to growth which means we can bump up his calories much higher than normal while having those extra calories go towards building muscle rather than fat but this wasn't easy Brandon is extremely active playing several hours of competitive tennis per week so even after eating 3,000 calories a day Brandon was still struggling to put on weight which meant we had to increase his calories even more as for supplements although Todd has his special juice assisting him we've got a natural supplement we'll be taken full advantage of and one that could give us as much as a one to2 lb boosted muscle creatine doesn't sound like much but considering Brad as a natural and has some experience in the gym we mainly gain just 2 to three lounds of muscle in the next 100 days so even just a one PB boost would be huge and with Brandon finally starting to make some good progress on the scale I couldn't wait for our next checkin with Todd bad news guys I just got a call from Todd and apparently he's moving out of the city he's still down to take part in the experiment but he's not coming in the gym anymore for check-ins which means Brandon and I are going to have no idea how Todd is doing until the final day and it just means that Brandon and I got to really start training hard and really push for that final result all right so we're going to put this between your back and the bench this way you're able to open up your chest way more get a deeper stretch nice and all we're going to do bring back you feel that stretch right here exactly it's going to be harder it's going to be more painful but we got to do whatever it takes to be Tod all right all right hit the head hit the head hit the hand hit the hand two more times come on Brandon come on nice nice there we go put that chest up string here I'm pulling you good nice I feel like my strength has been really progressing well so I think at the beginning of the challenge I was dumbbell pressing around like 50 55 lb and now I can do three sets of 10 with 75 so I think that's a pretty good Improvement I've also been noticing that a lot of my t-shirts are fitting a little bit too small these days so I'm really hoping that Jeremy after this video is done can buy me a new wardrobe look at this man so how you think you're going to do the end of the week I'm a little bit nervous so I know there's a lot of pressure riding on this I don't want people to watch this and then see that okay maybe they should be taking steroids instead of staying natural but you I'd be happy with like a 2% body fat increase and then 2 to 3 lbs of uh muscle gate I haven't seen you in two months Dy you look good though man he's quiet he's just good mentally ready for this I'm pretty nervous right now yeah I don't know what's going to happen with the the video and with Jeremy's rep hopefully it don't ruin his day in the past 3 months of his time your feet can be down towards me and then but while Brandon was completing hisan I was finding out just how hard Todd had been working since we last spoke cardio is like 65 minutes per day and still have to train so yeah tired oh my God oh my God I I'm honestly in disbelief so results are in Brandon your starting body fat was 13.6% today it's at 13.5% which means your body fat pretty much stay the same your starting weight was 149 lb today is 154 lb which means you gained 5 lbs pure muscle lean muscle let's go but Todd on the other hand you started at 19% body fat today you're at 7% body fat which means you lost over 10 lb in weight but you gained over 13 lb of muscle which is insane dud that's crazy holy I'll be honest I knew there would be a difference and Todd had a big Advantage but I didn't think it was going to be like this that's crazy 0% to % while gaining 13 lbs of lean muscle mass cause transformation is an incredible Fe even with the help of steroids but although Brandon built just onethird as much muscle as Todd he still gained significantly more muscle than the average natural lifter without spending every weaking moment in the gym as for the ultrasound results while Todd did have a speed in most muscle groups Brandon actually saw more growth in his delts biceps as well as one leg muscle likely due to the special exercises we incorporated so while our respect caus Cho to hop on gear in my opinion unless you're is dedicated to competing this Todd or need testosterone for health reasons the risks simply aren't worth it Brandon is proof that with the right approach us ntis can still make incredible progress without putting our health at risk and if you want more guidance and are looking for a step-by-step program

    "title": "Uneven Abs: The 3 Main Types and How to Tell Which One You Have",
    "published_at": "2017-07-23T07:49:15Z",
    "transcript": "what's going on guys today we're going to be talking about something that's pretty interesting and it's a topic that I can personally relate to and it is all about uneven ABS so if you've ever lowered your body fat enough so that you can actually see your six-pack and you've noticed that your abs are a little bit off or they're not totally even then you definitely need to watch this video fact of the matter is most people actually have abs that are uneven but the reason they're uneven varies for everyone so in this video I'm going to be going through the three main pauses for uneven ABS what you can do about it and also how to tell which one you have before we get started please make sure that you hit that like button hit that subscribe button it'll really help me out I put in a lot of effort into these videos so I'd really appreciate if you subscribe and support me anyways let's get started with the video so the first type is where the ABS are not lined up from side to side like in this individual's case you can see that the lines connecting the bottom portion of each paired AB do not line up as they would in perfectly symmetrical ABS and the cause of this is is dependent on the way your abdominal muscles insert onto your ribs which is completely determined genetically unfortunately in this case there is no fix you can't change your muscle insertion points as this is something that's predetermined genetically for example here's a picture of me when I was 16 and you can already tell that I have uneven abs and they're not perfectly lined up and even to this day regardless of how much AB training I did the lines still don't line up and it's still slightly uneven but don't leave the video just yet because your abs may be uneven in more than one way you can work on the next two points that I'm going to discuss to make your abs seem a little bit more even and even if your abs aren't lined up perfectly then don't stress about it too much having a perfect set of lined up ABS is extremely rare and even if they aren't Lin up they'll still look really aesthetic and really attractive if you get down to a low enough body fat to actually see your sixpack and your midsection will look better than 99% of the population and the second type of uneven ABS is where the ABS are imbalance from the top to the bottom so you can see in this photo for example that the upper abs are much more defined than the lower abs in this case there are two main causes for this the first cause is that you simply don't have a low enough body fat to reveal your lower abs lower ab fat is actually the most stubborn fat to lose so it's typically going to be the very last place that you're going to lose fat and you're going to lose your upper AB fat before you lose your lower ab fat and this may give the illusion that your upper abs are more defined than your lower abs but really it's just the fat distribution that's creating this effect and to fix this you simply need to get your body fat down to a low enough level I suggest getting down to at least 10% and for some people you're going to have to get into single digit body fat to really see your lower ab and if you're struggling with getting rid of that last bit of lower ab fat then I highly suggest you check out this video where I go through the best methods to doing so and the second cause if you're certain it's not due to your body fat distribution is that you are simply working out your upper abs more than your lower abs which causes your upper abs to pop out more than your lower abs and makes them look uneven to fix this you simply need to work out your lower abs more IMG activity actually shows that the best exercises for activating your lower abs are hanging leg raises caps and chair leg raises line leg raises and bicycle kicks and for the best results I highly recommend incorporating weight into these movements and you can do so simply by adding a dumbbell in between your feet when you do the uh hanging leg raises or the captain chair leg Rises now the third and final type of uneven ABS is where one side of your abs is more defined and prominent than the other side this issue is a little bit more complicated to fix and there are two possible causes for this one possible culer for this type of uneven ABS is your mind to muscle connection with your abs when training them this may be due to you subconsciously bending your body in a way that emphasizes one side of your abs more than the other and causes you to activate one side better than the other you can fix this by focusing on performing all your abdominal exercises with correct form and allowing the contraction to be evenly distributed on both sides of your abs you need to form a solid mind to muscle connection with your abs during your workouts and prevent your stronger side from taking over one effective solution if you're still struggling is to perform unilateral ab exercises that will allow you to train each side of your ab separately the best exercises for this purpose are single leg raises side planks cable Wood Choppers and rope pul Downs to one side this will help balance out the two sides of your abs and you can perform a few more reps on the less defined side to even it out more quickly the next possible cause is a little bit more complicated to fix and is due to imbalances in your body that have been created over time for example scoliosis which is a slight curvature in your spine can actually cause you to contract one side of your abs better than the other due to the imbalance which over time from a lot of weight training and and ab training can lead to uneven ABS and the fix for this is to Simply correct the imbalances in your body which is a lot easier said than done and will vary for every individual and unfortunately this is beyond the scope of this video so if this is the case for you then I highly recommend you see a good physiotherapist or chiropractor to get yourself checked out and to see if you have any misalignments for the time being really try to focus on having an even contraction between both sides of your abs and also using the unilateral exercises that I show so to put what I said into practice I'm going to use my abs as an example I highly suggest that you don't just use a picture in the mirror of your abs to determine your asymmetries because 99% of the time we look at ourselves is through a mirror and when we look at our bodies in the mirror and take pictures in the mirror we actually subconsciously adjust our bodies in a way that makes us look the best and most symmetrical so what I do is if I'm going to use a picture of my abs in the mirror I'll flip it horizontally which really helps me notice my asymmetries or you could always just get someone to take a picture of your abs for you so take a quick look at this flipped image of my abs as you can see my abs aren't lined up perfectly mainly the middle two ABS this is purely genetic and it's not something I can fix and it's something that I've always had even as a kid however in addition to this the left side of my abs seemed to be more defined than my right side and I actually know from personal experience that I have a better mind to muscle connection with the left side of my abs which may have caused this imbalance so what I will do is really try to focus on the mind to muscle connection with the right side of my abs and also perform unilateral exercises to try to balance it out so to recap the video what you should do is the following one get to a low enough body fat to be able to see your abs in the first place 10% is ideal two take a picture of your abs if it's in a mirror flip the picture horizontally three analyze your abs and see if they're uneven if they are find out which type of uneven ABS you have and keep in mind that more than one type May apply to you and four use the fixes I provided to help even out your abs that's basically it guys I really hope you found this information useful if you have any questions please let me know in the comments below and as always please don't forget to like the video

    "title": "How To Unlock Your Mobility in 5 Minutes (DAILY STRETCH)",
    "published_at": "2022-02-27T16:19:38Z",
    "transcript": "our bodies are very efficient at maintaining the resources we use and getting rid of what we don't if we stop training we get weaker similarly if we don't regularly use the full range of motion of our joints we quickly lose our ability to do so most people in this day and age they haven't trained their full range of motion in their joints for years whoa whoa what is going on jeremy what is on your leg yes your boy just got a fresh new tattoo i actually just posted it on my instagram you can check out the full booty shot there but comment down below what do you guys think love it hate it either way i'm gonna keep it cheers guys let's get back to stretching as a result the shoulders hips back and ankles just don't move like they may have used to a good example here is how certain cultures such as southeast asians use the deep squat every day and can assume that position quite easily and although differences in bone structure do play a role you can contrast that to western cultures where very few are able to perform a comfortable deep squat for example try sitting down and rising from the floor without using your hands or knees for support how easy or difficult was that for you to do this loss of mobility can not only create feelings of tightness limit your ability to perform certain lifts in the gym and prevent you from being able to activate certain muscles very well but it may even extend far beyond this so how do we improve this well today i'll show you how by focusing on the right areas and the right exercises you can significantly improve your mobility in just five minutes so before we dive into the exercises we first need to understand what will make this five minute routine so effective although i have released quite a bit of posture and mobility routines in the past that can help you let's face it the shorter a stretching routine is the more likely you'll be able to stick to it five minutes done every single day will be far superior than a 10 or 20 minute routine you only get around doing once or twice a week but because this routine is only five minutes we need to make sure it focuses on areas that need the most help and based on the sedentary day-to-day life of most individuals as well as the results of a recent poll that i ran on my instagram we picked three key areas the hips the upper back and an area where you probably don't even realize needs help the ankles even though you may think that your problem areas are elsewhere like your shoulders and your hamstrings because these three areas are such important lengths in the human kinetic chain improvements here tend to improve things everywhere else to ensure that we mobilize these areas properly though pay very close attention to the form and modifications i'm about to show you for each exercise as the details really do matter the first move will be used to loosen up the spine and our back muscles in preparation for our next exercises this is especially helpful in the morning after we've been laying in bed for several hours to perform it get onto all fours with your knees under your hips and hands under your shoulders from here in a gentle motion round your back up towards the ceiling as if someone was pulling your mid-back up with a rope as you do this take a deep breath in while tucking your head down then exhale as you reverse this motion by now curving your back the opposite way while lifting your head up based on the lab research of back pain expert dr stewart mcgill he found that just seven to eight cycles of this are what's needed for the most benefit when done slowly and controlled this should take you about a minute to do if you're having trouble nailing down this motion though try placing a band around your mid-back this is going to help you pull your spine into the bottom position and also give you the resistance and sensory feedback you may need to learn how to properly round your spine upwards and for your reference here is a snapshot of each part of the stretch so that you can quickly screenshot it for reference i'll do the same with the next four exercises as well the next exercise called the world's greatest stretch will be the most effective way to hit all the key problem areas at once this stretch has three parts to it a lunge a drop and a reach the first part is going to focus on your hips and ankles get into a plank position with your hands under your shoulders and your feet together from here lunge forward by bringing your right foot up as high as you can ideally next to where your right hand is you should feel a deep stretch in your groin muscles of your front leg and the hip flexors of your back leg as you do this next take your right hand place it on your knee and push your knee out and back and then forward and back a few times just to loosen up the hips and the ankles a little bit more then to deepen the stretch even more in the second part of the stretch you'll try to drop your right elbow as far towards the ground as you can while rotating your upper body down towards the ground as you do this try to keep your right knee pushed out rather than letting it collapse inwards and then for part three to really open up the mid and upper back rotate your entire upper body up and to the right and reach your right arm as far overhead as you can if you can try to keep your back leg as straight as possible as you do so then you're going to reach back down and repeat this for five reps or about 30 seconds in total before switching to the next side [Music] now this is quite a difficult stretch to make it easier you can keep your leg bent or keep your knee on the ground and work towards straightening it more and more over time in the beginning also don't be discouraged if you can only reach so far here and there just stay consistent with it and it's going to improve very quickly and finally here's the snapshot of each part of the stretch for your reference next we're going to do what i'll just call the asian squat but with a few modifications to really open up the hips and ankles first you're going to want to get a rolled up towel and place your heels on it from here using a squat stance which is typically just outside shoulder width squat down into however deep is comfortable for you keep your chest up and try to keep your heels down if your heels do come up you can roll up the towel to make it even thicker otherwise that's fine to keep your heels up if you have to from here place your arms on the inside of your legs and use your elbows to push your knees out you're going to sit in this position for 30 seconds and as you do so you should feel a deep stretch in your groin and in the muscles around your ankles and if you're in a rush to get to work you can always have breakfast while you're at it then for the next 30 seconds move side to side to deepen the stretch of each ankle one at a time as you do this though you want to avoid collapsing your knees in and avoid pointing your feet too far outwards as this takes the stretch away from the ankles instead try to keep your feet angled out at a max of about 30 to 45 degrees and keep each knee in line with the outside of your toes now there's a couple ways that we can go about progressing this in the beginning if you struggle with ankle mobility you may need quite a bit of heel elevation to comfortably get down into a deep squat over time though try to use less and less heal elevation and see if you can eventually get to using no elevation at all then at the bottom position to open up the hips even more you'll first just push your knees out with your arms straight ahead once that gets easy try to place your hands together into a prayer position once that gets easy place your hands together into fists each progression is going to open up your hips more and more by spreading out the distance between your elbows and finally here is a snapshot of each part of the stretch for you to screenshot all right so next we're going to really focus on mobilizing the upper back with rotation and opening up the chest get into a half kneeling position with your right leg bent as close to the wall as you can get and your left leg planted forward in a lunge position you're gonna place both arms directly in front of you with your right arm making contact with the wall from here push your right hand into the wall as you rotate your upper body to the left trying to reach your left arm to the other side of the wall as you do this you want to avoid rotating your hips and try to rotate only the upper body return back to the starting position and then repeat this for 30 seconds before switching sides to make it easier when starting out try moving your planted leg further away from the wall and just try to rotate as far as you can without rotating your hips as this improves try to move your leg closer and closer to the wall and rotate further and further then once you can get that down you can progress it even further to really open up the chest and shoulders by sliding your hand against the wall as if you were drawing a half moon and here's a snapshot of each part for you to screenshot okay so now that we've loosened up your upper back we will now temporarily have the mobility we need to be able to better activate and strengthen some of the smaller weakened muscles in the back strengthening these muscles will help you maintain these mobility improvements long term and the exercise we'll use to hit these muscles or wall slides to perform it stand with your back against the wall and contract your abs to flatten your lower back then slide your arms up and down the wall to make this easier when starting out place your feet further away from the wall and then over time try to get your feet closer and closer to the wall while trying your best to keep your lower back flat when done properly you should feel a few muscles in your mid-back really light up as you raise your arms up and if you can't initially keep your arms in contact with the wall all the way through or you just can't slide your arms up very high at all that's all perfectly fine just focus on improving this over time and here is a snapshot of each part for your reference all right so here is the full five minute routine each exercise will take you just about a minute to do but within that minute i want you to focus on doing as many high quality reps as you can and just for your convenience i've created a completely free downloadable pdf that

    "title": "Why Your Triceps Aren&#39;t Growing (1 Key Exercise You&#39;re Not Doing Enough)",
    "published_at": "2020-10-04T16:48:44Z",
    "transcript": "if you're struggling with your triceps growth or just want to get bigger triceps faster then there's one exercise that you need to ensure that you're including in your weekly routine let me explain many of you watching have likely heard that by just doing enough of your compound movements like bench pressing that your arms will naturally grow and get bigger as a result and that is true in fact multiple papers have shown that adding in additional triceps exercises to a program already consisting of various pressing movements did not significantly increase triceps growth one recent 2020 study revisited this and once again showed the same result adding in an additional triceps exercise to a bench press program did not significantly increase total tricep size after 10 weeks however what this study did differently is that the researchers then analyzed the growth of each of the three heads of the triceps as opposed to just measuring whole muscle triceps grow and here's what they found subjects that performed only the bench press experienced significant growth in the lateral and medial heads of their triceps but not in the long head whereas subjects that supplemented their bench pressing with the triceps exercise the lying overhead extension experience significantly greater growth in the long head of their triceps which indicates that pressing movements alone do seem to be enough to grow the lateral and medial heads but they do a poor job at developing the long head of the triceps which is actually what makes up most of the mass of your triceps and the reasoning for this is because while the other two heads of your triceps only cross the elbow joint and only function to extend the elbow the long head also crosses the shoulder joint and therefore has an additional function to extend the shoulder and research has shown that during your movements like the bench press your nervous system will actually preferentially recruit muscles that only cross one joint because those muscles tend to be more efficient meaning that if you aren't supplementing your pressing movements with additional triceps work or you are but you're not choosing the right triceps exercises specifically for the long head of your triceps then you're leaving a ton of potential gains on the table so what i'd recommend is to ensure that you're regularly performing a triceps exercise that specifically emphasizes the long head most triceps exercises where the arms are held overhead will effectively accomplish this for example in the study that i previously went through the researchers used the lying overhead extension which did prove to elicit significant growth in the longer the triceps and is a great potential option but we can take this movement and we can make it even more effective since we know that the long hair of the triceps functions to both extend the shoulder and extend the elbow we can combine these two functions into one movement one option is to simply modify your traditional rope or bar push downs instead of keeping your elbows locked into your sides allow them to raise up and initiate each rep by first extending the shoulder and then finish the rep with elbow extension with your elbows by your sides this subtle tweak can help you prioritize the long head more since it now incorporates its two main movement functions and to take it one step further once your triceps fatigue to the point where you can no longer finish your reps you can extend the set by just performing the first part of the exercise until you completely fatigue there as a result you're likely going to feel a burn in your triceps that you've never quite experienced before another option is to perform these modified push downs lying down instead like so this orientation it not only helps prevent any momentum or cheating during your reps but the line of resistance from the cable forces the long head to constantly work against the resistance to not only bring the elbows down but to then keep the elbows pinned in place as you fully extend at the end of each rep and again this same concept can be taken and applied to your traditional line overhead extensions as well for this movement there's four parts to it so first start with your hands held directly above you then lower them to your sides from here straighten your arms back behind your body and lock your elbows in position lower the dumbbells to behind your head and then extend them back up again from here drive your elbows back to the starting position and then straighten your arms up overhead that all counts as one rep as you can imagine you won't be able to get many reps but each individual rep will place a ton of tension on your long head as you move through its various movement functions focus on control use light weight and do experiment with different grips and ranges of motion with this movement just to find what feels most comfortable for you and your elbows i found that using the neutral grip with dumbbells tends to be the best option for most people but just try out these different exercises and find which one enables you to best feel that long head working i'd highly recommend choosing one or two of these exercises to do at least once a week to supplement your current pressing movements or to even swap out some of your other triceps exercises with as this is the head that tends to get left behind yet is largely responsible for the overall size of your triceps by focusing on this you'll very quickly be able to spark new growth in your triceps and for a step-by-step program that shows you exactly what to work out week after week to ensure that you're maximizing growth and not letting any muscles lie behind and simply

    "title": "The Best Core Workout For Thicker, Stronger Abs (YOU\u2019RE DOING IT WRONG!)",
    "published_at": "2020-08-10T20:56:12Z",
    "transcript": "if you don't know the difference between training your abs and training your core then you need to watch this video because most people use those two terms interchangeably and are under the impression that if you train your abs you're training your core right and i mean sure you can do a hundred crunches in a row and sure you may actually have a nice looking six-pack but this doesn't at all mean that your core is strong and will hold up and assist you in your exercises and in your daily life so realize that your core is what sets the foundation for everything else if your core is weak then your ability to get stronger in your exercises and your ability to grow the muscles surrounding each of your joints will be negatively impacted and as a bonus it will also provide aesthetic benefits as well as research has not only shown that those who engage in sport that require a ton of core stability such as professional weight lifters tend to have increased thickness of their deep abdominal muscles relative to the average joe which may help with the appearance of your six-pack and just making them a little bit more visible crossfitters and powerlifters are a perfect example of this as they require a tremendous amount of core strength and stability for their movements as a result they usually have their abs protrude even when they're at a higher body fat percentage so now that i've hopefully convinced you to pay more attention to your core how exactly do we go about training it well although many movements and big lifts in the gym will indirectly train your core in these movement patterns additional exercises can help ensure that you are in fact adequately training your core and not overlooking any k muscles but before we dive into the core workout we need to first cover the muscles that make up the core and the proper way to go about training them so the word core actually refers to the area of your body between your diaphragm and your pelvic floor meaning that all the muscles that support this region and stabilize the spine can be categorized as part of your core and when it comes to core training it's important to realize that each core muscle does play an important role but contrary to a typical bodybuilding workout your goal should not be trying to train each of these specific muscles in isolation not only has research shown that you can't actually train these individual core muscles in isolation in the first place but we also just wouldn't want to since these core muscles work together synergistically and therefore should be trained in that fashion a much better approach would be to use core exercises that challenge a core in every possible way that your core could be challenged in a lift sport or just in your daily life and this can be broken down into four categories anterior core stability exercises where we train the body to resist excessively arching the lower back posterior core stability exercises where we train the body to resist excessively rounding the lower back lateral core stability exercises where we train the body to resist bending to one side and lastly rotary core stability exercises where we train the body to resist excessive rotation of the lumbar spine so we'll use these four categories to serve as the four movement patterns that we want to hit with our core workout and with all that being said we're ready to dive into the workout the first exercise we'll do here will actually serve as an activation exercise to get you to first learn how to contract all of your core muscles together which our bodies tend to forget how to do because of the excessive amount of time we spend sitting in a relaxed state so what you want to do is lay on your back with your knees bent then from here you want to take a deep breath into your belly a deep breath out and then when you're near maximal exhalation brace your core as if you were to prepare for a punch in the gut as a result your lower back should flatten on the ground and if you feel around your midsection your sides and your lower back all of these areas should be firm and tense continue breathing while holding this contraction this is what's termed as abdominal bracing which was a term first coined by researcher dr stewart mcgill a leading expert in spinal mechanics what he found is that abdominal bracing is able to co-activate all of the layers of your core muscle simultaneously which is how your core should be contracting and working during your lifts and just in your daily life as this is what creates the core stability and stiffness that your spine needs and if this alone is quite fatiguing for you to do and hold for a minute or two then that's a good sign that your core is likely quite weak and could definitely use some more attention so going forward just be mindful of abdominal bracing apply that practice to each of the following exercises that we're gonna go through and eventually it's just gonna start to happen on a subconscious level the next exercise reverse crunches is something i've covered in past videos but does a great job of challenging our anterior core stability what you want to do here is lay with your knees bent either on a bench or on the ground with your arms holding on to something back overhead then from here posteriorly tilt your pelvis and flatten your lower back by applying the abdominal bracing practice we previously went through then lift your knees up to 90 degrees curl your pelvis up towards your belly button and then slowly come back down you want to be mindful of keeping that lower back flat throughout each rep and to progress it you can slow down the reps and or start loading it by adding a ball between your legs like so as you do these you should feel a strong contraction in your deep abdominal muscles next we're going to challenge our posterior core stability by using the exercise highly recommended by dr stewart mcgill the bird dog for these just get on all fours with your back neutral abrasive core and then simply kick one of your legs backwards while raising the opposite arm until they're both straight hold this position for a second or two and then come back down and repeat on the other side you want to avoid arching your back as you do so if this is too difficult for you to do while keeping your spine neutral then you can start by just doing one arm or one leg at a time the goal here is just to simply keep that abdominal bracing intact as you challenge it by moving your arms and legs next we're going to challenge our lateral core stability with suitcase carries where you hold the kettlebell or dumbbell with one arm and take steps while ensuring that your torso remains upright and shoulders remain level you want to look as if you were walking without the weight added on one side as stated by dr stewart mcgill's research the asymmetric weight helps challenge the deep lateral musculature in a way that is never possible with big lifts like the squat yet it's essential for enhancing core strength and stability as you do these you should feel the lateral core muscles on your opposing side working as you walk with the weight and lastly we're going to work on our rotary core stability with a pallof press here we're just going to take a band we're going to wrap it around a fixture take a few steps out laterally and assume an athletic stance with your knees slightly bent feet at about shoulder width apart and your core brace then start with your hands close to your sternum then from here simply extend your arms forward and back while resisting the urge to rotate inwards and if needed you can perform this with a cable pulley instead like so what this exercise does is it challenges your body's ability to resist a twisting motion which is a key component that's missing from a lot of people's worker routines as you do these you should feel your lateral core muscles and obliques working to resist that inward rotation so to sum the video up here's a breakdown of the full core workout now for your convenience i've actually created a mobile friendly downloadable pdf of this workout that comes complete with the exercises tutorials for each exercise and how to go about implementing these exercises into your routine to grab a copy of this just head on over to builtwithscience.com forward slash core workout pdf and i'll send it right over to you but all in all it's important that within your weekly routine you're training your core in each of the four categories that we covered in the long run this will not only lead to a better looking midsection but a stronger and more stable one as well and for a step-by-step program that shows you exactly how to train these important muscles and pairs them with a weekly workout and nutrition plan based on size so you can burn off fat and build lean muscle as efficiently and as safely as possible and simply

    "title": "The Best Science-Based DUMBBELL Shoulder Exercises For Mass and Symmetry",
    "published_at": "2019-07-07T15:59:25Z",
    "transcript": "big well-defined and balanced looking shoulders are key when it comes to developing a broad powerful looking upper body but achieving them is no easy feat and one of the biggest mistakes people make with their shoulder training is failing to incorporate enough dumbbell exercises into their routine which is crucial that you do so since it helps better prevent imbalances or asymmetries from developing in your shoulders and has various advantages that can help take your shoulder growth to the next level so if you'd like to boost your shoulder development by incorporating more dumbbell work into your routine or on the other hand if you've only got access to dumbbells then stick around as i'll go through the best dumbbell exercises that you can use to target each portion of the shoulder and add the size that you're after the first exercise is going to be the dumbbell shoulder press which can be done standing or seated both variations are going to effectively target the front delt with some contribution from the middle and rear delts as well and it's going to act as your main heavy compound movement for the shoulders now the reason why i'm giving the option for standing or seated is because they each have their pros and cons that you'll want to consider the standing dumbbell press for example has been shown in a 2013 emg analysis to elicit eight percent greater front delt activation 15 percent greater lateral delt activation and 24 greater rear delt activation than the seated version as well as greater involvement from the core musculature and the reason for this greater activation is due to the stabilization role of the shoulder muscles which obviously becomes more challenged when you're pressing while in a standing position compared to seated the downside with a standing version however is that you're not going to be able to lift as heavy of a weight likely around 10 percent lighter and once you get to heavy weight with this exercise it becomes increasingly difficult to continue overloading since it can be quite cumbersome to get the dumbbells into the right starting position whereas with the seated version you're able to both lift heavier weights and can more effectively overload it since you now have the ability to kick the dumbbells up into the starting position therefore in terms of isolating and developing your shoulder size over time one could argue that the seated version would be ideal whereas if you'd like to use lighter weights without compromising shoulder activation or you'd like to strengthen the core and improve overhead stability for sport for example then in these cases the standing press would be ideal in either case so you'll want to perform the press correctly and one key mistake you want to avoid is flaring the elbows out as you press instead keep your elbows tucked forward slightly and something called the scapular plane is shown here as this has been shown in multiple biomechanical analyses to be a much safer and more comfortable position for the shoulder joint to be in as you press in addition it's vital that you avoid compensating by arching your lower back especially as you fatigue and you can prevent this from happening by keeping your core contracted and tight throughout the press as this is going to help with your overall stability and lead to a safer stronger press the next exercise is going to target the lateral deltoids or mid delt which doesn't receive enough attention from the shoulder press alone now as i've said in the past lateral raises are likely your best bet for growing this portion of your shoulders since they've been consistently shown to elicit the highest activation when compared to other common shoulder exercises however to make the movement even more effective you can slightly lean in the direction of the raise by hanging onto a fixture with one hand as you perform the movement with the other arm this is based on the findings of a study on the rotator cuff which found that the supraspinatus one of the rotator cuff muscles is most active during the beginning of the race whereas the side delts only become more active after around a third of the way up and remains highly active to the end of the range of motion at the top therefore by leaning away we effectively remove the beginning portion of the rays where the supraspinatus is most active which as a result now enables the side delts to remain highly active throughout the whole range of motion and for this exercise you want to use a relatively lighter weight with higher reps while mentally thinking about leading the rays with your elbows rather than your hands and raising the weight out as much as possible rather than simply lifting the weight up these two cues should help you better activate the side delts and prevent the upper traps from taking over next we're going to use the rear delt dumbbell row to shift more of the focus onto the rear delts as shown here with some involvement from the back musculature and the biceps as well this exercise is a great choice to add mass to the rear delts since it enables you to use heavier weight and overload it more effectively than you can compared to other dumbbell rear delt exercises like reverse flies for example but the key to maximizing the effectiveness of this exercise ultimately comes down to how you perform it as you can see i'm performing what looks like a dumbbell row which would normally mainly target the lats however by letting my elbow drift upwards and away from my sides i'm now able to lessen the involvement of the lats and shift more of the tension to the rear delts instead this is because we know based on anatomical analyses of the lats that they are strongly involved in shoulder extension when the elbows are tucked close to the sides but we also know that they become progressively weaker as you move the elbow away from the sides into more transverse extension which is when the rear delts are now highly active so when performing this movement rather than keeping the elbow tucked close to your sides you'll want to let the elbow drift away and upwards from the sides as you pull in order to better hit the rear delts and it's also important that you focus on keeping your body square rather than twisting at the top of every rep and you also want to avoid any excessive arching or rounding to the lower back as you perform the movement for this exercise you'll want to use a relatively heavier weight with a moderate rep range of roughly 6 to 12 reps the next exercise is a dumbbell version of the traditional rope face pull it will be used to further target the rear delts while also strengthening the all-important rotator cuff muscles and the mid and lower traps in the process and this exercise is highly effective at doing so since it incorporates the major movement functions of the rear delts but also adds an external rotation which is a lesser known function of the rear delts and something that the previous exercise fails to incorporate but again to maximize the effectiveness of this exercise you'll want to ensure that you're performing it correctly i'd suggest performing these on an incline bench set at roughly 45 degrees as this will help minimize any lower back involvement then grab a pair of light dumbbells and start with your arms straight down and thumbs pointed towards each other at the bottom then as you raise up you want to rotate your hands up and out to the side while twisting the thumbs so that they now point at the ceiling at the top position your arms should make the shape of a w hold this position for a brief second while contracting the rear delts and mid and lower traps before you come back down for another rep and you want to avoid making the mistake of not getting the wrist all the way back at the top position as this will minimize the all-important external rotation component of this exercise also avoid compensating by arching the back as you raise a weight instead maintain a straight neutral spine throughout the movement and for this exercise you definitely want to put the ego aside and use relatively lighter weight with a higher rep range of roughly 10 to 15 reps [Applause] so here is a dumbbell only shoulder workout that you can do using the exercises that i previously went through feel free to do this as a workout on its own or you can split up a couple of the exercises and just throw them into your existing workouts to see better shoulder development but i hope that you were able to see that choosing the right exercises is important but also performing them in the right manner is just as important if you want to build muscle most effectively while avoiding injury in the process and if you're looking for a step-by-step science-based program that shows you exactly what exercises workouts reps and sets you need to be doing based on science and how to optimally and safely perform them with in-depth tutorials for each and every exercise in your program then simply head on over to buildwithscience.com and take the analysis quiz that will determine

    "published_at": "2021-02-28T17:13:08Z",
    "transcript": "[Music] [Music] if your shoulder has over time slowly rounded into what i'll just call mom posture and it's suffering from aches pains popping and or instability especially when you reach for something or perform certain exercises then this video is for you before we dive into the solution though let's talk about how you got here in the first place odds are two things contributed to this and are continuing to worsen the problem the first likely contributor is the muscle imbalances around your shoulder that were created as a result of spending a lot of time with poor posture over time this not only tightens the muscles in front of our shoulders which will pull it forward into this rounded position but it also weakens the important back muscles that are supposed to keep it back in place the second likely contributor is what you do during your workouts where you worsen the muscle imbalances previously mentioned by over training your pushing and internal rotator muscles while neglecting the often overlooked rotator cuff and scapular muscles that help keep your shoulders healthy combine these two things and you have the perfect recipe for common type of shoulder impingement to occur this can happen when as a result of your muscle balances certain parts of your shoulder are moved out of their proper position which can cram up your shoulder joint and lead to a pinching in one of your rotator cuff tendons this can then lead to pain in your shoulder especially when lifting your arm overhead or behind your back in fact you can test for this by raising your arms up with your thumbs up like so repeat this but with your thumbs down if you experience pain or the pain worsens in the thumbs down position this is an indication that you may have the specific type of impingement another indication is if your shoulders feel better when you press with a neutral or underhand grip instead of overhand regardless the key to fixing this preventing this and just keeping your shoulders healthy in general is quite simple and it involves two easy steps the first step here is to create more space in your shoulder joint to relieve the pinching on your tendon and the pain that you're feeling to do so we need to activate the various muscles that you've been neglecting and have weakened over time as for what these muscles are as shown in the following graphs most of the studies that have analyzed subjects with impingement find a decrease in activation of the lower traps in the serratus anterior on the injured side as well as weakness in the external rotators of the shoulder meaning that we want to focus our efforts on activating and strengthening these specific muscles the first muscle the lower traps can easily be activated and strengthened with a simple body weight progression level one involves first lifting your chest off the ground slightly by using your mid-back muscles raising your arms up while turning your palms out and then pulling your shoulder blades back and down as if you were reaching your fingers down towards your feet as these are the two main functions of the lower traps and the key to activating them hold this position for 10 seconds and then repeat for more reps you should feel a strong activation in the muscles just above your lower back and then as you get stronger you can progress to the next progressions but still apply the same concepts of raising your chest off the ground and focusing on squeezing your shoulder blades back and down [Music] next to strengthen the serratus anterior we need to focus on first activating it in the first place and we're going to do so with the following drill first you want to assume a wall plank position with your forearms on the wall then think about pulling your shoulder blades down and around your ribs by pushing away from the wall with your forearms you should feel the contraction in the region shown here if you can't feel anything try to round your back as you push your forearms into the wall hold this for 20 to 30 seconds and then repeat this for more revs to progress this you can then start adding overhead movement only if you can do so pain-free by using a shirt or cloth to help slide your forearms up and down the wall as you actively push against it but if that progression does cause pain then you can easily switch it up for another movement called the push-up plus shown here where you apply a similar technique but by pushing into the ground instead of on the wall lastly to strengthen the external rotators we're going to perform the sideline external rotation with a light dumbbell or even a book or water bottle i'd also suggest that you add a rolled up towel or t-shirt under your upper arm as that's been shown to help prevent compensations and boost activation by 20 to set up pull your shoulder blades back and down and keep them locked then you simply rotate your arm upwards while keeping your elbow pinned to the side when done properly even with just minimal weight you should quickly feel a burning sensation in your shoulders signaling that your weak external rotators are being worked to eventually progress this only if you can do so without pain you'll want to add a raise at the end of the movement like so this will help train your external rotators in a more functional 3d manner and will be the key to regaining your ability to press pain-free the next step is to address the root cause of your shoulder issues which lie in the various mobility restrictions that were created from a sedentary lifestyle or just time spent in poor posture because although the exercises we did earlier may help alleviate pain and improve shoulder function in the short term a lack of mobility in key areas can just cause you to continue having recurrent shoulder issues in the long run particularly because of the ways your body will compensate during your exercises no amount of rotator cuff strengthening would truly fix the issue which is why in step two you need to focus on mobilizing some of the titan structures and address the poor posture positions that likely cause the issue in the first place now i have done quite a few videos on improving mobility and would highly suggest that you take a look at those but the two most problematic areas that you'll want to focus on are the pecs and the mid back when the pecs are tight they pull our shoulder into this forward rounded position to help mobilize them all you need is a wall or something to prop your elbow against keep your elbow at 90 degrees brace your core and then lunge forward gently until you feel a stretch in your pecs then slide your arm up and down slowly to stretch out the different fibers and muscles of your chest do this for 30 to 60 seconds and then switch sides [Music] after the pecs we're gonna work on the mid back with the following simple yet effective thoracic extension move that i've shown in several of my past videos to perform this movement place your elbows on top of a bench or couch with your hands together sit your hips back into your heels and simultaneously drop your chest towards the ground hold that bottom position for a few deep breaths before repeating for more reps by working on these two specific areas while focusing on just being more aware of your postures throughout the day you're gonna be able to address the root cause of your shoulder pain for long-term success rather than just short-term relief so as a summary here is a corrective routine that you'll want to run through initially two to three times a day part one focuses on creating more space within your shoulder joint to relieve the pain caused by an impingement part two then focuses on mobilizing some of the areas that likely contributed to the impingement in the first place by implementing these two parts you're going to be able to not only quickly relieve your shoulder pain but will also be addressing the root cause of the problem now although it may sound tedious you won't need to do these every single day indefinitely if you simply choose the right exercises to include in your workouts while making an effort to move more and be mindful of your posture throughout the day then you're going to be able to keep these muscles strengthened and prevent imbalances from occurring without having to do a ton of different corrective exercises every single day and for a step-by-step program that uses science to show you exactly how to transform your body as efficiently as possible without overlooking key muscles that make all the difference and simply head on over to buildscience.com and take our analysis quiz to discover the best program for you and your specific body anyways that is it for today guys i hope you enjoyed this

    "title": "15 BEST Shoulder Exercises For Growth (And How To Use Them)",
    "published_at": "2022-01-16T18:05:47Z",
    "transcript": "when properly developed the shoulders help complete a powerful looking physique and contribute to creating that v taper we all want but why is it that so few successfully achieved this well do a quick google search of the best shoulder exercises and you'll be met with an overwhelming number of exercises and workouts that all promise the same thing but let's be honest how many of you have hit your shoulders with everything in the book yet are disappointed because they just won't seem to grow very well trust me i know the frustration what you need and what i wish somebody told me back in the day is more structure behind your shoulder training with the overwhelming number of options out there though this is much easier said than done today my goal is to simplify this for you i'll break down the best exercises for each of the three regions of your shoulders show you how to pick the right ones for your body and your equipment availability and then show you how to combine them all into a weekly routine to make sure that you're growing the three areas of your shoulders in a well-rounded way over time let's start with the first region the front delts so take a look at the direction of its muscle fibers they run almost 45 degrees to the side relative to your torso this means that to best activate this muscle you want to avoid the common mistake of flaring your elbows out to the sides during overhead pressing this is not only a riskier position for your shoulder to be in but it also fails to line up with the front delt muscle fibers instead move your elbows into what's called the scapular plane which is slightly in front of the body let's apply this little tweak to five of the best overhead pressing options the first exercise is a standing overhead press this has been shown to activate the front delts very well with levels even higher than that of traditional front raises to perform the press use a narrower grip that allows you to position your elbows directly under the bar and slightly in front of your torso into the position we talked about earlier squeeze your glutes brace your core and then push directly overhead while keeping your lower back neutral here you'll want to use a heavier weight and aim for 6 to 12 reps the recommendation for the next exercise comes from a 2013 paper comparing four different types of overhead presses the standing dumbbell overhead press provided the highest activation with not only the front delts but across all three heads of the shoulder the downside with this exercise however is that it can get increasingly difficult to overload once you get to heavier weights this is why here you'll want to do the opposite of what we did with the barbell overhead press choose a lighter weight and aim for about 20 to 30 reps per set this way you can still take your shoulder muscles close to failure without letting your setup be the limiting factor standing shoulder presses are great and should not be left out of your routine but the benefit of a seated press is that it provides a lot more stability for you to really isolate the shoulders for these press in the scapular plane and keep your elbows stacked directly under the dumbbells this next move will help you work on any muscle imbalances you may have especially if you tend to only do barbell work it's also a great exercise for improving your shoulder health and as an added bonus because you're pressing the weight with one arm your core will have to work hard to prevent your torso from rotating too far to the loaded side this can translate to better strength in compound movements like the deadlift and squat as you perform these think about reaching forward rather than just pressing up when you hit the front delts without any equipment yes just like the other exercises pike push-ups align the elbows in the way the front delt fibers run to set it up bring your feet close to your hands to make an upside down v-shape and perform a press if these are too hard you can start out by performing these on your knees instead on the other hand if these get too easy for you after a while feel free to elevate your feet onto a higher platform next the lateral head the key to their growth is to use a variety of exercises that stress this area in different ways i have done a past video that breaks down this concept in more detail with some unique exercises and i'll leave that linked in the description box down below but for now here are five great options let's start with the dumbbell lateral raise as i mentioned in my past videos the best way to perform this for the most activation and safety of your shoulder joint is to use a slight lean forward raise your arms in the scapular plane slightly in front of your body and with your thumbs positioned slightly above your pinkies remember when we talked about variety for maximal growth use an exercise that stresses the side delts in a way that your standard lateral raise just can't do now the side dials only start becoming highly active once you pass the first third or so of the race so hang onto the cable machine with your non-working arm and slightly lean towards the direction of the raise to ensure the delts are working throughout the whole range of motion if you don't have access to the cable machine you could also just tie a resistance band to a fixture and use that instead although we're still using cables here this exercise will provide a different stress to the shoulder by taking your side delts all the way to its fully contracted position to perform it grab the right cable with your left hand and vice versa to crisscross and then pull the cable up into a wide wide position this movement will also highly activate your lower traps which is a good thing now if you don't have access to cables here's an exercise that by playing with your body position will replicate the effects of cables it's also a great choice if your upper traps have a habit of taking over to perform it just set up a bench to about 45 degrees and raise your arms into a wide y shape holding on to light dumbbells or weight plates think about raising your arms out rather than up you will feel this one quite a bit in your lower traps as well again this is a good thing last but not least upright rows but the better kind that's safer for your shoulder to perform it widen your grip to about two times shoulder width raise your elbows only up to the level of your shoulders and at the top position ensure that your hands are not below your elbows but are rather raised up to the same level these can also be done with dumbbells instead finally we have a region of the shoulder that's key to balancing out the look of your front delts by rounding out the back of the shoulder it's the rear delts and if you take a look at the way these muscle fibers run it's at a roughly 45 degree angle this means that to best target this muscle you want to use exercises where your elbows can pull in this 45 degree arm angle relative to the torso here are five great options first up what i call the rear delt swing grab a pair of light dumbbells and lay on an incline bench set at about 30 degrees then swing your elbows back behind your body while keeping your arms straight and angled out at about a 45 degree angle now what i want you to do here is push hard do as many reps as you can and then we can do no more we'll want to immediately drop set to the next exercise using the exact same setup and pair of dumbbells you can take the rear delts to complete failure by turning the swing into a row by simply bending your elbows with this slight modification you'll be able to continue doing more reps until your rear delts are completely fatigued now we're going to move on to a barbell movement the key to making these rear delts focus will be with your elbow angle and how high you pull the bar use an overhand relatively wider grip that enables you to pull high to the level of your sternum and with your elbows angled out at about 45 degrees and think about pulling with your elbows as you do so now this same form can be applied to a cable machine by using a wider attachment and that sweet spot 45 degree angle last but not least an exercise i got from coach paul carter that trains the rear delts in its fully stretched position this has recently been shown to be an important mechanism of muscle growth and is something that our previous exercises failed to do to perform it sit sideways next to a cable machine and adjust the pulley to a height where you're able to pull your arm into a 45 degree angle away from your torso think about reaching your arm to your opposite ear and then pulling your elbow across and then behind your body you can also easily do these with a resistance band if needed alright so here comes the most important part putting everything together you've learned into a workout routine that'll give you the shoulder growth you're looking for research shows that the front delts are already highly activated in many of the pricing movements you're already doing for example this study in particular showed the chest and front delts to be activated to almost the same degree during a bench press so since your front delts are likely already well developed you're only going to pick one main front delt exercise to do throughout the week you'll want to emphasize the side and rear delts more by picking two exercises from each of those categories you can do three to four sets of each exercise and throw those into your existing workouts throughout the week or do it all in one shoulder workout but once you find what exercises work best for you stay consistent with those week after week only if you strength plateaus in any of those exercises or you simply get bored of them should you then consider switching to another exercise from the list which typically happens every four to eight weeks guys failing to have a detailed plan of attack every time you work out is why so many people stay stuck despite years of training for science-based program that takes care of all the guesswork for you so that you can transform your body as efficiently as possible and simply head on over to build with science.com and take our analysis quiz to discover what program is best for you

    "title": "The Best Science-Based Leg Day For Growth (Quads/Glutes/Hamstrings) | PUSH PULL LEGS SERIES",
    "published_at": "2020-03-01T16:58:48Z",
    "transcript": "this video is the final installment of my three-part push-pull leg series that i've recently released in this video we're gonna cover your leg workout for the week it's designed to target the quads the glutes the hamstrings and the calves in a balanced and carefully thought-out manner by using both our anatomical understanding of these various muscles and the finites of current scientific literature so without further ado let's dive right into exercise one the first exercise shouldn't come as a surprise here and it's going to be barbell squats which have been shown to be a great exercise for developing the lower body musculature for instance a recent 2020 paper from the international journal sports medicine had a group of trained subjects perform only the back squat as their lower body training for a period of 12 weeks after the 12 weeks the subjects managed to grow their quads by an average of 12 percent and their glutes by roughly 9 confirming that the back squat is indeed a great exercise for growing not only the quads but the glutes as well now as for whether to perform back squats or front squats contrary to popular belief their muscle activation patterns are actually quite similar both squat variations have been shown to activate the quads the hamstrings and the glutes to a very similar degree with front squats providing just a slightly higher activation of the quads and back squats providing slightly better activation for the hamstrings however there are some unique benefits of the front squats that you should keep in mind first of all the front squat achieves this comparable level of muscle activation even when using roughly 20 percent lighter weight than the back squat and second of all research has shown that the front squat produces significantly lower compressive forces on the knee as well as reduce lumbar stress when compared to back squats which is due to the position of the bar and the decrease in forward trunkline that you experience with front squats meaning that for those with past knee injuries and lower back issues the front squat when performed correctly may be the better option for you and won't require you to lift this heavy yet will still be as effective as back squats regardless though incorporating both into your routine by for example perform the back squat on this leg day and then the front squat on your next leg day of the week is a great idea given the complementary muscle activation patterns that we see in the two variations and for both squat variations make sure to use a full range of motion down to at least parallel and relatively heavy weight with a moderate rep range of 6 to 10 reps next we're going to move on to barbell hip thrust to now prioritize the glutes as well as involve the hamstrings a little more this exercise can be argued as the perfect complementary exercise to the squat since they've been shown in research such as in this 2015 emg analysis to better activate these important posterior chain muscles than the squat does however with that being said a new paper that came out just this year shows how this greater muscle activation may not actually lead to better growth the researchers had a group of trained subjects either perform only hip thrusts or only back squats for a period of 12 weeks for all of their lower body training after the 12 weeks squats led to just over double the glute growth and hip thrusted which goes against some of our past beliefs that hip thrusts are king when it comes to the glutes so why would i still suggest that you incorporate them well first of all this is a relatively new finding and there has been some conflicting unofficial research by researcher brett contreras on identical twins showing that hip thrusts were the better exercise for glutes growth after a period of six weeks meaning that i just wouldn't take the previous study results as fact just quite yet and second of all we know that squats are a great glute builder given that they elicit a high amount of mechanical tension on the glute muscle fibers which is a primary stimulus of muscle growth hip thrusts on the other hand though provide less mechanical tension on the glutes but they do provide a much greater glutes contraction and puts a high amount of tension and metabolic stress in the glutes when they're in a shortened position at the top of the movement something that the squat just fails to do and lastly hip thrusts are very low impact on the joints and easy on the lower back yet they still enable you to lift heavy weight when compared to other glute exercises therefore since hip thrusts complement the squat so well in terms of a strength curve and they enable you to perform more heavy volume for your glutes with minimal additional stress on your joints including them in this routine is recommended and just some general tips when you perform them are to focus on posteriorly tilting the pelvis as you thrust the weight up avoid arching your lower back and position your feet such that your shins are vertical at the top position you can use a barbell to easily overload the movement here over time as your booty develops and will use a relatively high rep range of 12 to 15 reps here next it's time to move on to split squats to further target the quads but with considerable involvement from the glutes and hamstrings as well it's important to include at least one unilateral movement in this routine that trains one leg at a time in order to prevent imbalances from developing over time it was for the differences between the stationary split squat and walk-in lunges split squats do have a unique advantage first of all they're just easier and safer to learn for example research from the journal strength and conditioning research found that beginners that performed the walking lunge had quite the difficult time balancing and compensated for this by cutting their range of motion short while also reducing the activation of their all-important glute medius muscle during the movement whereas beginners who perform the split squat instead were able to perform it with full range of motion and a significantly higher glute medius activation which was helping them stabilize their body therefore starting out with a stationary split squat would be best and then once your balance improves with this rather than progressing them to walking lunges you can instead progress them to the bulgarian split squat where you elevate your rear leg this is arguably the better progression since it helps you now increase your range of motion enables you to better load and isolate your front leg by minimizing the contribution of your back leg and it also gives you a better chance to identify and address any strength differences between your two legs and then once you're able to comfortably do this variation what i'd recommend is to progress it once more by performing half of your sets with a contralateral bulgarian split squat where you're now just holding one dumbbell on the opposite hand as your front leg this dumbbell carrying position has been shown in a 2015 analysis to significantly boost the involvement of the glute medius since it now has to help stabilize the body by counteracting the weight on the opposing side which is beneficial since this muscle is pretty much neglected in virtually all compound leg movements yet it plays a very important role in stabilization balance and preventing and reducing knee pain and as an added bonus of this variation it also better activates the outer quads which can help balance out any inner versus outer quad imbalances you may be experiencing for these in the regular version we'll use moderately heavy weight for a rep range of roughly 8 to 12 reps lastly we're gonna move on to the glued hammers to now emphasize the hamstrings since they've yet to be prioritized very well in the past movements the blue hammers is a great exercise to do so since it's been shown in emg analyses like this one by mcallister and colleagues to elicit the greatest activation of the various hamstring muscles when compared to other common hamstring movements like the leg curl and the romania deadlift for example in addition one of the unique benefits of the glue hammer is is that it forces you to control your body weight on the way down or eccentric portion of every rep this is important given that research has shown that it's the eccentric strengthening of the hamstrings that seems to be the most important factor for not only enhancing your athletic performance such as with your vertical jump but also for better protecting your hamstrings from any future potential injuries or imbalances now to properly execute them you want to position your knees just behind the pad and then lower your body in a controlled fashion by contracting your hamstrings your head your back and your hips should all stay in line as your knees gradually straighten and then on the way up curl your body up by using your hamstrings while again keeping your upper body in a straight line and moving as one unit for those struggling with this though or just lack the equipment to do so a good alternative is to perform a similar movement but on a bosu ball against the wall the same form to supply here but you can make it easier by simply starting out with just doing the negatives by controlling yourself on the way down of every rep and then resetting to the top and repeating this motion you want to work towards using a rep range of roughly 10 to 15 reps and then you can even add weight over time once you're capable of doing so with proper form so to sum everything up for you here's what your leg workout could look like for calves i'd simply recommend adding in one standing calf raise exercise and one seated calf raise exercise to ensure that both calf muscles are hit and a mix of higher and lower rep ranges as for your other leg day during the week based on research i've gone through in past videos you want to ensure that you incorporate a hip dominant hamstring exercise like deadlifts into it as well as a knee dominate quadriceps exercise for optimal development of both of those muscles and then just simply use variations of the day one leg a day exercises to make up the rest of your volume for day two and lastly just as i did with the push and pull workouts i'll compile this leg workout into an easy to download free mobile friendly pdf for you to use and reference while you're at the gym it'll show you

    "title": "15 BEST Back Exercises For Growth (And How To Use Them)",
    "published_at": "2021-12-05T16:04:19Z",
    "transcript": "if you want a wider thicker more balanced back then there's four main regions your back exercises need to Target I'll show you the best exercises for each of these regions by the end of the video you'll have a personalized back routine that you can start run away all right so before we dive into the exercises let's first talk about the most common mistakes that people make when choosing their back exercises first mistake most people think of the back as one muscle and will aimlessly put together a back workout without giving much thought as to what each exercise targets for example as as you'll see in our exercises simply changing your elbow position as you roll will completely shift the muscles that are being targeted being unaware of these differences can lead to a back that may have a lot of width for example but lacks thickness in definition or vice versa speaking of muscle imbalances the second mistake people make has to do with neglecting the smaller back muscles that play an important role in keeping your shoulders healthy and posture upright the last mistake has to do with your workout program even if people are aware of the best exercises for the different back muscles they often end up doing too much volume for some and not enough for others which fails to develop the back in a well-rounded manner we're going to solve each of these problems by equipping you with the best exercises and then showing you how to properly use them let's start with the upper back so of the four main regions of our back this region is where most of your back thickness and definition is going to come from it consists of the upper traps the mid traps and the teres muscles now given the unique anatomy and function of these muscles they they are best work during exercises where the elbows pull at roughly a 45 to 60\u00b0 angle away from the Torso we'll apply this along with a few other tips to six exercises to make them the best options to build a thicker more defined B first up the barbell row but performed in a way that focuses on the upper back muscles the keys to do this are with your elbow angle and how high you pull the bar rather than keeping your elbows too close or too far out from the body tuck them to about 45 to 60\u00b0 as you pull then using an overhand grip play around with the grip width until you find a placement that allows you to pull the bar to the level of your chest focus on driving your elbows back and squeezing the shoulder blades together at the top next seated rows but similar to bball rows the key here is with elbow angle as you pull rather than keeping your elbows too close to the sides keep them at about a 45 to 60\u00b0 angle out from your torso keep your shoulder blades down as you pull and squeeze your shoulder blades together together at the end position using a wider handle here can make it even more effective this next exercise The Meadows row is a great way to help prevent imbalances by working one side of the back at a time use a land mine attachment and load it with smaller weight plates to increase range of motion our back muscles will go through get into an athletic stance as if you were doing a barbell row and then while keeping your elbow angled at about 60\u00b0 pull the bar up grip can get challenging here so use a lifting strap if needed to prevent your grip strength from limiting your back gains this next exercise is one of my personal favorites because it takes a need for stability out of the equation first set up your inkline bench too high of a bench angle is going to shift too much the emphasis to the upper traps so set it at a lower angle to about 30\u00b0 which is often the second Notch up on the bench then grab the pair of dumbbells lay with your stomach on the bench and then pull up to the level of your chest again with your elbows angled at about 45 to 60\u00b0 squeeze your shoulder blades together at the top and and let them open up at the bottom of each rep for full range of motion now we're going to get into our vertical pulling movements like the pull-up to emphasize the upper back muscles more than the lats you want to keep your elbows angled out to the sides by using an overhand grip slightly wider than shoulder width all right so this last exercise may come as a surprise given the name but based on the wide elbow angle used during lap pull Downs as we learned earlier this will biomechanically favor the upper back muscles more than it will the lasts which is why it's in this cat speaking of the lats though let's now dive into how we can best Target this next area of our back so the lats are a broad muscle that's responsible for adding more width to the back based on the way the muscle fibers run unlike the upper back muscles the lats are actually best targeted during exercises where the elbows can pull as close to the Torso as possible we're going to apply this along with a few other tips to make the next five exercises your best bet for growing a wider back all right so you remember how you performed the barell road to Target the the mid traps we're now going to tweak that to emphasize the lats more first use a narrower grip that's about shoulder width then when you pull this time keep your elbows as close to your sides as possible and then finally to maximize the range of motion your lats go through instead of pulling up to the chest pull lower down towards your belly button next we're going to apply similar Twee to the seated rows that I showed you earlier to now make them more lat focused first tuck your elbows close to your sides and keep them there as you row second avoid arch in your back as you pull as that's going to shift more of the load to your upper back instead keep your torso straight or if you can maintain just a slight lean forward to favor the lats even more and finally rather than thinking about squeezing your shoulder blades together think about driving your elbow down and back as you pull okay back to one of my personal favorites the chest supported row but now with the elbows angled close to the sides and pulling lower down the body as if you're trying to tuck your elbows into your back pockets next next similar to the Meador for the upper back to prevent imbalances from developing we can do single dumbbell lat rows here we'll want to again keep the elbows tucked and think about pulling your elbows down towards your back pockets our last exercise will be a pull down but one that actually targets the lats to perform it get into a kneeling stance in front of a cable machine grab the handle with a neutral grip lean your torso forward slightly and then pull your elbow down while keeping your elbow as close as possible to your sides by the way guys if if you're enjoying this video and you think that I should do another one just like this as part of series then comment below what muscle group you'd like to see and I'll cover that next but for now let's get back to training the third region of our back all right so we've covered the big muscles that'll add thickness and width to our back now we need to balance this out by working the lower traps a small yet important muscle that tends to get neglected research such as this 2008 paper has shown that this muscle is best worked by matching our arm angle to the direction the lower TR muscle fibers run which ends up being between a 90 to 120\u00b0 angle a simple yet effective exercise to implement this is by either laying on the floor bench and raising your arms to make a wide y shape if this is too difficult though you can make it easier by using an incline bench while research shows that performing these with your shoulder internally rotated so thumbs down leads to slightly greater activation of the lower traps this may not be the most comfortable position for everyone try it with thumbs down or thumbs up and see which best engages your lower trap muscles another great way to train this muscle is to utilize cables or a band since it helps provide constant tension throughout each rep to do so set up a cable to about waist level and grab the right cable with your left hand and vice versa to crisscross brace your core and squeeze your glutes to prevent your lower back from marching and then raise your arms up in that same y shape at about 120\u00b0 before we dive into how to actually Implement these back exercises we need to cover the last area the lower back research has actually shown that these muscles are already highly activated whenever we do compound lists like row squats and deadlifts despite this including some form of isolation work for the lower back can be beneficial if you don't do many of these lifts or if your lower back seems to be a weak link limiting your strength in these key movements to do so we're going to use back extensions but it's important that you get the setup right to maximize its benefit start by positioning your pelvis at the top of the pad or just past it then you're going to lower yourself down to the bottom position while keeping a neutral spine and then raise back up but avoid going into hyperextension instead stop once your torso is in line with your legs and no further now is the most important part putting together everything you've learned into a balanced back routine that works for you here's what I recommend pick two exercises from the upper back category two exercises from the lats category and then one exercise from the lower traps category dep depending on your existing lower back training volume you can choose to add in some back extensions to this as well here's an example of how you can do so if you have access to a gym and here's an example if you only have dumbbells and you can choose to either throw all these exercises into one back workout per week or sprinkle them into a couple of your workouts throughout the week instead and anywhere between about 3 to five sets for each of the exercises will be the right amount of volume for most of you to maximize your back growth but do experiment with it and see what works best for you there is a lot of thought that goes into picking the right exercises as well as putting them together properly within my bu with science programs though I take care of all the guesswork for you by showing you exactly how to train and how to eat week after week based on your specific goal to start today just take my free 30C quiz at builtwith science.com and I'll let you know which of my step-by-step programs will best help you transform

    "title": "How To Unf*ck Your Hips In 10 Minutes | Corrective Routine",
    "published_at": "2021-05-16T15:08:22Z",
    "transcript": "are your hips tight do they ache or just feel off when you squat do you shift more to the left or right or when standing have you noticed that one of your hips is higher than the other if you said yes to any of those things then you may have a hip asymmetry sometimes hip asymmetry happens because of the way that you're built like if one of your legs is longer than the other but in most cases hip asymmetry occurs when you have muscular imbalances that you've developed from lifting or doing any kind of repetitive task like simply sitting a certain way is this problematic well although various asymmetries in the body are expected and perfectly normal when it starts to cause pain discomfort or affect your lips is when it can start to be a problem and worth addressing today i'm going to show you three tests you can perform to see if you currently have asymmetries in your hips if you test positive in any of these three tests i'll give you a home exercise program that focuses on strengthening weak structures and mobilizing tight structures to restore balance in your hips perfectly balanced this whole thing should be test one stand in front of a mirror and palpate the top of your hip bones and orient your hands flat to the floor compare the level of your hands if one hand sits higher than the other then you may be positive for an unevenness in hip height again this isn't necessarily problematic and in many cases this is normal but for some individuals is a good thing to adjust for the reasons discussed earlier however this test is a static test and your deficits may only reveal themselves when you're moving which is where test 2 comes in so test 2 is looking for a phenomenon called the trendelenburg side for this test again stand in front of the mirror or take a video from behind you level with your hips then raise one leg so that your foot is off the ground hold this position for 30 seconds repeat this test on the other side if you struggle the balance when doing this test then you can lightly hold on to a wall for support now normally the pelvis of the raised leg should rise a little bit as shown here which would indicate a negative test if the pelvis of the raised leg drops however and the trunk muscles flex towards your planted leg then that would indicate a positive test as for why this happens whenever you get into a single leg stance the hip muscles like the glute medius of the grounded leg have to work to stabilize your upper body over your pelvis if these muscles are weak then they're unable to stabilize the pelvis in this case the trunk muscles like the abdominals will take over their jaw by contracting and flexing your upper body to the side of the planted leg which is why we see that hip drop towards the lifted leg in a positive test so for example if you tested positive when raising your right leg then that's an indication of weakness in the glute medius of your left leg and vice versa strengthening this muscle can help restore balance for test three we're going to take this one step further and assess your hip symmetry when lifting next time you squat look in the mirror and pay attention to your hips as they come up from the bottom better yet film yourself from the front and back during your next hard working set of squats ideally your hips should rise symmetrically and in parallel what some of you may notice however is that you preferentially favor squatting through one side more than the other causing a subtle shift to the left or right as you squat sometimes this is caused by strength and balance where you preferentially shift towards your stronger hip which may have been revealed for you in our previous test in other cases this is caused by a side to side hip mobility imbalance specifically with external rotation both of which will be addressed in our corrective routine so now that we've run through the test we're ready for the fix which is going to involve a simple yet effective two-step plan that anybody who tested positive for any of those previous tests can start incorporating right away to help improve any potential asymmetries step one is all about mobility the first exercise focuses on the hips with what's known as a 90 90 drill to perform it sit on the ground with one leg bent in front of the other like so then while keeping your torso stacked over your hips transition from one side to the other by opening up your hips some of you may find that your front leg on one side has a more difficult time keeping its knee on the floor which is a good indication that it's limited in that hips ability to externally rotate you can spend more time on that tighter side and if needed you can support your body up with your arms as your mobility improves you can progress this move by bending your upper body over your front leg to get an even deeper stretch do this for three sets of 10 reps each side the second exercise is called the teapot this exercise is used to mobilize two muscles that can lead to a hip being elevated or depressed for example a tight ql can pull up the iliac crest and cause it to be elevated whereas a tight tfl can pull down on the iliac crest and cause it to depress this exercise will target both of these muscles to perform it stand with your back against the wall for support and cross your target leg behind the other one put one hand on your pelvis and reach the other hand overhead you want to bend away from the target side as you do so you should feel a gentle stretch in your lower back and hips opposite to the side that you're reaching towards hold the end position for one to two seconds and then return to neutral do this for three sets of ten reps each side [Music] now we're ready to move on to step two strengthening which is arguably the most important step mobilizing is a great way to help with short-term pain and mobility improvements but gains from strengthening last much longer which is why a combination of both is great to get both short-term and long-lasting gains to do so we'll use a progression going from two easier exercises in level one to two more difficult exercises in level two for you to move on to once you're ready the first exercise in level one is the hip drop which is going to work your glute medius isometrically as they stabilize the hips for this exercise find a small step or hop on a stable stack of books you'll proceed to place one leg firmly on the step while the other leg hovers over the edge place your hands on your hips and begin to slowly lower your foot to the ground by letting the hip of that side drop towards the floor your planted leg should be kept straight at the bottom position the hand of your dropped leg should be lower than the hand of your planted leg hold this for one to two seconds and then raise back up to neutral in a controlled manner thinking about using the outer hip muscles on the side of the planted leg when we drop the hip we're strengthening the opposite glute medius which is isometrically contracting and that's where you want to feel it so repeat this exercise on both sides for about three sets of eight to ten reps [Music] the next exercise of this level is the sideline hip abduction or what i like to call the jane fonda one two for this exercise lay down on your side with your hips stacked on top of each other bottom leg bent and think about driving that bottom knee into the ground for stability then keeping your top leg straight raise it not just up but slightly backwards as well as this is key to engaging the glute medius rather than other muscles when done properly you should feel this in the outer butt of the top leg hold the top for one second and slowly lower repeat on both sides for three sets of eight to ten reps and for these exercises it's also a good idea to train your weaker side first just to help prioritize it a little bit more so once you've mastered level one and your strength improves you can move on to level two the first exercise in level two is what's called hip airplanes an excellent move that was first brought to my attention by renowned researcher dr stewart mcgill the great thing about this exercise is that it not only helps improve the hip strength of your planted leg but it also works on your overall hip mobility at the same time to perform these i'd recommend starting out with assistance by holding onto a table or any fixture for balance keep one leg planted on the ground grip the floor with your planted foot and then rotate your torso forward while kicking your back leg behind you keep your back leg completely straight and the knee of your planted leg in a slightly bent position next slowly rotate your hips in towards your planted leg and then away from it by opening up your hips a cue that may help is to think about simply moving your belly button towards your planted leg and then away to the side you want the movement to come from your hips as opposed to simply twisting your upper body when done properly you should feel a stretch in your upper groin and you should also feel the glute medius of your planted leg kicking in to stabilize you aim for about three sets of just three to five slow and controlled reps on each side many of you will find that one side is much harder to stabilize or more restricted than the other in which case you want to spend just a little bit more time working on that side once you're capable you can then progress this move by using less assistance for example just one arm instead of two and then eventually you can progress to no assistance by keeping your hands on your hip bones or out to your sides like so [Music] the second exercise of this level is the rnt squat which helps tie everything together functionally and is especially helpful if you tested positive for hip shift when squatting to perform these wrap a light resistance band around a fixture and loop it around your knee such that it's pulling in towards your hip shift for example if you hip shift to the left one squatting you'd want to wrap it around your right knee such that it pulls in towards the left and vice versa if your hip shift was to the right instead after you set this up squat down and pause for two seconds in the bottom position while avoiding letting your banded knee collapse inwards by pulling your body into the hip shift your body will learn to reflexively pull out of that dysfunction by activating the weaker glute and getting you back to where you want it to go aim for about 3 sets of 6 to 8 reps [Music] now let's put this all together for you into a simple yet effective 10 minute corrective routine start out with the mobility exercises and level 1 strengthening exercises once you feel that level 1 becomes too easy then progress to level 2. you want to perform the four exercises for whatever level that you're on in order and as a routine at least two to three times a week this can be done at any time of the day or as part of your warm-up routine before a lower body workout for example and then after you've used this routine for a little while it's important to retest your hip balance using whichever test you failed on just to see if there's been any improvements then once your asymmetries have been significantly improved you won't need to do these exercises as often but you should still consider incorporating some of them into your weekly routine while just making an effort to get off your butt and move more in general as this is what's going to be key for long lasting results but overall it's important to pay attention to often neglected muscles like the ones i went through in this video to prevent potential imbalances and injuries from creeping up

    "published_at": "2024-12-22T13:30:33Z",
    "transcript": "15 16 give me 20 this is Kevin recently he followed my diet plan and lost an impressive 12 lb but now we're taking it up an onch let's go Kevin push what happens if he takes on my intense training program for the next 30 days could what I do really work for a beginner with a completely different body type or will the training be too much for him both physically and mentally let's find out Cong congrats dude dude who's cleaning this up people love the video so much that we're doing another one okay so now for the next 30 days you're going to copy my training plan don't think I can do that we're going to try our best we're going to see what happens all right we will just do a little bit of warmup so before today Kevin's work plan consisted of three full body workouts per week each being about 45 minutes long with my program however his workouts will jump to five workouts per week we'll be training upper body on Mondays and Thursdays lower body on Tuesday and Fridays and doing accessory work on Saturday with each workout lasting at least an hour for my own workouts I often use a system called reverse pyramid sets reverse pyramid training involves doing your first set with the heaviest weight and aiming for lower reps after that you drop the weight by about 10% for the rest of your sets this approach builds strength with the first heavy set but also maximizes muscle growth by allowing you to do more reps and overall volume in your following sets give me two more let's go control good form good form even on your last rep though you know how you're just like you were done and you're like all right boom I'm tired bro so with Kevin and I pushing each set close to failure our chest is going to need some time to recover between sets but to still get the most volume out of my workouts I like to Su set my training so while my chest is recovering I can switch over and start working an opposing muscle group like my lasts it's a proven approach that can help you do more and less time Slow Down slow down slow down there you go remember don't let gravity do the work for you on the way up your body's going to want to just let it pull you got to resist that couple more of these there's no rest time we're going to drop it down all right this is your hydration where's your water do you have a water bottle I do but I left protein powder in it for like a week and now I don't want to ever use it again well you got to tell me these things now you can't be drinking zero zero calories hey even has protein in it not joshing you dude and even without a good source of hydration Kevin did manage to push himself all the way to the end of the workout T you have officially finished Kevin is starting this program at 216 lb and before our first workout I also tested his strength with Max chin-ups where we managed to get two maybe a half reps as well as his max push-ups I give you eight and three of those were like we're good if we could get 20 that would be huge another 30-day thing that core brace back straight there we go way better stick that butt back nice show them your calves oh my God look at these I have to do calves today but you my friends you get a free pass but because one exercise is a great fit for me doesn't always mean it's a great fit for Kevin for example when I tried running Kevin through dips the exercise was way too challenging so we had to swap them for an easier exercise that still hits the lower chest incline push-ups nice I also noticed after seeing Kevin squat that his body is incredibly quad dominant whereas my body structure makes my squat naturally more glute dominant but with all the sitting Kevin does every day I needed to tweak his squats to hit his glutes more and so normally he'd squat super deep keep his torso upright and drive his knees forward so to work his glutes more I had him instead focus on pushing his hips back bending his torso over forward and limit how much his knees were coming forward sit back there good not bad who's your favorite anime character that gives you motivation Aaron joerger the attack Titan is that your goal physique yeah he's Jack to the Bone so we're going to get you to Aaron jager's shape yeah okay let's go it's going to take a few years all right so the plan today is we're not going too crazy again it's a rest day we're still trying to get moving we did Legs yesterday so exactly we'll just do one lot getting the legs now most people associate rest days with doing absolutely nothing at least that's what Kevin had in mind but doing the right amount of movement can actually help speed up Kevin's Muscle Recovery and Not only was Kevin's poor conditioning holding them back from his workouts in the gym but there's some new research suggesting that improving your cardiovascular fitness may actually provide benefits in blood flow inside your muscles and lead to faster muscle growth So today we're going to get Kevin moving but also do a few higher intensity workouts to get his heart really pumping let's go let's go go keep walking keep walking interval training good for the heart you go look at everyone else just chilling boom we're at 47. 37 that's not a bad that's not a bad start it feels worse when the camera guys is like we're going to do two more of those what the normal Engineers have stand up at 11 yeah in all seriousness it's terrible we're just going to do a cool down lot you didn't even have to whip out the Naruto form what what dusted you dude Nar we're going to give 65s a try today let's go Kev push and after just 10 days on my program Kevin was already seeing his performance improve in his chest press as well as his [Music] chinups three come on give me one more oh oh my God that bro let's freaking go man now I can see why people do 5 days a week you can actually exert more the full body workouts like by the time you're like 2/3 of the way through you're like completely gassed 5day split is uh I'm I'm still saying I should do it I'm I see why okay okay about to head in to the office Jeremy has me doing these hourlong workouts but there's also this secret project that I'm supposed to be working on and I think I just need way more time to work on this this is crazy and while while I can't wait to talk more about that project K is working on at the end of this video I do want to make sure he actually has time to finish it so I decided to run them through my go-to time-saving workout routine for whenever I'm purly crunched on time so the technique I'm using here is called rest paw sets let's say you normally do three sets of 10 reps that's a total of 30 reps so with rest pause sets you use the exact same weight and instead try to do as many reps as you can on your first set rest just 15 to 30 seconds and then again try to do as many reps as you can and repeat that until you get to 30 reps total research suggests that this technique can get you the same and potentially even more muscle growth yet cut down your workout time by more than half since you're spending far less time resting but it definitely comes at a cost I don't think this working last one I'll spot you up all right good slow on the way down slow on the way down quick but more intense uh so we're going to do that to the next exercise the next exercise and then you're done you're out of here and while we did get Kevin through his workout in just 30 minutes he had no interest in trying this workout again people should just do their normal set rest their normal appropriate time and do the best they can but even though though Kevin wasn't thrilled with my first attempt at condensing his workouts research shows there's a much easier way to reduce his workout time while still making progress you see my workout program is designed to maximize gains which means I'm doing a lot of volume at least three to four sets for most exercises but a recent study from my good friend Dr Brad shonfeld's lab found that even doing just one set per exercise can still lead to significant gains as long as you're pushing hard enough so while Kevin might not maximize his Gams with this approach he'd happily trade a little bit of muscle for cutting his workouts down by a third but Kevin wasn't always excited about the exercises I planned for him I quickly learned that squats in particular are one of his most hated movements but rather than forcing Kevin to just grind it out I gave him some options one of them the leg press he actually seemed pretty excited about nice keep going how would you rank the enjoyment of squats I like a solid two leg press the set you just did seven 7 out of 10 for the leg press but will machines like the leg press still get them just as good gains compared to squats well a metod analysis done back in 2022 attempted to answer that question they compare the strength and muscle gains you get from free weights like the barbell squat or barbell bench press to machines like the leg press or smith machine the result well whatever exercise participants trained with they got better strength gains with which is expected strength is a skill and you get better coordinated with ex exercises that you practice more often but as for muscle growth there were no differences now keep in mind that depending on the type of machine you use and how you use it it could work different muscles compared to the free weight version but in the case of Kevin's leg press I showed him a few tweaks to make it replicate his squats quite well and since this was the first leg exercise he actually didn't seem to hate making that switch was a no-brainer we're back on the track for another rest day it's cold man but we got records to beat we're going to on the 200 met again see if we can beat Kevin's time from last time which was 47 seconds I'm hopeful go push keep pushing keep pushing almost there 41 seconds that's 6 seconds F last time that's a PR I never want to run again look at this dude it's the final week oh buddy you're going to be Romania deadlifting he's big 45 plates 10 two more two more come on come on K one more 12 baby [Music] nice damn dude look at this meaty mey tricep what's the number 238 23.8 that sounds familiar but while Kevin's weight loss hasn't actually changed much I'm not overly concerned with every single lift in the the gym going up and with Kevin now training with a lot more intensity and volume than he was before there is a strong chance that he's building muscle as he's losing fat also known as body recomposition which is causing his weight on the scale to more or less stay the same even though he's making progress as long as we're continuing to see progress and you're getting stronger I don't care if we stay at 23.8 you know just a number it's just a number that's said I have noticed that ever since we started training harder Kevin's assumed that he can slack off on his diet he hasn't tracked his calories as much as he used to and I also found out that he was eating a lot more than normal on our track days thinking he was burning a ton of calories in reality our whole track workout could be offset by eating just half a muffin now if only there was a tool that took care of everything for you a simple way to track both your training and your nutrition all in one place well remember that secret project Kevin and I I've been working on so as great as my videos and online programs are I still get messages from you guys all over the world asking for oneon-one coaching wanting something specifically tailored for you and trust me as much as I would love to personally work with you guys oneon-one it just wouldn't be feasible so back in 2019 I set out to create something that could give you the personalized coaching experience you deserve an all inone Fitness and Nutrition Solution that's the closest thing to being able to work with me oneon-one no matter matter where you are in the world and with Kevin's help it's almost here in the first week of January our secret project will go live you can check out builtwith sci. for updates and subscribe to my YouTube channel where I'll post the an announcement for now though please comment below keep going Kevin to give him some encouragement not just with this fitness journey but with finishing up this incredible project for you guys he's also going to need a lot more than Koke zeros because we're about to test his final results oh my God go that final 50 m when you slow down it's all mental I mean a bit of it is physical but a lot of it is mental [Music] go oh boy let's go dude and when we tested Kevin's strength the following day one two three keep going Kev come on four try to give me one more off off off let's go oh baby his chin UPS jump from two on day one all the way to five chin-ups by day 30 as for his push-ups one two 18 two more come on Kev all the way down all the way down last one up 20y baby holy and one we tested his final weight loss 23.6 Kevin not only dropped 3 lb on the scale but also lost 2 and 1/2 CM off his waistline considering his huge strength gains this is a really good indication that Kevin was building muscle as he was losing fat and you can definitely see the difference in his photos every day Kevin is getting just a little closer to his final airon Jagger form soon Kevin very soon I'm proud of you man how do you feel tired okay but you're at least a little proud of yourself I'm I'm a little proud of myself yes now if you're also ready to Kickstart your fitness journey head over to

    "title": "The Best Science-Based DUMBBELL Biceps Exercises For Size And Shape",
    "published_at": "2019-08-18T14:55:13Z",
    "transcript": "if you're seeking to maximize your biceps growth then you need to ensure that you're incorporating enough dumbbell biceps exercises into your routines and this is crucial since dumbbell exercise is not only better prevents muscle imbalances from developing in your biceps when compared to their barbell counterparts but as you'll see in this video they also enable us to manipulate our biceps exercises to boost growth in ways that simply aren't possible with the use of barbells so if you'd like to boost your biceps growth by adding more dumbbell work into your routine or on the other hand you only have access to dumbbells then stick around as I'll go through the best dumbbell exercises you can use to target each portion of your biceps and add the size that you're after the first exercise is a seated concentration curl and is going to be used to preferentially target the short head or inner part of the biceps we could do this by placing the arms slightly in front of the body during the curl which we know biomechanically enables you to favour the short head more and this exercise is a highly effective exercise to include in your biceps training since is shown in the two following umji analyses it tends to outperform other common biceps exercises in terms of eliciting the highest biceps activation we should researchers speculated is because by having your upper arm pressed against your leg it better prevents you from swaying your arm as you curl when compared to other biceps exercises and as a result this effectively minimizes the involvement of the front delts during each rep and enables you to better isolate the biceps instead hence the greater activation however in order to better target the short head of the biceps and maximize the overall effectiveness of this exercise you want to implement a few key points as you perform it first we know based on EMG analyses of the short head of the biceps that its activation is maximized with combined flexion of the arm and supination of the wrist meaning that during each rep you want to be turning your wrist out to bring your pinkies up towards the ceiling much as possible in order to fully activate the short head but to take this even one step further you can modify your grip by moving your hands such that when your palms are up it grips on the outer part of the dumbbell rather than in the middle this will now ship more of the weight into the pinkies of your hand which then increases a degree of active supination needed to curl and twist the wrist therefore leading to even greater involvement of the short head and then to potentially boost growth even more after your normal set is complete and you can no longer perform additional reps you can continue the set by performing a few more reps with assistance from your other hand during the way up with a curl and then slowly letting the weight down without assistance during the eccentric as doing so has been shown to significantly boost activation of the biceps even further by enabling you to continue essentially working with a way you otherwise would not be able to next we're going to target the long head or outer head of the biceps using the incline dumbbell curl which many of you know is one of my favorite biceps exercises for a variety of reasons first of all we know that by placing the arm behind the body during the curl we can now preferentially target the long head of the biceps due to its Anatomy what's more though is that as shown in this graph from the paper from the journal sports science and medicine the incline dumbbell curl is unique in its strength curve such that it elicits a fairly high neuromuscular activation of the biceps throughout each phase of the curl as opposed to just the beginning or just the end for example which is the case with many other common biceps exercises leading the researchers and myself to highly recommend the incline dumbbell curl to maximize biceps growth however as we saw with the concentration curl its effectiveness depends on how you perform the exercise and some key points you want to remember as you perform it or to keep your elbow pinned and locked in place to minimize any front delt involvement a few degrees of movement is fine but it should not be excessive to the point where the delts begin to take over you also don't want to cheat by rolling the shoulders forward as this reduces the range of motion that you put the biceps through can start to get the traps involved as well instead keep your shoulder blades pinned back as you perform each rep and maintain this even as you begin to fatigue doing so will minimize the tension place on unwanted muscle groups and instead maximize the growth of the biceps lastly we're going to target the brachialis which is not only responsible for some of the mass of the Oder arm but it also anatomically pushes up the biceps to create the illusion of a wider and thicker appearing arm now to effectively target this muscle we'll want to play around with our grip by incorporating hammer curls this is because due to the biceps anatomy as a degree of pronation increases and the biceps tendon winds more and more around the radius the potential for maximum force development decreases and the brachialis now takes over instead so by gripping the dumbo with a more pronated grip as if we were holding a hammer we can now in a wrist friendly way effectively shift some of the tension away from the biceps and onto the brachialis when we curl however to emphasize the brachialis even further with this exercise we can implement the finance of the 2001 paper from the American College of Sports Medicine which has shown the following graph found that if you slow down the eccentric portion of the curl you're able to further decrease the involvement of the biceps and instead significantly increase out of the brachialis even more as a result which can be easily implemented into the hammer curl by simply implementing a three to five seconds slow eccentric during the way down of each rep as this will enable you to isolate the brachialis that much more so here's a quick summary of the dumbbell exercises I went through targeting each region of the biceps with the recommended sets and reps feel free to do this as a workout on its own or you can split it up and add one or two of the exercises to your existing workouts instead what also suggests playing around with the order of the biceps exercises since we know that lifters experience greater gains for exercises that are done early on in the workout so if you're long head or outer bicep for example is notice we'll be lagging behind compared to your short head or inner bicep the want to perform the incline dumbbell curls first in your workout in order to prioritize the blockheads development this way you'll be able to see more balanced biceps growth in the long run I hope you guys enjoyed the video but just remember like I've said in the past if you want to build muscle and stop wasting your time in the gym then it's absolutely vital that you not only choose the right exercises but you need to perform these exercises in a way that's been proven to be most effective and that's exactly why within my build with science programs we've not only carefully selected each and every exercise included in your step-by-step routines but we've also taken the time to create in-depth tutorials for each exercise such that you know exactly how to perform them optimally in order to build muscle as fast as possible

    "title": "The 4 BEST Glute Exercises For A Nicer Butt (GYM OR HOME!) Ft. Bret Contreras",
    "published_at": "2021-01-31T17:22:44Z",
    "transcript": "[Music] your butt is home to a powerful group of muscles that play a key role in many movements of course they just look good when they're well developed on both men and women but they're also a muscle group that many tend to struggle with developing and strengthening this can not only potentially lead to problems and imbalances elsewhere in the body but can also lead to the dreaded pancake butt to fix this and to maximize your glutes development you need to first realize that they're designed to do much more than just squat and deadlift and that you can experience much more overall growth and strength in the different regions and muscles that make up your glutes by simply implementing the right variety of glutes exercises now although the best exercises for the glutes will vary individually generally if we want to maximize the goose development then you want to ensure that you're training them with at least one exercise from each of the following four categories and this applies to both men and women the first category is a thrust or bridge exercise to build the upper and lower glutes and will provide the most amount of tension on the glutes when they're in the fully contracted position the second category is a squat or lunge exercise to emphasize the lower glutes and quads and will provide the most amount of tension on the glutes when they're in a fully stretched position the third category is a hinge or pull exercise to emphasize the lower glutes in the hamstrings and the fourth category is an abduction movement which will mostly emphasize the upper glutes by targeting the glute medius a muscle that's often left neglected choosing an exercise in each of these four categories helps provide not only total glute development but total leg development as well now as for what the best exercise is for each of these four categories that is going to vary individually but some options are definitely better than others and to help us out with choosing what an appropriate exercise would be for each of these four categories we're going to rely on the expertise of brett contreras aka the glute guy a well-known published researcher and author who's had the pleasure of studying loose for over 20 years and was actually the one who initially popularized the hip thrust here's what he recommended all right so brad going into the first category of a thrust or bridge movement for the entire gluteal region what would you suggest is a good exercise to throw on this one well i would just say the the just a barbell hip dress and i like pausing at the top two if possible so the pause barbell hip thrust would be my exercise as a choice for that category in terms of execution what are some cues and form tips that you could give to help maximize glutes activation of this movement so for the hip thrust uh the general form there's two different strategies one is the posterior pelvic tilt method where you're looking forward you move mostly from the sternum down and you kind of scoop the weight up and posteriorly rotate the pelvis into lockout two-thirds of people prefer it that way one-third of people prefer the hinge method where you think of your head and neck and spa and torso is a solid unit you you you're looking forward at the bottom when you come to the top you're looking up you keep it keep it in neutral in general you want a horizontal torso at lockout you want neutral or poster tilted hips but that happens naturally if you squeeze the glutes hard at lockout and then you want vertical shins when you're at the top uh so like the knees stacked over the the feet um but that happens naturally uh if you have the foot distance at the right place not too far away not too close so knees stacked over the heels and avoid overextending at the top position and just focus on squeezing the glutes as hard as you can at the top main thing is to avoid spinal hyperextension and excessive anterior pelvic tilt at the top and for those who are limited in terms of equipment a suitable alternative that brett recommends would be the single leg hip thrust with your back resting on a bench couch or any elevated platform and for this movement you actually want to execute it using the hinge method that he previously described which involves focusing on keeping your head your neck and your torso in alignment and neutral as you execute each rep and then now going into the squat lunge movement for the lower glutes and the quads what would you recommend here if you follow dr brad schoenfeld's research he's a hypertrophy expert he will say that you know mechanical tension is the most important mechanism for muscle hypertrophy but then metabolic stress and muscle damage likely play a role well with the hip thrust you're going to get lots of tension you'll also get a lot of metabox stress but you don't go deep you don't get a lot of stretch in the glutes with the hip thrust so this is why the lunge complements the hip dress very well with the lunge you get a stretch in the glutes and it's the hardest at the bottom whereas the hip thrust is hardest at lockout the lunge is hardest in the stretch and so you'll actually be sore the next day and you'll develop you know some soreness which is likely related to muscle damage so you're getting a little bit of muscle damage not too much though when you do the lunge you want to do them in a way that maximizes like you know the glutes like the effect on the glutes so instead of you don't want to take too short of a stride because then you're working more quads and you don't want too long of a stride because then you bring your hamstrings into play more so i like the tibia angle the knee travels forward a little bit but not too much and not too but doesn't stay vertical it doesn't go too far forward at the bottom of the movement your knee the front of your knee would be lined up with the the front of your shoes that's to me the the the form that maximizes glute activation and you're going to lean a little bit but you're only going to lean like say 20 degree torso lean not 45 degrees you don't lean too much push through the heel don't let the hips shoot up that's the most important thing don't turn into like a good morning where you shoot the hips up and then uh so if this is your torso at the bottom that's how it stays for the first half of the movement you don't go like that for those with limited equipment then a viable alternative would be something like the deficit reverse lunge where you elevate your front foot um and it can vary how much you elevate that front foot just depending on what you have and then a similar execution in terms of form would be applied to this one as you did with the walk-in dumbbell lunge right yes next we have the hinge or pull movement for the lower glutes and hamstrings what would be your exercise of choice for this one so my choice would be the dumbbell 45 degree hyper and the reasons why it really leads to very high like when i was doing emg experiments i was very surprised how high the glute activation is but you also get very high hamstring activation because the knees are straight and therefore the hamstrings are much better positioned to produce force compared to when the knees are bent as in the case of a bridge or a thrust but it's also a very safe exercise like anecdotally you don't get nearly as many injuries with the dumbbell 45 degree hyper as you do say the deadlift or the good morning so you can do them frequently week in and week out and not have to worry i've also found that executing this exercise it seems to be pretty tricky for a lot of individuals are there any quick tips that you can provide to help clear this up now we do this two different ways option one is the neutral neutral neutral feet neutral spine that's going to work the hamstrings the glutes and the erectors very well if you are trying to bias the glutes you want to round over fully round over the spine it's kind of hard for some people to do that the reason why is now you're not erecting the spine you're not activating the erectors they completely shut down and now that they're shut down it's more it's a pure gluten hamstring movement but you also flare the feet out 45 degrees turning the feet out puts the glutes in a better position to activate they get higher activation in that way and so when people try the round back method a lot of times it's the first time that they uh feel the glutes like fatigue first in a back extension and then as far as alternatives this one does seem a little bit tricky to to replace at home but would you say something like reverse hyper extensions done on a bench or even a countertop would be suitable yep an even new reverse hyper is very controlled if you have a very tall surface you can have straight legs i like doing spread eagle method which means you'll start narrow at the bottom and end wide at the top and you kind of go like that if you have a low bench like say you just had like a bench press you could still do them you'll just bend the legs at the bottom and then kick the legs out at the top so lastly we have the abduction movement for the upper glutes what exercise would you recommend here and how exactly do we go about performing so i choose the bodyweight sideline hip raise what's nice about this is it's just body weight you can do it anywhere this is going to hit the upper glutes so it's when you're at the bottom of the movement it's going to work the entire glute like glute max glute medius but when you're at the lockout you're more in the frontal plane so it's going to focus more of the lockouts more targeted in the gluteus medius now the way you do this you start off in a side plank position kind of like a on your elbow but your your body's on the ground your hips and knees are touching the ground kind of as if you were doing a sideline clam but on your elbow then you push through the grounded knee push as tall as you can and you're going to have achieve you aim to achieve maximum hip separation so both legs abduct as much as possible when you're at the top and you kind of drive the hips forward and then on the way down you sink the hips back and you're gonna feel it in the entire glute uh i do three sets of 12 with a nice controlled tempo i don't try to get three sets of 30 over time i always just do between 10 and 15 and my glutes are lit up after three sets of these another great alternative for this and the move recommended by brett are seated banded hip abductions here you're going to take a mini band wrap it around your knees and perform reps of pushing your knees out by using your upper glutes perform 10 to 15 reps with your back straight up 10 to 15 reps through the back bent over and then another 10 to 15 reps with the lean back these various positions are just going to help stimulate different fibers and different regions of your glutes so to sum everything up for you here are the recommended exercises with reps and sets for each of the four categories you can add these exercises into your weekly routine as needed or even perform it as a complete lower body workout on its own but hopefully you're able to see that in order to speed up your results and train efficiently then you need to pay close attention to both the exercises that you include in your routine but then also how you go about implementing and performing them and for a complete step-by-step science-based program that shows you exactly how to train eat and

    "title": "How To SCULPT Your Lower Abs: 3 Key Exercises You Should Be Doing",
    "published_at": "2019-09-08T16:30:04Z",
    "transcript": "[Music] the lower abs are one of the most important features that you want to develop if you seeking to complete a well-defined 6-pack and achieve an attractive looking midsection however it's also typically the most difficult part of the ABS to reveal which is mostly due to the low level of body fat you'll need to achieve in order to do so and in something that nutrition will be largely responsible for but although nutrition will play a huge role in revealing your lower abs just like any other muscle you can actually prioritize and develop this region of the ABS to make them more visible and pop even at a higher body fat percentage and the way you do this is by first choosing the right lower abs exercises and then performing and progressing them in the right manner and in this video that's exactly what I'll show you how to do but before we dive into the exercises for those who believe that the lower abs cannot be selectively targeted research clearly indicates that it is indeed possible this is because the upper and lower abs are actually innervated by different nerves and this hence provides a mechanism for selective activation and in fact researcher Brett Contreras has performed extensive research on this very topic with his youngji findings concluding that the upper and lower abs can beyond a shadow of doubt be selectively emphasized depending on the type of exercise you perform more specifically though top-down ab exercises that involve bring your shoulders down towards your hips such as crunches are going to preferentially activate the upper abs more so than the lower abs whereas bottom-up ab exercises that involve bringing your hips up towards your shoulders such as like raises are going to instead preferentially activate the lower abs more so than the upper abs so now that we know the theory behind lower abs exercises let's take a look at the best ones you can do to start developing this region the first exercise reverse crunches is going to enable us to target the lower abs but bringing the pelvis up towards the shoulders and while though this is a well-known exercise most people just don't proof in a way that actually targets and activates the lower abs well most people do is they aimlessly swing their legs up and down which makes the movement more of a hip flexor exercise and momentum ends up driving the movement rather than the lower abs and in fact this was actually proven in a study that looked at the reverse crunch they found that subjects who perform the movement using the form I previously described were unable to effectively target the lower abs where subjects who perform the movement using correct form with something called a posterior pelvic tilt which I'm about to show you we're now able to activate their lower abs to a significantly greater degree during the movement therefore instead of performing it like this here's what you want to do to maximise your lower abs activation first lay on a flat bench or on the floor with your hands held behind the bench for support next raise your legs up and bend to roughly 90 degrees and from here before starting the exercise it's absolutely crucial that you initiate something called posterior pelvic tilt as pictured here you can do so by squeezing your glutes and contracting your abs to tilt your pelvis upwards which as a result is going to completely flatten your back onto the bench and you want to maintain this posterior pelvic tilt throughout the whole movement next lift your pelvis up off the bench by thinking about raising it up and curling it towards your belly button and as you do so visualize and think about contracting your lower abs and then slowly lower back down to the starting position ensuring that you maintain that posterior pelvic tilt and that flat lower back against the bench every time you come down for the next rep when done correctly you should feel a very strong contraction in the lower part of your abdomen signifying that you're successfully working the lower abs and then once you're able to easily perform over 15 reps or so with this exercise you want to progressively overload it just like you would any other exercise in order to further develop and stimulate the growth of the lower abs and one easy way to do so is by using any kind of weighted ball and squeezing it between your knees as you perform the movement which is a bonus will further boost your core activation as well just be careful this guy's is you don't want the ball to end up smacking you right in the face another option as well is just simply move on to a decline bench when performing it either way it's vital that you overload the movement in some fashion over time to progressively make it harder and harder next we're gonna move on to the hanging leg raises which is another bottom-up AB movement that's going to effectively hit the lower abs as a result in fact this exercise was shown in two separate EMG analyses to elicit the highest lower abs activation when compared to several other ABS exercises however just like with the reverse crunch its effectiveness on lower ab activation is highly dependent on how you perform it as this can again very easily become a hip flexor dominant movement when done incorrectly so to correctly perform it start by hanging on to a bar or you can set up on a captain's chair leg raise if the hanging version is too difficult for you either way though before you initiate the movement move into posterior pelvic tilt by again flexing the core and tilt in the pelvis upwards like so in order to flatten the curvature of your lower back and then from here rather than thinking about just raising your legs up I want you to simply think about raising the pelvis up and curling it towards a belly button as much as your ab strength allows you to which is just gonna bring the legs up with it as a result by consciously thinking about this while avoiding swinging and using momentum you'll be able to successfully shift tension away from the hip flexors and onto the lower abs but if this movement is initially too difficult for you you can start with bent knees and use the same cues I previously went through and then as you get stronger you can both gradually straighten the knees out more and lift the pelvis and legs higher up to make the movement more difficult and then when that becomes easily done for 15 or more reps for example you can then load the movement with a weighted dumbbell or weighted ball to ensure that you're continuously progressing and effectively grow in the lower abs over time the last exercise I will roll out is another great movement to effectively target the lower abs along with various other muscles as well now although this movement isn't technically a bottom-up movement like the previous exercises I went through when performed properly the lower abs will be involved to a very high degree something that's actually been shown in various EMG analyses that have compared the abuela berola to various other commonly performed ab exercises but once again its effectiveness on lower ab development depends on proper execution which most people just don't do first off you want to get into the right starting position by again moving into posterior pelvic tilt so rather than having a curved or straight back you actually want to contract your abs to tilt your pelvis towards your belly button which will now slightly flex your spine as a result this will not only help us better engage the lower abs during the rollout but is also going to put the back in a much safer position from here you want to maintain this position with your abs contracted as you begin to roll out and then roll out only as far as you can while maintaining this posteriorly tilted pelvis because the second that your lower back begins the cave is an indication that your ab strength is not yet at that level so start out with short rollouts first and then gradually progress further as your ab strength improves and on the way back you want to avoid simply bending at the knees to cheat back to the starting position instead you want to maintain that posterior pelvic tilt which we talked about and pull up with the midsection to roll back in one helpful cue I actually use is to think about as if there was a string pulling your mid-back back up to the starting position when done properly you should feel a very strong contraction especially in the lower abs I hope that you're able to see that when it comes to developing your abs just like any other muscle group you need to ensure that you're not only choosing the right exercises but that you're performing these exercises in the optimal manner because doing so when combined with the right nutrition plan really is gonna be the key to drop in your body fat and attaining that six-pack that you're after and for a step by that science-based nutrition and workout plan that puts all of this together socially you can lean down and drop your body fat percentage as quickly as possible to attain your six-pack and simply head on over to built with science calm and take the body type quiz to discover what shred program is best for you and a quick shout out to the transformation of the week Vincent who actually ran this program for just a few months and was able to

especially if you don't take action to counteract this and for some individuals due to this glutes inhibition and excessive sitting this can often lead to lower back and or hip pain this then worsens the whole problem since research has shown that your body will tend to avoid using the glutes in response to any lower body pain or injury that it has as a protective mechanism and what often happens is that even after the pain or injury is resolved the body still remembers this pattern and will continue inhibiting the glutes world-renowned spinal researcher dr stewart mcgill has looked into this topic extensively and he terms this phenomenon as gluteal amnesia now the main problem here is that as you forget how to use your glutes due to disuse or pain your body will compensate so now when you're squatting deadlifting or doing any hip extension movement where your glutes are supposed to be helping out other muscles will take over instead and oftentimes it's the hamstrings and lower back that take that extra load which not only inhibits your glutes development but it's also why we commonly see this pattern of weak glutes tight hamstrings and lower back pain it can even get to the point where simple tasks that involve hip extension like walking or jogging will cause lower back discomfort because the glutes are essentially just turned off so long story short your glutes are important and to find out if your glutes may indeed be needing some more attention there's four key indicators that we can look at first if you just generally have a hard time feeling your glutes working or contracting them during the lower body exercises and your lower back and your hamstrings just tighten up instead then this is a good sign that the glutes aren't activating how they should be second perform a single leg loop bridge like so with one leg straightened and the other leg bent on the floor hold this position with your hips in the air now if you feel your hamstrings your lower back or your quads more so than your glutes then this is another indication that your glutes aren't doing what they're supposed to be doing during hip extension third if from the side you exhibit an anterior pelvic tilt posture then your glutes are likely failing to pull your pelvis into its neutral position due to weakness and lastly if you sit for most of the day and have what i'll just call flat butt syndrome then chances are your glutes can use some work so if you've tested positive for one or more of those four indicators or you just like to see better results with your glutes training then it's time to start awakening those glutes and to do so in this video we're gonna go through a four step plan where with the use of just a few daily exercises we'll be able to gradually get your glutes firing harder and harder to the point where you'll be actually using your glutes whenever you walk move and perform your lifts instead of having your lower back or other muscles compensate and work overtime as a result so the first thing we want to do here is just get you to understand what a glute contraction actually feels like and to get your brain to actually connect with the muscle so to start just sit down and place your hands under each butt cheek then take turns contracting each of your glutes with your hands you should be able to feel those glute muscles firing as you contract them one at a time then once you're able to do that we'll progress this by going into a kneeling position this time engage your core and place your hand on the glute at the down leg and try to flex it as hard as you can you should feel the contraction with your hand and your glute changing shape as you do so keep working until you can establish this then after you've run a few sets of each of those and you can actually really feel your glutes contracting in each of those positions we want to then progress into some exercises where your glutes are working against gravity which is where step two comes in to do so we'll use two simple exercises that dr stewart mcgill based on his 30-plus years of extensive lab and experimental research found are the best options to getting those glutes firing again so based on your research what exercises have you found are best to just help re-establish that connection with the glutes and individuals who suffer from gluteal amnesia or just can't seem to activate their glutes very well in general well over the 30 years of probing this we found that two exercises were superior at reintegrating the gluteals and they both came from the great czech neurologist vladimir yonda that is the back bridge and the show good coaching and mindfulness is essential we've measured that those who treat these exercises trivially do not re-establish the gluteal patterns that are required so the coaching cues in the way that we've described ensure appropriate gluteal activation so proper execution with these two exercises is absolutely essential here and luckily dr stewart mcgill was kind enough to spend the time to personally guide me through each of these exercises to explain the setup and various cues that he found based on his several years of research tend to work the best to maximize glutes activation i'll summarize them as i go through each exercise the first move the glute bridge will target the largest of your glute muscles the gluteus maximus for these first lay on your back with your knees bent while keeping your core brace and without arching your lower back squeeze your butt muscles to get them engaged first and then lift up while keeping your glutes contracted at the top squeeze your glutes as hard as possible for about five seconds before coming back down now if this alone doesn't activate your glutes very well and you feel it more so when you hamstrings then you can experiment with the following cues first you can think about as if you were holding a hundred dollar bill between your butt cheeks so to keep that hundred dollar bill constantly squeeze your glutes throughout each rep to prevent that bill from dropping another helpful cue is rather than thinking about driving your heels into the ground which tends to activate the hamstrings more instead think about pushing your feet away from you so actively push your feet forwards as if you were trying to perform a knee extension and you can even perform this against the wall if you need something to push against what this does is it will activate the quads and then through a concept called reciprocal inhibition will as a result decrease the activation of the hamstrings so that the glutes are now forced to do the work and finally if needed you can add a mini band around the knees which can help boost activation since your knees will actively have to use your glutes to keep them spread apart as you perform the movement so experiment with these various cues and use them as needed in order to maximize your glutes activation next are clamshells which will be used to target another important glute muscle the gluteus medius for these lay on your side with your knees and hips bent use one arm to make a pillow for your head and then with your other hand place your thumb on the bone in the front of your hip and then wrap your other fingers around over top the upper part of your butt this muscle is a glute medius and you want to feel this muscle working as you do the following movement next while keeping your feet together and core braced open up your top knee like a clam shell so that the knee of your upper leg rises towards the ceiling avoid rotating your hips as you do so by maintaining that abdominal bracing again you should feel the glute medius contracting with your fingers as you perform each rep and as for sets and reps of these exercises dr stewart mcgill recommends three sets of ten reps but with each rep performed mindfully and with a strong activation of the glutes now once you do get back to a point where your glutes are firing and you're feeling a lot more relief in your lower back and your hamstrings you want to then start progressing your glutes with more and more resistance and load and training them in different movement patterns and to do so there are three exercises that dr stewart mcgill recommends our best so student now once we do get back to a point where our glutes are back on so to speak what should we then progress to in order to further challenge the glutes with more resistance and our load and just to get them reintegrated with our other lower body muscles number one lateral step up it challenges the gluteals in hip extension but also in ab duction or frontal plane strength which is glute media so it's an outstanding exercise to stimulate to a very high level the glutes but it's a very mild exercise so it's easy on the body [Music] second exercise goblet squat it targets the glutes and with the coaching cues that we use it really stimulates all of the neuromuscular compartments in the gluteals [Music] do [Music] the third one the cable pull through really sets up squats deadlifts and some of the more power type of exercises that some of your listeners will be very passionate [Music] at the end of this uh training progression the idea is to have full integration of hamstrings now as dr stewart mcgill suggested these exercises are essential to just get your glutes back in the habit of knowing how to properly fire and work with your other lower body muscles then eventually you'll be able to do your more demanding exercises like split squats barbell squats and deadlifts and gradually load them with more and more weight but this time with the glutes actually doing what they should be doing as opposed to having other muscles compensate instead until then however focus on these progressions now lastly although you will likely have success with the previous steps it's important that we don't overlook a potential root cause of all this too much sitting and inactivity which is where step four prevention comes in you want to avoid prolonged periods of sitting where you just aren't using your glutes at all and instead get up and take a walk or have a stretch at least between every 30 minutes of sitting and even better during your breaks perform what i'll just call a wake up exercise for your glutes for example one great mindful exercise is toe raises where you point your toes outwards squeeze the quads and then rise up to the balls of your feet while squeezing your glutes as hard as possible hold the top position for 5 seconds and then come back down and repeat for a total of 10 reps this will just serve as a quick exercise to keep your brain in the habit of knowing how to properly fire and use your glutes throughout the day so as a summary here is the action plan perform the two activation exercises the glute bridge and the clam shell every single day at least once a day with the following reps and sets then in addition to this you want to add in one wake up exercise like toe raises that you can do throughout the day to break up your periods of sitting as your glutes activation improves and you've had success with these progression exercises eventually you're going to reach a point where these daily glute exercises for the most part just will no longer be needed since you'll be able to activate strengthen and grow your glutes to a much greater degree through your main lower body exercises but to get to that point it's absolutely vital that you stay consistent with the plan that we've outlined and for a step-by-step program that uses science to show you not only how to properly train each of your muscles week after week but also then shows you how to best fuel them for recovery and growth so you can build lean muscle and strip off that in the most efficient way possible then simply head on over to buildwithscience.com and take the analysis quiz to discover what program will be best for you and your specific body also big thank you to dr stewart mcgill for his help with the video his wealth of knowledge is truly incredible and he really is a blessing in the industry i'd highly recommend that

    "title": "The Best Science-Based Chest Workout for Mass &amp; Symmetry",
    "published_at": "2017-10-29T16:00:53Z",
    "transcript": "[Music] although chest is one of the most frequently trained muscles by most people it's also the one muscle group that people tend to have the most trouble developing when it comes to developing an attractive chest symmetry becomes more important than shear size so it's vital that you target each portion of your chest appropriately and we can do this by first understanding the anatomy of the chest anatomically the chest is divided into two main parts the clavicular head of the pec major also known as the upper chest and the sternal head of the pec major which divides into both the middle chest and the lower chest because of the way the fibers run although all portions will be activated during all chest exercises certain portions can be emphasized since the upper chest fibers run upward they are best activated with chest exercises where the arms move upward since the middle chest fibers run horizontally they are best activated with chest exercises where the arms move directly horizontally and since the lower chest fibers run downwards they are best activated with chest exercises that involve the arms moving downwards so in this video i'm going to show you guys a well-rounded chest workout that's optimized based on current scientific literature and our anatomical understanding of the chest before we get started it's important that you establish a solid mind to muscle connection with your chest otherwise you'll be working secondary muscles and your chest won't grow as much as it could in fact one study by snyder at l actually showed that verbal cues helped boost chest activation by 22 percent during bench press and trained athletes compared to when no cues were used some helpful cues you can use are to depress your traps and squeeze your shoulder blades back into the bench before starting any pressing movement and think less about pushing the weight and more about moving the weight by squeezing your biceps together and back out again during every rep as a main function of the pecs is this exact movement through the added shoulder flexion of this movement incline dumbbell presses put more emphasis on the clavicular head of the pecs and work several other secondary muscles as well the main reason for starting with this exercise is to prioritize the upper chest which is often the lagging portion of the chest in most people but i'll further discuss exercise order later on in this video now the great things about this exercise are one it allows a more full range of motion for the pecs which leads to more hypertrophy which is something that has been supported by many range of motion studies and two it's very effective at activating the upper chest for example an extensive emg study by brett contreras analyzed chest activity with 15 different chest exercises and inclined dumbbell presses were found to be the most effective compound movement for the upper chest and three it more effectively prevents muscle imbalances from forming since each hand is responsible for an equal amount of weight as for the best bench angle to perform these with this is something that will vary based on your anatomy emg studies have shown that an optimal bench angle is somewhere between 30 degrees to 56 degrees and showed higher anterior delt activation as the angle got higher i personally find that a 30 degree and 45 degree angle best activates my chest which also seems to be the case for most people so i'd suggest performing a couple sets at both angles in order to hit your chest most effectively the next exercise which is the traditional barbell bench press is going to put the most emphasis on the middle chest and just help with building overall chest thickness this exercise is something i had to include in this workout because of the overwhelming evidence supporting its effectiveness at building the chest it has been shown in several studies to be the best exercise at activating the chest and additionally the exercise that you can lift the most weight with also studies like this one by akage et al also show a positive correlation between one rep max bench press with the size of the pectoralis major indicating that a strong bench does indeed equate to a big chest in many cases and regarding form you definitely want to come down to your chest for a full range of motion since as i mentioned earlier this is more effective for hypertrophy than shorter ranges of motion however the main problem i find with the bench press is that some people respond very well to it yet others tend to overcompensate with adults regardless of their form and various use of activation cues which i personally think comes down to their individual anatomy if this is the case for you consider alternatively using an exercise like the dumbbell bench press which has been found to have similar chest activation to the barbell bench press but less triceps activation which may be a plus if your triceps are overactive when benching and in fact dumbbell bench press was actually shown by brett contreras study to elicit the best activation for the middle chest and another plus is the greater range of motion with dumbbells since your range of motion isn't limited by the bar like it is in bench press but as you can see even in the literature there is a lot of individual variation so try them both out and see which works best for you the next exercise is going to be dips which was shown in brett contreras study to be the most effective exercise for hitting the lower chest which makes sense given that your shoulder is put in an extended position i personally prefer this variation called straight bar dips as i feel it a lot more in my lower chest probably due to the added internal rotation during the movement which is another main function of the lower chest and it also gives my core a really good workout you can do these on a smith machine bar or any barbell that's set up on a rack you want to lean your upper body slightly over the bar and bring your legs forward under the bar as you descend to stay balanced and then use your lower chest and triceps to push back up and try to keep your elbows from flaring out too much and make sure the bar doesn't drag against your body throughout the movement to be honest it is a pretty tough exercise for most people but i guarantee if you perform them properly and start using weight on them you will see huge improvements in your lower chest but if you're struggling with that then stick to regular dips for now with a slight lean forward to hit your chest more as opposed to the triceps and you want to eventually start adding weight to keep progressing it this exercise is kind of a finishing movement but it's something i highly recommend you include in your routine all you do is you put a band around your back and hold each end of the band with your hands then perform regular push-ups with the added resistance a study by anderson at al compared banded push-ups with the bench press they had one group perform only banded push-ups for five weeks and another group performed only bench press for five weeks and compared how their bench press strength changed after the five weeks were complete the researchers found that not only did banded push-ups exhibit nearly identical chest activation when compared to the bench press but both groups resulted in very similar bench press strength gains over the five weeks the fact that this exercise has a potential to improve your upper body strength as much as a bench press does and the fact that it has been shown in multiple studies to activate the chest especially the upper chest very well is why i chose to include this exercise an easy way to progress this exercise is just by using bands with higher resistance as you get stronger the last exercise is going to put more emphasis on the sternal head of the pecs so both the middle and lower chest will be emphasized high to low cable crossovers have been shown in a few studies like this one by shanked l to be almost as effective as a bench press at activating the pecs so it's definitely a great finishing movement that you can perform the failure another bonus with this exercise and something that you can't do in most other exercises is it enables you to cross your hands over at the bottom position to allow greater horizontal abduction at the shoulder which will better activate the chest so to conclude here is a sample chest workout that you can perform using the exercises i previously discussed but one thing to keep in mind is the order that you perform the exercises in several studies have shown a trend where lifters get better gains in hypertrophy and strength for exercises that are done early in a session meaning you want to order exercises based on what your strengths and weaknesses are if your upper chest is lagging then perform the workout in this order if your mid chest and overall thickness is lagging then perform the workout in this order and if your lower chest is lagging then perform the workout in this order this will help prioritize weaknesses and help balance out your chest more thanks for watching guys i hope you enjoyed the video one important thing to keep note of and something that i noticed in both my personal experience and my review of the literature is that there is a lot of individual variation when it comes to the best exercises for the chest for example anatomical things like how far down your pec inserts onto the humerus can actually determine if bench press will be a good option for you or not although results from studies may apply to most people they don't account for each individual which is why i highly recommend that you guys just try out a bunch of different chest exercises and see which one best activates your chest and with that being said i put in a lot of time and effort into this video so if you could please support me by giving the video a like leaving a comment and sharing the video i would really appreciate it and as always please don't forget to subscribe and turn on notifications from my channel as this will really help me out anyways that's it for this video guys i will see you next time [Music]"

    "title": "The #1 Exercise To Lose Belly Fat (FOR GOOD!)",
    "published_at": "2022-06-05T16:15:05Z",
    "transcript": "belly fat is really easy to gain and notoriously hard to lose it can seem as though no matter what exercises you try and no matter how well you eat the belly fat just won't budge and unfortunately with exception to surgery there's currently no proven method of being able to spot reduce fat from the belly there is an exercise however that is incredibly underutilized yet powerfully effective when it comes to losing belly fat today I'll share what that is and how you can start using it right away first off let's talk about why belly fat is so hard to lose in the first place this was first brought to attention in the literature back in 1997 by Dr bshar where he discovered that certain areas of your body are easier to lose fat than others and is largely determined by genetics they found that although some individuals seem to be less inclined to store fat around their abdomen most people's genetics prioritize abdominal fat loss last now having your genetics stacked against you may seem problematic if you're looking to develop a slim or lean looking abdomen but there is a solution as long as you create a calorie deficit and continue to burn more calories than you consume every day you will continue to lose fat eventually if maintained long enough you will lose excess fat from all areas of your body even if your genetics put your belly fat at the back of the line and although your diet should be your main way of creating a calorie deficit adding additional exercise can help speed it up and ensure that you're continuing to lose fat even as your metabolism is slow close down now you guys are smart and you're probably already aware of this and may have attempted to burn more calories and Shred belly fat faster by incorporate in things like running rowing cycling or even hit workouts these forms of cardio tend to burn calories very quickly making them seem like a great way to burn off belly fat over time for example based on what's known as a compendium of physical activities a regularly updated database that outlines the calorie burn for various exercises a 170 lb individual compared to if they were to just sit around can expect to burn roughly an additional 12 calories per minute when running at a moderate pace of 6 mph so 30-minute running session would lead to a net total of about 360 calories burned do that three times a week for a year and that would lead to an additional 56,0 calories burn and given that back in 1958 researcher wishnowski discovered that losing one pound of fat requires burning 3500 calories more than you consume then this routine would amount to about 16 lbs of additional fat loss per year now while this does sound great on paper the truth is the overwhelming majority of people can't actually stick with traditional cardio long enough for fat loss to reach stubborn areas in fact even in studies where subjects are assigned to cardio sessions to do Dropout rates tend to be on average almost 20% it's not that these methods don't work because they do I've personally used running and hit regularly in the past to get me down to very lean levels in fact I used to believe that these intense cardio sessions were the key to burn off sub fat but they were brutal they required a lot of willpower I got sore from them it really impacted my energy and I just dreaded doing them most of the time and although I stuck it through and eventually did get the six-pack I was after simply because I was burning a lot of calories I just couldn't get myself to continue these gring sessions especially outside of summertime and eventually I had lost a lot of the progress I had made now don't get me wrong these forms of cardio they do definitely have their place and some people have no problem sticking to them in fact I still do these intense sessions once or twice a week for conditioning but I no longer rely on them as my main form of cardio to lose fat and nor should most people because if you want to lose your belly fat and more importantly keep it off once it's gone then you need something that you can stick to for life what's the solution it's the easiest to maintain the lowest stress lowest fatigue most versatile form of cardio walking now I know what you're thinking walking doesn't burn many calories and there is no way I can walk my way to a six-pack years back I would have said the exact same thing but a 20201 meta analysis titled slow and steady or hard and fast helped shed some light on the matter the researchers analyzed a total of 54 studies to determine the effect that different types of cardio had on Fat Loss what they found is that intense forms of cardio like hit or running while time efficient didn't provide any Superior fat loss effect when compared to longer yet less intense forms of cardio such as walking which makes sense it's simply a numbers game your body doesn't care whether the calories you burn were from some crazy intense fast and cardio session or from plain old walking what matters most is what you can do consistently over time and if you crunch the numbers you'll actually find that the calories burn from Simply walking can very quickly add up to a meaningful amount for example using the same exercise database we used earlier a 170 lb individual walking at a casual 3 mph can expect to burn an additional 3.4 calories per minute and roughly 200 calories per hour if for 3 days per week you add in an extra hour of walking that would amount to 600 additional calories burn per week over the course of the year that's an additional 31,200 calories burned which would amount to about 9 lbs of fat loss and the math checks out in the literature as well with one of the few studies out there analyzing walk-ins effect on Fat Loss finding that subjects who simply added in 2 and 1/2 hours of brisk walking per week experience an additional 3.5 lbs of fat loss over the course of 12 weeks now although hours of walking may sound like a lot it doesn't have to be all at once later in this video I'm going to show you how to incorporate this into your life effortlessly but first just compare the walk-in routine to the running routine that I gave earlier yes the running routine will burn more calories and less time but be honest with yourself How likely would you be to keep that up for a whole year you feel like most people and you go all out for 2 months but then become inconsistent and give up after that that 16 lbs of additional fat loss we calculated becomes just a couple pounds nowhere near enough fat for most people to even come close to burning through their excess belly fat this is why walking is the number one exercise to lose belly fat and is why it's now my main form of cardio to get lean and stay lean it's easy to stick to so now that I've hopefully convinced you of the power of Walkin let's dive into how you can easily start a applying it to lose fat the first step is to determine an average of how many steps you're currently taking you can use a health app on your iPhone or use Google fit if you're on Android after a week see what your daily average comes up to if you already know this great I'd like to know as well so do me a favor and comment below how many steps you're currently taking and if you have any tips that helped you increase it or what obstacles may be holding you back some of you however might be surprised with how few steps you're taking but this is a good thing is it means that you have a big opportunity to bump that up for example here's one of our buil with science program members Devin who recently hit a plateau and simply bumped up his step count up from 3,000 steps to around 8,000 to 10,000 per day and is back to losing fat every single week especially in his stubborn areas it's simple but it works for most people though I wouldn't recommend trying to jump all the way up to something like 10,000 steps right away instead set a realistic goal and for example first aim to do an extra 2,000 steps a day given that the average individual takes about 1,00 steps during 10 minutes of walking all you have to do is throw in two 10minute walks into your day to accomplish that once you're consistent with that try bumping It Up by another 2,000 steps and continue doing this with the goal of consistently getting at least 8,000 steps or even up to 15,000 steps per day which seems to be the range that provides the greatest fat loss and health benefits the key though is to make this fit your lifestyle some tips I personally use are to always choose a far parking spot take the longest way to the washroom do 10 minutes of incline walkit after each workout take 10-minute walks after each meal take the stairs instead of the elevator whenever possible listen to podcast while walking and more and for those who are busy in the office all day a study that had subjects add just 5 minutes of walking per hour into their office day found that over the course of the year it would amount to over 9 lbs of additional fat loss in this case you can also try to aim for a higher step count on the weekends to boost your weekly average but trust me these little things add up apply these tips and you'll be surprised with just how much they can increase your step count and even more surprise once you notice the fat slowly coming off that said guys I want to emphasize that walking or any form of cardio is only effective for fat loss if it's used in combination with the diet think about it the calories you burn from a whole hour of walking or 30 minute run is equivalent to the calories in three pieces of toast which you can consume in literally a matter of seconds so use your diet as a primary way to create a calorie deficit and supplement it with walking to help speed up the process and if you need help with putting this all together into an easy to follow science-based workout and nutrition plan that you can trust will work to help you burn up stubborn fat and build Le muscle then head on over to buildwi science.com and take our analysis quiz to find the best program for you I'd also highly recommend that you give this video you watch next which is going to cover some tips on how to structure your nutrition plan to help further speed up the fat loss process thank you so much for watching don't forget to subscribe and I'll see

definitely gonna pick him as as the transformation winner I haven't told them yet but what I actually wanted to do is I wanted to fly down there and surprise him in person and oh my God I tell him all the time I think that he just I don't know if he just doesn't realize it or because his self-confidence is so messed up but his story could Inspire so many people and in two different ways the way that he struggled with sobriety and with the workout and people thinking that they can't do it it's it's hard yeah he's got such a beautiful story oh my God I'm so excited my name is Sean O'Brien and I am a recovering drug addict and alcoholic I'm originally from a city called Newport Richie you know I was always in trouble as a kid I was always doing the wrong things with the wrong people and I moved to Kentucky to get away from all that when I moved up here I started cooking professionally and I know a lot of people don't know this but outside of the entertainment industry service industry is the second most common for drug and alcohol abuse and that's when I started drinking real heavily I started doing a lot of drugs and I use daily for close to 10 years because of my use I had a stroke that was one of the hardest things I ever went through the scariest thing I ever went through in my life I thought I was going to die and I still didn't get sober I'd work 13 hours in a day and I would get off work and I would drink and party until you know the sun came up and I'd take maybe an hour power nap and I'd do it all over again for almost three years I hated myself I hated everything about myself I couldn't look at myself in the mirror I couldn't you know I couldn't look anybody in the eye I couldn't look myself in the eye the rate that I was going I wouldn't be surprised if I wasn't able to even sit here in this room right now it was actually February 7th of 2022 and I had actually looked up some meditation because I heard meditation helps I woke up and I did a meditation that morning after I got out of bed and I had this flood of emotion that came over me it like literally felt like it like raised up through my body and um I had this entire day where I did nothing but cry and I'd boohooed and I snotty you know I couldn't breathe and when it finally came to a close if I looked at myself and I was like what the hell are you doing you know I used to blame everybody else I used to you know everybody else is the cause of my problems and it's not me how dare everybody say these things to me how dare everybody call me out on these things you know if it wasn't for you I wouldn't even be doing what I'm doing in the first place I finally had to look at myself and realize it's not everybody else you know I mean it's you you're not doing anything different and you are getting the same results you know what I mean that's what they say the definition of insanity is you know so I changed I cut everybody out of my life I changed my phone number I went from having friends you know my party friends to literally having nobody I was looking up workout videos because I wanted to do something different than what I was doing and I ran across Jeremy by mistake and came across as beginner shred program and went from there I got myself in the habit of doing it and then once I kept doing it I was finally able to prove to myself hey you you can actually do this thing I started you know back at my heaviest I was close to 235 pounds when I weighed myself this morning I am 162 pounds pull-ups I've always been the hardest thing for me I could barely at one point lift myself up six inches off the ground and now I'm able to do between seven and nine you know and uh it's exciting yeah the physique and the all that that was just a bonus what really came with it was it took my mind from a really dark place and it brought me mentally to the best spot I've ever been in my life Sarah is my ride or die she's my bestie I met Sarah at work turns out we're from the same Hometown and tried to be friends with me for a really long time he was just on a path that I didn't really like kind of thought he was a bully and um yeah now we're the best of friends oddly enough she's been my number one supporter and I mean she's always been there you know if I'm going through a hard time I'll give her a call and she's there for me you know I mean even when it came to this contest I wasn't confident enough to put in the put in the the submission and she talked me into doing it oh I told him he'd do it or I'll beat his ass yeah is there he's present he's an actual friend it's an actual parent he's an incredible Chef um I mean he's completely just opposite of the person that I met and did not like when I first met him I would be lost without him honestly she is she's amazing you know and I don't know where I'd be if I didn't have her for real even if you don't have somebody there supporting you in front of you just in the back of your mind know that you can do it just like he did because even if I wasn't here he may not think so I know he could have done it he could have done it even without me he's he's that strong of a guy all right guys so I'm in Vancouver and I'm at the airport I'm just waiting for my flight and I'm not gonna lie I'm I'm starting to get pretty nervous um I have no idea how he's going to react like I've never met the man in person and he might not even recognize me or want to see me so I don't know if there's uh well I'm nervous building up but there's no turning back officially landed in Kentucky all right we're about to head out and meet Sean just waiting for the Uber just texted Sarah so she's with Sean uh just waiting at the house I told her I was nervous and she's like I'm nervous too I was like [\u00a0__\u00a0] that doesn't help I don't know what if it's too much for him but if he's just like phone call was cool but like you need to show up [Music] well this time it's been building up to this moment you ready let's do this holy [\u00a0__\u00a0] Adrian you recognize me yeah man here we go bro oh really yes really dude oh my god really I had to come down here man I had to I had to meet you in person and I wanted to tell you you're the next built with science transformation winner oh and I had to I had to meet you in person man dude my heart's racing right my heart's racing and believe me you're gonna be an inspiration to the world man you you already are you're an inspiration to me and it's just an honor privilege to meet you man oh man I didn't get a picture with you we'll get a plate I'm so proud of you I can't imagine like how anxious you were like just waiting like why are you telling me to be home at 12 why are you coming over you'll see it'll be good all of a sudden someone knocks on my door and I'm like who is that and I open the door and he's standing there I'm like what the [\u00a0__\u00a0] that is so awesome I'm so proud of you yeah so I uh yeah so I won congratulations honey I'm so proud thank you anybody that's gone through something similar to Sean just know that you can do it and that there is a light at the end of the tunnel everybody has their own problems everybody has their own struggles everybody has their own remedy and everybody's journey and everybody's everybody's closure to that problem is different you got to worry about you you got to be able to look at yourself in the mirror and if that means cutting everybody out of your life for x amount of time so you can focus on you and only you do it it works for me [Music] because I've always wanted to try to reach out to people yeah I just don't know how to go about it I guess you could say [Music] foreign"

    "title": "The PERFECT Mobility Routine to FIX YOUR SIT (3 Min/Day)",
    "published_at": "2024-06-09T13:00:59Z",
    "transcript": "if you sit most of the day and your body looks and feels locked up and stiff then you've got two choices leave it and let it get worse or fix it in just 3 minutes a day with three simple exercises since you're here I'm guessing you want to look and feel better so let's get right into it starting with a pretty crazy study that looked into how you can reverse the effects of sitting researchers and participants sit for 4 and 1/2 hours a day to see how it affected their muscle stiffness exciting I know but bear with me sure enough everyone's back got Tighter and Tighter as the time dragged off but they found something interesting you see the participants were actually split into three different groups the control group literally just sat there and did nothing but with the test groups the researchers used something called a neuromuscular electrical stimulator to send 17 electrical currents into their back muscles at regular intervals however one group received a low-level current which felt like a tingling sensation throughout their bath whereas the other group received a high amplitude current that actually caus their back muscles to contract just like how they do during exercise so what did they find well at first nothing surprising you see when you sit for a long time your joints are stuck in one position and your body essentially turns off the muscles you're not using so what happens is over time you not only lose your ability to move these joints but after sitting for a while your body will create the feeling of stiffness in your unused muscles in an attempt to get you to move and actually use them and this happens even if you tried to sit with perfect posture and this is exactly what the researchers found in both the control group and the group given just a lowlevel current their backs got increasingly stiff and it's also worth pointing out that this was just after 4 and 1/2 hours of sitting so imagine what happens to your back if you sit all day every day for years but anyway here's the surprising part for the high amplitude group those whose muscles actually contracted from the current the stiffness in their backs almost completely reverse so what does this mean for you well for starters if you haven't already picked up your very own neuromuscular electrical stimulator machine Co Jeremy for 15% off what the heck are you waiting for just kidding no the real takeaway is actually a lot simpler you don't need to run electrical currents through your back while you're at your desk although I guess that could work but if you want an even better solution one that will not only relieve muscle tension in your back but also your shoulders and hips improve your posture so you naturally stand up taller and straighter and increase your range of motion so you can have more effective sessions of the gym then you simply need to start moving the joints and Contracting the muscles that you don't use when you're sitting all day that's said I know how hard it can be to stick to a stretching or Mobility routine consistently so that's why rather than giving you an extensive list of movements my team and I have worked together to find the three exercises that focus on the most problematic of areas at first I recommend you start by introducing these exercises into your day just a few times each week but work towards doing them once or twice a day to break up your sitting the first exercise is great for improving rounded locked up shoulders not only will it loosen your delts and chest it'll also strengthen the weakened muscles in your upper back and shoulders for long-term posture improvements it's called the wall clock to perform it stand sideways with your fingertips touching the wall and your thumb pointing down engage your core and without arching your back back slowly draw your palm in a big semicircle forward and up the wall let your shoulder blade move forward and then up as you do so you should feel a stretch in your chest on the way up and some of your shoulder and upper back muscles working then complete the circle by moving your arm back and down the wall letting your shoulder blade move back and down as your arm travels behind you reverse the circle to get back to the starting position and spend about 30 seconds on each side and the nice thing is you can decide how much of a stretch is right for you you based on how close you stand to the wall closer you are the harder it will be but harder isn't necessarily better here especially if you're experiencing any sort of pain or discomfort aim for a stretch that feels like a four maybe five out of 10 just don't overdo it now we're going to focus on the back and neck when you've been sitting for a while and you finally get up what's the first stretch you do chances are it's this one your body is basically telling you to wake up and use all those muscles in your back that have been on standby but if you want a better way way to contract them to completely reverse the sitting position and to go through their full range of motion you'll want to do this exercise get on all fours with your hands directly under your shoulders then spin your elbows towards your thighs to engage your lats inhale and gently lift your tailbone towards the ceiling and reach your chest forward through your biceps to stretch your abs squeeze your shoulder blades together as you lift your chin up towards the ceiling when done properly you should actually feel the muscles in your midback activated this is the first half of the exercise then you'll want to go in the other direction exhale and imagine there was a rope pulling your midback up towards the ceiling and rounding your spine as you do this push the floor away to open up your shoulder blades then use your neck muscles to tuck your chin by looking towards your knees or even your belly button you should feel a deep stretch in your back muscles as well as your neck do this for about 30 seconds and then for the next 30 seconds we'll move your spine in a way you probably don't do all day come back to a neutral position and turn and look towards your left foot this will stretch the muscles on the right side of your lower back and rib cage then return to center after that same on the other side turn and look at your right foot and a good way to manage your breathing is to inhale when you return to neutral and exhale as you look towards either foot finally the perfect 3-minute Mobility routine wouldn't be complete without an exercise to Target the hips when you're sitting all day your hips are literally just locked into one position but they're designed to move in all sorts of directions so we need an exercise that moves them into as many different positions as possible while strengthening the muscles that weaken from sitting too much exercise 3 does exactly that we'll start at a level one version and then build up to level three which is the most effective variation for level one sit on the floor and bend one leg in front of your body at around a 90\u00b0 angle and then do the same with the back one you can use your hands for support if you need to then sit up tall and try to position your shoulders Square to the front of your shin keep your spine tall and exhale as you reach your chest forward hinging over your front leg until you feel a deep stretch on the outside of your front leg's hip or glute area try not to round your spine instead focus on bending at the hip inhale as you come back to the starting position and exhale as you get into your next rep for level one do 30 seconds on each side trying to get deeper into the stretch with each rep level two now focuses on activating some of your weak hip muscles which is the key to relieving stiffness you're going to maintain that same 90\u00b0 leg position but this time as you lean forward push your front Shin down into the ground and lift your hips up to get your torso upright you should feel some of your glute muscles working and you should feel the hip flexors and groin muscles of your back leg stretching once you get to the top then you're going to reverse this by lowering as slowly as you can while leaning forward again aim to do 30 seconds on each each side once you're comfortable with level two you can emad to level three in this case you're going to repeat what we did in level two but instead of sticking to just one side at a time for deeper stretch in your groin and hip flexors you're going to windshield wiper your knees directly over to the other side on the way down and repeat this motion back and forth to help you stay upright reach your arms out in front of you and engage your core during the transition and again you can always use your hands for support here if you need it now these exercise are great but if you want to truly fix your posture and mobility issues for good then there's one thing that you have to add to this list it's an extremely underrated exercise for preventing aches and pains and surprisingly for burning fat as well give this video watch next to find out what it is and how to use it if you guys want a free pdf of this routine to remind you how they're done with step-by-step pictures I've added a download link in the description box down below and lastly for those who want an all than one fitness

    "title": "4 Exercises That Are Harming Your Shoulder (And What To Do Instead!)",
    "published_at": "2018-10-14T15:48:53Z",
    "transcript": "when it comes to building muscle losing fat and progressing in the gym nothing is going to set you back more than injuries will which is exactly why you need to design your workout program such that it ensures your longevity in the gym and minimizes your risk of injury and one of the easiest ways you can do this is with proper exercise selection now although it's true that any exercise can very quickly become dangerous if performed incorrectly there are certain exercises and variations that for the majority of people not only have a higher risk associated with them but as backed by research are also inferior in terms of muscle growth and should thus probably be avoided and in this video I'll discuss four such exercises with why they're considered risky in the first place and what you should do instead the upright row is a common choice for those looking to develop their traps and shoulders however if you actually analyze the mechanics of the exercise it's easy to see why this may not be the best choice this is because at the top of the movement the shoulder gets into something called an internally rotated position where the elbows are high and the hands are below holding the weight and as the shoulder is in this position the tendon of the supraspinatus which is one of your rotator cuff muscles can rub against a bone in the shoulder which can lead to shoulder inflammation and pain and observational research agrees with this idea as well for example this 2014 paper from the journal strength and conditioning research looked into shoulder injuries and exercise selection among 77 resistance trained men they actually found that there was a significant difference for the presence of shoulder impingement among individuals who performed upright rows when compared to those who did not leaving the researchers to conclude that there seems to be a significant strong association between the upright row and shoulder impingement therefore indicating that for most individuals the upright row is just something probably not worth doing so what can you do instead well one option is to modify the upright row to make it not only safer but also more effective and you can do this by making the following three Changez 1 widen your grip to about 200% of shoulder width since based on this 2013 EMG analysis from the journalists strength and conditioning research this grip width is safer on the wrist and shoulder joint and elicits higher upper trap and lateral deltoid activity when compared to a narrow grip to limit the top of the movement such that your elbows don't go above shoulder height and 3 ensure that as you raise the weight your hands are not below your elbows but I actually raised up to elbow height and as you can see here this point will be key in eliminating the internal rotation component of the movement and thus making it much safer to do so the new and improved form should look something like the following and will not only make the movement safer but also makes it that much more effective at activating the target muscle groups but another option that may be better suited for some individuals especially if you've had prior shoulder injuries is to simply use lower risk alternatives that hit the same muscle groups as the upright rodas mainly the upper traps and lateral deltoid for the upper traps one great alternative is the barbell shrug which I show how to properly perform in my science-based trap video and for the lateral deltoid a great alternative is the dumbbell lateral raise which is however vital that you perform correctly and is explained in my science-based shoulder video and I'll link both of these videos in the description box down below behind the neck press is another common exercise used to target the shoulders and is a slight variation of the standard overhead press such that the bar is brought behind the head instead of in front however for most individuals this can again be a risky exercise to perform and the reason being is because in order for you to safely lower the bar behind your head it requires a great deal of external rotation at the shoulder which most people just don't have the adequate mobility to do in fact one 2015 paper from the journal sport and health science took 33 trained subjects and had them perform overhead presses both in front of and behind in the head the researchers concluded that behind-the-neck presses required greater shoulder flexibility an external rotation than most males possess and this becomes risky because when you don't possess the adequate mobility for the movement it not only excessively strains the shoulder but you also tend to compensate by sticking your neck forward in order to allow the barbell to pass behind your neck this in turn increases the compressive forces within the neck and should definitely be avoided so what should you do instead simple stick to the standard in front of the head shoulder presses as this will target the same musculature as behind the neck shoulder presses but is a much more natural plane of movement for your shoulder and therefore enables you to lift more weight when compared to behind-the-neck presses again due to the mechanics of this exercise in the degree of external rotation needed to perform it correctly it makes it another exercise that for most people it just simply isn't worth the risk of doing instead your best bet is to stick with front lat pull-downs since this variation doesn't involve excessive external rotation of the shoulder and is also the better option in terms of back development proving this point this 2009 paper from the journal strength and conditioning research compared activity of the lats during behind the neck and front of neck lat pull-downs they found that front lat pull-downs elicited significantly higher lat activation the behind the neck lat pull-downs which led the researchers to conclude that given the potential risk of behind the neck lat pull-downs and its inferior activation of the lats it appears to be in unnecessary exercise and should be avoided so for these reasons simply stick to front lat pull-downs and although this exercise in itself isn't necessarily dangerous in my opinion for most people it's just not needed and can definitely contribute to problems down the road this is because the front delts are already very active in most pressing movements which is why most people have proportionally bigger and stronger front delts when compared to their rear delts and since as shown in this paper from the Journal of clinical biomechanics the rear delts play an important role in reducing injury potential by further emphasizing the front delts through isolation movements and spending less time on the rear delts it just worsens this common muscle imbalance and can very well contribute to shoulder injuries over time therefore for most individuals you can just avoid any front delt isolation and leave it to your compound movements like overhead presses to develop this area so instead of dedicating more time to your front delts I'd recommend increasing the volume dedicated to your rear delts instead as this will not only provide a more balanced look to your shoulders and posture but will also help reduce the risk of injury over time that's pretty much it for this video but keep in mind though that these exercises for some individuals can be perfectly fine and even beneficial depending on your specific goals wherever this is highly dependent on your current range of motion and your specific anthropometry but since we know anatomically and through research that the majority of individuals will likely have problems with these exercises and at the risk of performing them highly outweighs the benefits it would be wise to stick to the recommendations I provided and guys if you're looking for a truly evidence-based program that ensures you're able to transform your body not only as efficiently as possible but also as safely as possible and simply head on over to built with science comm four slash courses we can choose the best program for you anyways that's it for now for those

    "title": "Make Your Back Wider (2 Exercises You Need To Start Doing)",
    "published_at": "2021-06-13T15:00:21Z",
    "transcript": "do you want to get an attractive looking v taper if so then you need to make your lats bigger i'm going to show you two exercises that will target your lats much better than the traditional back movements that most people do yeah that's right i'm talking about you if you execute these two exercises with all the important details and tips i'm going to be covering then many of you will finally feel what it's like to truly train and grow your lats so the lats are a big fan like muscle that wraps around your back it can actually be divided into three different regions which can just be thought of as the upper the middle and the lower lats you'll notice that the lat fibers they get more horizontal at the top and more vertical at the bottom now although during any lats exercise in general all three regions of the last will be involved you can actually slightly favor certain regions over the other by better matching the exercise with the direction in which these fibers run so first off to emphasize the upper and mid lats a little bit more we're going to use a lat focus row which is a move i first came across from coach kassim creator of n1 training now most of you are probably doing some form of a cable row in your routine that looks something like this which is great for overall back development but to make it more lats focused there's a few key setup tweaks that we'll want to make to this first tuck your elbows into your sides and keep them there as you row rather than flaring them out the further away your elbows are from your torso the more your rear delts and your upper back will be involved and less lats as a result next stop the row once your elbows reach your torso rather than extending beyond this this should happen naturally if you're focusing on maintaining tension in the lats since the lats are going to be much less involved in the movement when we pull the elbows further back behind our torso that added range of motion will come from the rear delts and upper back muscles instead of the left you also want to be mindful of your forearms at the end position ideally they should line up with the direction of the cable so avoid overly flexing or extending the elbow as you pull as that'll start involving more of your arms instead of your lats lastly as you pull you want to limit how much you extend and arch your upper back as that will again put the upper back in a more favorable position compared to the lats instead what you can do only if comfortable is incorporate a slight hinge forward at your hips to better line up the lats with the line of pull and to increase the range of motion as you do this you'll want to keep your abs engaged and ensure that there's no rounding of your lower back depending on your hip mobility you may only be able to achieve a slight torso lean forward which is perfectly fine some of you may also find that placing your feet on the floor instead is more comfortable which is also perfectly fine now after you get the setup down the next key is execution and your thought process as you wrote first rather than thinking about pulling back and pinching your shoulder blades together initiate the movement by thinking about pulling your elbow down by using your lats and then as you pull continue thinking about bringing your elbow down and in the shoulder blades are still going to retract during the movement but you want to avoid starting the movement with that in order to get the lats engaged if we go back to the lat's anatomy and look at their line of pull you can see how the fibers move down and in so visualize a rope attaching to your upper arm and pulling down back and in towards your spine that's essentially what your lat is doing and is very helpful to visualize as you pull lastly as for handles ideally you'd want to use a neutral grip wider handle to best bias the lats but applying the form and execution tweaks that i went through will make a big difference regardless of what handle you have access to and if you currently don't have access to a cable row then you can apply most of these tips and cues to something like a dumbbell row in order to make it more lap focused or just replace the cable with a band do know however that with these modifications in place many of you will initially have to drop the weight just a little bit this is a good thing and expect it because it means that your lats which are likely weak are finally being forced to work but as with any exercise just focus on getting more familiar with it and gradually increase the load as you get more proficient and stronger with it by the way guys this is exactly what i teach you how to do in my step-by-step programs where we cover each exercise in depth and then show you how to maximize your growth with these exercises by mastering technique and progression but i'll talk more about this at the end of the video for now let's move on to exercise number two next we have the single arm pull down to now bias the lower lats a little bit more by incorporating a more vertical pulling angle here we'll want to use a half kneeling stance and grab a handle with the neutral grip such that your arm is positioned at roughly a 45 degree angle in front of your body and cable positioned such that it's in line with your forearm brace your abs keep a neutral spine and then drive the elbow down towards your side and then as you pull similar to the lat focus row discussed earlier you want to keep your elbow close to your torso rather than flared out and think about driving the elbow down and slightly in towards your glutes at the bottom position in the end position you can also slightly bend your torso sideways towards the pulling arm to get an even greater contraction and again it can be helpful to visualize a rope pulling your upper arm down back and then slightly in towards your glutes you can see how with this exercise the angle of pull lines up very well with the lats overall especially with the lower lats that wrap around the pelvis as a result many of you watching will likely feel a very strong contraction in this area that you've never quite experienced before now if you don't have access to cables right now then an easy alternative is just to use a band with the exact same setup and execution as for programming these into your routine if your lats are currently lagging then feel free to swap some of your horizontal and vertical pulling movements with these exercises instead but overall just try out the exercises try out the variations that i went through as many of you will for the first time feel what it's like to actually train your lats now to maximize your gains in all of your muscles not just your lats you need to pay close attention to the exercises that you're using and even closer attention to how about you go performing them and that's what makes all the difference for a step-by-step program that shows you exactly how to train

    "title": "The PERFECT 10 Minute Daily Posture Routine (FIX YOUR SIT!)",
    "published_at": "2020-05-17T16:49:53Z",
    "transcript": "if you're someone who sits for the majority of the day whether it be sitting at home at the office driving or just general inactivity then odds are your body has over time adapted to become a very efficient sitter yes your body over time actually gets really good at sitting by turning off certain muscles and over activating other muscles and when you then combine this with the fact that most people don't just sit and instead slouch forward and lean sideways and do all kinds of things to make themselves more comfortable it leads to a host of problems and imbalances that arise when you're not sitting and typically what this will lead to is more or less the development of the following posture where the head protrudes forward the mid back and shoulders round forward and the lower back arches excessively with an anterior tilt to the pelvis and to make matters worse this posture is often accompanied with a host of asymmetries created by various sitting habits which can lead to one side of the body being tighter than the other and as a result create a slight drooping on that one side for example which all in all can lead to tightness and aches and pains in the neck the shoulders the lower back and various other areas while making it difficult to properly execute various exercises in the gym let alone comfortably stand and move throughout the day but luckily there are easy ways to reverse this and prevent it from worsening if you spend the majority of the day sitting because based on the analysis of multiple papers we know that these various postural patterns created by sitting are simply a result of various muscles that become underactive and weak over time and other muscles that have become overactive and shortened over time which in effect pull your body into this new posture therefore to reverse this i'll be showing you two quick and easy five-minute corrective routines that you can do virtually anywhere and are designed to mobilize these tightened areas strengthen the weakened areas and work on correcting any asymmetries you may have as well the first routine will focus primarily on the upper body and the second routine will focus primarily on the lower body each consisting of four exercises and then towards the end of the video i'll show you how to then go about implementing them into your day but for now let's jump into the first routine the first exercise we'll use to mobilize the upper body is over and backs which can be done with either a band or a towel this exercise is used to open up and stretch the shortened chest and shoulder muscles that are pulling you forward into this hunched posture here you'll simply grip the tower band with a wide overhand grip pull it apart slightly to create tension and then without bending your elbows raise it over your head and behind your back going only as far as you're capable of then when it gets behind your back focus on pulling your hands apart start with a wider grip and over time narrow your grip as your mobility improves next we're going to move on to the cobra pose to now stretch out pretty much all the titan muscles from sitting this is arguably one of the single best stretches for sitting because if you go joint by joint the entire body is almost completely reversed in the stretch position when compared to a typical sitting posture to do it properly and without aggravating your back however you want to execute the following lay on your stomach with your feet about hip width apart toes facing down and hands by your sides positioned directly under your shoulders next contract your quads so that your knees are off the ground bring your shoulder blades down and back and then lengthen your spine by thinking about bringing your upper body forward and up by using and engaging your mid and lower back muscles you should not be muscling your way up by pushing your arms into the ground they should simply be there for guidance and stability as you lengthen hold for a few deep breaths at the top position before coming down and repeating for more reps the next exercise we'll use here will be used to help correct some of the asymmetries developed from slouching one way when sitting this causes your muscles on your side such as your ql to tighten up and commonly droop your body one way as a result for these we'll perform a simple standing reach where you hold one hand at your hip and then with your other arm you want to extend up and back behind your body at a diagonal think about reaching towards the ceiling and experiment with different angles until you find the angle that best creates a stretch in your side shown here hold the end position for about five to ten seconds and then repeat for reps before switching to the other side and you'll probably notice that one side is tighter than the other as a result of your slot chain in which case you'd want to spend a little bit more time and do more reps on that tighter side next we're gonna move on to strengthening some of the weakened upper body muscles more specifically the weakened lower traps that contribute to that hunched over posture and the weakened neck flexors that contribute to that forward head posture to do so we'll use wall slides with chin knots here simply stand against a wall with ideally both your upper back and lower back completely flat against it then slide your arms up and down against it like so then with the back of your head against the wall simultaneously perform reps of chin knots where you tuck your chin into your chest by using those deep neck flexors to basically give yourself a double chin as you raise your arms you should feel a strong contraction in your mid back and as you perform the chin knots you should feel the muscles in the front of your neck working this combination of wall slides and chin nods is an effective way to correct both that hunch posture and that forward head posture at the same time if the ball size is too difficult to start though you can perform shoulder w's like so as an alternative next it's time to move on to focusing a little bit more on the mid and lower body muscles with the second routine to start off though we'll work on thoracic or mid-back mobility that gets stiffened from sitting and not only promotes that hunched over posture but can also lead to problems and compensations in the lower back and lower body as well to do so we use thoracic rotations where you get on all fours sit your hips back towards your heels place one hand extended out in front of you and the other held behind your neck like so then simply bring your elbow down towards the floor and while following your elbow with your eyes rotate your elbow up towards the ceiling as far as you can hold the top position briefly and then come back down for more reps before moving to the next side you should feel a good stretch in your mid-back area as you do so next we're going to move on to stretching out the hip flexors which have become tightened over time and are pulling the pelvis into that anterior pelvic tilt to do so we use a simple kneeling hip flexor stretch but the key to this exercise is effectiveness which most people overlook is to first posteriorly tilt your pelvis by contracting your glutes and abs then only once you properly set your pelvis gently lean forward until you feel a deep stretch in the front hip of your back leg hold the end position for 10 deep breaths or so and then switch the other side next we're going to move on to a stretch that not only further lengthens the tightened hip flexors but also helps open up the hips with external rotation and addresses any asymmetries present there to best set us up for success and the strengthening exercise we're gonna do next for these you can use a couch or any elevated platform and cross your front leg on top of it and fully extend your back leg to lengthen out your hip flexor then with your hands placed on your foot and your knee brace your core and simply bend at your hips to bring your chest forward until you feel a deep stretch in the side of your front hip hold it there but feel free to move around at different angles to tweak the stretch a bit then you can switch to the other side you'll likely notice that one side is significantly tighter than the other especially if you tend to cross your legs quite a bit when you're sitting if so spend a little bit more time on the tighter side and if needed an alternative is to perform this similar stretch but seated with your foot rested on your opposite knee and again leaning forward by dropping your chest until you feel a stretch lastly we're going to move on to glute bridges to help awaken and strengthen the glutes that tend to become inactive and weakened as a result of prolonged sitting and are now contributing to that anterior pelvic tilt it's vital that you perform the prior stretches first however since research has shown that those tightened muscles we stretch will actually inhibit your glute activation and make it hard for you to effectively use this exercise so to perform your glute bridges lay on your back with your knees bent and feet flat on the floor then first move into posterior pelvic tilt by contracting your glutes and abs once that's set use your glutes to thrust your hips into the air while keeping your back straight rather than arch hold the top position while contracting the glutes before coming down for more reps over time you can then progress to single leg glute bridges as you get stronger which can help correct any strengthy symmetries you may have in your glutes so here are the two routines all summarized with rep ranges and timing guidance for each of the exercises as for the best way to implement this there is some research and office workers indicating that for the highest levels of productivity throughout the day you should take a short break after every 52 minutes of work therefore a good way to easily incorporate these routines is to alternate between each of them after every hour or so of seated work during the day regardless though i'd suggest aiming to perform both of these routines at the very least once a day and ideally each twice a day if you do sit quite a bit as it's the consistency and the frequency with these routines that's key but keep in mind as well though guys that sitting is just part of the problem i mean we see similar postural imbalances in those who stand all day as well the real problem is not taking regular breaks not being aware of your posture throughout the day and just not moving enough in general so focus your efforts on improving those aspects while incorporating the routines mentioned in this video and you'll be able to create positive long-lasting changes and as a result look feel and perform that much better and for a step-by-step holistic program that shows you exactly how to train and eat to build muscle and lean down

    "published_at": "2021-04-25T16:21:03Z",
    "transcript": "do you lift weights every week twice a week three times more but are your arms chest or whatever muscle you're trying to make bigger actually staying the same size well listen up because with regards to training i'm going to show you five reasons why people who lift consistently stay the same size and if that describes you how to fix each one reason one effort first step ensure that you are training with sufficient effort research implies that it's not necessary to train to absolute failure every set but you do need to get close enough to it meaning that during each of your sets you need to push hard enough such that you're at least one to three reps short of the point where you could not possibly do one more rep with proper form but many people missed the mark on this one by either one simply not pushing hard enough during a set to reach this one to three rep short of failure zone or two overestimating how close they really are to reaching the zone for example thinking that they just did the set with only one rep left in the tank before they reached failure but in reality could have done five more if they really pushed themselves a 2017 study took 141 lifters and grouped them by lifting experience they were then asked to choose a weight that they regularly used in their training on various exercises and then predict how many reps they could do to failure they then performed each of the exercises with their self-selected load for as many reps as possible what they found was that beginners significantly underestimated how many reps that they could actually do sometimes by even up to eight reps whereas more advanced lifters in the group did estimate more accurately but still underestimated their true capabilities by about one to two reps on average meaning that some of you watching are likely either failing to push yourself hard enough to reach a zone need to maximize growth or think that you are but in reality you have much more left to give than you think it won't be comfortable and you will have to push past the point where your mind is telling you to stop but is necessary to stimulate the growth of more muscle reason two intensity you want to make sure that you're training with enough intensity or in other words using heavy enough weight for a long time it was believed that the most muscle was built in the hypertrophy rep range of 6 to 12 reps this concept has since been disproven many times over and it appears that similar muscle growth can be built across a wide range of repetitions but it does appear that there is a limit to how low of a weight and how high reps you should go before muscle growth is compromised for example in a 2018 study researchers had participants trained for 12 weeks using either 20 40 60 percent or 80 percent of their maximal strength for each exercise despite taking all sets to failure gains in the 20 condition were approximately half that achieved in the 40 60 and 80 conditions which all had similar growth based on this the authors concluded that hypertrophy is likely impaired when training with loads lighter than around 20 to 40 percent of your maximal strength for an exercise or your one rep max so as a general rule of thumb what this means is that if you can perform more than 30 reps with a given load even if it is to failure you likely need to increase the weight to drop the reps or else you will be leaving gains on the table reason 3 overload even if you're training with enough effort and even if you're using a heavy enough weight what was once hard enough to cause growth when you started working out will likely not be hard enough after a few weeks or months the easiest and most straightforward way to make sure that you continue to push yourself is to periodically try and increase the weight of an exercise for example if you use 30 pounds last week and perform 10 reps try to use 35 pounds this week and perform 10 reps but this strategy it works very well for new lifters but as you become more and more trained it is unlikely that you're going to be able to make noticeable progress on a week by week basis for more advanced individuals a more likely scenario is to try and increase the number of reps for example start by using a weight that you can perform for three sets of 10 reps the following week try and do another rep on the first set the week after that try to do another rep on the first two sets then an extra rep on all three sets continue this process until you're able to perform 12 reps for all three sets and then finally increase the weight and start that process over again these are only a few examples there's plenty of ways to do this but what's most important is that you do not let yourself fall into the mistake of doing the same exact thing for too long make sure that every week or every month you are challenging yourself and progressing by training with enough effort and then increasing the weight of reps when you start to feel it become easier reason number four execution as you continue challenging your muscles and pushing them harder than you're used to you need to ensure that your technique remains on point many make the mistake of trying to do too much too soon and sacrificing good technique to use more weight or add another rep so even if you checked out point number three you could be artificially getting stronger and improving your sets and reps every week but compensated by using more momentum or shortening the range of motion this minimizes the tension and growth that your target muscle will experience and in many cases is why those of you who have been getting stronger and progress in your exercises just don't see the growth along with it we've seen multiple times in the research that using a partial range of motion rather than a full range of motion generally leads to less growth even if heavier weight is used and i'm sorry to break it to you but many of you watching will need to reduce the weight that you're used to using and focus on improving your form trust me i know you'll be feeling as if you're taking a step backwards but that couldn't be further from the truth and is necessary if you want to start actually seeing results now before we dive into reason number five what i want you to first do is run through the following checklist based on the points that we previously covered number one are you taking each of your sets in your workouts to within one to three reps of true failure a good way to make sure that you are trained with enough effort is to perform a single set to failure for a given exercise every few weeks doing this will help to make sure that you are actually training as close to failure as you think you are say that you normally do three sets of ten on the chest press every two to three weeks perform your first two sets as you normally would but then take your last set to absolute failure if you can do more than 12 to 13 reps then that's a good indication that you're normally just not trading hard enough and need to add more weight or reps but just keep in mind that training to true failure can be dangerous and it should be implemented with caution this practice it works very well for machine and single joint exercises but if you're going to do this for a multi-joint exercise such as the bench press then just make sure that you have a spotter and stop before your form starts to really break down number two are you training with enough intensity if you can perform more than 30 reps when you take a set to failure then you need to increase the weight that you're using three are you progressing your training to keep up with your gains remember what was once enough to stimulate growth in your muscles eventually will be no longer enough you will have to increase the weight and or reps at some point to stimulate more growth and you need to use a systematic way of implementing this four finally are you training with good technique and a full range of motion many of you will say yes to this but in reality you're failing to check this off and you need to lighten the weight during your next workout take a video of yourself doing an exercise with a certain weight then take a video of yourself doing that exercise once you have overloaded it with more weight or reps the two videos should look identical in fact aside from your facial expressions and the speed of the rep your form for your warm-up sets and your most difficult sets should look pretty much identical if not then you're likely compensating and sabotaging your gains as a result if you have checked all of these boxes and you're still not making good progress then and only then should you start considering number five training volume now the training volume that you're going to need to grow the fastest is highly variable and what will be enough for one person to grow may not be enough for somebody else based on the current research it appears as though at least 10 sets per muscle per week is a rough estimate of where to start but once again this will be different for everyone if you find yourself in a place where you need to increase volume then a good rule of thumb is to increase whatever you are currently doing by about twenty to thirty percent to stimulate more growth for example if you are currently performing ten sets of chest exercises per week but are failing to make good gains then increasing this up to about 12 to 13 sets per week is probably a good place to start but again this is the last consideration you should be making if you're not experiencing the gains you know you should be then go through this checklist and odds are you'll find at least one culprit that may be the reason why but keep in mind that it's also absolutely essential that you pair all of this with a solid nutrition plan to fuel and support your recovery and growth for a step-by-step program that does all of this for you by showing you how to train and how to eat week after week to maximize growth and strip off excess fat then simply head on over to builtwithscience.com and take our analysis quiz to discover the best program for you and your specific body anyways that is it for today guys i really hope you enjoyed this video please show your support by giving the video a like leaving a comment down below

    "title": "The PERFECT 5 Minute Posture Routine To Increase Your Height",
    "published_at": "2022-06-19T16:45:22Z",
    "transcript": "can we do exercises to make ourselves taller yes but anything we do will only reveal our natural height in fact many people who have applied my past posture routines have noticed significant height improvements here's alex and abdullah who both grew by three centimeters here's aljoshka whose parents even noticed this height increase and here's gautam who instantly gained 1.5 inches after doing the exercises how does this work well many of us sit for most of the day and when we do we sit like this at work or like this when driving even when we're eating over time our bodies will learn to become extremely efficient sitters and will lock us up into this hunched over head forward position this can not only reduce our height but can also create feelings of stiffness and negatively impact our mobility there is however a five-minute solution that can help improve your posture undo the damages of prolonged sitting and maybe even give you an extra inch or two of height as a bonus today i'll show you what exactly that is and how to use it first let's do a quick overview of the routine and the science behind it if we take a look at the most common saving posture you can see how certain joints get locked up in poor positions improve our posture and relief stiffness we want to look for exercises that not only move these joints in the opposite way but also strengthen the weakened muscles needed to keep the joints in the proper position for good for example if our head is stuck forward in extension most of the time will benefit from an exercise that reverses this motion and trains the deep neck flexors that pull the head back we'll apply this concept to the three most common problem areas in the areas that affect your height the most the back the shoulders and the neck let's start by focusing on your back the first exercise is going to help improve your ability to rotate your mid-back based on how you sit though you may be more stiff higher up in your back or lower in your back i'll show you how to adjust your form to find your most problematic area first get on all fours and sit your hips back towards your heels place one hand extended out in front of you and the other held behind your neck then bring your elbow down towards the floor and while following your elbow with your eyes rotate your elbow up towards the ceiling as far as you can exhale as you rotate your elbow up and push down into the floor with your planted hand hold the top position briefly and then come back down for more reps before moving over to the next side over time try to rotate your elbow further and further now the closer your butt is to your heels the lower in your spine you'll feel the movement so first try it with your hips on your heels like we just did but then try it with your knees semi-flex and then your knees at 90 degrees to work higher and higher on your back you'll want to focus on the area that feels the tightest and as for how many reps and sets to do don't worry we're gonna cover all that in the full routine at the end of this video for now just focus on the form next we're going to focus on extending your back out of its random position and strengthening some of your back muscles this exercise is a great option to do so because if you go joint by joint the entire body is almost completely reversed in this stretch position when compared to a typical sitting posture but it's important that you pay close attention to form to avoid aggravating your back lay in your stomach with your feet about hip width apart point your toes down and place your hands by your sides positioned directly under your shoulders next contract your quads so that your knees are off the ground and then bring your shoulder blades down and back from here think about bringing your upper body forward and up by using your mid-back muscles you want to try to at least get your chest to the floor but go up only as far as it's comfortable for you and without any pain hold that top position for a second or two and then come back down and note that you are not muscling your way up by pushing your arms your arms are simply there for stability when done properly you should feel the muscles in your mid and low back activating to lift your upper body over time try to extend higher and higher now guys before we move on to the shoulders i want to emphasize that while these exercises may look easy when i do them it took me a long time to improve my mobility to get to this point and many of you will find them quite challenging when you actually try it so don't worry if your form doesn't quite look like mine yet run with your eyes and go as far as i can nice don't use your arms good breathe come back up all right so now that we've unlocked the spine we'll be better able to work on your stiff shoulders that are rounding you forward into a locked up position and also contributing to your forward head posture the first exercise will focus on loosening up the shoulders grab a band towel or broomstick and hold it with a wide overhead grip pull your hands apart to create tension and then raise the band or stick over and behind your back as if you were making a big circle try to go as far back as you comfortably can and aim to go lower and lower to make a bigger circle over time but avoid arching your low back and keep your core braced and once that becomes easy you can make it harder by using a narrower grip so the previous exercise helped us loosen up our shoulders but now we want to strengthen our weakened back and shoulder muscles to do so we're going to use what i call reverse wall angels kneel in front of a wall with your knees chest and forehead in contact with the wall release your core and then while keeping your arms straight move them in a big circle overhead as high as you can and then back down as you do so try to keep your arms and hands a couple inches away from the wall and think about pushing your arms out away from you to better engage your back muscles avoid leaning back and arching your low back instead keep your back straight the only movement should come from your arms when done properly you should feel this in the muscles of your mid-back and shoulders if however you feel this more in your upper traps try performing it on the floor or on a bench instead as your mid-back muscles may not yet be strong enough to perform this upright if on the other hand you find it too easy you can add pulses to each part of the movement and even add a bit of weight in your hands finally we're ready for the last piece of the puzzle the neck nerd neck forward head posture whatever you want to call it is extremely common nowadays back in the 2020 cross-sectional study researchers took 200 university students and assessed their cranial vertebral angle which is typically the angle used to assess forward head posture they found that 146 of the 200 students exhibited a cranial vertical angle less than 53 degrees which the researchers used as a criteria for testing positive for forward head posture odds are you have some degree of this as well in fact your head is probably sticking out right now watching this video and i bet you probably just corrected yourself as well that's great but to fix it for good what we need to do is actually pretty simple we just need to strengthen the deep muscles in your neck that'll become weak and are failing to do its job of keeping your head in its upright position in fact in a 2021 review every single study that focused on strengthening these deep neck muscles helped the participants successfully reverse their forward head posture as for the strengthening exercise we're going to use although it may not look pretty it's extremely effective and can be done anywhere sit down on a chair and while gazing straight forward pull your chin straight back you're not trying to jam your head as far back as you can it's a very small motion of only a few inches but as you perform it you do want to make sure that you aren't leaning back or tilting your head up your head should move in a straight line directly back you can also perform this against a wall to prevent you from cheating and to have a goal of touching the back of your head against the wall try to hold the end position for one second once that becomes easy you can add a chin tuck to the end position by tucking your chin down as if you're trying to give yourself a double chin and holding that for a second or two before returning to the start position when done properly you should feel the deep muscles under your chin really working alright so now that we've gone through the exercises let's cover how to implement them for the best results you're going to do each exercise for one minute within that minute take it slow and try to do as many quality reps as you can quality is far more important than quantity here and to help you guys out i've also created a completely free downloadable pdf that contains the full routine and step-by-step tutorials to guide you through each exercise as you perform it to download it just head on over to builtwithscience.com posturepdf implement this one to two times a day make an effort to get up and move more and you'll very quickly feel and see a difference and don't forget to measure your height before and after as well and leave a comment below if you managed to gain an inch or two if you didn't don't worry about it embrace your height ignore anyone who puts you down about it and enjoy the many other benefits that this routine has to offer now this routine does heavily focus on the upper body but odds are most of you have tight hips as well as glutes that could use some awakening from while you're sitting so here's a video to help working your hips and here's a video to help work on your glutes and if you want to take things a step further to look and feel great you can check out

    "title": "The Best Science-Based Trap Workout for Growth",
    "published_at": "2018-09-30T16:10:07Z",
    "transcript": "[Music] of all the major muscle groups the traps are one of the most important muscles for creating a powerful looking upper body and completing a well-developed frame for example take a look at the following two pictures of me the original on the left and the edited version on the right with a considerable downsizing of my traps you can see the extent to which the well-developed traps on the left contribute to the overall aesthetic of my upper body by connecting the neck to the shoulders whereas on the right this component is absent and takes away from the muscularity of my physique and not only that but adequate development of all three portions of the trapped muscle adds considerable size and definition to the back musculature between the lats while also playing an important role in injury prevention and improving posture and despite the fact that several common pulling exercises will involve the traps they can be further emphasized through direct trap training but in order to learn how to best work out the traps we need to first understand their anatomy anatomically the trapezius muscle is divided into three main regions commonly referred to as the upper middle and lower traps the upper traps are the region most people focus on likely because they are clearly visible from the front view the middle and lower traps on the other hand are often underdeveloped in most people partly since they're not visible in the mirror but also because other more powerful muscle groups like the upper traps and the lats tend to overpower them which is detrimental since they not only help add extra definition to your back but they play a very important role in scapular stability which is especially useful for preventing shoulder impingement therefore ensuring that you're actually emphasizing each portion of the traps based on their function and anatomy is vital and in this video i'll show you an evidence-based workout that does just that when it comes to trap development rack pulls above the knee have become increasingly popular as of late and for good reason although this exercise will target the majority of the back musculature most of the emphasis is placed on the upper traps and the reason they're so effective at building the upper traps can be explained through the findings of the following two emg analysis studies both studies found that during the conventional deadlift upper trap muscle activity is the lowest during liftoff to mid lift when the bar is around knee height whereas from past the knee to lockout the involvement of the upper traps increases and reaches its maximum muscle activity therefore by limiting the movement such that you're only performing the upper portion of a deadlift you're able to specifically emphasize and overload the upper traps with heavy weight without taxing your lower body musculature making above the knee rack pulls a very effective option for targeting the upper traps without impairing your recovery it should also be noted that since as shown in this 2011 study from the university of kentucky upper trap muscle activity during the deadlift increases with heavier loads you should therefore strive to use heavy weight when performing this movement in order to maximize upper trap involvement but as always to avoid injury do so within your relative capabilities [Music] the barbell shrug is another excellent exercise to include in your arsenal for trap development they will again mainly emphasize the upper traps and seem to be one of the best options when it comes to activating and developing this region one 2008 paper from anderson colleagues found that the shrug elicited the highest upper trap activity when compared to four other common upper trap exercises in agreement with this an extensive 2010 emg analysis by researcher brett contreras analyzed upper trap activity with 25 different shoulder and trap exercises and the barbell shrug was once again found to elicit the highest upper trap activity however despite already eliciting high upper trap activity it's vital that you perform the barbell shrug optimally in order to maximize its effectiveness and as shown in this paper from the journal of clinical biomechanics that analyze the shrug there's two things you can do the first thing you can do is widen your grip width this is because performing the shrug with your hands shoulder-width apart increases the involvement of the levator scapulae muscle in your neck and lessens that of the upper traps due to their respective muscle fiber orientation so instead by widening your grip when you perform the shrug you can see how the line of pull is now more in line with the way the upper trap fibers run which helps increase their involvement while lessening that of the levator scapulae muscle the second thing you can do is rather than simply shrugging the weight completely straight up and down you want to instead think about squeezing your shoulder blades together as you shrug up since the upper traps not only function to just elevate the scapula but also assist in retracting it it means that this small tweak will lead to a better contraction this next exercise is something i'd highly suggest you add into your trap training arsenal they're called prone reverse flies and will mainly emphasize the mid traps which will not only help with the overall aesthetic of your back but also helps tremendously in terms of injury prevention and improving posture multiple studies have found that the prone reverse fly with external rotation such that the thumbs are pointing up elicits maximal activity of the mid traps which is likely because of the way the mid trap fibers run since as you can see here the line of pull of the arms is most in line with the mid trap fibers which run pretty much horizontally now as for how to perform them simply lay on a flat or incline bench or even on the floor and lift your arms straight out to your side with your thumbs pointing up the goal is to feel a strong contraction in the middle of your back so avoid shrugging your shoulders up as you perform them in order to minimize upper trap involvement i'd highly suggest that you start out without any weight and then gradually add weight over time as needed this exercise will mainly emphasize the lower traps which like the mid traps not only contribute to aesthetics but also play a vital role in strength and stability of the shoulder and improving posture and in support of this exercise one 2003 emg study by ekstrom and colleagues found that prone wise elicited the highest lower trap activation when compared to nine other common lower trap exercises which again is likely because of the way the lower trap fibers run since as you can see here the line of pull of the arms is most in line with the lower trap fibers which run downwards at a slight angle and the way to perform this exercise is pretty much identical to the previous exercise just with your arms positioned such that they make a y shape i'd suggest starting out with no weight initially and then you can progress it by either adding weight over time or by performing the same concept with the cable machine for the added resistance we kneel down and grab the opposite cables with each hand and raise your arms overhead such that they make a y shape so to wrap this all up here is a sample worker you can do using the exercises previously discussed keep in mind that this is just a recommendation and the optimal number of sets and reps will vary individually but i just wanted to give you guys some sense of direction to take and as for how to best implement this you have a few options if your traps are really lagging and it fits well with your workout split you can run this just as a workout on its own another option is to just add a few of these exercises when you train back or shoulders to help give your traps a little more emphasis or alternatively you could run a specialization phase for a few months with these exercises to hip the traps with greater volume just keep in mind that many back exercises especially the deadlift already target the traps so just ensure you're not over doing it and guys keep in mind that you don't just want well-developed traps you want the rest of your back and overall physique to be just as developed and if you're looking for a truly evidence-based program that shows you exactly how to do this and how to use science to help you reach your goals as efficiently as possible and simply head on over to

    "title": "The BEST 10 Minute Ab Workout For Six Pack Abs (HIT EACH AREA!)",
    "published_at": "2020-01-26T17:35:05Z",
    "transcript": "let's face it acquiring a sculpted set of six pack abs is a goal that most of us want to achieve most of us also know that in order to achieve this we need to strip off the excess fat that's covering our abs by focusing on our diet and you have to do this until you get down to at least around 10 to 12 body fat for men and around 14 to 18 for women but with that being said achieving well developed as an impressive looking midsection goes beyond this because although your diet will be mainly responsible for revealing your abs in the first place your training will then be responsible for how developed and how well your abs and overall mid section look once they're finally revealed meaning that adding in direct abs and core work into your routine is definitely needed if you'd like to improve their development but in order to best do this you need to first understand the basic anatomy of the core muscles as they each play a vital role in contributing to the overall look of your midsection first off there's a rectus abdominus which is the muscle group that most people associate with the coveted six-pack now the rectus abdominis can be further divided into two regions the upper and the lower abs and research has shown that each of these two regions can be selectively activated given that they're innervated by different nerves which as you see will be accounted for when we get to our workout next there's the obliques which run down the sides of the abs and not only adds definition to your midsection but can also help visually taper and narrow down your waistline and then lastly there's a serratus anterior situated right on top of the ribs which again adds more definition to your midsection as well as plays a vital role in your shoulder health and injury prevention so as you can see each of these muscles play a significant role in sculpting out an impressive midsection meaning that your abs routine needs to be designed in a way that hits each of these various muscles but this is something that most people fail to do with their ab workout simply because of the overwhelming number of core exercises out there which makes it difficult to pinpoint exactly which ones you should be focusing your time and effort on and which ones will speed up your core development most effectively in this video though that's exactly what i'll show you how to do by crafting the optimal abs workout for you based on both scientific research and our anatomical understanding of the core muscles so the first exercise we're going to perform is a reverse crunch which is something categorized as a bottoms up abs exercise since the hips are brought up towards your shoulders as a result effectively favors the lower abs over the upper abs in terms of activation now the reason for starting out with this movement first in the workout is simply because bottom up abs exercises are typically the most taxing to perform when compared to other abs exercises and given that the lower abs or the region the abdominals that most people struggle with not only losing fat from but also with developing will want to prioritize them by working them first in the workout when they're fresh however as i've stated in the past the key to this exercises effectiveness completely depends on how you perform it illustrating this is an emg analysis that found that subjects who perform the reverse crunch with the commonly done incorrect form where the legs were simply swung up and down were unable to elicit much lower abs activation whereas subjects who performed the reverse crunch with the correct form that i'm about to show you were now able to elicit significantly greater lower abs activation so instead of doing this what you want to do is before you even start initiate something called posterior pelvic tilt by squeezing your glutes and contracting your abs so that your pelvis tilts upwards and your back flattens onto the bench this is going to pre-activate your lower abs and will help keep them activated during each rep then when you perform a rep all i want you to think about is curling your pelvis up towards your belly button and think about contracting your lower abs and you should feel a very strong contraction in the lower as as a result of this i recommend building up this movement to roughly two to three sets of 15 to 20 reps done with body weight and full control and then move on to perform them weighted and or with the decline implemented like so for two to three sets of 10 to 15 reps and this is crucial that you do since just like any other muscle like your biceps for example you want to overload your abs with more weight over time in order to best develop and stimulate their growth next we'll move on to a rotational movement high to low wood choppers to now shift our focus onto the all-important obliques these are a great option to include in your core workouts since they enable us to apply a weighted resistance that's directly in line with the diagonal weight that the oblique fibers run and for these you want to avoid simply swinging the weight down with your arms instead keep your arms extended and elbows locked and then use the one side of your obliques to rotate your torso down and across your body towards the opposite knee i'd recommend a set and rep range of roughly two to three sets of 10 to 15 reps and then adding more weight as this becomes easier however if you find difficulty with this movement that a viable alternative are bicycle crunches which have been shown by the american council of exercise to elicit quite high activation of the obliques when compared to other common obliques exercises for these though you want to implement a higher rep range of roughly 20 to 30 reps or simply perform than a failure since you'll be working just with your body weight here next it's time to move on to weighted crunches which are a top-down abs movement that we know will now enable us to selectively emphasize the upper abs over the lower abs which were already worked earlier now there are a variety of weighted crunches that you can do here such as a stability ball crunch or weighted cable crunch which are both effective at targeting the upper abs but the key is that you're emphasizing the top down aspect of these movements by focusing on simply bringing the rib cage down and forward towards your pelvis your hips should simply remain stationary as you perform each rep which will just enable your abs to be taken through their full range of motion and for these you want to use a moderate rep range of two to three sets of 10 to 15 reps and again and gradually overload these with more weight as your ads develop and strengthen over time the last exercise of this abs workout will be something called serratus jabs which we know based on emg analyses elicits very high activity of the serratus anterior since it effectively applies both of its main movement functions protraction and upward rotation of the scapula you can use a band or cable and set it up such that your arm travels upwards during the jab then you simply want to perform an upward punching motion and reach as far as you can at the end position in order to fully protract the scapula and activate the serratus anterior to the greatest degree i will again use a rep range of 10 to 15 reps per set for these and overload it over time by increasing the resistance so to wrap this workout out for you here's how you'd want to construct it i'd recommend performing this workout one to three times per week which can either quickly be done after your main workouts or on your rest days and just for your convenience i've compiled all this information into an easy to use completely free mobile friendly pdf

    "title": "The Best Science-Based Back Workout (TARGET EVERY MUSCLE!)",
    "published_at": "2017-08-28T12:38:19Z",
    "transcript": "the biggest mistake people make when training back is utilizing too many isolation exercises and not targeting all of the back musculature which includes both superficial and deep muscles the four main muscles that make it the bulk of the back and the ones we want to focus on developing or the trapezius which has an upper and lower portion the rhomboids which lady'd to the trapezius muscle little to Smith's dorsi or lats and the erector spinae which are the lower back muscles there are also a few smaller muscles that serve an important role such as the teres muscles and the infraspinatus we want to focus on these muscles as well as they will strengthen our shoulder through stabilization and also provide an aesthetic appeal and when it comes to building a powerful and attractive looking back I think that most of us want the following large but not over developed upper traps for thickness wide strong lats that extend down load to create that elusive v-taper strong lower traps and rhomboids for mid-back thickness clear development and separation in the teres major and infraspinatus muscles and a well-defined Christmas tree structure in the lower back created by the erector spinae we can achieve these features and train all these muscles by choosing the right exercises to include in our back workouts in this video I'm going to go through a back workout consisting of five of the best back building exercises based on current scientific literature and our anatomical understanding of the back muscles now before we get started on the exercises I want to briefly talk about muscle activation it's important that you have a solid mind to muscle connection with your back muscles during each of the back exercises you perform or else you'll be training the wrong muscles in fact one study by Schneider at I'll examine the effect that cueing had on untrained athletes who were performing lat pull-downs the study found that activation of the lats were significantly higher after coaching them before some helpful cues I personally use are to think about pulling with your elbows as opposed to thinking about pulling with your hands and bring your shoulders down and away from your ears to depress your traps before starting each movement another thing I also do for most back exercises aside from the deadlift is I'll remove my thumb from underneath and put it over the grip with my fingers also known as a thumbless grip as I find this makes it harder to engage the bicep and makes it easier to feel your back using these cues will help you maximally activate the muscles that should be working in the following exercises if deathless currently aren't somewhere in your lifting routine that I highly suggest you start doing them it's a great compound movement to target pretty much all of your upper and lower back muscles which will add more width and depth to your back and help you get that Christmas tree shape and it also works several lower body muscles in addition to the large hormonal responses exercise elicits when compared to isolation exercises it's also very easy to progressively overload this exercise with weight given that you're doing the exercise with proper form which of course is essential and although I'm not going to explain how to perform the deadlift properly in this video I highly recommend you do a little bit of research as to the proper way to do them before trying it out I personally prefer including deadlifts on my back day as opposed to my leg day and I suggest starting with this exercise first year in your workout as it's a very energy demanding exercise this is probably my favorite back exercise for several reasons first of all not only does it work pretty much all of your back musculature like your lats lower traps and rhomboids they also greatly increase the role of your shoulder and scapular stabilizers like the terry's muscles and the infraspinatus and the fact that it's a closed chain I should say as meaning that the hands are held at a fixed anchor point means that it may result in greater motor unit recruitment as demonstrated in several studies that compared open chain exercises like lat pull-downs with closed chain exercises like the pull-up now as for whether you should do pull-ups or chin-ups research such as this study by Otis Adel tends to show that both pull-ups and chin-ups provided equal lat activation however this same study showed that the lower traps and infraspinatus had greater activation in the pull-up when compared to the chin up whereas the chin up had greater pectoralis major and biceps brachii activation given that we are focusing on maximizing back growth pull-ups seemed like the better option for this reason however I urge you not to immediately draw conclusions directly from literature especially solely from EMG studies as all studies have flaws and we all have individual differences in our anatomy and body structure so try them both out and see which feels better for you and you can always include both in your workout I find that a fairly wide overhand thumbless grip pull up best activates my back and as for a progressive overload once you can comfortably perform 10 to 12 clean reps of the bodyweight pull-up I suggest starting to gradually add weight by using a weight belt or holding a dumbbell between your feet in order to continuously get stronger this exercise and if you're currently unable to do a pull-up I suggest using an assisted pull-up machine and focusing on negatives until you build the strength to do bodyweight pull-ups next you want to move on to a horizontal rowing movement one study by laymen that I'll actually found that the seated row provided similar levels of lat activation as lat pull-downs but more activation in other areas of the back like the traps and rhomboids so I definitely suggest you include a rowing type movement into your back routine to hit these other muscles whether it be t-bar rows bent over barbell rows and so on I pervert this variation of the chest supported row where you put a bench at an incline and pull the weighted bar towards your chest which works the majority of your back muscles with more emphasis on their mid-back musculature I prefer this exercise because it minimizes the involvement of my lower back in the movement which has already gotten a good workout for my deadlifts now although the pull-up is a superior exercise when compared to lat pull-downs the lat pulldown is an excellent supplemental open-chain exercise that targets pretty much the same muscles I previously showed in the pull-up just with less involvement of the shoulder stabilizers as for the best variations to perform them in my opinion overhand middle and wide grip front pull downs with a slight lean back are likely the best options front pull downs have been showed in numerous studies such as this one by barrows at all to be superior in terms of lat activation when compared to other variations like behind the neck pull downs and another bonus is it doesn't place your glenohumeral joint in a compromised position as behind the neck pull downs do so stick to front pull downs as for hand grip one study by lusca IL concluded that a pronated grip had significantly higher lat activation when compared to a supinated grip during lat pull downs which is why I recommend using an overhand grip I also suggest a slight lean bag during the pull downs based on the conclusions of this study which demonstrated that a slight lean back at 135 degrees led to it an 11% increase in lat activation as long as no momentum is used so a slight lean back may be optimal but you don't want to be swinging every rep as for grip with this study by Anderson I'll examine the activation of various back muscles using three different grip widths narrow medium and wide the researchers concluded that the three different widths exhibited very similar lat activation but the biceps were most activated with the middle grip and in addition subjects were able to lift the most weight with the middle grip however the same study also showed that during the eccentric portion of the movement the infraspinatus one of our rotator cuffs was better activated during the wide grip and given that a wider grip will also involve more of your teres major muscle due to its anatomical position and function I think we can conclude that using a combination of both the middle and wide grip is best in terms of bag training as opposed to just sticking to one grip with this last exercise is something I highly suggest you add into your back training routine they're called scapular pull-ups and mainly strengthen your lower traps while helping with your scapular stability and keeping your shoulders healthy you simply want to be hang from a bar to press your shoulders down and away from your ears and pull your body up without allowing your elbows to bend as you get stronger with this exercise you can always progress it by using a weight belt or alternatively perform the exercise on your knees and use the handles on a cable machine so to wrap this all up here's a sample workout what you can do using the five exercises I discussed you want to stick with this routine for a couple months and focus on progressively overloading these exercises but I guarantee that if you get strong as hell with these exercises you will develop a well-rounded and powerful looking back video useful I know it's a lot of information to take in our first but I honestly believe that if you implement what I go through in the video so you'll be able to maximize your Factory and see a lot more back growth and with that being said I've put in a lot of time and effort into this video so I'd

    "title": "How To Grow Your Biceps In 10 Minutes (Using Science)",
    "published_at": "2021-08-22T17:33:27Z",
    "transcript": "i'm going to give you a killer 10 minute bicep workout using only dumbbells we'll use three different training methods that will cut your workout time by a third without sacrificing gains i'll show you how each of these methods work using science and exactly how to use them to grow your biceps alright so here is the 10 minute workout method one takes about two minutes to complete and will use something called rest pause sets method two we'll pair two bicep exercises together as a compound set that will take five minutes to complete method three will finish the workout off with drop sets which are brutal but will only take one minute to complete assuming one minute of rest between each method you'll be done in just 10 minutes so to kick the workout off we're going to implement rest pause training this is a method where instead of doing a bunch of test print exercises you combine it all into just one long set illustratedness effectiveness is a recent 2019 study where participants were split into two groups one group trained their biceps with a traditional method using three sets of six reps with 90 seconds of rest between each set the other group used rest pause training where they performed just one long set within the set they tried to do as many reps as possible only took 20 seconds rest and then repeated this process until they achieved the same amount of total reps as a traditional group what they found is that both training methods resulted in similar gains in size and strength in the biceps despite the rest pause group only training for half the time we're going to take the science and we're going to apply to our workout with an exercise that is completely safe for us to push our limits with but you need to maintain proper form as you do so otherwise you're gonna risk the rest pause method actually not working start by finding a way that you could typically do six to eight reps with then using that weight perform your first set and try to do as many reps as possible so as the set gets more difficult be mindful of two things first keep your elbow locked by your side letting it swing forward is going to take tension away from the biceps and onto the front delts instead a little bit of movement as shown here is perfectly fine but any more than that is just too much second also be mindful of your wrist you want to avoid curling the wrist excessively at the top which is going to cause the forearms to take over instead to maximize the tension on the biceps keep them neutral and keep your palms facing up even at the bottom okay so once you finish your first rest pause set and can't do any more reps put the weights down rest for just 20 seconds and then immediately pick the weights back up perform another set using that weight for as many repetitions as you can it's not going to be as many as you could do the first time but keep repeating this process until you have completed a total of 20 reps if done correctly it'll likely take you around four to five mini sets to get a total of 20 reps and would look something like this all right method two compound sets this is where we take two types of bicep exercises that can be performed back to back without rest this is possible because the bicep is composed of two heads there's a short head which is the inner part of the bicep and then there's the long head which is the outer part of the bicep these two heads have slightly different functions during bicep curls where your arm is held in front of the body the short head is more active and the long head is less active whereas the opposite is true for exercises where your arm is held behind the body we can take advantage of this to save time by performing a compound set of two bicep exercises performed back to back without rest to perform this compound set start by setting an adjustable bench up to 30 degrees this is generally the third or fourth notch on the bench then you're gonna go grab a weight that you typically do 10 to 12 reps with for a normal bicep curl with the dumbbells in hand lay with your stomach on the bench and your arms hanging down in front of you you're gonna lock your elbows in that position and then curl the weight up but as you do so fight the urge to let your elbows move back towards your body instead keep your upper arm perpendicular to the ground and then you're going to do as many reps as you can with good form ideally somewhere between 8 to 12 reps immediately after we're gonna flip over on the bench keep the exact same pair of dumbbells but now position the arms behind the body then you're gonna lock your elbows in place and curl the weight up but in this case you're gonna be tempted to let your elbow move up closer to the body fight this by keeping your upper arm perpendicular to the ground to maximize tension on your biceps once again you're gonna empty the tank on this one by performing as many reps as possible while keeping good form after doing so you'll have completed one compound set take 60 seconds of rest and then repeat this two more times okay so to finish the workout off we're gonna use drop sets this is where you do a bunch of sets without rest but you actually drop the weight after each set illustrating this effectiveness is a 2017 study where researchers had participants perform curls two different ways one group used the traditional method of three sets with 90 seconds rest between each set the other group used drop sets where they performed an initial set where they tried to do as many reps as they could to failure decrease the weight by around five pounds immediately performed another set of failure and continued this without rest until five sets in total were done what they found is that both groups experienced similar gains in size and strength but the drop set group finished each workout in less than a third of the time as for the exercise that we're going to apply droplets to we actually want to use an exercise that will target an arm muscle called the brachialis that has yet to be emphasized with our previous exercises this muscle it runs under the biceps but when grown it can actually help to push up your biceps and create an illusion of a bigger bicep it can be targeted by using curls where the hand is in a neutral position such as in a hammer curl where you hold the dumbbells as if there were hammers to implement this start by finding a way that you can initially do between 15 and 20 reps with using that weight perform one set of hammer curls to failure with good form keeping that elbow locked in place with minimal swinging after you can't do any more reps immediately move to the next lowest set of dumbbells and perform another set to failure you're gonna repeat this until five yes five total sets are completed it's gonna burn it's gonna feel nasty but trust me it's worth it for the growth then you're done you can see how much more effective your workouts can be if you apply the right signs to apply the same science to all of your workouts not just your biceps then head over to buildwithscience.com and take our quiz to find the best program

    "title": "The Best Science-Based DUMBBELL Legs Exercises For Size And Symmetry",
    "published_at": "2020-12-06T17:33:37Z",
    "transcript": "to be honest nothing really feels like an accomplishment quite like doing some heavy deadlifts or some back squats however sometimes it's just nice to change things up and sometimes we may even have to depending on our circumstances and equipment availability and the good thing is that we don't need a barbell or leg press machine to adequately work and strengthen every major muscle in the legs as long as you know what you're doing today i'm going to show you how to do just that with the use of a few dumbbells and a little bit of science but before we go into the actual exercises we first need to talk about rep ranges this is especially true for those who only have access to a few lighter dumbbell sizes as you will most likely not have enough weight to mimic the same amount of load that you'd normally have so to compensate for this instead of using our typical moderate rep ranges we'll instead use higher reps for most of our sets and focus on simply taking each of our sets close enough to failure so that our leg muscles are sufficiently activated despite using lighter weight this is what's most important for muscle growth and is why several papers have now shown that we can get comparable results by using lighter weights for higher reps as we would by doing less reps with heavier weight as long as we're pushing close enough or all the way to failure during our sets so keep that in mind as we go through the following exercises first we'll start with dumbbell squat jumps with the weight held either by your sides or at your chest this will not only work most of your lower body muscles like the quads and glutes but will also help improve our athleticism and can help better prepare lower body muscles and nervous system for the rest of the workout one study that implemented this exercise with a group of athletes showed an improvement in maximal strength vertical jump and sprint performance after eight weeks and the fact that we may only have lighter dumbbells to work with is perfect for this movement since our goal here is power production we aren't going to use very heavy weights and we aren't going to do a ton of reps but we do want to focus on proficiency with every single rep to maximize force and to do so research suggests to squat down to just above parallel instead of all the way down and then explode on the way up with near maximal effort for a total of just six reps for four or five sets perform these reps consecutively but move smoothly this means a proper landing followed by controlled descent into your next squat this is also the one exercise on this list where you should not train to failure next we're going to move on to the hardest strength movement of this workout the skater squat to perform this movement you drop your back leg and then squat back up using your front leg it's almost like a reverse launch except your back foot never quite hits the ground holding the light dumbbell out in front of you will help even out your weight to make balancing easier now the key difference between this exercise and other single leg squat variations or the back squat is that the hips travel further backwards and the torso inclines further forwards which research has shown results in significantly greater activation of the hamstrings and the glutes when compared to the traditional back squat or other single leg variations now even with just your body weight this is quite a difficult movement so what i'd recommend is to reduce the range of motion by placing blocks a stack of books cushions or any platform for your back need to touch on during the descent then over time gradually decrease the height of this platform until you can lower your back knee to the floor another option is to hold on to a countertop or any fixture just to help out with your balance and support during the movement next we're going to move on to a quad dominant lunge variation this movement will allow us to continue focusing on one leg at a time yet with less of a strength demand than our previous exercise now the easiest lunge variation out there are split squats which are lunges but without alternating legs one study which compared split squats to lunges found that non-resistance trained men completed split squats with a much greater range of motion compared to lunges since they were better able to balance just making it a great choice for those who are relatively new to training for these you set your stance and then simply drop your back knee towards the floor then push back up with the front leg continue until you finish your set on that side before switching to the other leg this exercise is going to hit your quads your hamstrings and your glutes but given that the skater squats we performed prior to this already did a great job of emphasizing our hamstrings and the glutes we actually want to make this exercise more quads focus and research has shown that we can do this just by narrowing our stance during our setup and maintaining an upright torso so that your front knee can travel forward more this will as a result shift more tension away from the hamstrings and glutes and onto the quads instead now if you think you need an even tougher movement or you only have access to lighter dumbbells then simply perform what's known as a bulgarian split squat where you now elevate your rear foot to place an even greater load on your forward leg when comparing various studies it's estimated that during a traditional lunge or split squat the forward leg supports 75 of your body weight whereas the bulgarian split squat now supports 85 percent of your body weight we also see slightly less hamstring activity with a bulgarian split squat as well just making it the ideal lunge variation to emphasize your quads with especially if you're limited to lighter weights and again just as with the standard split squats you'll want to use a relatively narrow stance to shift more of the tension towards the quads next we'll focus on the hamstrings with a single leg romanian deadlift as the name suggests this is simply a romanian deadlift but on a single leg you want to keep your planted leg relatively straight and simply bend over the hips while keeping a neutral back now the single leg romania deadlift has a few benefits over the standard double leg one you're not going to need as much weight to load the muscles and again this is just a great movement if you have limited weights and two being that you're on one leg you're going to get more activation from your stabilizer muscles specifically your medial glutes as they are a primary stabilizer in fact in a study speaking about the massive benefits of single leg squats like the moves we did earlier it was suggested that a single leg romanian deadlift be paired with them in order to better isolate the hamstrings due to the high activation that they experienced during this movement so it's a great option but if you find this a little too difficult to balance however you can start with a regression by using a split stance and use your back leg to provide a little bit more stability as you perform the movement next we're going to perform the line dumbbell leg curl to further target the hamstrings but with the knee flexion dominant movement instead this is important to do since as illustrated in a 2015 paper activation of the upper hamstrings seems to be maximized with hip dominant exercises like the romanian deadlifts we previously did whereas the lower hamstrings seem to be best activated with more knee dominant exercises like the leg girl which makes sense given that the short head of the biceps femoris one of her hamstrings muscles crosses over the knee joint and can only be trained through knee flexion so to perform this movement you can perform it on the ground or on a bench like so you want to control the weight and extend the downward or eccentric portion of each rep as strengthening this portion of the movement has been shown to be important for both enhancing athletic performance and preventing hamstring injury next to train the inside of our legs the inductors will use something called an inductor bridge normally a heavy full range of motion bubble squat and similar exercises would do the trick to strengthen this region but since we don't have that available for us and are likely limited in terms of weights we'll want to just ensure that we don't potentially leave this muscle behind this is especially important since studies have shown that strengthening the abductors greatly reduces the chance of growing injuries so to perform this movement you'll need a bench or some form of elevated platform you're going to get into a side plank position place one leg bent on top of the support and then let your other leg hang underneath then simply contract the abductors of your top leg to pull your body up take it slow and pause at the top of each rep you should feel the muscles on the inside of your top leg working as you do so and if this is too difficult you can simply hold it at the top isometrically and focus on extending this isometric pause as you get stronger over time lastly to finish off the workout with some more volume we're going to use dumbbell goblet squats while usually we start with squats due to the ability to use a heavy load since we have limited equipment this actually becomes the lightest movement and a great finisher since our legs are already quite pre-fatigued from our previous exercises we'll be able to provide greater muscular fatigue to our legs with this exercise even though we're using relatively lighter weight so push hard and focus on accumulating volume for these and feel free to take these sets to failure so putting all the exercises together here's what your lower body workout could look like i have a listed reps on many of these movements because as i mentioned earlier focus more on taking each step close to failure whether you reach this with 10 reps or 20 reps depending on your strength and the amount of weight that you have handy it doesn't matter as long as you're pushing hard enough during each set as that's what matters the most overall this is a great lower body workout that can hang with any barbell workout even if you don't have a ton of fancy equipment by taking the time to carefully select your exercises and properly implement them you can create an effective muscle building workout that also doesn't overlook important key muscle groups and for a step-by-step science-based program that shows you week after week how to work out and how to eat to get the best results regardless of what equipment you may or may not have and simply head on over to buildscience.com and take our analysis

    "published_at": "2021-01-17T16:30:03Z",
    "transcript": "if your body feels stiff and achy in certain areas you're getting pains and knots here and there or your posture has over time evolved into something like the following then chances are your body would benefit from having more mobility in fact most people are lacking sufficient mobility in key areas due to a lack of movement combined with the funky positions that we put our bodies in throughout the day this can then affect not only our posture but also our risk of injury our ability to perform certain exercises and just our quality of life this is why dedicating more time to improving your mobility can be so beneficial and this doesn't require a lot of time at all if you focus only on the areas that actually need work rather than wasting your time and effort on performing mobility exercises in areas where you actually don't need an increase in mobility in fact in some instances this can even do more harm than good now as for where these problem areas are physical therapist great cook and strength coach mike boyle shaped a concept that's called the joint by joint approach based on their years of experience and research they found that typically there are four main areas where people tend to lack sufficient mobility the most the shoulders the thoracic spine the hips and the ankles therefore what we're going to do in this video is we're going to focus our mobilizations on these specific areas and within each specific area we'll also first determine if you truly could benefit from more mobility in that area or not so by the end of the video you'll have a personalized mobility plan based on the areas where your body can use the most work the first area we're going to cover is a shoulder joint a lack of mobility here is nowadays quite common especially in males in fact in the shoulder mobility test i'm about to show you on average almost all male subjects including young subjects in their 20s failed the test with the failure rates just continuing to rise and worsen with age this result was slightly better in females but still had a similar trend as males and this common mobility deficit becomes a problem because of the compensations we then make not only in the gym during our major lifts but also in our daily life during any reaching or overhead tasks for example which can then lead to pain and discomfort down the road so to test for this mobility deficit we're going to use what's called the aptly scratch test to perform it simply reach one arm up and over your shoulder and your other arm up your back as far as possible to pass ideally you want those fingers to touch but aim to at least get your top hand to reach the top of your shoulder blade and your bottom hand to at least touch the bottom of your shoulder blade if your top arm fails then it's likely missing adequate shoulder external rotation and abduction if your bottom arm fails then this indicates that it's likely missing the opposite adequate shoulder internal rotation and adduction so do the test on both sides and see how you do and note down which arm has the worst mobility on each side we'll want to then use these results to determine which specific shoulders and positions need the most work with our mobility drill in order to correct the imbalances and the mobility drill we're going to use is quite simple just grab a shirt or towel and hold it in each hand using the test position with both hands behind your back then to mobilize the top arm perform reps of gently pulling down on the towel while actively reaching downward with your top arm whereas to mobilize the bottom arm perform reps of pulling the towel up while actively reaching up with your bottom arm each rep do so gently and avoid letting your shoulder round forward as you do so you'll want to only do the respective arms that failed and spend more time on whichever needs more work next we'll move on to the mid and upper back or in other words the thoracic spine this area often stiffens up due to excessive sitting and technology used throughout the day and we over time lose the ability to extend our back out of this hunch posture to test if this is a problem area for you it's pretty simple just take a picture sideways in the mirror with your body relaxed as hard as this picture may be to look at analyze it and if your mid to upper back seems to round then that's a good sign that it could use some mobility work to do so we're gonna first mobilize the area with thoracic extensions here just place your elbows on a bench or couch with your hands together sit your hips back into your heels as you drop your chest towards the floor hold this for a few seconds and then repeat this motion for more reps trying to go deeper every rep you should feel this in the mid and upper back region we'll then follow this up with cat cows that can either be done on the floor or conveniently done while seated like so perform it slowly while focusing on rounding and extending mainly that mid upper back region next we'll move on to the hips that tend to get tight from sitting and driving and also tend to develop various imbalances because of all the positions that we put them in throughout the day and the test we're gonna do here is pretty simple perform a bodyweight squat if your feet turn out excessively on the way down or your hips just seem to lock at a certain depth and you can't go below parallel or your hips tend to shift to one side during your squat then these are all potential signs that your hips could use some more mobility work another indicator is that your hips just feel stiff in general so if this sounds like you then you'll want to add what's called the 90 90 drill to your mobility list as it's a great exercise to mobilize pretty much all of the hip muscles at once to perform it bend both legs to 90 degrees like so then while keeping your torso stacked over your hips simply transition from one side to another by opening up your hips you should feel the hip external rotators of the front leg being stretched and the hip internal rotators being stretched from the back leg you can also lean forward to deepen the stretch of the front leg and can also come up to your knees at the end position to deepen the stretch of the hip flexors in the front of your hips play around with it and again just spend more time on what feels the most restricted at first you may even need to support your body with your arms but over time just trust me this will improve lastly we need to look at the ankles which is where admittedly most of the problems stem from when our ankles lose their ability to move it affects the rest of our body to determine if they are problematic for you we'll use a pretty simple test again we're just gonna perform a bodyweight squat and see how deep he can go without rising up off your heels or leaning forward excessively then we're going to repeat this but this time we want to put weight plates or a book under each of our heels and then see if your squat improves in terms of depth and form if it does then you'd likely benefit from adding the next ankle mobility drill into your daily routine simply find an elevated platform like a bench a couch or even your stairs and place one foot on top of it then using your arms under your bench or couch pull yourself forward to drive your knee directly over your toe while keeping your heel planted hold the end position for a few seconds and then repeat for more reps before switching sides lastly to tie everything together we're gonna add a weighted goblet squat to the end of our mobility routine here you'll want to hold any weighted object like a backpack stuffed with books or a weight plate out in front of you and then sit into a deep squat hold this position while keeping your chest up and rocking side to side to transfer the weight and stretch to one ankle at a time this is a great way to further mobilize basically your entire body but in a more functional position so what you'll want to do is simply go through the test for each of the four joints and use that to determine what your daily mobility list will look like to then see the best results and to maintain your new fan mobility with this routine you want to implement it daily or even two to three times a day with about two sets per exercise this should be done at a time that you'll be most consistent with and can even be done as a warm-up before your workout to help you improve your range of motion and performance in that workout when using it as a warm-up though just avoid holding each stretch statically for prolonged periods as that can provide the opposite effect and actually hinder our performance but guys just also don't forget that you need to be mindful of the positions that your body is in for the rest of the day even the most mobile of individuals will get tight if they sit down in the same position all day so make an effort to move more whether it be with this mobility routine or by simply getting up for a walk every now and then as that is very likely the root cause behind your aches and tightness and for a step-by-step program that shows you exactly how to build muscle and lean down as efficiently as possible without neglecting important aspects of your training like mobility and prehab simply

    "title": "ROUNDER GLUTES: 5 Mistakes Keeping Your Butt Flat",
    "published_at": "2022-07-03T17:08:10Z",
    "transcript": "for most men and women round firm glutes are seen as more attractive than having a flat pancake butt a nice looking butt isn't just important for turning heads though the glutes are a key muscle for athletic performance and keeping them strong can also go a long way to preventing back and hip pain the problem is most people approach their glute training the wrong way whether you're chasing the next gym shark sponsorship want to boost athletic performance fix low back pain or just look better in a pair of jeans pay attention into the next five mistakes as I guarantee you're making at least one of them before we dive into the mistakes it's important that we understand the anatomy of the glutes most people are unaware that the glutes are composed of three muscles the gluteus maximus the gluteus medius and the gluteus Minimus as for which of these three muscles is most important to develop let's take a look at this recent 2020 study researchers used Mr scans to compare the glute muscles in Elite level sprinters sub Elite sprinters and average untrained men here are the MRI scans of the three groups the Big Orange area in the back represents the glus Maximus whereas these other two areas represent the gluteus medius and Minimus you can see just how much larger the gluteus maximus is compared to the other two regions it's actually the largest and heaviest muscle in the human body and what's interesting is that not only is it a big muscle but researchers also found that the size of the gluteus maximus was a strong predictor of Sprint performance and in fact the gluteus maximus in Elite sprinters was on average 45% bigger than it was in sub Elite sprinters since this muscle makes up most of your butt and seems to be the most important region for boosting athletic performance it only makes sense to make it the focus of your training but most people fail to do this because of the following five mistakes the first mistake has to do with exercise selection the primary function of the glutitis Maximus is hip extension the movement of driving your hips forward most glute exercises you'll find online either don't train hip extension at all and focus on the smaller glute muscles or they'll train hip extension but not in a way that enables you to use heavier and heavier weights over time the best glute exercises are instead the ones that focus on hip extension and enable you to use heavier weight over time exercises like back squats leg presses Bulgarian split squats deadlifts and hip thrusts they're not fancy but if you use the right form and get really strong with these over time they're going to be the key to the glutes growth you're looking for that said even with the right exercises if you don't perform them with the right form you're going to end up working other muscles rather than the one you intended to this brings me to the next two mistakes which both have to do with exercise execution the second mistake is working your quads more than your glutes whenever you do leg exercises the reason for this has to do with the angle of your shin and the angle of your torso as you perform these exercises based on multiple kinematic analyses the more forward your shin angle is the greater the knee movement and the more the quads will be involved compared to the glutes on the other hand the more forward your torso is the more the glutes will be involved because this increases the degree of hip extension in the movement which as you'll remember is the main function of the gluteus maximus now Bas on your Anatomy some of you will naturally squat in a way that is already more glute dominant with a vertical Shin angle and lean forward torso whereas others are going to squat in a way that's more quad dominant with a forward Shin angle and upright torso this is perfectly fine and the glutes will still be heavily involved either way but in other exercises like leg presses and Bulgarian split squats we do have a greater ability to adjust our form to better emphasize the glutes in the leg press for example if you were to place your feet higher up on the platform and stop each rep once your knees hit 90\u00b0 this would enable your shins to stay vertical over the foot throughout the movement and will also involve more hip extension therefore emphasizing the glutes more than the quads in fact in muscle activation studies where they compared various foot stances they found significantly greater glute activation with a higher foot stance and significantly greater quad activation with a lower foot stance you can try these out one leg at a time as well and you can also apply the same concept to lunges and Bulgarian split squads here I'm performing the Aran split squat with an upright torso and letting my shin travel forward to emphasize a quads more whereas here by leaning forward and taking a slightly wider stance my shin is able to remain vertical over my foot and I'm able to emphasize a glutes swamp just remember that my back is still neutral I'm not rounding my back but rather bending over slightly at my hip apply this tip to these exercises and you'll feel the difference right away by the way for all the ladies watching before we move on to mistake number three I can speak on behalf of all of us guys who are dying to know the answer to this how important is a nice athletic butt on a guy is it a turn on comment yes or no below and share your thoughts and guys no matter what they say in the comments still train your glutes because they're important for so many other reasons that said let's move on to mistake number three all right so we talked about the quads taking over but in other glute exercises the lower back and hamstrings actually have a tendency to take over as well let's take a look at a great glutes exercise the Romanian deadlift although this exercise will work both the hamstrings and glutes you can modify your form to emphasize one over the other if you try to keep your legs completely straight on the way down that's going to emphasize the hamstrings more instead to emphasize the glutes you want to use some knee band this incorporates more hip extension into the exercise which as you know is the main function of the gluteus maximus in addition to this on the way down many people try to go as low as possible possible but you should only go down as far as your Mobility allows you to this is the point at which the hips stop moving backward on the way down you can see here that once my hips stop moving back if I try to get any lower than this my lower back will start to round this takes tension away from the glutes and places it on the lower back instead try to look in the mirror and spot the point where your hips can't move back any further and stop each rep as soon as you reach this point for some of you this will around the level where your hands end up around your knees whereas others will be able to go lower depending on your Mobility okay so we already covered what some of the best glute exercises are but the way that you program these into your workouts is also very important this is because different exercises challenge a muscle in different ways Bulgarian split squats for example they challenge the glutes the most at the bottom position when the muscle is fully stretch at the top position however there's no tension placed on the glutes the same is true for back back squats leg presses and Romanian deadlifts now while these are great glute Builders and while research does indicate that challenging the muscle when it's in a fully stretched position seems to be most important for growth we may be missing out on some potential growth if that's the only way that we train our glutes in fact some research shows that challenging a muscle in different ways may lead to more complete growth in the various regions of that muscle so in the case of the glutes we'd want to add in an extra exercise that challenges the muscle when it's fully shortened or in other words at the top part of the movement exercises like the hip thrust and the 45\u00b0 hip extension both do just that by providing Little Resistance to the bottom when the glutes are fully stretched and the most resistance at the top when the glutes are fully squeezed now to apply this concept to your glute Focus workouts I'd recommend picking one to two exercises that challenge the glutes most at the bottom position when they're fully stretched and then also include one that challenge es the glutes most at the top position when they're fully squeezed although picking the right exercises and Performing them correctly will set you up for Success some people especially those of you who sick quite a lot will still have a hard time activating and feeling your glutes working one way of improving this is with activation exercises these are simple exercises that Force the target muscle to carry the load so that your nervous system can learn how to use the target muscle and recruit it during your main glute movements a recent 2022 paper provides some evidence behind this method they had subjects perform glute activation exercises twice per day for a week and afterwards found that subjects were able to recruit their glutes with on average 50% more activation during the body weight squat compared to before as for the exercises i' recommend I'd highly suggest giving this past video I did watch it'll cover a quick daily routine that you can do to start Awakening your glutes so that you're better able to use them during the glut loot building exercises we covered earlier I'll leave a link to this in the description box down below as well and at the end of this video Implement these five things and you'll very quickly start to feel and see the difference in your glutes development but it's important that you take the same step by-step science-based approach to all the muscles you train if you want to maximize your efforts for a plan that puts this all together for you just head on over to built with science.com and take my analysis quiz to discover which of my

    "title": "How To Build A Big Back At Home (NO WEIGHTS &amp; NO PULL-UP BAR)",
    "published_at": "2020-04-05T16:12:04Z",
    "transcript": "you're familiar with home workouts and you already know that the back is probably the most difficult muscle to adequately train a home without equipment and especially when you don't even have a pull-up bar and although there are plenty of home back workouts out there that do target the back muscles to a certain degree they're either failed to actually work your back muscles through their full range of motion or they just don't provide enough load or resistance to enable you to actually build muscle in your back without using heavy weights in this video though I'll go through a home back workout that avoids those two komak pitfalls and will instead enable you to target and grow your various back muscles in the comfort of your own home the first exercise we'll be doing here will be a replacement for the pull-ups or allow pull downs that you typically perform in the gym to target the lats and to do so most effectively you ideally want to use a bed sheet setup that are presented in my other home workouts where you tie a knot at the end of two long bed sheets throw them over your door and then close the door inwards to now create a home version of the TRX I highly suggest you at least try the setup since we'll be using it quite a bit in this back workout but just make sure that when you actually close the door you want to close us that the door leans in against the frame as you're pulling rather than the other way around as this is gonna enable it to hold strong as you perform it exercises once you have that setup ready will perform bodyweight lap pull downs with it where you wrap the sheets around your hands lay on the floor with your legs straight and then pull your elbows down and back just as you wouldn't a pull-up a lap pull down to lift your body off of the ground and then you want to use your lats to control your body back down to the ground and repeat if these are too difficult you can regress them by bending your knees like so and then using your legs to help push you up during your trip and then over time you can use your legs less and less by gradually straightening them until they're completely straight and your upper body is now doing all the work now if you aren't using the bed sheet set up an alternative is something I've shown on my past home workout video the sliding lat pulldown although this does eliminate the all-important eccentric portion of the movement when compared to the bed sheet lat pull-downs or standard pullout it's still better than nothing to Wiley's work the lats if you don't have access to a pull-up bar or a suitable bedsheet set up at home next we're going to now move on to a bodyweight road to now shift a little more emphasis to our mid-back musculature like the mid traps and rhomboids for more bag thickness for these we're gonna go back to the bedsheet setup so grab each sheet take a few steps back lean back until there's tension in the sheets and then pull yourself up words by driving your elbows back and squeezing your shoulder blades together for the easiest modification you can perform this with a split stance and use your back leg to help raise your body up during your trip and then you want to move on to doing these with your feet together and then from there you can continue moving your feet closer and closer to the door in order to make the movement more difficult the more horizontal you position your body the more load you're going to be lifting and it's a great way to effectively progress this exercise without weights if you're not using the sheet set up though then ideally you'll want to find a table sturdy and long enough to safely perform your row which can be made easier by bending your knees and using an electric resistance and then as you get stronger straighten your knees and gradually make your body more horizontal to increase the load of your bodyweight that you'd be lifting next we're gonna move back to targeting the lats for more back with I will use the sheets here again in order to best simulate a dumbbell pullover or straight arm pulldown that we typically perform in the gym to target the lats for these wrap the sheets around your hands straighten your arms in front of your body engage your core and then simply let your body fall forward as you let your arms raise overhead then you want to bring your body back up to the starting position by driving your arms downwards by engaging the last your torso and your arms should remain straight the whole time you want to think about driving your elbows backwards to best engage the lats as your raise your body up to start out I recommend doing these with your feet further away from the door so that your body doesn't fall forward as much as this is gonna be the easiest regression and then as you get stronger move your feet closer towards the door to enable your body to fall forward one you can also shorten the range of motion to make it easier one starting out and then increase the range of motion by letting your arms travel further overhead as you get stronger an alternative if you're not using a she's though are to perform a sliding version of these on the ground here you want to place your forearms on something that can grip the floor so like a yoga mat or even shoes for example then while keeping your elbows tucked close to your sides you want to simply drive your elbows down towards your torso to slide your body upwards this exercise is quite similar to the slide on that pull-downs done earlier but by keeping your elbows tucked close to your body you'll be able to effectively target the last through a slightly different angle next we're gonna use the sheets to now perform face pulls to target the mid and lower traps as well as the various rotator cuff muscles that are all important muscles for postural improvements and overall scapula and shoulder stability for these wrap your hands around the sheets take a few steps back from the door and lean back until there's tension in the sheets then raise your torso up a performing a face Bowl where you pull your hands towards your face while keeping your elbows high and externally rotating your shoulder such that your arms are in a biceps flexing pose at the end position you should feel this exercise in the middle of your back and in the back of your shoulders to start out you can perform these with a split stance to use your back leg for assistance and then as you get stronger you can perform that with your feet together and gradually move your feet closer and closer to the door to increase the difficulty over time if you aren't using the sheet set up to hit some of these important muscles you can perform wall slides instead where you simply lean your back against the wall and slide your arms up and down against it mimicking a shoulder press movement pattern when done properly you should feel these light up your mid-back muscles next we're gonna finish a workout off with a move that will enable us to not only work all over upper back muscles but will now target and strengthen the lower back as well through hip extension for these lay on your stomach with your arms and legs extended your palms should face downwards and your feet should be about hip-width apart then you want to raise your arms and legs up off the floor by about an inch or two try to get at least your chest and your thighs up off the ground if you can and from this alone you should already feel your glutes your lower back and your mid back all very highly engaged and then from here you want to slowly bring your arms out to your sides and then all the way back behind your back while twisting them such that your palms now face upwards when they reach your back position and then slowly move them back to the starting position for one complete rep you can take a break for a few seconds before performing your next rep and if this is initially too difficult for you I recommend raising your legs and your upper body to a lesser degree and then also performing the arm circle movement faster and then over time as you get better and better with a movement you can progress it by raising your legs and your upper body up a little bit more while slowing down the tempo of your arm circles so some of the video up here is what your home back workout could look like and this can be performed as a back workout on its own but I'd recommend instead splitting it up into at least two days throughout the week by using an upper lower split for example to better manage the training volume frequency and ideally you do want to use a rep range of roughly 10 to 15 reps per set but as I've explained in my past home workout videos worry less about the rep range and instead focus on taking each set of the work out either to failure or then a rapper too short of failure in order to maximize growth despite having no access to heavy weights and then once you can perform more than roughly 30 reps per set in any of the exercises you want to then progress to a harder variation that a provided for each movement in order to continue maximizing growth over time but by executing and progressing this workout properly over time as you get stronger you'll be able to build your back in the comfort of your own home with belting for heavy weights a first step by step program that shows you not only how to optimally train the build muscle but also then shows you exactly how to properly fuel your body for girls so you can truly transform your body and pack on size as efficiently as possible with size and simply head on over to build with science comm to take the analysis quiz to discover which program is best for you and where your body is currently at anyways that's it for

    "title": "The Best Science-Based Bicep Workout | ARMS (Part 1/2)",
    "published_at": "2017-10-01T16:35:28Z",
    "transcript": "I think we can all agree that a physique just isn't complete without full well-developed 3-dimensional arms yet you rarely see individuals who have actually achieved this feat and this is likely due to deficiencies in their arm training in part 1 of this video I'm going to discuss the best exercise routine for the biceps based on the analysis of several studies and our anatomical understanding of the arms and in order to learn how to best train your biceps it's vital that you first understand their anatomy the biceps is a two-headed muscle consisting of a long head and a short head and their individual growth will depend heavily on your exercise selection as you'll see in this video another muscle that tends to be forgotten is the brachialis which lies beneath the biceps and assists in flexing at the elbows and when well-developed it can actually push your biceps up more to provide a better peak when flexing as well as provide more separation between the biceps and triceps so in order to best train your biceps you want to choose exercises that will allow growth in both the long and short head of your biceps as well as brachialis you may be wondering what chin ups are doing in an arm routine but in my opinion they are one of the best exercises to grow your biceps and scientific literature seems to agree with this for example this 2014 study by the American Council on exercise compared EMG activation of the biceps with seven different exercises as you can see in the graph above the chin up was tied for a second for activation of the biceps and managed to outperform traditional bicep exercises like the barbell curl or EZ curl and the reason I'm opting to start with channels from biceps as opposed to concentration curls which perform better in terms of activation is one because it's a compound movement and two because research like this study by Hughes at Elle has shown that the biceps are comprised of mostly type 2 muscle fibers which best respond to training with heavy weight in fact one study by legaly @al found that each jump in relative load going from 30 to 90 percent of one max resulted in more bicep activation meaning that in order to recruit all the motor units of your bicep you need to use heavy weight and since you can easily overload chin-ups with weight and work up to very heavy loads with it I suggest starting your biceps working with them and going heavy for fairly low reps the second exercise will be used to put more emphasis on the long head of your biceps but keep in mind that both heads will always be activated to an extent or in any elbow flexing movement but the reason it emphasizes the long head more is because when you perform a curl when on an incline your shoulder is put into a hyper extended position so what stretches the long head of the biceps which runs over the shoulder joint and since the long head is placed in a greater stretched position compared to the short head it's now able to reduce more forest and as demonstrated in this study by Oliveira a tell the long head will be active throughout the whole range of motion rather than just the beginning or just end which is the case for many biceps exercises like preacher curls this next exercise will be used to put more emphasis on the short head of the biceps I chose to include this exercise because as we saw earlier in this study the concentration curl elicited much higher bicep activation than the seven other bicep exercises and the reason it puts more emphasis on short head of the biceps as opposed to the long head is because as shown in this study by some men at al activation of the short head of the biceps is maximized with combined flexion and supination so you want to turn your wrist out during every rep in order to fully activate the short head of your biceps and another great thing about this exercise is that it minimizes the involvement of the anterior delts which often come into play during curling exercises in fact the study I previously showed by the American Council of exercise not only showed that the concentration curl had the greatest bicep activation but the activation of the anterior delt was significantly lower during this exercise than all of the other bicep exercises this is likely because during this movement the humerus is pressed against the leg and it doesn't allow the upper arm to sway which helps fully isolate the biceps one researcher also noted that there may be something mental going on as well the fact that you can visually see your biceps working throughout the movement may in fact help with this mind to muscle connection with your biceps you want to use this last exercise to help target the brachialis and the brachioradialis which are muscles that will help a lot in improving the aesthetics of your arm the reason I chose ez bar curls with a reverse grip is because brachialis inserts onto the ulna rather than the radius simply meaning that it only has one purpose and that is to flex their arm since it has no role and supinate in the wrist like the biceps do flexing the arm with a pronated grip will shift some of the work away from the biceps and onto the brachialis which otherwise gets taken over by the biceps during regular curling exercises which has actually been proven in various EMG studies like this one by NATO and oh that's basically it for the video guys I hope you've enjoyed it I suggest that you perform three sets of each of the exercises that I showed and also perform them in the order that I presented them in you want to train heavy for a fairly low rep range of around six to eight reps as this will allow you to fully recruit all of the motor units of your biceps so if you like my video and found it useful of

    "published_at": "2019-06-02T15:42:48Z",
    "transcript": "[Music] you've probably noticed that your gym that most of the people working now regularly just don't have much to show for it and their bodies seem to remain the same year after year well the truth is the reason why so few people are able to build a muscular lean body and actually improve their physiques year after year just comes down to a few key things that they're not properly doing both in and outside of the gym in this video we'll discuss the train inside of the equation and go through some of what successful gym goers do every single time they step in the gym for a workout more specifically we'll cover three crucial things that you need to be doing every single workout in order to progress and build muscle much faster the first thing you need to do is log every single one of your workouts when you're in the gym I remember back in the day I never bother logging what I did in my workouts and just went with what I felt like doing at the time and the major problem that this causes is well let's use an example [Music] this is Paul aka your average shim bro [Music] he's about to do 135 for 5 reps for what he believes is the first time in his life little does Paul know though is that last week he was able to do 10 pounds heavier for 5 reps but doesn't remember since he never kept track of it meaning that in this workout despite Paul's enthusiasm no gains were made so long story short don't be a Paul be a Jeremy and start track in your workouts so as you can see failing to record what it is you're doing every workout means that you'll never be able to tell if you're actually progressing or not and this is detrimental when it comes to muscle growth since we know based on research the mechanical tension is the main driver of growth which is best stimulated by progressively getting stronger and lifting more weight and reps over time and not only that but research also indicates that as you gain more experience in the gym the correlation between muscle size and strength becomes much stronger simply meaning that the importance of tracking your workers becomes more and more crucial over time in order to continue progressing and building muscle but it's important that you do so properly first you want to choose what you'll be tracking with for a very long time I personally just use notes on my phone as it was convenient but there's also more organized free apps out there that you can play around with next although it's ideal to take as many notes as possible during your workout the two main things you want to jot down are the weight you lifted and the number of reps you performed for each set of each exercise you should also consider jotting down rest times how difficult the sets were to perform and if you switched up anything from the previous workout such as an exercise swap or changing the exercise order so for example let's say you just finished with the benchpress what you jot down is the following and then next week you'll be able to look back at this log and you'll have a plan of Hackett's oh the numbers who want to hit to beat last week's workout overtime these small weekly and monthly progressions will not only serve as motivation for you along your journey but will also manifest into big physical changes as well another thing you need to be doing every workout is timing your breast periods and this will play a significant role in how quickly you'll be able to build muscle and strength over time illustrating the importance of this is a 2016 paper that compared the effects of resting one minute between sets versus rest in three minutes between sets and as shown here after eight weeks they found that the three minute group not only experienced significantly greater muscle growth but they also got significantly stronger than the one minute rest group meaning that for you you'll want to ensure that you're resting long enough between sets more specifically a fret least two to three minutes when doing compound exercises unfortunately though well most people do instead is simply perform their next set when they subjectively feel ready which is often only after a minute or so but the problem with this is that although you may feel ready to go cardiovascular wise your muscles still need the extra minute or two of rest to push more weight and/or reps during your next set resulting in better growth and strength over time therefore by timing your rest periods you'll hold yourself accountable to this and ensure that you're giving your muscles the rest they need in order to perform better in the following set and if you find that these rest periods are too long I'd suggest either incorporating super sets into them which I did make a past video on or doing some prehab and mobility work in between or just watch some cat videos so you're not sitting there bored the whole time lastly you want to ensure that you're incorporating a proper warm-up routine for each of your workouts as doing so has been shown to significantly boost range of motion and performance in the following workout however most people just don't do so properly by either not doing enough warmup or on the other hand overdoing it although I have made a past video with a full warm-up routine included which I'll link below the basics of your warm-up should look something like the following one start with five minutes of light intensity cardio and/or dynamic stretching specific to the upper or lower body depending on what you're going to Train which just helps increase the body temperature of the muscles you'll be working and to before your first main exercise you want to use what are called weight acclamation sets in order to enhance your neuromuscular activation which is just going to improve your exercise technique during your working sets a good way to do this is to do one set of 50% of your working weight for 10 reps then one set of 70% of your working weight for six to eight reps and then one more set of 90% or so of your working weight for another one to two reps then when you proceed into your main working sets you'll be better warmed up and more proficient with the movement without being excessively fatigued although these three tips may not seem like much if you're serious about maximizing your progress it's absolutely vital that you implement them into every single one of your workouts I remember back in the day I would basically just go with how I felt in the gym which I think a lot of people still mistakenly do but it wasn't until I started implementing crucial tips like these into every single one of my workouts that I started to see my body drastically change and for an all-in-one step-by-step evidence-based program that shows you exactly how to implement tips like these into both your training and nutrition such that you can burn fat and build muscle as effectively as possible then what you can do is simply head on over to bill to a science

    "transcript": "I'm going to show you how to fix your knee issues and protect your knees for good with a 10-minute corrective routine we're going to go through two tests to figure out what causes your knee discomfort use those test results to determine the appropriate knee mobility and stability exercises for your body and then combine this all into a 10minute corrective routine with instructions on how and when to implement it by the end of this video you should feel immediate relief in your knee have much better knee alignment when you move in Squat and we'll have a 10-minute routine to keep them protect Ed long term the most common type of knee pain is at the front of the knee it's a warning sign that something is wrong but we don't know exactly where typically it's in the muscles and Joints above and below the knee as a result of our lifestyle The increased time that we spend sitting leads to our glutes becoming weak and hips imbalanced on one side compared to the other the time that we spend standing or walking in shoes that nowadays often come with the heel lift can lead to our ankles becoming stiff the knee caught in between the hip and ankles has to compensate to fill in these gaps this leads to excessive stress on the knee whenever we then run jump or Squat and over time this can develop into pain or discomfort so let's now do some ankle and hip tests to reveal where these problems lie so the first test is going to look for ankle stiffness what you're going to do is you're going to find a ball take your shoes off and you're going to make a thumb and fist with your hand that's the distance that you want between the wall and your big toe once you get that down you're just going to drive your knee forward see how close you can get to the wall in order to pass this test there's four things that must happen number one is your knee must come at least within an inch of the wall so mine's close enough number two is your heel must not lift off the ground number three is that your knee and hips need to travel directly straight they can't rotate excessively inward or outwards as you do so and number four is you're going to repeat this on both sides and the differences between the sides shouldn't be more than 1 in typically the more restricted side is where you going to be experiencing knee problems and we're going to show you the ankle Mobility exercise to fix this after we finish the next test all right so now let's test your hips to determine if you need to add the hip mobility exercise to your 10-minute routine we're going to look for internal rotation you're going to line on your back bring your legs up knees bent at 90\u00b0 and from here you're just going to kick your feet out to the sides as far as you can and the main thing we're looking for here are differences between the two sides so if one leg is like this and the other leg you can get this far then this hip is clearly lacking in internal rotation once you finish those two tests note down your results okay so before we move on to mobilizing based on these tests I want to emphasize the importance of doing tests like this because everyone's bodies are different that's exactly what I've applied within my built with science programs by developing A system that uses science to transform your specific body into a lean muscular painfree physique it's worth worked for tens of thousands of people of all different body types genetics and Lifestyles so if you head on over to builtwith science.com you can do a really quick 60-second quiz I'm going to do it right now so I'm going to go with mail uh age range 20s Fitness goal honestly I'm going to say lean in tone right now and fitness experience I am experienced then it's going to guide you to the best program based on your goals and body type so for me it was intermediate shred program it's that simple guys and once you get into it it's a onetime payment for Lifetime access home workouts are included as a temporary free bonus and a 30-day money back guarantee there is nothing to lose but now let's move on to mobilizing we're now going to use your test results to determine what Mobility exercises you should focus on this is going to help temporarily improve your restrictions but the stability exercises that we're going to add afterwards will be essential to help you keep those improvements long term so if you failed the ankle Mobility test you're going to add the combat stretch you're going to come down into a half kneeling lunge position straighten up your hips and from here you're going to drive your knee forward over your toes but as you do so you want to think about pulling yourself forward by driving your toes up towards your shins this is going to activate your shin muscles to make the stretch more effective so you're going to drive forward as far as you can hold the end position for about 5 Seconds come back off and then repeat for about 5 to 10 reps on each side you want to start with a more restricted side before you then move on to to the other side so what you can do if you have a band to make this stretch even more effective is wrap it around the top of your foot just above your ankle there and you're going to elevate your foot just onto a small elevated platform and make sure the band is pulling you back and then you're just going to repeat the same stretch but now you'll notice that you're able to get just a little bit more Mobility if you found in balance in the hips internal rotation test add the following stretch sit on your butt with your arm supporting you upright and legs out in a wide stance Point your toes up to activate muscles that will help avoid aggravating your knee during the stretch from here drive your knee towards the floor until you feel a stretch hold that for a few seconds and then switch from side to side to get about 5 to 10 reps on each side now if you have a band available we can do an even more effective stretch wrap the band around a low fixture and loop it around the hip of your more restricted side so it's pulling your back get down on your hands and knees kick the foot of your banded leg out and then sit your butt back into your heels from here if you can come down to your forearms Rock back and forth for about 5 to 10 reps and gradually kick your leg further out for a deeper stretch repeat on the other side now your body is ready for the stability exercises after we run through these we're going to show you the full 10-minute routine and the best way to use it the first move will help further open up your hips but now while at the same same time strengthening your weak glute muscles with both arms lightly grab onto a fixture like a table for support extend one leg back off the ground rotate your belly button towards the side of the planted leg to stretch your glute don't let your knee cave in as you do so then squeeze your glutes together hard as if you're trying to stop your friend from poking your butt keep them squeeze while you now rotate your belly button out to open up your hips hold this top position for about 5 Seconds you should feel a deep stretch in your groin and your glutes working hard to hold this position then rotate back in to complete one full rep as you do these think of a pole attached from your head to foot rotating inwards and outwards your whole body should rotate as one to make it easier you can start with your leg just slightly off the ground and then gradually kick it back further to progress it aim to complete a slow and controlled 10 reps on each side so for a lot of people I find that the standard hip airplanes they're hard to first get used to and this is a great way to get that movement down if you have a handy so you just grab a plate that can spin onto a squat rack and basically it's like you're driving a big steering wheel and you're going to use that to kind of guide you through the movement this is a really effective way to learn how you should actually be doing the move so give it a shot if you have it available to you so the next move is going to work your glutes as well but by slowing the downward part of the movement we're also going to start incorporating some knee tendon Health work so you're going to grab a weighted dumbbell kettle bell or even a book or weighted bag if you're at home hold that at your chest get into a squat stance and we're going to take a total of 5 Seconds to perform the downward part of a squat but every second you're going to stop and squeeze your glutes hard and then you're going to continue stop squeeze your glutes hard as you come down you want to make sure that your knees are staying in line with your toes and go only as deep as you can without experiencing any pain or discomfort and then you're going to come back up pushing through your midfoot and then you're going to repeat for a total of five reps so the last exercise is called an isometric this is where the body doesn't move but the muscles around the knees are Contracting it's going to help both provide instant relief to your knee pain or discomfort so that you can actually train afterwards and it's also going to thicken the tendons around your knees to keep them healthy the exercise we're going to use is a simple yet really effective wall squat so you're going to sit into a squat with your back completely flat against the wall and your legs bent at about 90\u00b0 or whatever depth that is painfree for you for maximum benefit research suggest you want to hold this position for about 20 seconds at a time with a 1 minute rest in between we're going to repeat this for total of two sets to implement this 10-minute routine for the best results perform it consistently two to three times a week you can even use it as a warm-up routine right before your lower body workouts although eventually the mobility exercises may not be necessary once your imbalances are fixed the stabil ability exercises are great moves to permanently integrate into your routine to protect your knee long term all right so I've showed you how to un your knees but odds are you could probably use some help uning your shoulders and uning your hips too you can click somewhere here to view those videos to check out my training programs you can head to buildwi

    "title": "How To Get A Strong Lower Back The RIGHT Way (4 Must Do Exercises)",
    "published_at": "2019-11-10T16:01:15Z",
    "transcript": "[Music] out of every 10 people it's estimated that roughly eight of them will experience lower back pain at some point in their lives now although lower back pain can stem from numerous factors multiple reviews and case studies have found that people with lower back pain often tend to have issues with lower back strength and neuromuscular control and that improving their strength and coordination of their lower back seems to be an effective intervention to prevent and reduce the pain that they experience and what's interesting is that research indicates that even well-trained individuals who regularly train in the gym seem to have this lower back imbalance as well which is thought to be due to a lack of lower back specific exercises within their training routines meaning that including exercises that specifically target and strengthen the lower back into your current routine will be beneficial not only to potentially prevent and reduce lower back pain itself but to also minimize the risk of you developing lower back weaknesses or imbalances over time but unfortunately most people who attempt to do so go about doing it the wrong way and either end up choosing the wrong exercises or they'll implement and perform them in the wrong way which all just worsens the situation take a look at the commonly performed superman exercise for example where both the arms and legs move into extension although this does activate the lower back muscles quite well research by dr stuart mcgill at the university of waterloo has actually found that it also causes roughly 6 000 newtons of spinal compression and given that the national institute for occupational safety and health actually recommends the lower limit of spinal compression to be just 3 300 newtons we can clearly see how a commonly performed lower back exercise like the superman can actually worsen the issue by creating a ton of excessive compression on the spine in this video though i'll clear everything up for you and show you how to properly and safely strengthen your lower back with a full routine that you can implement right away first off before diving into the lower back specific exercises we need to cover two compound exercises that should ideally make up the bulk of your lower back training squats and deadlifts because these two exercises especially deadlifts have been shown in multiple papers to elicit very high activity of the lower back muscles simply meaning that free weight squats and deadlifts should definitely be a staple in your weekly routine given that they have not only been shown to be highly effective for lower back strength and hypertrophy but also because they are easy to overload with weight in order to continue adequately challenging the lower back muscles over time with that being said though there are a few problems with squats and deadlifts which may even explain why we still see lower back weaknesses and imbalances in individuals that perform them regularly first off let's just face it not everybody does them secondly though we know that the heavier you go with these exercises the greater the activation of the lower back muscles but the truth is that a lot of people don't perform these relatively heavy enough to actually provide enough stimulus to their lower back and lastly for those that do perform them and may go heavy enough with them multiple studies have also indicated that without proper stabilization of the pelvis the much larger and stronger hamstring and glutes often tend to take over and do most of the back extension work instead resulting in less stimulus and less strengthening of the lower back muscles themselves therefore to fill in this missing gap you want to incorporate the next two lower back exercises the first exercise back extensions does this perfectly by stabilizing the pelvis such that the lower back can be better activated and strengthened to a much greater degree than other exercises which it's been consistently shown to do with the literature however despite the effectiveness and popularity of this exercise most people don't perform it in a way that safely works and strengthens the lower back muscles and instead just worsens the problem so to properly execute it you'll want to do the following steps which i'm going to demonstrate on a glute ham raise but the exact same tips apply to the roman chair back extension as well first you need to set up correctly by positioning your pelvis at the top of the pad or just past it then simply lower yourself down to the bottom position while keeping a neutral spine and then ascend back up by using your lower back muscles until your torso is in line with your legs but avoid going past this point into hyperextension as this causes more and more spinal compression the further back you go instead keep your spine neutral throughout the movement and stop before you go into hyperextension positioning the pad too far forward which most people do is just going to cause your back to excessively round as you descend for this exercise you want to start out with a rep range of roughly eight to 15 reps with your body weight and then over time as your lower back strengthens and you can perform 15 reps easily you can continue overloading the movement by holding on to a weight or dumbbells as you perform it now in addition to the previous exercise you want to also include an exercise that challenges your stability to a greater degree because as found in a paper from the australian journal physiotherapy although high loading of the back extensors as we've previously done is an ideal way to strengthen them an additional exercise that demands more stability from the lower back is required in order to selectively emphasize individual muscles that play a greater role in stabilizing the lower back like the multifidus shown here for example this is especially important since many people with lower back pain actually do have strong backs but instead they lack proper coordination and stability of their lower back and an effective way to improve this is by using the bird dog exercise shown here not only does this exercise elicit greater activation of the various stabilizer muscles in the lower back but it's also been shown to do so with minimal spinal compression in fact going back to dr stewart mcgill's research compared to the superman exercise this exercise brought out a much safer 2000 newtons of force on the lower back but again it's vital that you perform it correctly and to do so you'll want to first get on all fours with your hands under your shoulders knees under your hips and your back in a naturally slightly arched position from here brace your core and reach with one arm all the way in front of you while simultaneously kicking back with your opposite leg until they're both straight as you do so push with your support hand down into the floor so that your upper back pushes off the floor slightly hold this top position for 5 seconds or so before returning to the start position and repeating with the other arm and leg and you want to avoid raising your arms and legs too high as this is just going to cause your lower back to excessively arch instead raise them until they're parallel with your body and focus on keeping your back neutral throughout the movement if this version is too difficult for you though to start out you can easily regress the exercise by reaching out with just an arm reach and then you want to progress to a leg reach and then finally you can progress to both the arm and leg reach and as for reps i'd use dr stewart mcgill's recommendation of using the descending pyramid such that you start with eight reps aside for the first set go down to six for the second set and then down to four reps for the final set and over time you'll want to focus on increasing the length of the holes at the top until you're able to hold for roughly 10 seconds or so each rep now to sum this all up into a weekly routine for you here's what i recommend so based on research on the training frequency and volume of the lower back you actually don't need much at all to see significant improvements in strength and you definitely don't want to overdo it in fact multiple studies have shown that even for well-trained individuals adding in just one lower back exercise one to two times per week was able to quickly and significantly increase their lower back strength therefore what i'd suggest is that if you're currently able to free weight squat and deadlift weekly then you'd likely just need to throw in the following two exercises once per week for a few sets each and just overload them as you get stronger whereas if you're unable to do free weight squats and deadlifts or you just don't go very heavy with them you can opt to do these more often regardless of how you set it up though guys by including these exercises in some fashion within your current regimen you'll be able to significantly boost your lower back strength potentially reduce your lower back pain and minimize the risk of you developing lower back weaknesses or imbalances over time but at the same time you need to be sure that you're not unknowingly overlooking other areas of your body as well and that's exactly why within my built with science programs we've taken the time to carefully select each and every exercise included in your weekly training routines such that you can build muscle and lean down while actually improving your posture and correcting your muscle imbalances in the process just like countless other members have successfully done with their bitly science programs and to find out which science based program is best for you and your specific body simply head on over to buildwithscience.com and take the starting point quiz anyways guys thank you so much for watching i hope you enjoyed this video as always please do me

    "title": "The Best Science-Based PULL Workout For Growth (Back/Biceps/Rear Delts)",
    "published_at": "2020-02-09T16:24:38Z",
    "transcript": "[Music] for those who are unaware this video is part two of my recently released push-pull legs routine series in part one of the series we covered a sample push workout for the week to target the chest shoulders and triceps in this video however we'll cover a sample science-based pull workout for the week to now target the various back muscles the biceps and the rear delts given that these muscles work together during pulling movements it's a good idea to train these muscles together in one workout as we'll do today and just like in part one of this series at the end of the video you'll receive a free downloadable pdf of this pull workout for you to conveniently refer to while you're at the gym now before we dive into the workout it's important that you first understand the reasoning behind its setup which involves the following the first four exercises will rotate between vertical pulling movements and horizontal rowing movements it's beneficial to rotate from one to the other throughout the workout to not only work our back muscles from different angles but to also avoid over straining certain stabilizer muscles that are heavily involved in certain planes of motion and then we'll finish the workout off with two accessory movements to work the smaller muscle groups that will still need a little more emphasis so with that being said let's take a look at what research indicates the optimal pull workout might look like the first exercise we'll perform this pull workout are pull-ups which are one of the best exercises for targeting the lats to increase the width of your back in fact when compared to seven other back exercises in the paper by the american council of exercise the pull-up came out on top with the highest lats activation in addition research has shown that the pull-up also activates various other back and arm muscles to a high degree as well meaning that it's a great overall back builder and therefore should definitely be a staple in your routine now as for its counterpart the chin up and its effectiveness despite both movements being quite similar there are a few key differences that are highlighted in the following paper by unison colleagues the researchers found that although both exercises activate the lats to a similar degree there were two main differences one chin-ups provide greater biceps activation which is expected due to the grip and two pull-ups provide significantly greater lower traps activation meaning that overall both are great options but given that the lower traps is a back muscle that tends to become weak and underdeveloped on lifters yet is especially important for posture and shoulder health pull-ups can be argued as a better alternative here for this workout and is why they're chosen here but on the other hand if you're currently unable to perform pull-ups as suggested in my recent pull-up strength video you'll want to swap these out for kneeling lat pull-downs instead since this exercise has been shown to best mimic the pull-ups muscle activation pattern when compared to other commonly used alternatives next it's time to switch the angle of pull by moving to a horizontal pulley movement with the barbell row which has been shown in research to not only be a great overall back builder but is especially useful for mid back thickness and lower back development given that it outperforms other common back exercises in terms of activation of these areas therefore we'll be using them here to complement the pull-up stern earlier to now focus on our back thickness and also just hit our lats from a different angle and to properly execute them for the best back development what you want to do is first lower your upper body by pushing your hips back while slightly bending your knees you want to stop at the point where the flexibility of your hamstrings prevents you from going any further down without rounding your back which for most individuals is somewhere around 45 degrees then you'll want to use an overhand grip that's just outside of your knees and pull the bar up towards your upper abs region while keeping your elbows at roughly a 45 degree angle as this specific form has been shown to be best for upper back thickness which is exactly what we want to achieve with this exercise next we'll move back to a vertical pulley movement with a lat pull down to further target the lats and various other back muscles however rather than the wide traditional overhand grip we'll be switching to a closer underhand grip and the reason for this is because anatomical studies have shown that the lats are comprised of an upper and a lower region which can actually be preferentially activated during your back training exercises that involve more shoulder abduction such as in the traditional pull-ups we did earlier have an angle of pull that is more in line with the upper lat fibers than the teres major and therefore will more effectively hit these regions whereas exercises that involve more shoulder extension such as in the reverse grip lat pull down now have an angle of pull that is more vertical and in line with the lower lat fibers and therefore will more effectively hit this region of the lats so since we've already worked the upper lats efficiently in the pull-ups that we did early on in the workout we'll now want to put more emphasis onto the lower lats to further maximize our back width which can be done by simply using an underhand grip with the lat pull down and with this exercise you'll want to incorporate a slight lean back and keep your elbows tucked close to your sides as you perform each rep in order to best activate the lats next we're going to move back to a horizontal rowing movement similar to the barbell row but performed in a way that will now emphasize the rear delts to a much greater degree it's important we do so in this workout given that most people's rear delts are often neglected and relatively underdeveloped when compared to the rest of their shoulder and although traditional rowing movements do involve the rear delts we can heighten their involvement by tweaking our elbow position as we row because we know that when the elbows are touched closer to our sides as we row the lats are biomechanically in a more advantageous position but if we widen our grip to enable us to flare the elbows out more as we pull as we're doing here the rear delts are now put in a more advantageous position and the evolvement of the lats is minimized and by laying on an incline bench we can then boost the activation of the rear delts to an even greater degree this is because research indicates that you can better target the upper back muscles by limiting the involvement of the lower back in the movement which is especially important for us to do here since our lower back is already relatively fatigued from the barbell rows that we performed earlier and if you're having some trouble setting this up with your bench though a viable alternative is the dumbbell rear delt row where you perform a similar row but externally rotate the shoulder at the end position like so in order to best engage the rear delts next it's time to move on to some isolation work for the biceps but more specifically we'll be targeting the long head of the biceps since the short head of the biceps has already received most of the emphasis in our previous pulling movements and the close grip barbell curl is a great exercise for this purpose because by both keeping the elbows close to the body and using a narrower grip that's within shoulder width will be able to put the outer head or the long head of the biceps in a more advantageous position when compared to the inner or the short head which you're likely going to feel right away and to further heighten its involvement you want to focus on lifting with your pinkies as you curl the weight up and utilize a full range of motion during each rep lastly we're going to finish off the workout with face pulls which will be mainly used to target the rear delts mid and lower traps and are various rotator cuff muscles however what we want to do is two versions of the face pull for the first two sets you want to perform them nearly understanding and focus on externally rotating the shoulder at the end position such a urinary biceps flexing pose in order to best strengthen the rotator cuffs and then for the last two sets you want to then switch to line face pulls in order to now emphasize the rear delts to a greater degree because as stated in some of my past videos by lying down you're able to minimize the effect of gravity acting on the upper traps and hence better prevent the traps from taking over the movement resulting in better rear delts activation so to sum everything up for you here's what your pull workout could look like and just as i did with the push workout for your convenience i've compiled all this

    "title": "How To Grow Bigger Shoulders At Home (NO WEIGHTS WORKOUT)",
    "published_at": "2020-04-12T15:35:23Z",
    "transcript": "if you want bigger wider and just more powerful looking shoulders then you need to focus on hitting all of the three heads and make up this muscle group because adequately targeting and growing the front the middle and the often neglected rear delts really is a key when it comes to creating that three-dimensional rounded look with your shoulders and although doing so is pretty easily done when we have access to heavier weights and gym equipment this now becomes much more difficult to do at home without any equipment to rely on but by simply knowing what each head is responsible for doing we can then determine what bodyweight shoulder exercises can be used to effectively train each of these heads without the use of heavy weights and in this workout I'll show you not only what those exercises are but I'll also show you how to properly progress each of them such that you can continue to grow your shoulders over time as you get stronger and all in the comfort of your own home the first exercise we'll use here are Pike push-ups to mainly target the front portion of your shoulders which is responsible for moving your arms forward and pressing them overhead just as we're doing here as you can see here due to the similar mechanics of both exercises this exercise can effectively will place the heavy overhead shoulder pressing movement that we typically perform in the gym to target this portion of your shoulders to perform them start out in a push-up position and then move your hands closer to your feet while keeping your legs straight until your body makes an upside-down V shape then simply bend your elbows and lower your upper body and tilt the top of your nose nearly touches the floor and then press up by using your shoulders to return your hands back to the top position now if these are too hard then initially you can start out by performing these on your knees instead where you again lower your upper body forward until your nose nearly touches the floor in front of your hands and then press backwards in the opposite direction back up to the starting position and then you want to progress to the standard version and then to progress even further from there you can first elevate your feet up to the edge of a platform and then perform your reps on that and then over time gradually move your closer to your feet to make the movement even more difficult and then once you're able to do so progress it once again by elevating your feet onto an even higher platform and repeating this process this way despite having no access to heavier weights you're still gonna be able to continuously overload the movement and grow your shoulders by just manipulating your body weight next we're gonna use lateral raises to now target the side portion of your shoulders which helps give it that added width now this head of the delt is mainly responsible for shoulder abduction or in other words just raising your arms out to the side but given that we don't have weights to perform traditional lateral raises with we can compromise by using our body weight instead so here you want to lay your forearm against a cloth or towel place on a smooth wall or the edge of a doorframe take a small step to the side of the wall and then lean your body against it and then you simply want to mimic a side lateral raise by sliding your forearm up and down to raise your body back up and down to the starting position to make these easier you can initially stand closer to the wall and use less of the lean and then over time as you get stronger you want to gradually move further away from the wall and lean your body to a greater degree so that your side delts are now lifting a greater proportion of your body weight you can also lengthen the lever to increase the difficulty as well by simply strain your arm and perform a little lateral raise like so next it's time to shift our emphasis onto the rear delt switch function to help pull the arm back behind the body and gives our shoulders that rounded 3d look that we're after yet are unfortunately quite a difficult muscle to train at home well effectively do so in this workout though by performing a rear delt roll by using the bedsheet setup that I've shown in my other home workout videos to perform these wrap the sheets around your hands take a few steps away from the door and lean back until there's tension in the sheets and then with your palms facing downwards perform a row by pulling your elbows back as far as possible to raise your body up and then control your body back down until your arms are straight and then repeat however as you roll you want to keep your elbows high up at shoulder height as this house biomechanically minimize the involvement of the lats and instead shifts more of the tension onto the rear delts you can start with your feet further away from the door and then gradually move your feet closer and closer to the door over time just to continue progressing it as you get stronger if you don't have the bedsheet setup handy though then an alternative is to perform the same rowing movement but in between the end of a hallway or a doorway here you can just grab onto the edges of the wall or door frame and then pull using the same rowing motion and again keeping those elbows hot lastly we'll finish off the workout with a little more rear delt isolation by using the rear delt fly here you want to again use the bedsheet setup but this time you'll strain your arms out in front of you with your palms inwards facing each other and then raise your body up by pulling your arms out to your sides hold the imposition for a second or two to intensify the contraction of the rear delts and then return to the start position and repeat by keeping your hands facing inwards throughout the movement and incorporate slightly more external rotation into the exercise which research has shown helps boost the activation of the rear delts given that is one of its main movement functions and it's something that our previous rear delt exercise was missing I suggest first turning these out with a split stance and using your back leg to assist you on the way up and then progress it by moving your feet together and then progress even further by simply bringing your feet closer to the door just as we did in the last exercise if you don't have access to bed sheets for this a viable alternative here our rear delt holds with external rotation where you lay down on your stomach and then simply raise your arms back behind your body while twisting your arms outwards such that your thumbs are now facing more towards the ceiling at the end position hold this for a few seconds before you come down in the perform another rep this does effectively incorporate the various movement functions of the rear delts obviously becomes problematic to overload with weight as you get stronger but as a compromise I suggest using a combination of holding that and position for a longer pause add an additional load by using a band or even holding onto weights like water balls for example just to ensure that you're still progressing over time so the Sun the video up here is what your home shoulder worker could look like now this can be performed all than one as a shoulder workout on its own without of recommend instead splitting the exercises up at 12 least two days throughout the week by using the upper lower split for example in order to better manage the training volume in frequency as for reps ideally you want to use a rep range of roughly 10 to 15 reps per set but worry less about the rep range and instead focus on taking each set of the work out either to failure or a repetition of failure in order to maximize growth despite having no access to heavy weights and then once you can perform more than roughly 30 reps per set in any of the exercises you want to dump aggress to a harder variation that provided for each movement in order to continue maximizing growth over time but by executing and progressing this workout properly over time as you get stronger you'll be able to build your shoulders in the comfort of your own home without the need for heavy weights just keep in mind though that that's just one piece of the puzzle because pairing your workouts with the right nutrition plan is essential when it comes to seeing results and packing on size now for step-by-step science-based program that takes care of all the guesswork for you by showing you both how to workout and what to eat week after week in order to build muscle as efficiently as possible with sides and simply head on over to build with science com2 take the analysis quiz to discover which

    "title": "The Best Science-Based Plan To Get Six Pack Abs (3 Simple Steps)",
    "published_at": "2019-01-13T17:07:58Z",
    "transcript": "let's face it six-pack abs are something that most men want they not only complete a lean muscular physique but are also representative of all the dedication and hard work you've put in to attain them however with the amount of people wanting a six-pack of their own comes the overwhelming amount of bad advice out there on how to actually get them for example a quick google searches all it takes to come across a plethora of misleading information some say you have to ingest certain types of special foods and drinks while avoiding others some advocates special fat-burning pills as all you'll need whereas others promote ab exercises as the key to stripping off that belly fat which is now something that most people unfortunately believe in well coming from someone who has personally stripped off that belly fat to reveal my six-pack I can tell you that none of those previously mentioned methods alone will help in fact taking just a quick look at the research proves my point for example this 2011 paper from the journal strength and conditioning research found that six weeks of direc AB training 5 days per week had no effect on reducing belly fat and overweight subjects simply meaning that no amount of ab exercises alone will get you a six-pack so what should you do instead the good news is that the real evidence-based way to get a six-pack is actually quite simple and with the following three steps I'm going to cover by the end of this video you'll have a complete game plan to get you there step one is the most important step and involves setting up your nutrition which is going to be responsible for stripping off the excess fat that's covering your six-pack in order to reveal them as many of you know in order to lose fat you must be at a calorie deficit and the easiest way to create a significant calorie deficit is simply by eating less and although you could theoretically do this by exercising more instead that's actually much harder to do and sustain for example most people would find it much harder to burn an extra 500 calories daily by jogging for 40 minutes as opposed to just eating a little less which is exactly why you need to prioritize your nutrition now as for exactly how much you should be eating in terms of calories and macronutrients I've simplified everything by setting up a calculator on my website that will calculate everything for you based on your stats and I'll leave a link to this page in the description box down below after you get those numbers write them down and that's what you'll want to stick with until you refine them in step 3 of this video and as for the types of foods to eat to hit your numbers here's a helpful graphic that provides some examples of what the majority of your diet should consist of step two involves setting up your resistance training program which is recommended because when combined with the calorie deficit it's going to enable you to maintain your muscle mass as you lose fat and help better shape and define your midsection as you lean down for example this 2015 systematic review and meta-analysis looked at the effectiveness of a calorie deficit alone a calorie deficit plus cardio and a calorie deficit plus resistance training on body composition in overweight individuals their analysis found that a calorie deficit combined with resistance training provided the most favorable changes in terms of fat loss and muscle gain as for what resistance training program to use for a good routine I'd highly suggest checking out my upper/lower workout split videos which come with a PDF you can download and get started with right away and again these will all be linked down below and as for direct ab training despite what I said earlier it actually is something I'd recommend incorporated in your routine the main reason is because compound movements and resistance training exercises in general don't stimulate the ABS are very well in fact this 2014 EMG paper from the journal strength and conditioning research found that activation of the ABS and external obliques during the back squat was quite minimal less than 20% whereas the standard sit-up led to more than double the activation at around 40% so since the abdominals and obliques can be grown just like any other muscle these findings mean that you should be training them directly as this will improve their look once you strip off the excess fat covering them my recommendation is to train them around two three times per week with a mixture of both weighted and unweighted exercises which can be done on your rest days and or after your main workouts for example now as for cardio it's not necessarily needed from the start and will be mainly use as a tool to speed up the fat loss process which will be discussed in step three one step one and two are in place the last thing you need to do is monitor your progress throughout the weeks and adjust accordingly to ensure you're heading in the right direction and you can start by simply weighing yourself every morning and tracking that overtime multiple studies like this 2011 paper by Garth and colleagues have found that aiming to Lewis around 0.7 percent of your body weight per week is a sweet spot in order to maximize fat loss while minimizing muscle loss for example a 170 pound individual would aim to lose roughly 1.2 pounds per week so what he'd do is track his morning weight over time and take a weekly average of it if he's getting close to his goal weight loss per week then we know he's on the right track if however he's not losing weight at all or not fast enough then he should just by either slightly reducing his calorie intake or adding a little bit of cardio in order to now hit his goal and conversely if he was losing way too quickly which isn't necessarily a good thing would simply do the opposite you will inevitably have to lower your calorie intake and/or slightly add more cardio as you progress but the key is to do so gradually also keep in mind that weight is just one measurement of progress it's also important to assess how your strength is doing in the gym how your body changes look in the mirror and so on in order to get the most accurate depiction of your progress so basically you keep doing this until you reach roughly 12% body fat or below which as you can see is the level of leanness you'll have to attain in order to see a well-defined six-pack just note that you will lose fat from other areas like your face and arms before it eventually comes off your stomach due to the fat cells there being more stubborn so the key is to be patient and trust the process although attained in a six may seem impossible to you or far off from where you are now trust me on this with dedication and adherence to the three-step protocol I went through you will get there thanks so much for watching everyone I hope this helps some of you out who are struggling with all the misinformation out there although it will take a lot of hard work and patience just trust me the end result will be worth it and if you're looking for an all-in-one evidence-based program that not only covers training but also comes with a custom-built nutrition software to automate the nutritional adjustments you should be making over time in order to transform your body as efficiently as possible then what you can do is simply head on over to built with science comm and take my starting point analysis tool I have up in order to discover which program and which approach is best for you

    "title": "The Best Science-Based Triceps Workout For Mass (DUMBBELL ONLY)",
    "published_at": "2019-06-16T15:58:34Z",
    "transcript": "[Music] in this new dumbbell only science-based workout series will cover the best workouts for growth for each muscle group starting today with the triceps now although with just dumbbells your exercise selection does become more limited this does not mean that your gains will have to suffer as a result because by picking the right exercises and performing them in the right way you can build muscle just as effectively as you could with anything else but to start let's first briefly cover the triceps muscle anatomy and what exactly this means for your training the triceps is a large muscle of the upper arm making up most of the mass of the arm with its primary role being to extend the elbow and it's composed of three distinct heads the long head which is the largest of the three and located towards the back of the arm the lateral head which is located further on the outside of the arm and the medial head which is the smallest of the three heads meaning that when training your triceps you'll want to choose triceps exercises that enable you to adequately hit all three heads as this will provide better growth and symmetry in your arms over time and in this workout i'll show you exactly how to do just that the first movement of this workout is going to be the close grip dumbbell press and is going to work the whole triceps muscle but with most of the emphasis on the lateral and medial heads as well as some involvement from the chest and this exercise was chosen for a couple reasons first of all it's vital that we start out this workout with an exercise that can be loaded with heavy weight since we know based on multiple muscle fiber composition studies that the triceps are typically type 2 dominant which are theorized to best respond to heavier loads thus making this exercise an ideal option to accomplish that since it's a safe and convenient exercise to go heavy with in addition we know based on emg analysis done on the barbell bench press that moving the hands closer together shifts more of the tension to the triceps as a result we can easily apply that same concept with dumbbells instead by using a close grip press where the elbows remain tucked close to the body as shown here rather than the traditional wider grip dumbbell press and as for the optimal pressing angle a 1994 emg analysis by barnett and colleagues found that a flat bench angle produced significantly higher triceps activation than an incline decline or vertical angle during pressing movements thus indicating that sticking with a flat bench would be ideal and as you perform this movement ensure that you're using a full range of motion such that you're coming down to the level of your armpits and then fully locking out at the top in order to maximally contract the triceps next we'll want to move on to incline dumbbell kickbacks set at about a 45 to 60 degree incline which will be mainly used to target the long head of the triceps located towards the back of your arm this exercise effectively hits this region of the triceps since it puts your long head in a state of maximum contraction relative to the two other triceps heads illustrating this is an emg study by barons and buskies which found that inclined dumbbell kickbacks elicited the highest long head activation when compared to other common triceps exercises as you can see in the following emg graph this exercise activates the long head to a significantly greater degree than the two other triceps heads simply meaning that it's a great choice when it comes to emphasizing the long head however the researchers also noted that in order to best utilize this exercise for long head development it's vital that you keep the upper arm parallel with the body and make a straight line between the shoulders and your pinkies as this is what effectively leads to a peak contraction of the long head thus i'd recommend starting out with lighter weights for this to avoid letting your arms drop as they fatigue and then gradually increase the weight as you get stronger over time [Music] next we're going to move on to another exercise to further hit the long head with more volume since it makes up most of the mass of your triceps yet is often neglected in a lot of routines incline dumbbell extensions are the exercise of choice here as they place the shoulders in a flexed position which we know will as a result specifically emphasize the long head of the triceps to a greater degree and doing these on an incline set to roughly 45 degrees enables you to provide an even greater stretch to the long head since you can now achieve even more shoulder flexion when compared to a flat bench angle however as i've stated in the past with this exercise when performing this movement you want to refrain from starting and ending each rep with your arms directly overhead since at the top position there's virtually no tension placed on the triceps so instead move the arms back slightly lock them here and then proceed to perform your reps as this will now provide tension to the long head of the triceps throughout the whole range of motion leading to better triceps growth in the long run as a finishing movement for this workout we're going to use close grip dumbbell push-ups which is going to hit the whole triceps muscle pretty evenly with some involvement from the chest and front delts as well and by placing your hands on dumbbells as opposed to the ground it enables us to achieve a slightly greater range of motion and elbow extension for the triceps than we would otherwise thus providing more tension to the triceps and better growth over time not to mention the increased comfort it provides on the wrist as well now as for your hand placement we'll go off the recommendations of this 2016 paper from the journal physical therapy science the researchers compared triceps activation during shoulder width wide and narrow grip diamond push-ups and as shown here the diamond push-ups elicited the highest triceps activation when compared to the other grip widths simply meaning that when setting up your hand placement for this push-up i suggest setting the dumbbells up for your hands as if you were to do a diamond push-up like so in order to shift as much tension onto the triceps as possible and with this exercise you want to aim for higher reps and push close to or to failure as this is crucial in order to maximally activate the triceps when performing body weight exercises and then as you get stronger over time you can continue aiming for even more reps than you did previously or you can add weight to your back like so just to ensure that you're progressing over time so to sum everything up here's a sample dumbbell only triceps workout that you can perform using the exercises i previously discussed in addition to this i've also made a free downloadable pdf of the workout with reps sets and tutorials included for every exercise just so you have something to refer to when you're at the gym doing the workout and to get this pdf you can simply head on over to buildwithscience.com forward slash db pdf and i'll send it right over to you so there you have it guys i hope that you were able to see that both choosing the right exercises and performing them in the right fashion is crucial when it comes to building muscle as effectively as possible this is true not only for the triceps but for all the other muscle groups that you train as well and this is exactly why within my built with science programs we've taken the time to carefully select each and every exercise that goes into your routines based on science such as you can build muscle and see results in the fastest manner possible so if you haven't already you can simply head on over to builtwithscience.com to take this starting point analysis quiz in order to determine what program is best for you anyways as always if you enjoyed

    "title": "Fix &quot;Hunchback&quot; Posture in 10 Minutes/Day (Daily Exercise Routine)",
    "published_at": "2017-09-17T17:36:59Z",
    "transcript": "what's going on guys it's Jeremy here back with another video and today we're going to be addressing the issue of hunched-over posture also known as upper cross syndrome which is something that honestly the majority of people have nowadays due to increased technology use and increased time spent cemetary but this definitely is an issue that you should just ignore because not only will you look better taller and just overall more confident with better posture but hunched-over posture can make you more prone to injury in the gym and can actually decrease your strength and key lifts in the gym like the benchpress and the overhead squat but before we get started it's important to know that poor posture is a result of two things number one being weakness or inactivity in the muscles that are supposed to pull your chest in your back upright and number two being overactivity and tightness and muscles that pull your back and your chest forward into this hunched over position so in this video I'm going to address these problematic issues I show you a 10 minute daily routine that can be done at the gym or at home consisting of strengthening exercises for Merlin techniques and mobility exercises in order to correct your posture as fast as possible first let's talk about strengthening exercises you'll probably hear most people say that you simply need to train your back more in order to correct your posture but honestly this isn't very good advice for most people because it's not all of your back muscles that are weak it's specifically the lower traps and rhomboids that aren't getting enough activation and strengthening in order to pull your back upright in order to target these muscles you need to be doing the right back exercises for this purpose which I'm about to show you the first exercise is called wall slides which are well known but aren't performed correctly by most people simply stand with your heels but upper back shoulders arms and hands against the wall like so the goal is to slide your hands up and down mimicking a shoulder press movement pattern however you don't want to compensate by arching your back and losing contact with the wall as you raise your arms instead flatten your lower back before starting the movement by engaging your abs and keep this contact as you perform the exercise and don't forget to depress your traps before starting the movement when doing this exercise you should feel a strong activation in the middle of your back and not in your shoulders or your upper traps if this is too difficult for you you can regress it by moving your feet further away from the wall which would make it a little easier for you the second exercise is called prone wise which for most people should ideally be done on an incline bench to start simply lay on the bench bring your arms straight out into a wide position with the thumbs pointing up to press your traps and raise your arms to the level of your head while keeping them straight hold at this top position for one to two seconds and then come back down and repeat the movement it's important that you don't compensate by arching your lower back or sticking your head forward during the movement and again you should feel a strong contraction and your lower traps in the middle of your back as you perform this exercise if you want to perform this exercise at home you can simply do this by leaning over a couch or doing a flat on the ground which will require a little bit more shoulder mobility next we're going to go into some formerly techniques the first one is going to help with your thoracic spine mobility to get into position you want to lay on the floor with your feet and butt on the floor the foam roller in the middle of your back and your hands placed over your head like so to get your shoulder blades out of the way then you want to lift your hips into the air and slowly roll up and down for a bit to loosen up your upper back before we get into the next step once you've done this you want to put your butt back on the floor and place the foam roller between your shoulder blades take a deep breath in and as you exhale you want to extend over the foam roller while holding your head to release any tension in your neck relax in this position for a few deep breaths and then come back up move the foam roller slightly lower on your back and repeat the process one or two more times each time getting a little lower on your back and if you don't currently have a formal or I'll leave a link down in the description box below - one that I use now finally we're gonna go into a mobility exercise to help loosen up muscles that have been tightened over time as a result of your poor posture and are pulling your shoulders forward this exercise is called shoulder dislocations and can be done with a broomstick or resistance band you want to stand straight and use a very wide overhand grip on the stick then you want to slowly bring the stick over your head and behind your back while keeping your arms straight and repeat this movement the more narrow the grip the more shoulder mobility we'll need so start with a wide grip and gradually narrow your grip over time you can use a marker to draw down where your hands are placed in order to monitor your progress another option is to perform these lying down with your forehead in contact with the ground as this will incorporate a little bit of lower trap and rhomboid involvement to help strengthen them so to put it all together here's a routine that you can do which will take you less than 10 minutes to complete ideally you'll want to do this routine every single day if you want to improve your posture very quickly and ensure that it stays in that corrected position another thing to note is that you should always be mindful of how your posture is throughout the day whether you're sitting or standing one tip I use is to think about someone pulling your body up with a string everything should be aligned that's it for the video guys I hope you guys found it useful and just remember that when it comes to corrective exercises frequency and consistency is the most important thing in order to see the best results and as always please don't forget to do me a big favor by liking the video even a comment down below and subscribe it to my channel I'd really appreciate it you know anyway that's it for this video guys I'll see you next time [Music]"

    "published_at": "2019-02-17T14:14:19Z",
    "transcript": "[Music] for those who aren't aware this video workout B is a continuation of my science-based full-body workout a video it's designed to be used in conjunction with that workout throughout the week like so such a you alternate between both workouts and complete a total of 3 full-body workouts per week and just like in workout a make sure to stick around until the end of this video where I'll provide you with a completely free downloadable PDF of the workout for you to use while you're at the gym so without further ado let's take a look at what exactly workout B looks like the first and most difficult exercise of this workout will be the barbell deadlift this exercise is going to target the whole posterior chain primarily the hamstrings glutes and the various other muscles that make up the back and although the conventional deadlift is shown here as discussed in my video from last week feel free to experiment with other deadlift variations to find what feels best for you regardless of what you choose though it's vital that you perform some sort of deadlift within this workout this is because as shown in this 2015 study from the journal strength and conditioning research activation of the lower hamstrings is maximized with knee dominant exercises like the light curls we didn't work out a where as activation of the upper hamstrings is maximized with hip dominant exercises like the deadlift simply meaning that you'll want to incorporate both types of movements as we've done in our routine in order to fully develop your hamstrings in a balanced manner and minimize your risk of injury the incline dumbbell press is going to be your main chest movement for this workout given that we perform the flat bench press and workout a we want to now include a chest movement that emphasizes the clavicular head of the pecs or the upper chest as shown here to prevent it from lagging behind overtime as you perform each rep you want to really focus on feeling this region of the chest working as for why this exercise was chosen not only does research Nikita this exercise activates the upper chest very well compared to other chest movements but it also both allows a greater range of motion and better prevents muscle imbalances on one side from developing when compared to barbell exercises which is important for us since we stuck with a barbell bench press and workout a and as for the optimal bench angle research does tend to show that the best upper chest activation is seen with an angle of roughly 30 to 56 degrees however this will vary based on your anthropometry so experiment with every angle above flat to see what best activates your upper chest while minimizing your front delt involvement next we'll move on to the main back movement of this workout which will be a chest supported row most of the upper back musculature will be worked but with more emphasis placed on the mid-back muscles like the traps and rhomboids as shown here it's essential that we include a rowing movement to target these mid-back muscles since they aren't is effectively targeted in vertical pulling movements like the pull-ups we do in workout a now the reason I'd suggest performing your rows either chest supported on a bench or machine or inverted from a bar is simply to help minimize the lower back involvement which is already adequately worked in the deadlifts performed earlier thus any form of chest support when pulling accomplishes is but the inverted row is also a great alternative that I suggest you try out advocating its effectiveness this 2009 paper by Fenwick and colleagues have found that the inverted row elicits significantly less spinal loading on the lower back when compared to other common pulling exercises while still providing sufficient activation of the upper back muscles however in the event that you do choose this alternative note that this 2014 paper that analyzes the inverted row found that a pronated grip results in significantly greater rear delt and mid trap activation when compared to a supinated grip thus indicated that to maximize this exercises effectiveness you'll want to use an overhand grip that's slightly wider than shoulder width apart next we'll move on to a personal favorite of mine the Bulgarian split squat the main muscles work to Y will be the quadriceps and glutes and will also involve the hamstrings quite a bit as well but as I've noted in past videos you can play around with your step length to vary the activation of certain muscles this exercise is something I'd highly recommend not only because it's a unilateral movement which helps minimize any potential muscle imbalances but also because it complements your squat strength from workout a quite well for instance one 2016 study on rugby players found that the Bulgarian split squat was just as effective at increasing back squat strength as a back squat itself while placing less strain on the lower back and as you perform the movement you want to focus on pushing up with the front leg and avoid compensating by pushing up with a back leg if you're having a hard time balancing during this exercise however then a good way to compensate is simply setting up a lower platform for your back foot and then gradually increase the height until you can safely balance on a bench next we're gonna move on to dumbbell lateral raises this exercise is going to target the lateral deltoid or mid delt which is yet to receive much involvement given our previous exercise selection and lateral raises will likely be your best bet for growing this muscle as they've been consistently shown such as in this 2013 EMG analysis by Barton and colleagues to elicit the highest lateral deltoid activity when compared to other common shoulder exercises dumbbells are chosen here simply because they're convenient and accessible to most people but periodically switching it up with a chest support kettlebells and/or cables is something I highly recommend in order to incorporate different resistance curves and to find a variation that you feel best activates your lateral deltoid while minimizing trap involvement next we're going to move on to a couple additional accessory movements to help minimize any potential muscle imbalances as you progress since we had an accessory moving for the biceps and workout a the first accessory movement here incline dumbbell kickbacks will emphasize the long head of the triceps which hasn't received much attention given our previous exercise selection is in my past videos this exercise enables a long head to be maximally shortened as a result has been shown in EMG analyses to elicit very high activation of the long head compared to other tricep movements I'd suggest setting up the incline to roughly 30 degrees and ensuring that your elbows stay locked at your side and that your arms remain parallel with your body as you perform each rep the last exercise of this workout will be high to low cable crossovers which will put more emphasis on the sternal head of the pecs or lower chest since the line of pull of the cables runs in line with the way that the lower chest fibers run it's important to include this exercise since none of our previous exercise selection prioritizes the development of this region of the chest and a couple key points with this exercise are to keep the elbow position logged throughout each rep and cross your hands over at the bottom position to allow greater horizontal adduction in order to maximally activate the chest fibers so to sum the video up here is what your full body workout B could look like as recommended in a workout a if you're a beginner lifter then stick into just the main compound movements and the low end of the range of sets per exercise would likely be best to start and then you can gradually add more volume over time you can also add calves and/or abs to this as well or do that extra work and arrest it what's going on everyone now as mentioned in the beginning of this video and as I did in workout a I've created a completely free PDF for workout B that's designed for you to download and reference while you're at the gym it shows you the full workout what muscles each exercise targets step-by-step tutorials with visuals and more so to get a copy of this all you have to do is follow this link which I've put in description box down below and also pin in the comments I hope you're all finding the free PDFs useful but if you want to take things one step further and are looking for a workout and nutrition plan that combines all the research I do into a step-by-step program such that you can transform your body as efficiently as possible from your starting point while actually learning why it is you're doing what you're doing then what you can do is simply head on over built with science calm and take my starting point quiz I have up in order to discover which program and what approach is best for you anyways as always if you're having it done so I'd really appreciate a follow on Instagram I post a lot of exercise form videos and my daily meals on my story there as well which I think a lot of you will find useful and lastly I put in a ton of effort into this video so what you can do to help me out in return is simply give the video a like leave a comment down below as to what workout you'd like to see me cover next subscribe and turn on notifications to my channel as well just to be sure you don't miss out on any future content but that's it

    "title": "The Best Science-Based PUSH Workout For Growth (Chest/Shoulders/Triceps)",
    "published_at": "2020-01-05T17:13:32Z",
    "transcript": "one of the most effective workout routines you can use to build muscle is a push-pull leg split in which your major muscle groups are split into three different workouts in the push workout you train all of your upper-body pushing muscles so your chest your shoulders and your triceps and the pull workout you then train all of your upper body pulling muscles so your back your biceps and your rear delts and then finally in the legs workout you train your entire lower body these workouts are then typically performed for a total at six days per week with a rest day in between every three consecutive days but can easily be adjusted in a variety of ways to best fit your schedule and the reason why the split is so effective for muscle growth is because it trains each major muscle group at the optimal training frequency of two times per week which we know is most effective for growth it allows plenty of recovery time for each muscle and it can easily be tailored to fit different schedules goals and your level of training experience and in this video I'll show you how to get started with the push-pull legs routine by going through exactly how to optimally set up one of your push workouts for the week based on the recommendations of scientific literature and our anatomical understanding of the various pushing muscles and do make sure to stick around to the end of this video where I'll be providing you with a free mobile-friendly downloadable PDF of the workout for your convenience the first exercise we're going to use is the incline barbell bench press which is going to be used to target the clavicular head of the pecs which makes up the mass of the upper chest and is often a weak point for most people yet it's key to achieving a well-developed chest and there's a couple of reasons as to why this exercise was chosen to do so first off we note that the benchpress is highly effective at growing the chest as recent papers have shown a strong positive correlation between benchpress strength and chest size which is probably not only due to the high amount of chest activation that we see with the bench press but also because barbell presses in general are typically the most effective to incrementally add weight to and progressively overload over time in order to continuously drive growth as you get stronger and secondly by implementing an inclined bench angle will now be adding slightly more shoulder flexion to the bench press which will as a result emphasize the upper chest to a greater degree given that this is one of its main movement functions but with that being said research has indicated that setting the appropriate incline angle is key when it comes to maximizing the effectiveness of this exercise for upper chest growth and is therefore vital that you do so correctly and although the optimal bench ankle does vary between studies research generally shows a trend where we see increased upper chest activation when going from a bench angle of 0 degrees to 30 degrees and then another slight boost and activation when we bump it up to 45 degrees however at the same time we also see a resulting increase in anterior deltoids activity during each successive increase in bench angle with 45 degrees elicited in the highest activation therefore in order to maximize the activation of the upper chest and prevent the front delts from taking over it does seem that an angle of 30 degrees is optimal which is typically two notches above the bottom position for most benches regardless though it would still be a good idea for you to experiment with lower and higher bench angles just to see what best activates your upper chest as this is gonna vary from many individuals and I would also recommend experimenting with a slightly narrower grip during this movement as one paper from the journal strength and conditioning research found that this not only boosted upper chest activation but it also helped minimize the activation of the front delts during the movement as well but when implementing this ensure that your forearms still remain stacked vertically at the bottom position by adjusting your elbow angle during the press accordingly and aside from that we use a full range of motion here coming all the way down to the upper region of your chest and a rep range of six to eight reps with relatively heavier next we'll be moving on to the standing dumbbell shoulder press which will be used to target the shoulders but with most of the emphasis being placed on the front and lateral regions and the reason for using the standing double press as opposed to its barbell or seated counterparts is based on the findings of a 2013 EMG analysis where the researchers found that the standing dumbbell press elicited significantly greater front side and rear delt activation when compared to the other three shoulder pressing options shown here which is likely due to the greater stability requirements of this movement the only downside with this exercise though is that not only will overloading it with heavier weight over time be much more difficult due to getting the dumbbells up in position but the paper also indicated that you'll have to lift around 10% less weight than the other versions but this really isn't much of a downside given that with exercise 1 we've already utilized a heavy compound movement that also stresses the front delts it just makes sense to utilize the standing dumbbell press now in order to focus a little more and activate on the side and rear delts but in order to still ensure that you're adequately working the shoulders despite having to use a lighter weight will slightly bump up the rep range for this exercise to a relatively higher 10 to 15 reps per set next we'll be using the flat dumbbell press - now emphasize the sternal costal head of the pecs more specifically the mid chest which is important we do since we instead prioritize the upper chest by using an incline earlier on in this workout and flat dumbbell presses are a great option for this since they're very effective at activating the mid chest illustrating this is an extensive EMG analysis by researcher Brett Contreras we analyzed the chest activity within 15 different chest exercises and found that the flat dumbbell press was most effective at activating the mid chest in addition one of the unique benefits by using dumbbells here is that we're now able to use a greater range of motion for the chest and we could when compared to using a barbell like we did earlier and for this exercise I would also recommend at least periodically in your sessions to incorporate a slight one to two second pause at the bottom position each Rev this will in effect not only add some more variety to chest pressing movements but it's also gonna help you build more strength out of the bottom position where most people are weakest in by preventing your muscles from receiving any assistance from the stretch shortening reflex that you typically get at this bottom position in addition and brief pauses in this position will also help strengthen your isometrically which will in turn better help you perfect your form for the movement since you're now forced to maintain tightness without breaking down your form at this bottom position before you proceed to the next rep and for this exercise will use moderately heavy weight for a rep range of 8 to 12 reps per set next is time to move on to lateral raises to now prioritize the side delts although they were work to an extender in the standing shoulder press that we did earlier lateral raises have been shown to elicit far greater activation of the side delts and is therefore a good idea to include in this routine given the importance of developing this muscle for a wider more powerful looking physique and that's of stating in past videos to potentially make the lateral raise even more effective for the side delts you can slightly lean in the direction of the raise like so the reason for this is based on our recent paper which showed that one of our rotator cuff muscles the supraspinatus is most active during the beginning of the race whereas the side delts only starts to become more active at around halfway up so by leaning away you're actually able to remove the beginning portion of the raise and as a result shifts slightly more tension onto the delts and away from the supraspinatus now for this exercise we'll want to focus on form and activation here by using relatively lighter weight for high rep range of 10 to 15 reps next is time to revisit the chest with a seated decline cable fly that'll be used to target the lower region of the chest which is yet to receive much emphasis but is important to develop in order to sculpt that lower and outer chest region so what you want to do here is set up a high incline bench and move the cables up such that they're slightly above the height of your shoulders when you see it next you want to perform a high to low fly motion and supinate your wrist at the end position by rotating your palms up and driving your elbows in the high-to-low motion implemented here enables us to apply tension in direct line with the lower fibers of the chest and the supination of the wrist at the end we'll simply heighten the lower chest contraction that you experience by enabling the elbows to travel inward to a greater degree and for these will again focus on maximizing activation of the lower chest by using relatively lighter weight and a higher rep range of 10 to 15 reps lastly we're going to move on to incline dumbbell overhead extensions to target the triceps more specifically though given the added shoulder flexion of this exercise we'll be able to effectively emphasize the long head of the triceps which is important that we do in this workout given that is responsible for most of the mass of your triceps and is yet to receive much attention from our previous pushing exercises when compared to the other triceps heads and for these we use relatively lighter weight here and a higher rep range of 10 to 15 reps as this is generally just easier on the elbows so to sum everything up for you here's what your push workout could look like I'd recommend that novice lifters stay on the lower end of the volume requirements whereas more experienced lifters can opt for the higher recommendations of says and as for your second push workout during the week you want to simply stick to the same general outline and target muscles but switch out the exercises accordingly and for your convenience I've compiled all of this information into an easy-to-follow completely free mobile-friendly PDF for you to download and use for reference while you're at the gym performing this push workout it'll show you the full workout the rest times step by step tutorials for each exercise and more so to get a copy of it just simply head on over to built with science comm forward slash push workout PDF and I'll send it right over to you and I'll leave a link to that in the description box down below as well so I hope you're able to see that when it comes to maximizing your time in the gym and building muscle most effectively it's crucial that you know only have a reason behind each and every exercise that you perform in your workouts but that you'll also pay close attention to how exactly you then go about executing them as the devil really is in the detail and for step-by-step program that takes care of all of the guesswork for you and shows you exactly how and what to work out week after week in order to build muscle most effectively with science just like Michael over here was able to do in just eight months then simply head on over to built with science comm to take the analysis quiz to discover which science-based program will be best for you and where your body is currently at anyways guys I hope you enjoyed this one I put a ton of effort into this video so please return the favor by giving the video a like leave me to come on the video as to what you'd like to

    "title": "How To Build Muscle At Home: The BEST Full Body Home Workout For Growth",
    "published_at": "2020-03-19T16:08:06Z",
    "transcript": "all right guys so as many of you in my programs already know from my announcement earlier last week in light of all the coronavirus commotion outbreaks in this world i thought it'd be a great idea for me to make a science-based full-body home workout routine that you can resort to in the event that you're either staying away from the gym or the gyms in your area are currently closed due to the outbreak now typically when we think of home workouts where you're more or less limited to just using your body weight we automatically assume that they're inferior for muscle growth when compared to working out at a gym where you have access to heavy weights and i'm not gonna lie for most home body weight workouts out there this is true and they are in fact inferior for growth but this is simply because they aren't designed properly because research is time and time again shown that in both untrained and trained individuals you can make comparable gains in muscle mass by using either lighter loads with your body weight for example or heavier weights in the gym but the catch is that there's a couple key points that people overlook when it comes to home workouts which are key to ensuring that you're still able to maximize your growth despite being limited to just your body weight these key points are essential that you incorporate into the routine i'll be showing you today and are as follows first off and arguably most important is that you need to push to near failure for every single set that you perform in this workout this is because research has shown that when using lighter loads if you stop well short of failure during your sets then you'll fail to fully activate all the motor units within your muscles and as a result you won't experience the same amount of growth that you would when using heavy weights therefore during each set of this workout you want to push until you generally just have a couple reps left in the tank before you would not be able to perform another rep with good form due to muscle fatigue now this will be very uncomfortable to do given that we'll be working with a higher rep range but it's essential that you push through if you truly want to maximize your growth with this routine secondly although research has shown that working with higher reps and lighter loads like with your body weight for example can lead to comparable growth as heavier weights in the gym it seems that there is a low end cutoff to this where if you train with loads or use a resistance that is too light then you won't be able to maximize growth which seems to be right around 30 to 40 percent of your one rep max meaning that during each of your sets you need to be working with a weight of resistance that is at least 30 to 40 percent of your one rep max if you want to maximize growth now although this is easier to calculate when using weights since we're just using our body weight in this workout we want to convert this to revs so thirty to forty percent of your one max equates to around 30 to 40 reps per set and what this means is that if you're doing one of the exercises in the work that i'll show you today and you're able to perform more than 30 or 40 reps on it during each set when pushed into near failure then it's an indication that you aren't using a resistance or variation that's difficult enough and you want to instead use one of the progressions that will show you to make the movement more demanding so ideally you should not be reaching over 30 to 40 reps during any of your sets in this workout now that we have that covered we're ready to dive into the full body home workout designed to train all of your upper body and lower body musculature in a proportionate manner i'll first go through the various exercises and how to perform them and then i'll cover your options in terms of how to best execute the workout the first exercise we'll use here are narrow grip push-ups with the hands placed in a diamond shape which will be used to target the chest and triceps we'll be using the specific hand placement since three emg papers have confirmed that it elicits significantly greater chest and triceps activation when compared to a shoulder width or wide hand placement during the push-up perform four sets of these in total two of these sets will be performed on a flat surface to emphasize the whole chest whereas two of these sets should be performed in a decline with your feet elevated and your hands positioned a little bit more towards your face as this will now shift more emphasis to the upper chest given that it now incorporates more shoulder flexion into the push-up which is one of the main functions of the upper chest and to progress this movement you can simply stuff a bag with books and strap it onto your bag to gradually increase the load you can also use a band to add more resistance to the movement as well next we're going to move on to the inverted row to target our overall back with most of the emphasis on the mid back for thickness now ideally for the most resistance you should either use a broom or mop and place that between two chairs or you can perform these under a sturdy table like so and to make this movement easier you can start out with bent knees to use your legs for support another option though is the following setup instead which we'll continue to use later on this workout simply take two bed sheets or towels tie a basic knot at the end of each of them and then throw it over your door and close your door this will enable you to now perform your roll like so for whichever variations you do choose though you can progress them by either getting your body more horizontal to the ground by elevating your feet for example and or add more load with the use of a backpack stuffed with books next we'll be moving on to something called pike push-ups to mainly target the shoulders and triceps for these you can start them out on the ground by assuming a push-up position and then moving your hands closer to your feet while keeping your legs straight such that your body now makes an upside down v-shape then bend your elbows and lower your upper body until the top of your nose nearly touches the floor your head should move forward past your hands as you reach the bottom position and then return to between your hands at the top position and just like with the overhead press your elbows should not flare out sideways keep them tucked and forearms vertical over your wrists as you descend then to progress this you can first simply elevate your feet up to the edge of a platform and then to progress this even further you can move your hands closer to the feet which will make the movement considerably harder and then again just repeat the process of elevating your feet onto a higher platform once you're ready i'd recommend marking down with tape how far your hands are from the platform so you're able to accurately gauge your progress over time next it's time to target the back primarily the lats with a vertical pulling angle rather than horizontal like we did earlier this one is bound to get you weird looks around the house but is worth it for the return and backhands it's gonna provide simply lay on a smooth surface and use something for grip on your hands like shoes for example then you simply perform a lat pull-down motion by pulling your elbows down to slide your body up you should feel your lats working as you do so and to progress it you can simply add weight with a backpack and or provide additional resistance by pressing your feet into the ground as you perform your reps now it's time for some arms isolation go back to your bed sheet set up and lean back with your arms straight like so then keeping your body straight and elbows locked in position curl your hands towards your face by using your biceps then to target the long hair of the triceps which is yet to be emphasized in this workout you can simply switch over and perform tricep extensions like so again keeping the elbow locked in place and your body in a straight line alternatively these can also be done on an elevated platform like so and for these arm exercises you can progress in a few ways by orienting your body to be more horizontal to the ground transitioning to just one arm at a time and or just adding weight by using the backpack next it's time to move on to the lower body and for most of us bodyweight squats just aren't going to cut it which is why today we'll use the bed sheet setup once again to perform assisted pistol squats to target the quads and glutes lean back with your arms straight and then lift one leg off the ground then you simply squat down like so finish your reps on one leg before proceeding to the other leg and at first you can use your arms to pull yourself up for assistance if you need to but over time you can progress it by either relying less and less on the assistance of your arms during the movement or transition to doing the same movement but stopping the range of motion short by sitting on an elevated platform and gradually reducing the height of this to continue making it harder next we'll move on to one you're probably familiar with the bulgarian split squat with your rear leg elevated up on a platform which will again further target the quads and glutes to progress them you can simply hold a weighted backpack at your chest like so once that gets too easy though a more difficult progression is the assisted shrimp squat where you can use the side of a counter for assistance hold one leg behind you with the same arm and then squat down until your knee just about touches the floor and then come back up with the assistance from the counter as needed and over time you can progress these by moving off of the counter next we'll use the sliding leg curl to effectively work the hamstrings through both hip and knee extension simply lay on a smooth surface and place your feet on two claws or something that will enable them to slide easily then using your hamstrings curl your heels in towards you while raising your hips up into the air your back should remain straight as you do so and to progress these you can slow down the tempo and or perform them with just one leg at a time so here is a summary of the workout now when performing it just like your exercises in the gym is vital that you get adequate rest of roughly two minutes between each of your sets and to do so in this workout while saving you time you can perform the following upper body exercises in a super set fashion as shown below where you perform for example a set of the push-ups rest for 30 to 45 seconds then go right into a set of the inverted row rest for 30 to 45 seconds again and then go back to the push-ups and repeat by strategically using this agonist antagonist superset method with the appropriate exercises research has shown that you'll be able to save time while ensuring that your performance on your sets don't suffer and as for the rep ranges again you need to push to near failure each set which is why i haven't given a specific number of reps as this is going to vary for everyone so instead just jot down how many reps you perform for each set try to beat those numbers in your next workout and use the progressions as needed once you're reaching over 30 reps per set and then as for frequency i recommend performing this workout three to four times a week as this will ensure that each of your muscles are worked at the optimal number of sets required to maximize growth and lastly i've compiled this home workout into an easy to download free mobile friendly pdf for you to use and reference while you're performing it it'll show you the workout tutorials proper progressions and more to get a copy of it just head on over to buildwithscience.com forward slash home workout pdf and i'll send it right over to you and i'll leave a link to

    "title": "We Tested 17 Shoulder Exercises, These Are Best For Growth",
    "published_at": "2022-11-27T14:00:22Z",
    "transcript": "Betty and I are back twelve thousand dollar science machine that'll help us determine which of these 17 shoulder exercises are the best and which are the worst for building muscle I tested these exercises on three subjects averaged the data and found some very interesting insights that aligns with other research out there with the results from this experiment you'll be able to save literally years of wasted time doing the wrong movements for your body how does this all work Betty measures the electrical activity from our muscles as they contract researchers use this to estimate muscle activation a couple weeks ago we used her magic to help us determine what chest exercises best activated the upper middle and lower chest this time we're testing shoulders let's explain what and then who will be measuring the shoulders also known as the delts are made up of three regions there's a front of the shoulder which most people over develop there's a side which helps widen your shoulders and finally there's a commonly underdeveloped developed rear or back region of the shoulder which helps balance out your shoulders and provide that 3D look we're putting sensors on each of these three regions but we're also putting One sensor on the upper traps you'll find out why exactly we did this later on as for who we'll be testing just like in the last video I wanted at least three subjects although I wanted to introduce a female subject this time unfortunately my girlfriend and ride or die homie for the past seven years Tawny had a shoulder injury preventing her from doing many of the exercises but we will bring her in next video as for this one I of course wanted to see what exercises work best for my body so I signed up right away Alex our Master Built with science coach had no problem being a guinea pig again the last subject however I wanted to be a beginner to see how the results might differ based on level of experience Raza our operations manager would be the perfect fit unfortunately in the last episode he faced the Wrath of the ice bath after losing the wager so I was pretty hesitant about asking him again to my surprise he was actually pretty open to it as per what that wager is this time this is a Scoville scale that ranks the heat of the food we've ordered extremely hot noodles which comes in around here we also got the world's hottest chip made with the hottest chili pepper on the planet the Carolina Reaper but we also got a gummy bear this bad boy goes way off the chart at 9 million Scoville and according to the description on Amazon is 900 times hotter than a jalapeno each of us is going to break down on a piece of paper where we think the top two exercises will end up being for the front side and rear parts of the shoulder the person who gets the most exercises correct still suffers which is not as much they get to choose who has to eat what now I've seen what these have done to people online and honestly I'm pretty terrified but let the games begin now before we get to testing there's just a few things we need to prep first we had to figure out how much weight we'd be using on each shoulder exercise to ensure they were all equally as challenging so a few days before testing we all spent a whole day in our gym and figured out our estimated one rep max for each exercise this is the maximum amount of weight we could lift on each exercise on test day we'd use 70 of this weight next electrode placement as some of you know from last video we need a clean shave to make sure the electrodes stick Alex and I were blessed with Asian genetics so we were ready to go Raza on the other hand do it or razza [Music] this time he didn't actually have much hair on his shoulders so a quick shave and an alcohol swab was all that was needed [Music] oh is that out of the way let's check if she's working here is the front delt you can see that Spike use the side delt the rear delt upper trap so you can see every time I shrug s up just like that seems like we're ready to go finally before we can start the first exercise we had to take a crucial measurement known as MBC or maximum voluntary contraction this represents the maximum activation your muscle can reach but this value will be slightly different for everyone so by gathering this value before we start testing we're able to then accurately compare the shoulder exercises we do against each of our own maximum values to see how well the exercise works for our individual shoulder muscles go with that out of the way we're ready to test we're sticking to a similar design as our chess experiment by doing one set of five reps and then taking at least a five minute rest before moving to the next exercise we also rotated between front side and rear delt exercises to avoid overly fatigue in one region form is also extremely important to activate the right muscles in the first place so I closely monitored and tweaked form if needed in fact this is raza's side dealt and upper trap activation using his original form when corrected his side Delta activation increased by over 55 percent and his upper trap activation decreased because he was Now using more of the right muscles it's the little details that make all the difference and for a step-by-step program that guides you every single week towards your dream body after this video head to our website take our analysis quiz and it'll tell you which science space program is best for you and your body now always going well until I realize something alright guys so I just realized guys we're at our Builder science gym and the one rear delt machine that we don't have is a reverse pec deck so we're gonna have to head back to the same public gym and see if they don't mind us borrowing their pec deck machine once again your friends are here they're your science buddies you hear that you got called their we all called their Science Buddies [Music] oh that just waxed me thank you man I appreciate that yeah see you all right guys I have all the data I'm gonna spend the next few days processing it but if you haven't seen yet for every muscle group we test we put a poll up on our site to give you the opportunity to see if you can guess what exercises will come out on top all entries get a discount code for our built with science fitness programs and anyone who guesses at least five out of the six correct they get enrolled into a program of their choice free of charge to vote just head on over to buildwithscience.com vote and I'll also leave a link in the description box down below good luck okay so before we dive into the winners just keep in mind that Betty isn't the end-all be-all I invested in her because I always had unanswered questions when it came to studies and I wanted to test things for myself but as you'll see she has her limitations not to mention we only tested three subjects that's it after averaging the data across the three of us I did find some very interesting insights that aligns with other research out there let's start with the front delts so most of you guys actually voted front raises to come out on top it's not a bad guess but it did end up performing quite poorly now there's a couple reasons for this first of all you're not able to use very much weight during this exercise when compared to other big shoulder exercises less weight tends to lead to less activation not necessarily a bad day just something to be aware of when measuring muscle activation second of all the tension during the exercise doesn't actually line up very well with the front delts if we look at the top of my shoulder during the race some of the front delt but also some of the side Deltas working so it hits a bit of both without being great at hitting either one now although we didn't test it with the thumbs facing up which would theoretically better line up the tension with the front delts of past EMG study did the researchers found front raises activated the front delts just as much as the barbell bench press and 40 less than the shoulder press so while it may be a half decent option to work the front dials without having to use very heavy weight let's take a look at the winners so both winners were overhead shoulder presses just different variations of them we tested the seated dumbbell press standing double press seated barbell press and the standard barbell press but for the seated variations we were actually able to use slightly heavier weight than the standing versions because of the extra stability provided by the bench likely as a result of this for all three of us although not by much the seated versions perform the best but the standard versions that do have their benefits as well since they get the core and the whole body in fall and as you'll learn later on the standard versions also provided a different kind of Demand on the shoulders one more thing for the front belts although the overhead presses we just talked about will provide significantly more activation on the front delts it's likely that you're already working this muscle quite a bit whenever you perform chest exercises in fact when we look at data from the chest exercises we tested a couple weeks back during the barbell bench press my friend dealt averaged 44 percent active Innovation this is why many people have over developed printouts relative to their side and rear delts so my recommendation would be to do overhead presses once maybe twice a week depending on your goals but to balance out your shoulder development spend more time working on the side and rear delts using the exercises we're about to cover now the side delts so this took me by a complete surprise the winners ended up being the two standing shoulder presses we tested at first glance I had no idea how these managed to outrank the lateral raise variations we tested since those are widely known as the best side belt exercises but after taking a deeper look into the data I noticed a couple things so if you take a look at the real-time graph of the dumbbell lateral raise you can see there's no activation at the bottom position when your arms are held straight down which makes sense your side delts are just chilling however if you look at the standing shoulder press you don't see this at the bottom position of each wrap the side delts are still helping stabilize the weight up at your chest in addition to this the standing versions of the shoulder press have a greater stability to mat in our experiment as well as in past studies this has been shown to lead to Higher Side Delta activation but this isn't a very powerful stimulus for growth for example if I put sensors on my glutes as I perform the exercise which are Contracting hard to stabilize my body you'd see quite High activation but you wouldn't do standing shoulder presses to grow your glutes in reality the front delts are the main muscle helping you actually move the weight and experience in most of the growth it's a case where more activation doesn't necessarily lead to more growth one of the limitations about it taking this into consideration I'd remove shoulder presses from the top which would now bring the lateral raises to the top of the list in this experiment the standing double lateral raise and the line incline lateral raise came out on top with cable Auto raises following closely behind all of those are great options last but not least the rear delts so most of you guys actually voted the reverse Tech Deck to come out on top while it did perform quite well the top exercise was instead one of my personal favorites and something we use a lot in our built with science programs it's a double arm reverse cable file but the setup and forum is what seemed to make all the difference if you look at the anatomy of the rear delts they travel at roughly a 45 degree angle away from the body the reverse pack deck since the arms are held up at shoulder height doesn't line up the tension very well with this but with this exercise by setting the cables high and pulling the arms down and back at a 45 degree angle from the body it lines up the constant tension from the cable almost perfectly with the rear delts which is probably why it performs so well before I show the other winner let's talk about face pulls this was the second most photophore exercise to win for rear Delta activation however it didn't perform very well at all part of it is due to what we just talked about face pulls keep the arms up to get the 45 degree arm angle seems to be optimal for the rear delts but another big part of it is stability it's very hard to use heavy weight with proper form on face poles as often causes you to tip over or use other muscles instead in fact I tried to go relatively heavy on face pulls during this experiment to make them equally as challenging as the other exercises and as a result my body compensated by activating my upper traps even more than my rear delts that said face pulls are great for strengthening the rotator cuffs and various other important muscles for shoulder health and posture but to properly do that you have to use light weight don't treat face pulls as a big muscle building movement for the rear delts as you'll see there's far better options for that as for the other rear delt winner this ended up once again being the reverse cable 5. but with one arm and the body positioned sideways to the cable now although these two exercises look very similar they actually both challenge the rear delts in a different way the double arm challenges your rear delts most in the middle of the movement whereas the single arm challenges you rear delts most in the beginning of the movement which Recent research has shown to be arguably the most important part of the movement for growth so I definitely recommend doing both if you don't have access to cables though another exercise to perform quite well is the chest supported rear delt dumbbell row with your elbows kept at a 45 degree angle away from the body the results are in Alex Gaza you did not win Jeremy is the winner hanging out with my lovely girlfriend they're sitting on the toilet tonight you are sitting on the toilet cheers wait how how long until milk gets worse yo shout out to the 10 people who got five out of the six correct you guys are traps so we're testing back next if you want to vote billasize.com vote good luck and I'll see you next time"

    "transcript": "this is Betty a 12 000 EMG machine who is going to help us determine what the best chest exercises actually are how does this all work I'll explain in a minute but here's a hint [Music] let's talk about why I bought a 12 000 piece of equipment in the first place I remember the first time I watched Crazy Stupid Love and saw Ryan Gosling's ripped muscular body on screen and I thought to myself damn I would feel incredible if I looked like that Play It's like a Photoshop so at 15 years old weighing in at a frail 120 pounds I decided to dive head first into the gym but almost instantly I became confused and overwhelmed with what to do everyone had a different opinion on how to train and what to eat I tried it all and while I saw some results I just wasn't satisfied until one day during my studies in University I accidentally came across a 2010 study titled the mechanisms of muscle hypertrophy and their application to resistance training this paper dove into the science behind what made muscles grow and how to apply that science to your training I was fascinated I felt like I stumbled upon a gold Mark I started reading more studies and applying these methods to my own training and my results skyrocketed I taught these methods to my friends and my family and the same effect happened there finally a source of truth I could actually trust that's when I went all in to pursue a career in Fitness learning from the experts and dissecting the research in a way that the average Joe could understand to apply however I wanted to go a step further I want to not only communicate research and spread the truth to the world but I want to be a part of that research process which brings me back to Betty she's what's known as an EMG machine just don't tell her that she likes to feel human EMG stands for electromyography and it's a way of measuring the electrical activity produced by muscles when they contract researchers use this to assess how well different exercises are at activating our muscles but there's a problem I haven't used this machine since back in University and I want to make sure I run this experiment as best as possible so that we and you can actually trust the data so I called up a few colleagues of mine and they led me to John a master's student specializing in EMG who taught me everything I needed to know finally Betty and I were ready for our first test run foreign stick this on all right it's a moment of truth boom so you see this green that is my bicep after getting the hang of her it was time to prep the experiment and think about all the variables we had to control first off subjects everyone's bodies are slightly different and the more subjects in a study the more reliable the data so although it would triple the work I wanted at least three subjects in total luckily we had Alex and Raza eager to give it a go Raza is more of a beginner so it's going to be interesting to see how his results compare to me and Alex next we had to figure out how much weight we'd be using on each chest exercise to ensure that they were equally as challenging so a week before the test date we all spent a whole day in our gym and figured out our estimated one rep max this is the maximum amount of weight we could lift on each exercise on test day we'd use 70 of this weight for each exercise however we couldn't really do this with push-ups since you're forced to use your own body weight which led to some really interesting results that I'll share later on finally the wager this is Raza and this is Alex one of our daily science coaches Bethany over here is going to help us determine which chest exercises are best at activating the upper the middle and the lower chest now before we reveal the results each of us is going to write down on a piece of paper which we think the top two exercises are going to be for each region the person who gets the least exercises correct well they're gonna have to face the Wrath foreign body-sized Canadian Tundra death trap guaranteed to shrink whatever manhood you have left here's a list of all the chest exercises we'll be testing but before we test there's just a few more final things we need to get done first to make sure the sensors thick we needed a clean shave thanks to my half Filipino jeans and Alex is beating a me's background we were ready to go Roz on the other hand needed some work hello how'd it feel next Electro placement we put sensors on the upper middle and lower portions of the chest but we also put one on the front delts to see if any exercises let the shoulders to take over rather than the chest and finally before we could go into the first exercise we had to take a crucial measurement to make sure we could standardize the data it's what's called NVC or maximum voluntary contraction this represents the maximum activation your muscle can reach but this value will be slightly different for everyone so by gathering this value before we start testing the exercises where able to then accurately compare the chest exercises we do against each of our own maximal values to see how well the exercise works for our individual chest muscles getting this value wasn't easy [Music] with that out of the way we're ready to test we're sticking to a similar design as EMG research papers use by doing one set of five Reps for each exercise and then taking at least a five minute rest before moving on to the next one forum is also extremely important to activate the right muscles in the first place so I closely monitored and tweaked form if needed in fact this is raza's chest activation using his original form and this is his chest activation using our corrected science-based form for the flat dumbbell press there was a 150 boost in this chest activation it's these little details that make all the difference and is what we teach you how to do in our brand new 2.0 online fitness programs over at builtwithscience.com after this video if you had their intake or analysis quiz it'll determine which of our step-by-step programs are best for you and your body anyways all was going well until we realized something damn okay so I just realized that one of the most popular exercises on the list is the pec deck machine and it's the one exercise that we don't have at the built with science gym so I'm gonna call the nearest gym and we're gonna see if they don't mind if we run a little bit of a science experiment I called but there was no answer so we decided to just show up yeah hi um yeah I'm not sure how entirely to explain this are you able to come to the front for a second and we're testing a bunch of different machines and the only one we didn't have was a pectec machine all of you guys think this song here room let's go [Music] figure out which exercise gives the best reading exactly my chest exercises yeah [Music] is that good they're good with that out of the way we managed to finish up the rest of the exercises all right guys it has been a long day over eight hours of testing I'm gonna get some sleep and then I'm gonna process the data and then it's gonna be time to reveal the winners but first I want you to comment down below what you think the top two exercises will be for the upper chest the middle chest and the lower chest and let's see if any of you guys will be the one summoned to the ice plunge good night buddy [Music] it's time so before I present the winners it's important to be mindful of the limitations of this little experiment with several variables and just three subjects it's hard to detect any statistical differences that said I did average the data across the three of us and I found some really interesting findings that actually aligns with a lot of other research out there let's start with the upper chest generally exercise is done on an incline bench will better Target the upper chest so it's no surprise that the top two exercises were both incline dumbbell presses just at different bench angles so we tested 15 degrees 30 degrees and 45 degrees but for all three of us as soon as the bench incline reached 45 degrees the upper chest activation began to decrease and the shoulders started to take over something that I've actually seen in past EMG studies as well as a result the lower inclines of 15 and 30 degrees which is usually just one to two notches up from the bottom position those came out on top 15 degrees actually work best for me so I'm going to be sticking with that whereas 30 degrees work best for Raza and Alex I'd highly suggest that you try out both angles and just see what feels best for you there is however one more upper chest exercise I want to highlight it's called The Pinch press a popular Instagram influencer exercise that I thought would be fun to throw in and test this ended up being by far Roz's top upper chest exercise and scored quite well overall from me as well but I wouldn't recommend it which brings me to one of the limitations of Betty I'm sorry baby don't take it personally although when exercise May activate a muscle really well it doesn't necessarily mean it's the best option to grow that muscle in the case of the pinch press the chest is activating really hard to keep the weight squeezed together this type of contraction on the chest is what's called an isometric contraction which unfortunately just isn't very effective for building muscle it's like trying to grow your legs with wall sits instead of squats luckily the pinch press is the only High activation but low muscle the potential exercise in the less digestive okay so now the middle chest the first winner is actually a not very well known exercise but it's something we use in our built with science programs and it's a favorite of a few popular bodybuilders such as John Meadows it's the decline dumbbell press but not the typical version that you see at the gym here we use just a very slight elevation by placing a weight plate underneath the front of the bench usually this helps favor the lower chest a little bit more but to my surprise it did an excellent job of activating the mid chest for all three of us the other winner was an exercise with a very stable setup and one that provides constant tension to the chest throughout the whole range of motion the seated cable flyer and in this case we put the cable handles at chest height which seem to be the perfect setting for the middle chest before we move to the lower chest winners I just want to highlight one more exercise push-ups why do a push-ups scored extremely poorly for both me and Alex but for Raza because they were more challenge you for him to do another one let's go it actually ranked the highest for his middle chest so while it can be a great exercise and just as effective as something like the bench press for beginners they will become less effective as you get stronger and need more of a challenge last but not least the lower chest here I expected high to low cable flies to wind because the tension from the cable aligns well with the lower chest fibers while it did end up scoring well seated cable flies came out on top which might be because it's a more stable setup with the tension from the cable still aligning quite well with the lower chest so both are great options but I would be interested to see if activation would change at all if I place the sensors a little bit more on the outer chest the area where I personally feel high to low cable thighs work in the most the other winner was once again the decline dumbbell press suggesting that the very slight decline aligns the Press very well with both the middle and the lower chest fibers of the chest for those of you who want to take a deeper look into the results I'll leave a link in the description box down below to where you can view all the data the Moment of Truth we got changed and gathered ground for the verdict at this point I still have no idea who is going in is it the master coach the beginner or my worst fear me the results are in Jeremy you got four correct Alex you got four correct oh four and Raza for you to avoid the dreaded ice plunge you need to get at least four correct you got three which means they're going to nice full plunge house [Music] foreign [Music] [Applause] seeing Raza take his ice plunge like an absolute champ inspired me to jump in but as I sat there freezing in the rain I started getting a little emotional after hitting a hundred thousand subscribers on YouTube I found it built with science which stemmed from a bigger Vision I always had in mind to build a legacy that would last long after I'm gone and be much greater and larger than myself a legacy that would bring a more scientific and research-backed approach to Fitness and weed out the BS and Bro Science that plagues the industry this little science experiment was a big step towards realizing that for the first time ever rather than just observing the science I'm in a way kind of actually doing the science I'm excited for where this leads and I appreciate you joining me on this journey thank you for everything you helped us yeah how do you feel about that huh how do you feel about that about about what everything the shooting and stuff honestly it was like a huge step and a huge step forward and I'll name my vision but like also in just trying to make my videos a lot more entertaining like stepping aside in my comfort zone and trying to do something different you know and like bringing the team in like it was so much more fun instead of just having me in it to have like other characters and people like Raza and to show you guys who else is behind the scenes who else is doing full of science because it's not just me like I can't do everything so I have these incredible people with me you know we've tested chest and we're testing shoulders next there's a pole up on our site where you can vote on the exercises that you think will come out on top winners get a free built with science program and all entries get a discount code you can vote over at builtwithscience.com vote I'll also leave a link in

    "title": "The Best Science-Based Full Body Workout for Growth (WORKOUT \u201cA\u201d)",
    "published_at": "2019-01-27T16:53:44Z",
    "transcript": "[Music] full body workouts are one of the best routines for muscle growth and strength regardless of your training experience they not only enable you to optimize your training frequency and recovery throughout the week but are also time efficient and in this case only requiring three workouts per week however in order to maximize the benefits of a full body workout routine you need to adequately target all of your major muscle groups within each workout and you need to do so in a balanced manner such that your muscles grow and strengthen proportionately over time which not only leads to a more aesthetic physique but also minimizes your risk of injury so in this video i'll show you exactly how to do so based on current scientific literature and our anatomical understanding of the human body but first off just to clarify this full body workout routine consists of three workout days per week it will alternate between two different full body workouts like so workout a will be covered in this video and workout b will be covered in a follow-up video each workout will consist of mainly compound movements with a mix of various accessory exercises to minimize any potential muscle imbalances and do make sure to stick around until the end of the video where i'll provide you with a completely free downloadable pdf for the workout so that next time you're in the gym you'll know exactly what to do so without further ado let's take a look at what the optimal full body workout might look like first exercise is the barbell bench press and it's going to be your main chest movement for this workout it's going to be responsible for contributing to most of your chest overall size and thickness over time more specifically due to the flat angle of the bench it's going to emphasize the sternal portion or middle part of your chest while also developing your shoulders and triceps so as you perform this exercise you'll want to really focus on feeling these highlighted muscles working with most of the tension being felt in your chest and the bench press was chosen for various reasons first off it's great at activating the chest multiple studies like this 2000 emg paper by barons and buskies have found the bench press to elicit the highest chest activation when compared to other common chest movements and this does seem to translate to better chest growth as well for instance two recent papers that tracked bench press strength and chest growth over time have found a strong positive correlation between them suggesting that in most cases a strong bench does indeed equate to a big chest and with regards to form you'll want to come all the way down to your chest to accomplish a full range of motion this is because multiple papers have found that for compound movements like the bench press a full range of motion is more effective for muscle growth even if heavier weights are used with a partial range of motion so unless you have past shoulder injuries preventing you from doing so or your main goal is to improve a specific sticking point then aiming for a full range of motion with this exercise would be your best bet for growth next we're going to move on to a lower body movement before proceeding on to the next upper body movement in order to optimize the recovery and performance with each exercise the barbell back squat is the exercise of choice here since it's been repeatedly shown in multiple papers to elicit very high quadriceps activation while also heavily involving the glutes and various other lower body muscles you should mainly feel the tension in these muscles that are highlighted as you perform the exercise and again with this compound movement you want to utilize a full range of motion to maximize growth in fact illustrating the importance of this a 2014 paper by mcmahon and colleagues found that there was a two-fold increase in muscle size after only eight weeks for subjects using full range of motion squats compared to subjects using a partial range of motion and although what constitutes a full range of motion will vary based on your own anthropometry i'd suggest sticking with what research recommends is optimal which is to come down to at least slightly below parallel or deeper if your mobility enables you to do so safely pull ups are going to be the next upper body exercise and your main back movement for this workout the main muscle worked will be the lats but as shown here various shoulder and scapular stabilizers as well as the biceps and forearm muscles will be worked as well as you perform this movement you should feel these highlighted muscles working but most of the tension should be felt in the lats and once you're able to successfully complete around 10 to 12 body weight pull-ups straight you'll want to then start slowly loading it with weight using either a weight belt or holding a dumbbell between your feet on the other hand if you're currently unable to do pull-ups then band assisted pull-ups machine pull-ups and or sets of slow and negative pull-ups are decent alternatives to start with and progress until you're able to successfully complete bodyweight pull-ups next going back to the lower body we're going to be using line leg curls i'd suggest trying out this variation with a dumbbell held between your feet as it helps ensure that you're controlling the weight throughout each rep as shown here this exercise will mainly target the hamstrings again as you perform each rep you'll want to really focus on feeling the hamstrings working while avoiding any lower back involvement by keeping your abs engaged and the main reason why this exercise is included is to further strengthen the hamstrings which is crucial because as shown in this 2009 emg paper the back squat alone doesn't sufficiently activate the hamstrings and only reaches about 27 percent activation which is much lower than other common hamstring movements so since the hamstrings need to be balanced out with the quadriceps for injury prevention this exercise is vital to include more specifically though research has indicated that it's the eccentric strengthening of the hamstrings that's important for both enhancing athletic performance and preventing injury meaning that when performing this movement you want to really control the weight and use a slow eccentric of a few seconds on the way down of each rep just be aware that for many this will cause quite a bit of post-workout soreness so what i'd suggest is just take it easy in terms of load and progress from there the last major compound movement of this workout will be the standing barbell overhead press which is essential when it comes to upper body development and strength although the full body is involved the main muscles at play here will be the anterior deltoids triceps and the serratus anterior this exercise has been shown in studies like this one by bearings and buskies to be the best exercise for the anterior deltoid in addition when compared to other similar shoulder pressing exercises it enables you to lift the most weight and from a practical standpoint it's also the easiest shoulder exercise to overload with more weight as you progress which is why i'd recommend incorporating it into your routine however research does also indicate that the seated dumbbell press elicits similar activation so feel free to use that as an alternative if it's a more comfortable movement for you next we're going to move on to a couple accessory movements to help minimize any potential muscle imbalances as you progress the first accessory movement is going to be the face pull which is essential for shoulder health posture and balancing out the pulling repetitions with all the pressing in this workout the main muscles worked at the rear delts mid and lower traps and the various rotator cuff muscles as shown here these can be done kneeling or standing but regardless you want to keep the elbows high and drive them back as you pull the rope towards your face at the end position your shoulders should be externally rotated such that you're in a biceps flexing pose in order to best emphasize the rotator cuffs and rear delts i definitely suggest using relatively lighter weight for these and really focus on activating the right muscles the last exercise is going to be the drag curl due to the shoulder extension component of this exercise it's going to help preferentially target the long head of the biceps or the outer head which otherwise doesn't get as much attention with our previous exercise selection to perform it simply use a weighted bar or barbell and lift the bar as close as possible in front of your body by driving the elbows behind the body as you lift the bar and then you want to lower the weight in the same fashion i suggest using a much lighter weight than you would in a standard biceps curl and perfecting the movement before progressing so to sum the video up here is what your full body workout a could look like calves and or abs exercises can definitely be added as part of the accessory movements as well just keep in mind that if you're a beginner lifter then sticking to just the main compound movements and the low end of the range of sets per exercise would likely be best to start and then you can gradually add more volume over time also keep in mind that you can play around with the exercise order of the workout several studies have shown a trend where lifters get better gains for exercises that are done early on in a session so by knowing what each exercise in this workout targets you can rearrange the exercises based on what you want to prioritize for example if you wanted to focus on pull-up strength and back growth you could simply perform the pull-ups first rather than the bench press what's going on everyone now as mentioned in the beginning of this video i've compiled all of this information into an easy to follow completely free pdf for you to download and reference while you're at the gym so to get a copy of this all you have to do is follow this link which i've put in the description box down

    "title": "How To Get WIDER Shoulders (3 Training Mistakes You\u2019re Probably Making)",
    "published_at": "2019-04-07T16:13:22Z",
    "transcript": "[Music] wider broader looking shoulders are one of the most sought after bodily features that most men aim to achieve in fact multiple studies have found that women rate broad shoulders as one of the most attractive features in a male's physique and this is likely because wider shoulders not only accentuate a powerful looking upper body but also creates the appearance of a smaller waist as a result and although genetics will play some role in how wide your shoulders appear you can definitely add further width to them by targeting a specific portion of the shoulder the lateral deltoids given that the lateral deltoids comprise the middle portion of your shoulders adding more size to them will actually create the effect of wider looking shoulders however despite the importance of this muscle most people just don't train them as effectively as it could be and instead make several training mistakes that in turn limits the development of this muscle in this video i'll discuss exactly what those training mistakes are and more importantly how you can fix them so that you can get broader wider shoulders as quickly as possible the first mistake is not effectively varying the resistance curve in your shoulder training what i mean by this is that most people's go-to exercise to target the lateral deltoids are dumbbell lateral raises which is a good option since they've been consistently shown such as in this 2013 emg analysis by botanin colleagues to elicit the highest lateral deltoid activity when compared to other common shoulder exercises however although it may provide superior emg activation the downside with the dumbbell lateral raise has to do with its resistance curve you see with dumbbell lateral raises given the path of the weights and the force of gravity this exercise produces a high degree of tension on the side delts only in the top half of the motion whereas at the bottom portion of the movement there's very little tension placed on the shoulders so if you stuck to dumbbells exclusively then you wouldn't be maximizing the potential development of the side delt now cable lateral raises on the other hand help to solve this problem by providing more consistent tension on the side delts throughout the whole range of motion and this is simply because the resistance applied from the cable is out to the side rather than straight up and down as is the case with dumbbells which enables the side delt to remain highly active throughout the whole movement and is therefore another version of the lateral raise that you'll want to implement lateral raises with a resistance band also help accomplish this and can be used in the event that you don't have access to a cable and in addition to potentially make the resistance curve even better for the side delt you can slightly lean away towards the direction of the rays by hanging onto a pole with one hand as you perform the movement this idea is based on the findings of a paper by mcmahon and colleagues that found that the supraspinatus one of the rotator cuffs is most active during the beginning of the race whereas the side delt becomes more active from the mid to end range of the movement therefore by leaning away slightly you're able to effectively shift more of the tension to the delts and away from the supraspinatus and are just extra lateral raised variations for you to experiment with but going back to what i mentioned earlier to maximize your side delt development you want to ensure you're performing both dumbbell and cable lateral raises in your routine or at least cycling through them over time a good option for example is if you perform four sets of lateral raises in your workout then dedicate two to dumbbell lateral raises and two to cable lateral raises this way you'll be able to reap the benefits that both exercises have to offer [Music] another common mistake people make with the lateral raise is leading the movement with their hands and allowing them to raise up higher than the elbows this somewhat defeats the purpose of the exercise by shifting some of the tension away from the shoulders and more so onto the rotator cuffs since you're now actually performing more external rotation rather than the main function of the side delts shoulder abduction and in many cases it also shortens the range of motion of this exercise which is obviously detrimental for side delt development so to fix this you'll want to ensure that your hands are more or less in line with the elbows as you raise up rather than the hands being higher and leading the way during each rep you'll want to also mentally think about leading with the elbows as opposed to raising the weight with your hands by implementing these fixes you'll both increase the range of motion of this exercise and maximize side delt involvement by incorporating more shoulder abduction into the movement and a good way to enforce this if you're having trouble with it is to experiment with using kettlebells when you perform the lateral raise i find that mentally it's a lot easier to drive with the elbows when using kettlebells as opposed to dumbbells or cables and it's just another exercise you can definitely add into your shoulder training arsenal [Music] and lastly you want to ensure that you avoid letting your traps take over as you perform various shoulder exercises the upper traps are overactive in virtually everyone nowadays this is mainly due to posture or common activities that cause us to inadvertently shrug and this actually causes the traps to get tightened and take over when we perform shoulder exercises like the overhead press and the lateral raise this is detrimental since for the best activation of the side delts you want your shoulder girdle to remain depressed rather than elevated but luckily fixing this can be quite simple you simply want to keep your upper traps out of the movement by pulling your shoulders down and back before you perform the raise and then maintain this as you perform each rep by focusing on keeping the upper traps depressed as much as possible some helpful tips to reinforce this idea are to use a thumbless grip and think about pushing out during each rep rather than thinking about lifting the weight up but if you're still struggling with this then i'd suggest simply feeling your upper trap with one of your hands and then slowly raise the other arm out without any weight focus on keeping the shoulders down and avoid tensing your upper traps as you raise your arm once you master this you can then slowly add weight to practice and then eventually apply this to your working sets but properly implementing this you'll be able to shift most of the tension away from the traps and onto your side delts leading to better development and wider shoulders for you in the long run and that's pretty much it for the video to sum everything up for you here are the main points that you want to keep in mind although these little training tips may not seem like much they really are what's going to make all the difference in your workouts and enable you to build muscle that much faster and if you're looking for a step-by-step evidence-based program that applies this into each and every one of your workouts such that you can build muscle and lose fat as efficiently as possible so what you

    "title": "The Best Science-Based Forearm Workout for Size and Strength",
    "published_at": "2017-12-24T13:20:46Z",
    "transcript": "what's going on guys i'm back with another highly requested science based video to add to the series i just want to thank you guys for all the support you've shown me i really do appreciate it i just finished all my final exams and i now have my kinesiology degree so i'll have a lot more time to put out content on a more regular basis and i also just wanted to quickly thank skillshare for sponsoring this video those who don't know they are an online learning community for creators and the first 500 people to click the link in the description box down below will receive a free two-month trial to their platform but i'll talk more about this at the end of this video so for now enjoy the video guys [Music] forearms are like the calves of the arms you can have well-developed upper arms but if your forearms are lacking then it can take away from a balanced physique in addition the study from the journal of physical therapy found that hand grip strength is highly correlated with forearm size which is expected but just goes to show you that lagging forearms may create more problems than just aesthetics and may be the limiting factor in your lifts that require sufficient grip strength but in order to address how to properly train them we need to first understand their anatomy the forearm muscles are complex consisting of both superficial and deep muscles to simplify it the muscles on the anterior side of the forearm consist of the flexors of the forearm these muscles are mainly responsible for flexion of the fingers and wrists but also act to pronate the hand on the posterior side of the forearm are the extensors these muscles have the opposite function and are mainly responsible for extension of the fingers and wrists but also act to supinate the hand and both the flexors and extensors contribute to wrist abduction and abduction so in this video i'm going to show you guys a forearm workout optimized based on current scientific literature and our anatomical understanding of the forearm muscles this exercise is essential for hitting all the muscles of the forearm and improving your grip strength you simply hold the center of a bar with one hand and prevent it from tipping over on one side this requires involvement of the forearm abductors and adductors to stabilize the bar which is beneficial since these muscles usually aren't worked much otherwise to progress this exercise simply load it with more weight or try to increase the length of time for the holes you can also perform it while walking similar to the farmer's walk exercise for the added stabilization requirement however this is for the most part an isometric exercise and research has clearly shown dynamic exercises to be the better option for muscle growth so although this exercise will help with grip strength we need to also add in some dynamic movements for forearm hypertrophy this exercise is likely your best bet in terms of working and strengthening the flexors on the anterior side of the forearm as shown here simply hold a bar behind your back let the bar drop down to your fingertips by extending them and then bring the weight back up by curling your fingers and wrists upward this simultaneous finger and wrist flexion will enable a better contraction since both are important actions of the flexors of the forearm and to progress it simply use a heavier bar as you get stronger i prefer this over wrist curls on the bench as it requires less wrist flexibility and less stress on the wrist joint which can be concerned for those prone to wrist injuries i suggest supersetting the previous exercise with this exercise here standing wrist extensions which is a very similar exercise but will mainly work the extensors of the forearm to help balance them out with the flexors simply hold the bar with an overhand grip and extend your wrists upward and then back down to the neutral position feel free to use dumbbells instead but again i prefer this exercise standing as opposed to on the bench for the reasons previously mentioned this exercise is going to help target the brachioradialis which is a very prominent muscle of the forearm that contributes a lot to overall forearm size although its prominence in your forearm will partly depend on how low it inserts which is determined genetically this muscle can nonetheless still be targeted and grown by performing reverse curls this exercise targets of brachioradialis because of the pronated grip used which as shown in this study by nato at l increases the involvement of the brachioradialis and reduces that of the biceps since the biceps are now at a mechanical disadvantage with this grip in addition unlike other forearm muscles the brachioradialis doesn't cross over the wrist joint therefore it can't be trained with wrist flexion or extension alone so adding in a reverse curl movement that involves elbow flexion is essential in terms of forearm development this last exercise can be used as a finisher exercise and is added in here to induce more metabolic stress in the forearms which as we know based on several studies is one of the primary mechanisms for muscle growth simply grab a bar and rotate it forwards as fast as possible for 30 to 60 seconds and then rotate it backwards as fast as possible for 30 to 60 seconds this allows you to work both the flexors and extensors of the forearm in one set and you can use a heavier bar to progress the exercise as you get stronger and although you hear a lot of people say that forearm isolation training isn't needed given that you do a lot of barbell and dumbbell lifts this may be true for some but for others not so much however research does seem to support the addition of forearm specific training with one study showing that subjects performing additional forearm training with a lifting routine led to more forearm strength gains than resistance training alone although the study did show that resistance training still indirectly provides foreign strength gains the researchers concluded that adding in some foreign specific training as well provides even more benefit now as for how to integrate foreign training into your current workout routine i'd suggest the following add reverse curls into your current arm training so if you have an arm day or pull day place it in that day for the rest of the exercises perform a couple of them two to three times per week as research shows that this frequency tends to be the most optimal for forearm growth use lighter weights and higher reps for the wrist movements to avoid any initial wrist pain and you want to perform these exercises after your upper body workouts to avoid fatiguing your grip strength before you start your workout an example weekly workout may look something like this but keep in mind that in order to maximize forearm development try to stick to exercises that involve the use of a bar or dumbbells in your weightlifting routine as opposed to mainly sticking with machines as this will provide you with a lot of indirect forum growth in the long run thanks so much for watching guys i hope you enjoyed the video again just wanted to quickly thank skillshare for sponsoring this video as i mentioned earlier they are an online learning community for creators with over 17 000 different classes and pretty much anything ranging from videography illustrations photography and so much more premium membership begins at around 10 a month but as i said the first 500 people to click the link in the description

    "title": "Why Weighted Abs Training is a MUST (4 Best Weighted Abs Exercises)",
    "published_at": "2017-08-13T17:44:53Z",
    "transcript": "ah [Music] if you want a well-defined impressive looking six-pack yet you aren't incorporating weighted AB movements then you need to watch this video the majority of people approach ab training differently than they would muscles like the chest in the back they often throw in a little bit of body weight AB training after every workout and stick to exercises like flutter kicks for high reps and don't get me wrong these exercises have their place in ab training as I'll mention later on in this video but they don't provide the necessary overload needed to grow your 6-pack and make your abs pop out more if people still judge the effectiveness of an ab exercise based on the burn sensation that they get when they do the exercise so this burning sensation is pretty much meaningless for example stand with your back against the wall and bend your legs to 90 degrees and try to hold this position for as long as possible you're going to get an intense burning sensation but you probably don't think that this exercise is an effective exercise for building your quads and a much better exercise will be weighted barbell squats or any other weighted exercise and it's the exact same when it comes to AB training why should you train your abs differently than any other muscle you want to progressively overload your ab training and the best and easiest way to do this is with weights and once I started to incorporate weights into my training routine I definitely saw a difference and I saw that my abs were actually able to pop out more than they used to so in this video I'm gonna be showing you guys the four best weighted ab exercises and how you can incorporate them into an ab workout routine that you can use but keep in mind like getting down to a low enough body fat percentage to be able to see your abs in the first place is a month so you can do all the app training you want but it's not gonna help you if you have a layer of fat that's covering your abs before I get started with the exercises please support me by hitting that like button and you need that subscribe button they'll really help me out anyways let's get started with the exercises first exercise is hanging leg raises with a dumbbell between your feet which is a great exercise for targeting your transversus abdominus while putting more emphasis on the lower portion of your abs simply hang on a pull-up bar or any elevated bar grab the dumbbell between your feet or have someone place it there for you and try to bring your legs up to about 90 degrees while keeping them straight and without swinging your body this is quite a difficult movement if you've never done it or but luckily there are progressions to help you master this exercise over time to start you can do captain's chair leg raises with bent legs and then once you can do that for around fifteen reps straight you can move on to doing it with straight legs and once you can do that for fifteen reps you can move on to adding weight using a dumbbell between your feet then once you feel comfortable you can try out hanging leg raises and gradually add weight to this exercise you want to gradually increase the weight you use or the reps you perform over time in order to continuously strengthen your abs second exercise is ab pull downs which is a great exercise that once again targets your whole transversus abdominus but emphasizes more of your upper abs so you want to kneel one to two feet in front of the cable system and after selecting an appropriate weight hold the handle with both hands and keep your forearms around your neck then by using your abs you want to try and bring your elbows down towards your knees until your head just about touches the floor and repeat this movement at the top position you want your back to be straight or a slightly arch to fully stretch the ABS before you can track them you can also do these with twists to the side as you come down like so which will hit your oblique muscles as well the third exercise is something called cable woodchoppers which are a great way to exercise your obliques and it helps with that feline you want to focus on pulling the handle across and down your body by using your obliques keep your hips facing straight and don't let them rotate to ensure that you're using your obliques to move the weight and the final exercise is weighted oblique twist which has a name hence will target your obliques you can hold a dumbbell weight ball or pretty much any object that adds weight to the movement simply lay on the ground raise your leg slightly in the air while keeping your back up and repeatedly move the weight to each side of your body by using your obliques if this is too difficult for you then you can keep your feet planted on the ground and do this instead now for the best results what you want to do is combine these weighted exercises with bodyweight ab exercises which can be used to train your abs to failure for weighted exercises you want to stick between 6 to 15 reps and for bodyweight movements you can do as many reps as possible and just go to failure I prefer doing my ab sizes in a circuit routine to save time here's an example of a workout you can use exercise one weighted hanging leg raises for 6 to 15 reps exercise 2 ab pull downs for 6 to 15 reps exercise 3 cable woodchoppers for 6 to 15 reps and exercise for flutter kicks until failure so basically you just go through all four exercises consecutively and then you take a minute or two to rest and repeat the circuit again four more times for the best results you want to train your abs with a workout like this two to three times per week which can easily be fit in at the end of other workouts and that's basically it I hope this video is clear and concise and helps you guys out if you have any questions let me know in the comments below and please don't forget to support me by giving the video a like subscribe you to my channel and checking out some of my other videos thanks and I'll see you next time"

    "title": "How To Get Stronger AND Bigger Muscles (4 Things To Avoid)",
    "published_at": "2021-06-27T15:20:17Z",
    "transcript": "some people's muscles tend to get stronger over time but not bigger there's several possible causes for this by the end of this video you'll have four ways that when all applied together will prevent this from happening to you your training being more geared towards improving your strength rather than size might be a reason your gains are lacking your muscles are made up of several of what are called motor units to maximize the muscle growth you get from an exercise you need to make sure that you're activating all of the motor units in the muscle that you're working now this doesn't happen until the last five or so reps in the set where you're pushing really hard this is why these wraps are typically called effective reps this means that when using lighter weight the first several reps that you perform are not as effective for growth with the last several reps providing the most gains on the other hand when using a really heavy weight you're actually able to fully activate the muscle much earlier on because it needs all the help that it can get to lift that heavy weight but as a result you're not able to do as many reps in this case you're not exposing the muscle to enough of these effective reps to maximize growth illustrating this effect was a 2016 study where participants performed all of their exercises in a workout with either low reps with heavy weight or more reps with a lighter weight after training for eight weeks the group training with higher reps and lighter weight experienced almost twice as much overall growth despite the heavier weight group beating them in terms of strength gains a result that's been backed up by other studies as well so an easy way to apply this is to simply do more reps with a slightly higher rep range and less sets of very heavy low rep training your strength gains may slow down as a result but your muscle gains will benefit considerably it's all about picking and choosing what you'd like to prioritize and training accordingly the next cause is artificial strength gains this is where on paper you may be lifting heavier weights but in reality you're actually cheating to get there you're incorporating more momentum you're using less range of motion you're performing your reps faster and recruiting other muscles to help you out and believe me it can be very difficult to catch yourself doing this for example in week one you do a set of a dumbbell press with 45 pounds using a full range of motion in week two you decide to bump it up to 50 pounds can you spot the three major differences i perform the rep slightly faster i'm stopping about an inch shorter at the bottom and lastly i'm bending my forearms inward slightly to reduce the moment arm and to recruit more of my triceps to help out although it may enable you to look slightly heavier it comes at the cost of less gains so whenever you decide to add more weight to an exercise pay very close attention to how you perform the exercise with the new weight and ensure that every little detail in your execution remains the same otherwise the only thing that you're going to be growing is your ego when you first do a new exercise you'll get stronger rapidly this is not because your muscles got a lot bigger but it's because your brain's ability to activate that muscle during the exercise has improved this is what we call neurological adaptations which typically lasts about eight to twelve weeks but the good news is after you've maxed these adaptations out further increases in strength are mostly because of increase in muscle size this is one of the reasons why it's so important to stay consistent with your exercises week after week the more frequently you're changing exercises the more you'll have to repeat this neurological adaptation phase and the harder it becomes to actually experience gains from that exercise so if you've only been in the gym for a few weeks or have recently reintroduced a new exercise into your regimen then this is a likely explanation for why you're experiencing a ton of strength gains with not much muscle to show for it in this case the most important thing is to not give up your gains are just around the corner the final cause is very common but the easiest to fix you're not eating enough i was guilty of this when i first started training and really struggled to see noticeable growth it's important to eat enough because muscle growth requires having enough energy available illustrating this is a 2011 study that had well-trained participants reduce their daily calorie intake by 30 while continuing to work out after six weeks despite working out these participants did not gain any muscle they were effectively wasting their time from a muscle gains point of view but interestingly enough they were still able to increase their strength now although in certain scenarios you definitely can build muscle while in a calorie deficit being in a calorie surplus does appear to optimize the muscle building process and seems to become more and more important as an individual becomes more trained meaning that when it comes down to it many of you watching simply just need to eat more but this doesn't mean simply adding an extra thousand calories to your daily intake because that's going to lead to a ton of fat gain instead of muscle instead a good recommendation if you haven't been gaining weight and increasing in size is to take your current calorie intake and increase it by around 10 to 20 percent this small bump should help to provide you with the additional energy needed to maximize the muscle building process while also limiting excess fat gain implement what i went through in this video and you'll visually start seeing the results that you're after and for a step-by-step program that takes care of all of the guesswork for you then simply head on over to buildwithscience.com take our free analysis quiz and we'll show you exactly what approach will best

    "published_at": "2018-08-23T16:26:24Z",
    "transcript": "what's up everyone before I get into the video I just wanted to really quickly announce that my online programs have finally launched and are now available on my website built with science com which I'll link in the description box down below long story short if you love my science-based YouTube videos and articles then I'm confident that you're going to love my programs and for reasons I'll discuss at the end of this video these programs will only be available for one week started today and signups will close by the end of the 30th and won't reopen again until a few weeks later so if you're interested make sure you listen to what I have to say at the end of this video anyway it's on to today's video so a little while ago I posted on my Instagram asking for YouTube topics to cover and by far the most requested topic was for me to talk about my current routine so that's exactly what I'm going to do I'll cover what my training diet and cardio currently looks like and why and I'll provide you with some recommendations on how you can implement what I do into your routine now just for your reference I'm pretty much at the end of my 12-week cut so my routine right now is still geared towards fat loss but as you'll see a lot of the same concepts apply to gaining weight and building muscle as well so I'll start with training my current training split is as follows I'm running a 5 day per week protocol consisting of a push-pull legs and upper lower workout so the following muscle groups are trained within each workout and are heavily based on a lot of science-based exercises that I show on my channel I do change the split up periodically but at the moment this is what it is now I currently use a split for three main reasons one each muscle is trained at a two times per week training frequency we know based on this 20 18 minute analysis on the topic this seems to be optimal and superior to training each muscle just one time per week to maximize growth so by using the split you can see how every muscle group is hit at this two times per week training for you conceived 225 days a week helps keep my workouts from being too long as discussed in my video with researcher Brad Schoenfeld so progress ultimately you will need to gradually increase volume over time as you gain more training experience and since I have a fair amount of training experience and do need a decent amount of volume to see continued growth it's a lot more realistic for me to split that across five training days as opposed to just three for example and three it enables me to focus on other important aspects of my training since my workouts aren't excessively long and I'm not training every day of the week I'm able to dedicate more time to both my ABS routine and my mobility and prehab exercises which are each done a couple times a week and these prehab exercises are mainly used to strengthen my rotator cuffs lower traps and a few other muscles that tend to become underdeveloped over time a lot of people neglect these other aspects of training but trust me guys it's these little things and exercises that's really what's helped me stay injury-free throughout my years of training now I don't want you to automatically assume that this is the optimal split and that you should change yours based on what I'm currently doing because you shouldn't when it comes to the best workout split and how often to train which I will be making a future video on it depends on several factors but long story short study after study shows that it's total weekly volume that's most important therefore how many days a week you choose to split up that training volume ultimately depends on your training experience personal preference and a few other factors that I will cover in another video so from my nutrition what I usually do is I just stick to somewhat similar meals every day which are more or less variations the meals shown in my diet for fat loss video which just makes everything simple and easy to stay consistent with and given that I'm currently eating at a calorie deficit and focused more so on fat loss I also utilize intermittent fasting four to five times a week since I personally enjoy eating three to four larger meals as opposed to five to six smaller meals throughout the day so on a typical day of fasting in my day would look something like the following black coffee green tea and or sparkling water in the morning that my first big meal at noon followed by a workout followed by another big meal after my workout and then another one to two meals before a p.m. now in terms of how many calories I eat and the macros I eat at those of you who follow me on Instagram probably already know that I've been relying on and using my own built with science nutrition software that I had the Bell which just provides you with calorie and macronutrient recommendations based on your personal data and your goal and these recommendations then actually adjust over time based on how your weight is changing to provide you with a very accurate value of how much you actually need to eat at to consistently hit your weight gain or weight loss goal so as you can see my maintenance or tdee calories right now is right around 2800 calories which means I have to eat at roughly 2300 calories to lose around a pound a week which is more or less my goal at the moment now this software is only available in the programs that launched today but a really easy way to get a rough estimate of what you have to eat at is to one use a recommendation of researcher Lyle McDonald and simply multiply your body weight and pounds by 15 it gives you a rough estimate of your maintenance calories which can then increase or decrease depending on if you want to gain weight or lose weight and the two using the recommendations of the most recent protein meta-analysis you want to intake roughly one gram per pound of protein when dieting and around 0.8 grams per pound of protein if you're trying to add size and finally three simply fill the rest of your calories with carbs and fat and then throughout the week's track your weight and increase or decrease your calories based on if your weight is progressing at the appropriate rate which is exactly what I personally used to do before I had my nutrition software I developed as for my cardio routine right now my main goal is just to use it to speed up the fat loss process especially since for the last little while I've been sedentary since I've just been focusing on creating my programs I personally find that using the Stairmaster is the easiest form of moderate intensity cardio for me to burn the most calories in the shortest period of time so I mainly stick with that for example right now I'll do four to five sessions per week ranging from 15 to 30 minutes depending on whether I worked out or not and other than that I'll also do one hit cycling session per week on a rest day and just try to get in some walking whenever possible but as I said before cardio is just a tool I use to help me burn more calories so stick to what you enjoy and what we'll be most consistent with and if you confuse it all as how to approach your cardio routine to lose fat but highly suggest watching my recent cardio video which should clear everything out for you that's pretty much it guys I hope you were able to take away something useful from this video let me know if you have any specific questions about what I do in the comments below and I'll do my best to reply to them now as mentioned in the beginning of my video after 10 tireless months of testing tweaking and perfecting my online programs are now live and I'm really excited about them so just a quick rundown there's four programs in total the beginner build and beginner shred programs and the intermediate build and intermediate shredded programs as you guys probably expected each are heavily backed by science with over 95 scientific references in each of them and they're all designed to take you from your starting point to the end goal of achieving a lean powerful looking physique through proven evidence-based methods just so you know I can trust that you're maximizing your efforts in the gym and with your diet so to determine which one is right for you you can simply take the quiz on my home page built with science comm which will guide you in the right direction now the main program itself is run on something called teachable where there will be sections on training nutrition mind muscle connection additional routines like abs prehab and mobility in depth video tutorials as well as downloadable mobile-friendly PDFs of your main routines basically everything you need to ensure that you progress as quickly and as safely as possible you'll also get the nutrition software that I mentioned this video as well now as I said earlier these programs are only going to be open for one week I'm going to temporarily close them by the end of the 30th and then reopen them a few weeks later and the reason I'm doing this is because I want to personally help and guide the first group that comes through to ensure they fully understand everything and to help them throughout the weeks so if you're interested just make sure you get in on the first round before it closes thank you so much in advance everyone I can't wait for you guys to see what's included but that's it for today everyone I hope you enjoyed this video please don't forget to support me by giving it a

    "transcript": "[Music] alrighty welcome to another video guys i have something really exciting today we're gonna show you the perfect breakfast concoction to burn off that stubborn belly fat all right all you're gonna need is quite a bit of apple cider vinegar we're going to use about 17 drops of lime juice 14 15 16 17. and then we're going to use a heaping tablespoon of cayenne pepper in this this is key there you have it you're gonna mix it all up and i know what you're thinking jeremy this is gonna taste disgusting and you know what it is going to but it's all gonna be worth it to lose those stubborn belly fat and those love hats who the are you and what are you doing on my bill with science set or what what is that nasty trick dude you and your bro signs you need to leave right now already guys that was a close one but just trust me it's a real jeremy here now and today i want to share some much better breakfast ideas and ones that'll actually aid you in your quest to burn off that stubborn fat now breakfast itself has gone from being the most important meal of the day to now not even necessary with the rise in popularity of various eating styles like intermittent fasting how do you know which approach to take well the truth is that this ultimately depends on what approach you find easiest for you to use to adhere to your calories for the remainder of the day with with that being said though choosing to include a breakfast with the right composition of protein fats and carbs it does for some seem to have potential indirect fat loss benefits by providing greater satiety and reducing cravings throughout the day especially if you do habitually include breakfast as part of your daily regimen in addition not only is it now well accepted by most that skipping breakfast can lead to decrements and performance if you're trained in the morning one recent 2020 study showed how it may still negatively affect performance in the evening within the study they had two groups of elite athletes eat the same amount of calories and macros before their evening cycling workout the only difference was the distribution of these calories and macros with one group skipping breakfast and the other group including it and what they found was that the breakfast skippers experienced a small but still significant negative effect on their power output and also reported that their workout in general especially in the beginning just felt harder than normal now although this wasn't a resistance training workout and was done on a group of habitual breakfast eaters it does highlight the potential importance of consuming a well composed first meal earlier in the day in order to maximize performance regardless of when your workout is especially if you're currently used to doing that already but regardless of when exactly you choose to eat your breakfast or if you choose to include it at all what seems to be most important is that your first meal of the day contains an adequate amount of protein to keep you full an adequate amount of the right types of carbs based on your workout timing all while best catering to your lifestyle so what i'm going to do in this video is i'm going to run through three quick healthy and easy breakfast ideas and go through what scenarios each of these meals are ideal for and what i'm also going to do is i'm going to show you just the base recipe for each of these meals and then show you the different ways that you can add to it so that you can customize it based on your taste preferences and target calories and macros for the day think of it like buying a base model car and then adding whatever bells of whistles you want to depending on your budget so this first recipe is one that i've recently been loving because of how quick and easy it is to make the fast digesting carbs and protein and the minimal fat and fiber content in this meal makes it the ideal choice if you train early in the morning and just need something quick and easy and not too filling shortly before your workout to help enhance your performance and recovery and because of its fast digestion properties it's also a great post workout meal option if you do choose to train faster during your morning workout now if you've never tried protein coffee i know it may sound weird but just trust me on this it tastes amazing and it eliminates the need for any cream or sweetener but to end up with a smooth consistency like this instead of the clumpy consistency that you usually get when you mix hot liquid with protein powder then pay attention to the following details first add a scoop of whey protein into a cup whey isolate is your best bet here to prevent any clumping and as for flavor i personally use french vanilla and it pairs perfectly with coffee then what you want to do is just add two tablespoons of cold water to the cup and mix with the spoon until the protein fully dissolves into a thick paste this step is key for that smooth consistency once that's done slowly pour in a cup or two of black coffee while stirring simultaneously and continue stirring until no clubs are present now as for your carbs we'll use a base recipe of three rice cakes topped with one sliced banana and a dash of cinnamon if you want some added flavor and texture then feel free to add one to two servings of peanut butter or a powdered peanut butter like pb2 as a spread on the rice cakes [Music] the next recipe is something that's been getting quite a bit of tension lately and is the perfect option for high protein low carb breakfast for those who want to save more carbs for later on in the day and aren't going to be training immediately after it's basically an egg omelet but made into a tasty wrap so for the base recipe all you're going to need are three whole eggs and a handful of spinach blend these together with some salt and pepper and then cook on low to medium heat on a non-stick pan until fully cooked through then what you choose to top this with is totally up to you but just do so in each of the four sections shown here i personally add a serving of either cheese or avocado some seared mushrooms and peppers and a small amount of baked chicken breasts to bump up the protein count once you've got your toppings down cut a little slit down from the middle of the wrap and then simply fold each side like so to create an easy to eat wrap and if you want to make this meal lower in fat you can easily swap the three whole eggs for roughly three fourths a cup of egg whites instead or just use a combination of both [Music] the last recipe we have is a great option if you'd like to prep your breakfast for multiple days in advance as it can be easily stored in the fridge and will be ready to eat whenever [Music] given the slow digestion properties of this meal it makes it the ideal choice if you're going to be working out a couple hours after this meal or just later on in the day you'll also notice that this recipe is relatively higher in calories than our previous recipes which makes it a good option to front load your calories with a method where you actually eat a good portion of your daily calories in your first meal some research has shown that this is beneficial on reducing your hunger and cravings while increasing your overall energy levels throughout the day and hence may better enable you to adhere to your diet and burn more calories through activity in fact in a longitudinal weight loss study they actually found that subjects who use this front loading approach lost more weight and reduce their weight size to a greater degree while reporting greater hunger control over a period of 12 weeks this will vary individually though but i do recommend experimenting with it and this recipe is the perfect way to do so all you're going to do is you're going to grab a mason jar or tupperware if you don't have any jars and stuff it with all the following ingredients to make our base recipe two-thirds a cup of dry oats one scoop of protein powder flavor of your choice i'm going to be using chocolate here one teaspoon of chia seeds 50 grams of plain greek yogurt splash of vanilla extract a quarter cup of stevia or tablespoon of honey for some extra sweetness and half a cup of cashew milk or any milk of your choice now if or what you choose to add from here is totally up to you what i personally like to add is one serving of peanut butter half a diced apple half a sliced banana and a small handful of almonds mix it all up store them in the fridge and it'll be ready to eat in a few hours making it a great way to quickly prep your breakfast for the whole week [Music] and there you have it for your convenience i've also compiled these recipes into a breakfast recipe book with ingredients lists and step-by-step instructions for each of the recipes shown to download it you can just head on over to buildwithscience.com forward slash breakfast pdf and we'll send it right over to you now just also keep in mind that this is just one meal for your whole day and it's your whole day's worth of calories that will govern whether you lose fat or not so experiment with these meals and use the ones that will best cater to you and your lifestyle and best enable you to adhere to your calorie deficit for the rest of the day as that is what's key to losing that stubborn fat over time now for a step-by-step program that shows you not only how to train but also comes with a nutrition software designed to show you exactly how much to eat week after

    "title": "2 \u201cMust-Do\u201d Exercises For A Massive Chest (Based On Science)",
    "published_at": "2020-12-13T16:00:03Z",
    "transcript": "chest is one of the most enjoyable muscle groups to train yet at the same time it seems to be a muscle group that many people struggle with developing this then often leads them to throw every single possible chest exercise at it in hopes that it'll grow but the truth is this often does more harm than good today i'll show you how you can get the most bang for your buck in terms of chest gains by instead just focusing on two very simple yet effective exercises that when paired together can make a big difference in your chest development the first exercise is the low incline dumbbell press pressing movements for the chest are necessary because it enables us to apply a high amount of tension to our chest over time since we can both lift heavier loads with it and easily progress over time with more weight but dumbbell prices in particular have advantages over barbell presses since it allows us to achieve a greater range of motion on our chest fibers while also enabling us to have more freedom with our elbow and wrist positioning as we press this gives us the freedom to tweak our form to better suit with our individual chest fibers and with what just feels most comfortable on our joints now a low incline press is chosen here for a couple reasons the first reason is that we want to ensure that we're adequately training each portion of our chest the upper middle and lower fibers and what we typically see with chest development in general is a lagging upper chest commonly due to a high amount of flat pressing done relative to the amount of incline pressing in fact a recent 2020 paper had subjects perform only the flat bench over the course of eight weeks the middle and lower portions of the chest grew considerably faster than the upper portion of the result however at the same time this does not mean that we want to perform a typical incline press because research has shown that even an incline up to just 30 degrees so typically just two notches up from the bottom of a flat bench results in greater upper chest activation but comes with the cost of significantly greater front delt activation and significantly less mid and lower chest activation when compared to a flat press with an incline up to 45 degrees now proving to be even worse whereas with the low incline up to just 15 degrees you still get a significant boost in upper chest activation but with less of an increase in front delts involvement and with less of a drop in activation from the middle and lower portions of your chest and i'd even argue that when you then apply a slight arch in the upper back and tuck the elbows in slightly as you perform this movement you'll now be aligning the resistance with even more of your chest fibers and experience even greater activation of your whole chest but going beyond chest activation growth the second reason why this exercise is beneficial is comfort this is because with the flat dumbbell press at the bottom position your shoulder tends to be put in an internally rotated position which can become problematic or uncomfortable on your shoulders especially if you lack sufficient shoulder mobility but by adding a slight incline your shoulders will be now placed in a slightly externally rotated position which for many is just a much more comfortable pressing position for the shoulder to be in now this isn't to say that flat dumbbell pressing is bad and should be avoided but it's just another unique benefit of the low incline press and is why i highly recommend that you include it in your routine and if you currently only have access to a flat bench or you want to try out an even lower incline than 15 degrees then simply add in one or two weight plates under your flat bench is a great alternative and will provide the slight bit of incline that we're looking for the next exercise is going to be any sort of cable or banded movement like a seated cable fly or if you don't have access to cables then banded push-ups ups or banded flats now the reason for this movement has to do with the strength curve of our previous exercise during a dumbbell press our chest experiences the greatest amount of tension at the bottom stretch position but as you press the weight up the resistance progressively decreases until you reach the top position where the chest now receives very little stimulation and what we know about muscle growth is that exercises with different strength ribs will likely produce different amounts of muscle growth in each region of our muscle in fact as illustrated in a 2015 paper by simply altering the strength curve of a knee extension subjects not only experience different amounts of muscle growth in each of the various muscles of the quadriceps but they also experience different amounts of growth within the specific regions of each muscle which implies that if we stuck only with the dumbbell press or if we added in other chest exercises that have a similar strength curve like the dumbbell fly for example then we'd be failing to adequately train and stimulate our chest in a locked out position this would mean that some muscle fibers of our chest would remain under-stimulated and hence could cause us to miss out on some additional chest gains the cable fly accommodates for this by providing adequate tension on the chest throughout the whole range of motion especially during the fully contracted position similarly if you don't have cables the banded push-up or banded fly is a suitable alternative since the resistance applied to your chest will be lowest at the bottom position but then progressively increase as you lock out and reach the chest's fully contracted position by combining these two movements and their respective strength curves you'll ensure that you don't miss out on any potential chest gains now what you choose to do with these two exercises is totally up to you i would definitely recommend plopping them somewhere into your current chest routine as you see fit for the reasons that i previously went through and if you're currently doing a ton of different exercises and volume for your chest yet you're not making any progress then simply shifting more of that volume and effort to these two movements instead while focusing on performing them with proper form and progressing them over time will do wonders for your chest development oftentimes more is just not better and for a step-by-step program that uses science to show you exactly how to train and how to feel your body week after week so that you can

    "title": "We Tested 17 Back Exercises, These Are Best For Growth",
    "published_at": "2022-12-11T14:00:13Z",
    "transcript": "the back is such an important part of what makes an impressive physique but with literally hundreds of different back exercises out there it's hard to tell which you should do this is why I got Betty a muscle activation measuring machine today we're using her to test the most popular back exercises on four different people to find which exercises might be best for you at the end we'll use the results to create a perfect back workout you can trust will get you the muscular powerful looking back your Raptor before we get to testing let me explain what we'll be testing so the back isn't just one muscle and different back exercises will Target different back muscles the slight problem however is that Betty the muscle activation machine I mentioned earlier only has four sensors so we first have to figure out what back muscles are worth putting sensors on to measure in the first place after talking with a few of our researchers and coaches here's what we decided the two main features of a well-developed back are thickness and width most thickness comes from the mid and upper back muscles to represent this area we put a sensor on the mid traps but we also put a sensor on an extremely important muscle right below the mid traps the lower traps you'll learn why we did this later on now the main muscle responsible for widening your back and building your V taper is the lats this is the largest muscle of the upper body because it's so large we're putting two sensors on it one on the upper lats and one on the lower lats after testing we're going to see which exercises come out on top for these two areas but I'll also run an extra analysis that determines what exercises might be best as overall back Builders as well next subjects in our past chest and shoulder experiments we use three subjects myself and Coach Alex the more experienced lifters and Raza are operations manager who although is learning quite a bit throughout the series is still a beginner this time although it would add even more work I wanted a female subject as well because they tend to be underrepresented in Fitness research and the more subjects the more reliable the data so we recruited Tommy yeah the love of my life who was out last experiment because of a shoulder injury luckily she was open to it but to show her some love comment below thanks Tawny as I'm sure she'll appreciate it it'll be interesting to see how the results compare between the different types of subjects as for the wager after last week and the Damage it caused yo we decided to take a break to give everyone a well-deserved rest plus it was costing us way too much to send Raza to trauma therapy after recruiting it was time to prep the experiment there's three variables you had to control for first the more challenging an exercise is the more muscle fibers you use and the higher activation better will read to try to control for this a few days before testing we all spent a day in our gym to figure out how much weight we'd use on each exercise to make them equally as challenging and flex your back what like this oh yeah the goal was to find the ideal weight that if we did five reps with we'd only be able to do three more before we reached complete failure but something unexpected happened I'm gonna lie this Hit me hard I've lifted with these wrist traps for years since the beginning of my journey so these are my lucky wrist straps we are cutting it close here and no matter how close they were to Breaking they never let me down I may have been smiling but on the inside I was crying but I'm taking it as a sign that I've reached new limits and I'm ready to move on from the old rest in peace buddy if you're going to happen to be used by ziz and many other gym gods next sensor placement as some of you know from our last experiments we need smooth hairless skin so the sensors stick and can read well usually Raz is the only one who needs a good waxing but to my disappointment there is only a small patch of hair on his lats that needed removing finally before testing there's one last variable we need to control some people may be able to activate their back better than others this is why we need a measurement known as MVC or maximum voluntary contraction push push push push come on let's go harder basically for each subject we need to figure out the maximum activation our back muscles can reach by gathering this before we start testing we're able to then accurately compare the exercises we do against each of our own maximum values to see how well they work for our individual back muscles foreign experiment we used an ultra heavy bench press for back however we had to get a little creative with all that done we're ready to test we're sticking to a similar design as our past experiments by doing one set of five reps and then taking at least a five minute rest before moving to the next exercise we also rotated between horizontal and vertical pulling exercises to avoid overly fatiguing the same muscles all right guys I have all the data I'm going to spend the weekend processing it with some of our researchers so far we've tested chest we've tested shoulders and now we've tested back but we're testing glutes next and we want to give you the opportunity to vote on what exercises you think will make it on top all entries get a discount code for a build science fitness programs and anyone who guesses at least five out of the six correct you get a free built with science program you can vote over at builderscience.com vote I'll also leave a link in the description box down below good luck okay so before we dive into the winners just keep in mind that Betty and EMG research in general has its limitations there's many instances where more activation does not lead to more growth and there's many other variables to consider when trying to determine how well an exercise is a building muscle this is especially true for back where you have to be extra careful about correlating activation with growth that said after averaging the data across the four of us I did find some very interesting insights that aligns with other research out there let's first talk about overall back Builders these are exercises that consistently across all four subjects show very high activation in all the muscles that we measured there's two exercises that came out on top the first one actually came as a bit of a surprise to me in fact most of you guys voted this exercise to come in almost dead last for the various muscles we tested what is it deadlifts now I always knew these worked back to an extent but I wasn't expecting to see such high activation in every single muscle but it makes sense your legs are mostly responsible for moving the weight but all of your upper and lower back muscles have to work hard to keep your body stable as you lift now although they aren't taken through their full range of motion and are only contractednessymetrically this is still a stimulus for growth especially because of a heavy weight used and the Deep stretch that some of these back muscles experience and even though Alex and I use relatively heavy weight during our measurements Tawny used much lighter weight and an elevated platform and still experience very high activation across the board the same was true for Raza who was still just learning how to properly do them okay so before I reveal the second winner I'm curious do you do deadlifts on your back days or leg days personally I do them on leg days or in a separate day altogether but I might consider throwing them in with my back train but comment below and let me know what you prefer now the second exercise is a classic bent over rows similar to the deadline lifts you're able to load it relatively heavy and your whole back including the lower back is helping you stabilize and move the weight now we tested this exercise with an overhand versus underhand grip the overhand grip led to more mid-back activation whereas the underhand grip likely because the elbows could remain tucked close to the sides let the slightly more latch activation primarily in the lower lats which is good to know depending on what area you want to focus on the most that said although these two exercises as well as the t-bar row another big exercise we tested that performed well overall are efficient ways to work a lot of your back muscles at once they do come with a cost they're very fatiguing and demand a lot from your lower back muscles especially as you get more experience and can lift heavier weights they also don't work certain back muscles as well as other exercises do this is where some of the next exercises we measured come in handy let's first talk about the mid and upper back only five percent of you successfully guess the exercise that came out on top the inverted row but when I took a deeper look into the individual data I noticed something interesting it led to the highest back activation for both Tony and Raza but didn't do nearly as well for both myself and Alex even after adjusting the setup to make it a bit more difficult so while it is a great bodyweight exercise that I'd highly recommend for most females and beginners as you get more experience you'll want to consider other movements that you can start adding weight to or save this exercise for the tail end of your workout when your back is already quite fatigued as for the other exercises that came out on top generally research suggests that rows with the elbows can be kept angled out wide are best at targeting the mid and upper back I was impressed to see most of you guys predicted the same based on your voting but what did we actually find well wide grip seated cable rows and dumbbell chest supported rows with the elbows flared out and shoulder blades squeezed together at the end both led to the highest activation after the inverted row and although we didn't test a chest supported machine row I'd expect to see the same thing as long as you use a relatively wider grip and keep your elbows angled up before we dive into the lats I want to talk about the lower traps although not on anybody's list of top 5 sexiest muscles it's an extremely important yet often overlooked muscle for overall shoulder health and posture so important that I'd recommend including at least one exercise in your routine that really focuses on this muscle and the one that came out on top during our experiment doesn't even require any weight incline prone y raises after we go through the Lots I'll explain how exactly at Gobo added this into your back routine last but not least the lats generally vertical pulling movements are best to hit this region so it's no surprise all you muscle nerds voted for lap pull downs and pull-ups to come out on top but while these exercises did a pretty good job of activating the lats one move in particular led to higher activation than any of those exercises the lat Focus row this is something I first got from coach casim with N1 training although it looks like a row it's very similar to a pull down because of the way you position Your Body by leaning forward slightly and keeping the elbows tucked close to the sides it puts the lats in a better position with proper coaching this exercise did very well even for tawny and Raza who had never tried this move before so it's a great move regardless of your experience to put a little bit more focus on the lats now let's put everything we learned into a back workout that you can start using right away I'd recommend picking one exercise from each of the categories we went through and then adding in prone y raises to the end to give the lower trap some extra love I've also created a completely free downloadable workout PDF that puts us all together for you complete with sets reps and instructions for each exercise you can download this over at builtwithscience.com back workout honestly after testing chest shoulders and now back it's helped me realize that training doesn't have to be crazy complicated the best exercises tend to be the most basic get these basic exercises have stood the test of time for a reason and help build many incredibly impressive physiques over the years so rather than trying to seek the next best exercise I urge you to stick to the basics and focus on consistency proper form and training hard as that's where truly most of your games will be made and for step-by-step science-based program that takes care of all the guesswork for you and shows you how to train and how to eat week after week to help you build the body you deserve just head over to build science.com and take our analysis quiz to find the

    "title": "4 ARM DAY Mistakes I Wish I Fixed Earlier (SLOWING Your Gains!)",
    "published_at": "2019-10-06T15:41:17Z",
    "transcript": "what's up everyone and Jeremy here and today I want to share with you four of the biggest armed end mistakes that I see people make all the time which really are killing the gains that they could be making and in fact back in the day as you can see here when my arms have literally no chance whatsoever of filling up my sleeves these were the exact mistakes that I was personally making and really do wish that I fixed earlier because it just would have helped me speed up my arm growth to where they're right now but to prevent you from doing the same in this video I'll go through each of these mistakes and I'll show you what to do instead so you can apply it right away to your next arm day or just your arm training in general so the first mistake is just not burying your arm angles enough when you train them for example like what a lot of other people do is back in the day pretty much all of my biceps exercises were some form of variation of curls where my elbows were held by my sides and for triceps it was mostly a mix of some form of triceps extensions again with the elbows just by my size but which you have to realize and something I've explained in my past videos is that the biceps and the triceps are composed of multiple heads which can each be selectively emphasized based on how you orient your arm angle when you train them so by incorporating exercises that mix up your arm angles during your arm day you'll be better able to activate and develop the biceps and triceps as a whole as you'll be ensuring that each head gets their required attention I just a further back up this point a recent 2019 paper actually compared performing a biceps workout with all nine sets done with a traditional biceps curl with the elbows by the size versus a biceps workout where three sets of the curls were done at the three different arm angle shown here with all other work of variables held identical and what they found was that the varied arm angle group was able to achieve the same amount of volume as a control group but their biceps experienced significantly higher overall activation from the session and although it wasn't tested here this increase in worker activation of the biceps would likely lead to faster growth over time so to apply this what I recommend is for your next arm day or just for your arm routine in general for your biceps you want to pick one curl where your elbows are held behind your body one curl where your elbows held by your sides and then one curl where your elbows are held in front of your body and then for your triceps similarly you want to pick one exercise where get all boughs are held overhead one exercise where your opals are held by your sides and then one pressing movement for example so by structuring your exercises this way you're gonna be able to hear our muscles a lot more effectively and it just ensures that each head is emphasised appropriately so the next arm day mistake that's killing your gains has to do with your exercise order and what most people do and what I used to do as well is I do all my biceps exercises first and then I'd follow up with my triceps exercises after but given that research has consistently shown that lifters get better gains and the muscles that are trained early on in their workout we can see how this can become a problem over time and that's exactly what happened to me my biceps really started to overpower my triceps in comparison simply because I put all my effort into the biceps training in the beginning of the workout and then I start to slack a little on the triceps training and since it be a little more fatigue which was obviously detrimental for my arm growth given that the trisys make up such a big portion of the arm so unless you actually do want to prioritize your biceps more than your triceps or vice versa what I suggested for more balanced development of both muscles over time simply alternate between the muscles that you start with every week or instead you can even perform your biceps and triceps exercises in a superset fashion but just first make sure that you know how to actually properly apply super sets before doing so which is something I've actually covered in a past video and I'll leave the link to that in the description box down below to help you out next is the all too common mistake of sacrificing your form for weight because using a weight that you can't control and have to use momentum to move like I'm doing here just as more harm than good now only does this shift tension and essentially gains away from the arms and onto other muscle groups like the upper traps that take over but also week after week you're not going to be able to tell if your biceps have actually gotten stronger and bigger or if you've actually gotten more sloppy with your form so instead to put the ego aside and worry less about how heavy your lifting and moreso about actually using and fatiguing the biceps and triceps which is best accomplished with proper and don't think that by lightening the weight you're not going to build muscles effectively because that simply is not true I mean one 2016 study for example has subjects perform unilateral bicep curls on one side of their arms with literally no weight for four sets of twenty three times a week and just had them focus on contracting the biceps as hard as possible throughout a full range of motion after six weeks they measured the growth in the arm and then had them do the other arm for six weeks but this time with a weight that was equivalent to 70% of their one rep max and a rep range of 8 to 12 reps it turned out that both arms experienced the same amount of biceps growth now keep in mind that these were untrained subjects and I'm by no means recommending to start curling with no weight in the gym and getting all sorts of weird looks but I just want to emphasize that we know that for muscle growth what's more important than the weight you lift is actually activating the target muscle and placing that under sufficient tension during your sets and that is always most effectively accomplished by using a weight that you can control and the last mistake has to do with your rest times between your sets I remember back in the day during my arm days all I care about was the pump so I do a set of curls and rest for maybe a minute tops before going into another set and this is what I thought was best because I get the biggest pump of my arms and it really felt like it was working but we now know that this actually isn't the best approach for example there was a 2016 systematic review done on rest periods and I'll pop up the results to that on-screen which actually showed that on average resting at least over a minute between sets led to almost 40% greater muscle growth and compared to rest in just under a minute more specifically though a couple recent studies actually indicate that for single joint exercises like the ones you've mainly be doing on your arm day you want to aim for roughly two minutes of rest between sets as this seems to be the sweet spot to maximize your workout volume your muscle growth and your strength so I'd aim for that but another option is to incorporate antagonistic superset for your arm days they'll just allow you to get that two-minute rest period in a more time efficient manner and again the video where I show how to properly do that will be down below so guys I hope this video was useful for you and I hope it actually helped you realize a few of the mistakes that you may have been making just like I was back in the day and for a step by step program that applies the science and helps you avoid crucial mistakes like these before they even happen so you can build muscle and add size as quickly as possible just like heaven over here did in nine months and simply head on over to built with science comm and take the starting point quiz to discover what program is best for you anyways I hope you enjoyed this one please don't forget to show your support by giving the video a like leaving a comment down below as to what you'd like to see

    "title": "How To Train For Six Pack Abs (3 Fixes You Need To Make)",
    "published_at": "2020-11-08T17:02:50Z",
    "transcript": "most of us know that to get our abs to show in the first place we need to get to a low enough body fat percentage for them to start peeking through the same is true for any muscle for that matter but in addition to that by training our abs in the right way just like any other muscle they will respond with growth and as a result your six pack will be even more visible and better looking as you start chipping away at the fat covering them so in this video i cover three fixes that you need to make with the way that you train your abs that'll help you actually target and grow your six-pack much more effectively the first mistake you're making with your ab training is letting your hip flexors take over the movement and the reason this can happen is because many abs exercises like leg raises sit-ups and reverse crunches they involve a great deal of hip flexion which as the name implies is the main function of our hip flexors and research has shown that if your hip flexors are already shortened all day due to prolonged sitting or if your abs are just relatively weak then your hip flexors will be more likely to take over and as a result reduce the involvement of the abs during these movements which is obviously detrimental for overall abs development but can also create a problematic imbalance between our hip flexors and ab strength that can potentially lead to back issues and pain down the road so one way to address this is by simply changing your focus during your abs exercises ignore what your legs or your upper body are doing during the movement and instead focus on your pelvis for bottom up abs exercises like leg raises or reverse crunches simply focus on curling your pelvis up towards your belly button and for top-down abs exercises like cable crunches or sit-ups simply focus on bringing the ribcage forward and down towards the pelvis this mindset shift alone will do wonders in terms of helping you feel the movement more with your abs and less with your hip flexors going beyond this though another solution is to tweak your current abs training to help take the hip flexors out of the equation for example during sit-ups one solution is to perform what's called the yonder setup a move devised by czech physician vladimir yondo which through a concept called reciprocal inhibition has been shown to reduce the activation of the hip flexors by using a band to force the hamstrings to remain contracted throughout the sit-up to perform it wrap a band around a fixture and place it either behind your knees or your heels keep your feet planted and mindfully contract your hamstrings and glutes to resist the pull of the band then you simply perform your sit up while squeezing your hamstrings and glutes throughout each rep if you don't have a band you can use a ball behind your knees like so and again focus on contracting the hamstrings and glutes and even with something like cable crunches the same concept can be applied what you'll find is that this simple tweak will force your abs to work much harder than you're used to and eventually you'll be able to strengthen your abs and improve your mind to muscle connection with your abs to the point where these modifications will no longer be needed in addition to this though during moves like the reverse crunch most people are unaware that the range of motion of the abs during this movement is actually quite short in fact on the way down as soon as you pass roughly 90 degrees your abs begin to do considerably less work and your hip flexors will start to take over instead so stopping the short on the way down is a very easy way to again shift more tension to the abs and minimize the involvement of hip flexors the next mistake you're making is you're failing to initiate and maintain what's called a posterior pelvic tilt during your abs exercises this subtle movement of tilting the pelvis by contracting the glutes and abs is another key function of the abs and it's been shown to not only significantly boost activation but also helps to further prevent the hip flexors from taking over during our abs exercises in fact in a 2008 paper from the journal strength and condition research properly initiating and maintaining a posterior pelvic tilt during a move as simple as a lying leg raise led to less hip flexor activity and greater upper and lower abs activation when compared to a neutral or anteriorly tilted pelvic position in fact as you can see in the following graphs hip flexor activity increased and abdominal activity decreased as subjects got further away from posterior pelvic tilt a similar finding was showcased in another paper analyzing lower abs activity during the reverse crunch so just realize the importance of this and apply this subtle tweak to all of your abs exercises for example during the reverse crunch initiate the posterior pelvic tilt by contracting your glutes and abs before you go to perform each rep and maintain that position as you go through each rep the same applies for moves like hanging leg raises [Music] sit-ups [Music] add rollouts [Music] and even planks make this change and you'll not only instantly feel a much greater contraction in your abs but also less involvement of other muscle groups like the hip flexors and lower back that we want to keep out of the movement the last mistake is treating your abs like some kind of special muscle on one end of the spectrum you have those who don't do any direct abs work on the other end you have those who train their abs completely differently than how they train any other muscle group both are sub-optimal approaches if you want to maximize your abs growth because although our abs are indirectly worked during many of our compound exercises research has shown that they are stimulated to a much higher degree during direct abs work and would therefore respond better with growth you can think of it just like any other muscle take your arms for example most people will be able to maintain their arm size and see some growth just from the indirect arm work that they get from compound exercises like the bench press and pull ups but more often than not they can get better results by adding in some additional direct arms work and the same applies when it comes to building the abs but then when you do add direct abs work approach it like any other muscle group a lot of people will make the mistake of training their abs several times a week with high rep ranges short rest periods and will leave them for the end of their workouts when they're already pretty fatigued instead train them like your other muscle groups by providing them with adequate attention and volume but also with adequate rest and as they get stronger over time overload your abs exercises with additional weight or difficulty instead of simply sticking to the same routine over and over again by training them in this fashion and as shown in the literature they'll respond with growth the exact same way that any of your other muscles would all in all though as mentioned earlier in this video just realize that while ab training does help to build your six-pack you need to combine this with a proper nutrition plan designed to then reveal your hard work and to get your abs more visible the exact same is true for all of your muscle groups focusing all of your efforts on training while remaining oblivious to the importance of your nutrition will get you nowhere but for a step-by-step program that shows you exactly both how to train and how to eat week after week so that you can not only build muscle but then also strip off the fat that's covering them to reveal that hard-earned muscle just like several of our members have done with their built

    "title": "6 CRUCIAL Things I Wish I Knew Before I Started Training (Beginner Workout Mistakes)",
    "published_at": "2017-08-20T16:53:35Z",
    "transcript": "what's up guys today I'm going to be sharing with you the six most important things I wish I knew when I first started lifting now I've been training for about five years now but I'd say in my last year of training I've made more progress than I did in my first 3 to 4 years of training and this is just because when I first started lifting I basically took advice from the wrong people and this is what caused me to really slow down my progress and it got to the point where I didn't really know who to go for for advice and who to trust but since then I've learned so much through my education personal research and basically five years of trial and error that now gone to the point where I know what works and what doesn't so for those of you watching I highly recommend that you learn from my mistakes and implement the tips that I'm gonna mention throughout the video as this will prevent you from wasting a lot of years of training like I did and it'll enable you to progress much faster than most beginner lifters out there well the first and probably the most costly mistake I made when I first started lifting was I did not establish a solid mind to muscle connection with my muscles I was more concerned with how much weight I could lift then actually focusing on using the right muscles for each movement for example when I first started lifting I had the most difficult time building on my chest and it just would not grow and I assumed it wouldn't grow because I simply wasn't lifting heavy enough but even when I got to the point where I could lift a decent amount of weight for example I was doing a 2 plate bench for reps my chest was pretty much the same size as it was a few years back when I first started lifting and although my shoulders and my triceps that actually grown quite a bit my chest was pretty much the same and this was a hundred percent due to the fact that I did not establish a solid mind--to muscle connection with my chest and I was working out the secondary muscles whenever I would do chest exercises so the fix is what I did is I first lowered all my weights which is hard to do trust me and it takes a big hit on ego but it's something that you have to do and I picked a few exercises that are really active in my chest and I also use various cues and chest activation exercises to really just establish that strong mind muscle connection so I could feel my chest when I was doing the movements and only after I did all that that I start to slowly increase the weight and only then did I start to see my chest actually growing and by then I had already wasted about two to three years of chest training and this applies to all muscles that you train you need to first focus on establishing a solid muscle connection with all the muscles that you train at or else you're not going to be trimming the right muscles and it's just gonna be your secondary muscles that are gonna grow another big mistake during my first few years of lifting is I kind of neglected my compound lifts and the main compound lifts I'm talking about our pull-ups than the squat and the overhead press I put more time and effort into isolation movements than with compound lifts because I didn't think they mattered that much yet compound movements are some of the best exercises that you can do to put on mass and once I started to get really strong with my pull-ups and deadlifts and squat and overhead press I started to put on a lot more muscle than I did previously what I didn't do compound lives and this brings me to my next mistake which is I was not focusing on the concept of progressive overload and basically getting stronger every single week instead what I was doing is I was constantly switching up my exercise routine almost every week and I wasn't tracking my progress with these exercises which made it really hard for me to get strong and the exercises that I needed to get stronger which meant I was basically wasting years of training when it comes to building muscle instead what I do now is I choose a few key lifts and I focus on getting strong as hell with them so I'll stick with pretty much the same exercise routine for a few months until I plateau and I also track my progress so I can make sure that I'm either increasing in weight or reps or total volume every single week with these key exercises this is a mistake I made for several years now and it's something that I've only recently fixed and it cost me a lot of years of wasted training as a beginner I'd see bodybuilders really fat during their bulking phases yeah when they started cutting and they lose all their fat and get super ripped they'd be bigger than they were the previous year so I thought that this was the best way to gain muscle and I tried to copy this I've tried to gain as much weight as a coder my bulk in the face and I remember at one point I kid you not I was drinking a whole gallon of chocolate milk in addition to all my regular meals every single day although I put on a lot of size during this bulk I went up to around 17 to 18 percent body fat which meant I put on a lot of fat as well which became really hard for me to get rid of and little did I know the bodybuilders I was following and taking advice from they take performance-enhancing drugs that allows them to get super ripped lose a lot of fat while maintaining pretty much all the muscle mass that they ganger in their bulk which is something that is pretty much impossible for natural lifters like myself so when I started cutting after I got to a really high percentage body fat it took me a long time to lose all that fat and through the process I lost a lot of muscle with it and this pretty much brought me back to the start important I was before I even started bulking which means I wasted all this time doing a big bulk and cutting when I could have been doing it differently instead a much better way to do this and it's something I do now is I do short periods of lean bulking combined with short cutting phases as this allows you to stay relatively lean as you gain muscle and you don't need to waste a lot of time burning off fat which also burns off your muscle in the process although you can still make progress while not counting your calories if you've never counted your calories before then you're pretty much gonna be shooting in the dark and you're not gonna really know how much you're eating every day for example during my first 2 to 3 years of training I never really counted my calories as I thought I knew I had a ballpark idea as to how much I was eating but once I first started counting my calories I realized that I was actually 400 to 500 calories off from what I thought I was eating which is huge and it could be the difference between gaining weight or losing weight so I suggest using a simple app like My Fitness Pal and tracking your food every single day at least for a few weeks until you get an idea as to how much food you're actually eating on a daily basis and how much food you have to eat in order to hit your goal whether it's for a gaining muscle or losing fat not only will it hold you accountable for what you eat every day but you're gonna progress much faster than you would if you were dishes to eat blindly every day all right guys last mistake and probably one of the more important ones is that when I first started lifting as a beginner I did no stability or mobility work for my joints and I did very little stretching if any at all and I did this because I didn't realize the importance of including these things into my training regimen and nobody really told me that these things were necessary to do as a result during my first few years of training I got tons of injuries especially in my rotator cuff which meant that I couldn't train for months at a time due to my injuries and the fact that I was sitting pretty much all day as a university student with bad posture just made matters worse so now what I do is that I regularly include a lot of self myofascial release stability and mobility work rotator cuff strengthening exercises and a lot of exercises to strengthen my lower traps and my wrong boys to help improve my posture and reduce my risk of injury in the future and ever since I started doing this consistently a few years back I have not had a serious injury since that's it for the video guys I hope you guys find it useful I guarantee that if you implement the tips I previously go through it and you learn from my mistakes that you're gonna save a lot of years that would be wasted training it and you're gonna progress a lot faster than you would otherwise and as always please don't forget to support me by hitting that like button and

    "transcript": "[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] all right guys welcome to the live stream I am super excited because today is a special day there is something I've been wanting to share with you for way too long years it's a big announcement and I'm nervous but I'm also just super excited to reveal what it is because I know that you guys are going to love it before I do though I want you guys to comment in the live chat where you guys are from so I'm actually from Vancouver Canada let me know if you guys have ever been here but it's amazing how my videos have reached you guys from all over the world and before I reveal what the big announcement today is I just want to share a little bit about my background because I feel like I never really talk about it much on the channel because I'm just so hyperfocused on science and teaching you guys so I am actually half French Canadian and half Filipino but comment in the live chat what your eth C is or just post the flag of where you're from but I guess the curse of my ethnic background is that I was always a super skinny kid so like especially in high school I just never really felt confident about my body I'd see superheroes on TV and actors like Chris Hemsworth Brad Pit and even athletes like Cristiano Ronaldo and I was like damn I want to look like them but then there I was looking like a stick and just feeling weak which is what eventually got me into working out but it seemed like no matter what I did I just wasn't getting very good results and to make matters worse there was just so much conflicting advice out there like I ended up trying all kinds of crazy diets and workouts I remember seeing the incredibly jacked Rocky baloa drink raw eggs in his movie and I thought that's what I have to do and I did it four whole eggs raw I can't believe I actually swallowed it it was disgusting but I was honestly willing to do anything just to get better results but still nothing was really working even the raw eggs didn't work and I honestly thought that my Asian genetics were what was holding me back but my mom who is the same one who cursed me with my Asian genetics she's also a doctor and let me tell you about her she was born in the slums in the Philippines literally sleeping with rats every night but she overcame All Odds she made it into med school here in Canada she became a successful doctor with her own clinic and at the same time provided my brothers and I with an incredible childhood but the thing about her guys is that she truly loves helping people she's almost 70 years old now but still works so hard every single day because she loves it and so growing up I saw firsthand how she was using science to diagnose patients guide her decisions and completely change people's lives for the better and so I wondered why can't I do that with Fitness use science to cut through the noise and find what's actually proven to work so from that point on I got hooked on learning researching I became a personal trainer and then started my bachelor's degree in science and once I learned where to look I uncovered a ton of studies that were buried away because most Jim Bros didn't care about them let alone knew they existed yet as soon as I used what I had learned in these research studies I instantly saw better progress and more importantly I tested these science back methods with clients as well as my brother and my dad who were both overweight at the time and boom the results were amazing and seeing them transform it felt incredible it felt like what I had imagined my Mom feels every day working and being able to help her patients and at that point honestly guys like it felt like my calling I had to share my findings with the world and that is when I broke my mom's heart by telling her mom I don't know if I want to be a doctor like you I want to start a YouTube channel and share all this amazing science I've been obsessing about so not only did I get an instant slipper slap from my mom but making videos was not easy for me like I'm a big introvert so talking to the camera scared the hell out of me even right now I'm nervous talking to you guys but guys like I was so awkward at first it's painful to watch back I'm actually going to pop up a snippet from my first ever hey guys thank you so much for watching I hope you enjoyed my transformation video for those of you that don't know I'm Jeremy and over the past couple years Fitness has really become my passion I'm now a certified personal trainer and I'm going into my final year of a kinesiology degree I I probably did that take like I could you know a hundred times to get it right man I was so awkward but I knew that I had amazing information and if I could just share it with you guys that people would benefit so I kept making videos and pretty soon they started going viral and it turns out I wasn't the only one who was sick of the Sea of misinformation and wanted some solid science-backed advice and also advice that just wasn't coming from a juice head or somebody just shouting in your face and millions of you joined for the ride your support your comments your suggestions have helped build the channel into what it is today but eventually I realized YouTube's limit ations YouTube is great for inspiration and information but people need more than generalized advice to reach their goals I wanted to provide the same quality of personalized attention that comes with an actual Fitness coach and that's what inspired me to release my online fitness programs back in 2018 where tens of thousands of science-based Believers joined our bu with science programs transformed their bodies and shared their stories and I loved it the more Transformations I saw the more dedic at I got to improving our systems so we could just help more and more people but no matter how great our videos on fitness programs were I still get messages from you guys all over the world asking for one-on-one coaching wanting something tailored specifically for you but we're still just a really small team here at Bill science and for me to work one-on-one with every single person who wants my coaching it's just not feasible so back in 2019 I set out to create something that could give the personalized coaching experience you deserve the closest thing to being able to work with me oneon-one no matter where you are in the world something Dynamic science-backed a deeply personalized workout and Di program built around you and evolves as you do which is why today after six grueling years of sleepless nights expensive lessons revisions stress and tears it is finally here the brand new built with science Plus app it is here guys I can't freaking believe it it is everything you need to crush your fitness goals all in one app and you can go and sign up right now at builtwith science.com I'm going to pin a comment in the live chat and also put it in the description but we're giving you two weeks completely free to try it out no strings attached because I know you guys are going to love it as soon as you try it and if you end up signing up for this week only you get 25% off plus because you're watching this live stream I'm giving you guys a special code for an additional 20% off just use the code live stream at checho believe me it is the closest thing to having me there with you 247 it's actually even better every feature is designed to make your fitness journey simpler smarter and more effective I'm going to do a full walkthrough of the app and explain all those amazing features in a second but let me tell you guys I thought creating an app would be simple but it has been hands down the most difficult project I have ever worked on and it's taken six gring years because I refused to compromise on quality I was plenty of times I was offered out of the box apps to just plop my programs into but I refused because I was stubborn with my vision and I knew if if we could just do this properly sticking to science back principles it would be a GameChanger for you it wasn't about just rushing the market for me it was about something making something worthwhile but I know some of you guys might still be wondering every influencer nowadays seems to have their own fitness app so what is so special about ours well it's the same thing that sets this channel apart everything is backed by science we spent years combining cuttingedge science with a personalization and guidance that you need to to succeed and to make that happen I brought on some I brought in some of the best Minds in the field we worked with Dr Eric trixler a leading health and Metabolism research from Duke University who has published over 80 peer-reviewed papers and he's also a pro natural bodybuilder and a certified trainer our head dietician along with other top scientists and coaches also helped us design every aspect of the app and we invested in building our inhouse Tech team led by the main M Kevin who you may have seen in some of my videos and this way guys we could create the app from the ground up and we didn't have to compromise on every on anything having Kevin and the team it also means that we can keep the app constantly up to date with the latest science so this means that it's only going to get smarter and more powerful especially with your guys' feedback and speaking of feedback we actually launched the app to a big test group a month ago Not only was a response incredibly positive but we've already made some major updates to the app based on their feedback and you guys are next if you want to work with me one-on-one this is the next best thing so if you're ready to start your fitness journey head to builtwith science.com or click the link in the left chat you get two weeks free 25% discount for launch week and only for those of you guys watching use the code live stream at checkout for an additional 20% off it is the best deal we're ever going to have so take advantage of it now but now what I want to do is I want to dive into the exciting features there's specifically six key features I want to talk about and first up it's an all-in-one Fitness and Nutrition solution see guys extra exercise alone doesn't work yes it improves your health and can help with building strength but when it comes to losing fat and building muscle exercise alone actually doesn't do very much if you're not pairing it with the right diet and this is why so many people in the gym they stay looking the same year after year and honestly it's not their fault social media has not only made dieting so much more complicated than it needs to be but most online programs and apps that people follow they focus so much on the workouts yet hardly talk about the nutrition why because it's complicated and it's just not as sexy as the workouts but you guys know from my YouTube videos how much importance I place on nutrition because I know it truly is the key to getting you the results that you're after and it doesn't have to be complicated once you understand the science behind it it's actually dead simple and that's why my goal with the built with science Plus app was to combine everything you need into one app workouts nutrition tracking and person personized coaching all working together to keep you on track this way you don't need to toggle between two or three different apps or gather information from a bunch of different places all you need is one app that will simplify the whole process for you all you do is you tell it your body stats and it'll tell you exactly what work is to do and what nutrition plan to follow every single day so I'm actually going to share my screen show you guys rather than just tell you so just give me a second while I load this up all right so now I'm into the dashboard and as you can see there's a daily checklist so that tells me everything I need to do every single day so today I actually have a nutrition check-in and I'll talk more about that later on in the video um we got a weighin I have to log my meals and as soon as you tap that boom you go to the nutrition Tab and you have a full food log here and it's super easy you can just tap to add breakfast whatever you ate and you can add whatever Foods you have in there and if you scroll down you have a bunch of meal recipes that you can explore and start experimenting with and this is a crazy part guys I'm gonna show you guys later I'll do a live demo but you hit the camera icon and we have a meal scanner yeah you just take a picture of your food it'll instantly log everything for you um again I'll show you guys I'll show you that later on and the back to the dashboard we also have the workout so today I'm supposed to do an upper body workout and you can see all the exercises and uh what I have to do in that workout again I'll show you um show you that feature more later on the video I just wanted you to see that every single day it's going to tell you exactly what you have to do and as long as you follow what's laid out there for you you're going to see amazing results um and there's so many other things that that I want to show you guys in there and we're going to get to it but truly guys all you have to do is show up and do what the app tells you I want to show you some examples of just how powerful the system is so Brian here is a perfect example of this he started at over 200 pounds and was in the worst shape of his life and he set a goal to get down to 12% body fat and see his abs for the first time ever well after his first week on the program he already dropped five pounds simply by adjusting his diet but that was just the beginning for briyan after just a few months of following his fat loss plan he started getting compliment from other people at the gym about how lean he was getting and what's funny is he didn't even know how ripped he was so one guy at the gym saw him and even recommended that he compete in an upcoming bodybuilding show something Brian had never done before and guess what he competed and ended up getting first place in one show and second place in another show that is insane but it all came down to following the right training and nutrition plan something he had never done before before he had tried creating a plan on his own before but because he didn't really know what he was doing it just never worked Brian is the type of person who just needs to be told what to eat what workout to do and he'll do it just give him the outline and he'll follow the path and that's exactly what he got and that's exactly what we've built into built with science Plus app everything is taken care of for you guys nutrition training everything and it's all backed by science all you have to do is show up here's another example of how powerful this all-on-one system is Maus lost 40 pounds in just four months I'm not going to lie I don't normally recommend losing weight this quickly but Maus here was super motivated when he started his doctor had just told him that he was classified as obese and that he needed to do something before it was too late and that led him to sign up for a buil with science program and initially he just followed the workouts and totally ignored the nutrition and he got pretty good results but his weight never really changed that much that's when he decided to go all in with our system following both the training and the nutrition plan that we let out for him and almost instantly the fat started melting off he first noticed it in his chest and then his shoulders and then after three months his belly started to really lean down and everyone started asking him what he was doing and what he was taking um but it was simple for the first time in his life he followed a program that focused not just on workouts but his diet too and it laid out everything for him it's why I just didn't want to release another fitness app guys like I knew I had to do more if I truly wanted to help you and change your lives I wanted to create something that took care of everything for you and would actually get you the results you deserve if you follow it and that's exactly what we did and this same system works for females too for any females who are watching here's Kristen so she like most female clients that I've worked with she would do a ton of cardio three to four times a week and eat super clean Foods so lots of vegetables nuts and chicken but it wasn't working for her and she couldn't figure out why well unfortunately she fell into a lot of the bad Fitness advice that's promoted online she was doing way too much cardio thinking it was a key to getting her ton and although she was eating clean she had no idea how much she was actually eating it turns out she was still eating way more calories than her body should have been and once she joined our program she got a workout plan and diet plan laid out for her all based on the latest science of what actually works and at first she was skeptical because her plan went against a lot of what she had been led to believe online and from Fitness influenc influencers that followed but in just six months she dropped her body fat in half while making massive strength gains she went from barely being able to hang on to the pull-up bar to now being able to bang out several body weight pull-ups in a row without any assistance but guys focusing on both her workouts and nutrition was key and although although it sounds overwhelming it was actually quite simple for her to do because she's the type of person like Brian she just needs to plan L out for her and she'll do it and that's exactly what we did and what we built into the built with science Plus app guiding you every single day and taking care of all the guest work for you just follow the daily checklist that I showed you and you'll get amazing results it's as simple as that and guys this is also just the beginning for the app once we have enough feedback and data from you guys we're planning to go even further by adding features like sleep and stress tracking so that you'll actually have a full picture of your health all on one app it's only going to get better and wow I am just looking at the notifications of everyone that's already joined the app during out live stream it's crazy welcome to the app guys we have a lot more features to talk about but if you're ready to join the app now just go to buwi science.com or click the link that I pinned in the live chat again you can get two weeks free to try it out and this week only we're giving you 25% off your plan plus since you're watching this live stream use code Liv stream for an additional 20% off this is a big moment for me guys I am I'm super pumped for all the people joining but now I want to move on I want to talk some more about the app so let's move on to feature two highly personalized workouts for anywhere anytime the sad truth guys is that 99% of Fitness plans out there are one-sized fits-all but think about it it makes no sense to use the same plan as someone else with completely different goals strengths and genetics and expect it to work the same way for you even most personal trainers I've worked with they use pre-built templates that save time but aren't truly personalized to the individual for example maybe you only have dumbbells for your workouts or maybe your body naturally grows your legs well but not your chest or maybe you have a hurt shoulder and you just can't do bench press or maybe THS days you're super busy and you only have 30 minutes to train your work out program should reflect that it's not about just doing what's optimal guys or what worked for somebody else the best workout routine should be built around you and that is why in our built with science Plus app we have a super detailed onboarding process so I'm actually going to share my screen here guys but basically we'll ask you things like your goal so whether you want to build muscle lose fat or maintain your experience level so whether you're just starting out you have a ton of experience or maybe you worked out a while ago and you're just getting back into it how many days a week you can work out and what days you'd prefer to work out and this one's cool I'll talk more about later but if there's any muscles that you have a more difficult time growing so for example if you have a really hard time growing your chest like me just tell the app that and it's going to take that into consideration when it builds your plant and of course what equipment you do or don't have whether it's a full out gym or just whatever you have at home or at your condo and how much time you have to work out even if you only have time for 30 minute workouts that is perfectly fine and then once you're done answering all the questions Boom the app will instantly build a perfect science-based workout plan just for you and even after it's built you're free to customize it however you want you can move around your workout days you can edit sets and Reps you can superet an exercise with something else and once you're actually in the workouts let's say your gym is really busy and you don't have your usual equipment boom just tap the swap Icon and you'll see a list of our recommended exercise alternatives to still work the same muscle because guys the key to your success it's not just about having the best science back plan you need a plan that also works for your lifestyle and adapts to any situation that comes up take Jesse here for example amazing transformation now would you believe me if I told you that he did this all at home using just one pair of adjustable dumbbells and a bench that he bought from Facebook Marketplace crazy I know but most people think they need access to a full gym or a bunch of equipment the truth is you don't need much and you don't even need to lift very heavy weights to get amazing results it's all about how you use what you have and that's the beauty about science if you pick the right exercises and you do them with a proper form you're able to challenge your muscles so much more with far less equipment and weight that is exactly what Jesse learned how to do we gave him a dumbbell only program and he was still clearly able to get to chisel down his body while building a good amount of muscle and even though his adjustable dumbbells maxed out at 50 pounds using our science-based techniques and exercise for him this was more than enough for him to continue forcing his muscles to grow as he got stronger we've actually had a ton of build with science members used just their body weight and still get amazing results and this is why in the build with science Plus app I wanted to make this process as easy as possible for you guys and make it possible for anyone in the world with any set of equipment to still get amazing results so in the app all you do is you just tell us what equipment you do or don't have and there's even a checklist where you can check off everything that you have and it'll instantly create a science back plan that makes the most of what you have so whether you have a full gym just dumbbells just band or even just your body weight it doesn't matter the powerful science back Al algorithm in our app will make a workout program that I promise you will get you results now here's another example I want to show you with Kareem so Kareem here he was way too intimidated to even step foot inside a gym yet still managed to gain over 20 pounds of muscle and he like most beginners was really nervous about going to the gym for the first time especially his local gym which was full of guys a lot bigger than him he don't want to embarrass himself with doing the wrong form and to be honest he was just really insecure about how he looked so instead of going to the gym Kareem started out with our built with science homeworkouts where we taught him how to build muscle and practice proper form by just using his body body weight and after doing this for a couple months he managed to put on a good amount of muscle and more importantly gained a lot of confidence so much so that he now had the courage to join a gym which is when we adjusted his workouts to take advantage of all the equipment he now had and he continued making progress and built over 20 pounds of muscle in the process he even remembers seeing before after transformations of other people on the program and thinking to himself that would never be him well look at you now Kareem and this is again guys why in The Bu with science Plus app we enable you to adjust your workouts on the fly so if you want to work out at home for a few weeks or you're out traveling no problem we'll adjust your plan for you you just tell us what equipment you do or don't have and we'll create the best science back workout plan based on that and lastly guys I want to talk about my own experience with it so most of us have stubborn muscles that refuse to grow as fast as others as well as stronger muscle groups that grow much faster faster for example some people have really big shoulders but a really flat stubborn chest some people's lower bodies May grow faster than their upper body and some people's arms for example grow really well from presses and rows whereas others need a lot of direct armor and yet despite these differences most people use a training program that doesn't take this into account I know this because it happened to be firstand I've always had a really stubborn chest but my shoulders and my arms were super easy for me to grow yet I would always work on my shoulders and arms just as hard as my chest because I was just following generic workouts and that is why in the app we built the muscle group prioritizer and all you do is you select the muscle that you're struggling to grow and boom the app will adjust your workouts integrating exercises and techniques to give that area the attention it needs for balance development so for me I just told the app that I want to focus a little bit more on my chest and it adjusted my workout space on that and I followed this workout plan for the past 16 weeks and I'm not kidding you guys my chest has been growing faster than ever it's definitely Fuller thicker and has more shape than it ever has so I'm actually going to keep running this program for another 12 weeks or so and then I'm going to tell the app to focus on the next area I want to prioritize which will probably be my back or my shoulders and this is exactly what I do whenever I personally train people it's why in order to provide you guys with the most effective person fitness plan I had to build an app and I had to build one from scratch it was the only way I'm telling you guys this app takes things to the next level and wow I'm seeing all the notifications of people joining and again this is crazy guys that is insane so many people have joined just want to say huge welcome to everyone who's joined the app so far and also big big welcome to anyone who just popped into the live stream I'm super pumped guys this is a huge day we still have more features to cover and then I'll do a Q&A to answer whatever questions that you guys might have but to get onto the app right now just go to buwi science.com or click the link I pinned in the live chat you can get two weeks free to try it out and this week only we're giving you 25% off your plan plus since you're watching this live stream use code Liv stream for an additional 20% off now we have four more features I want to cover and then we'll get to the Q&A and the next feature is your built-in workout coach so most fitness programs out there they hand you a plan and if you're lucky might also help you track your progress and that's it but as you get stronger your workout program also needs to adapt and it's not as simple as push as hard as you can every workout there's a science behind it some workouts you want to focus on adding more weight other workouts you want to add more reps and sometimes you might even just keep everything the exact same and focus on improving your form or changing up an exercise but if you don't know how to properly make the right decisions that your work out you'll end up either pushing yourself too hard and get injured or Plateau or you'll fail to challenge yourself enough and never really progress and I wanted to take I wanted to build something that took care of all of this for you to build something that mimics as if I was personally coaching you reviewing your data and giving you the best science back recommendation every single workout and let me tell you guys we did just that and I want to share my screen and just show you exactly what it is that we've built so let me get into my app here I'm going to start my workout and I'm going to go into the first exercise here so it's a low incline dumble press That's my first exercise and again what I showed you guys before you can just tap the form guide to pop that up but here so I I've actually been using my app every single week and you can see my last week's progress right here and so if I just tap this icon here boom decrease weight last workout you below eight reps for this set keep the weight the same but try to reach the recommended 8 to 12 reps this is basically telling me that on my first set last week I want a bit too heavy and this time it wants me to drop the weight and increase the rep range and then second set boom let's see what it says maintain weight for this set stick to the same weight but try to do more than eight reps so as you can see guys every single set is just guiding me through my workout and it uses my data from my last workout right it looks at okay how much weight did Jeremy do how many reps did he do and what was the effort of that set and it uses a science back algorithm to determine what's the next best step for jerey to take so it takes care of everything for you guys trust me it is it is gamechanging and with it basically every single workout the app can tell you exactly how much weight to lift and how many reps to do and the algorithm is designed to push your body just the perfect amount of your workout to continue making progress without over doing it so all you have to do is show up do what the app tells you and the gains will follow and over time guys this will lead to insane results for example Sean here he went from feeling humiliated because he couldn't do a single chin up to now being able to do 15 chinups in a row no problem his bench press also went from 135 lbs to 225 lbs and now he's even squatting 35 pounds and you can see the difference it's made on his physique and muscularity so how did he do it well in the past he had no real structure to his workouts he'd do a bunch of exercises one week and then change it all up the next week he never tracked what he did so he had no real way of making sure that he was progressing and getting stronger every single week but as soon as he started tracking his workouts using buil with science he was able to see what his Baseline strength was and then we taught him how to slowly progress his workouts every week add a little weight here add a few more reps here and every single week he was just focused on little wins that way he was able to challenge his muscles just a little bit more but never overdid it to the point where he'd get injured or not be able to recover and it was these little wins every week that eventually led to the insane strength and muscle gains he experienced over the course of the year and the best part no injuries and that guys is why I had to build in the workout coach feature into build with science plus all you have to do is show up and it'll take care of all the complicated guess word for for you and this works for women too this is Ally she she is actually one of the uh initial test users for our app and funny story so her husband took her before photo and told her straight up Ally you're not gonna like this well she continued taking photos every month and at 57 years old even though she thought at her age it would be tough to tone her body and build muscle she is now leaner and stronger than she has ever been and the crazy part guys is before she had already done a ton of workout programs but they just didn't have any consistency the workouts would change every single month and she never really tracked anything but after joining the built with science Plus app she learned the importance of sticking to the same exercises and applying Progressive overload every week to challenge her muscles just a little bit more as they got stronger and stronger as soon as she did that she started seeing incredible results and best of all she actually loves her workouts now because the mini PR she's able to make every single workout again it's why in buildt with science plus we built tools to enable you to not just create workouts for you and track them but to tell you every single week how to make them more challenging to make sure you're always progressing and forcing your muscles to grow and again guys this is just the beginning with your guys' feedback and data we're going to continue improving the app to make it more and more powerful for example this progression system that we've built bu it could even start taking into account your sleep and your stress levels and use that to start factoring in how aggressive its recommendations are our mission is to build the world's smartest Fitness coach but to do that I need your help and I want you guys to play an active role in providing Fe feedback and helping us make this better and better so to join the app today just go to buildwi science.com or click the link that I pinned in the chat again guys you get two weeks completely free to try it out and this week only we're giving you 25% % off your plan plus only for you guys watching use the code live stream for an additional 20% off but now let's go into the next feature there is three more amazing features I want to cover before we get into the Q&A and the next feature has to do with our exercise form videos honestly I'd say on average More than 70% of people I seen the gym use the wrong form or at least could be improved and it's not their fault the truth is most trainers and fitness influencers are actually teaching the wrong form to begin with and it's not their fault either I remember back when I first got certified as a trainer I was taught what I thought was proper form on various exercises like the squat deadlift and so on but it wasn't until I really dove into the research on the on these exercises and worked oneon-one with thousands of clients did I discover how outdated these textbooks and common ways of teaching exercise forms is but guys this is one of the most important factors that you need to get right in order to get results because if you aren't using the proper form you're not only going to work muscles that you aren't intending to but you also have a much higher chance of injury even little tweaks like how wide you grip the bar when benching or where to place your feet when squatting can make a massive difference on how well your muscles will grow and respond to that exercise and that is why guys within the built with science Plus app every single exercise in your workout routine comes with a highly detailed science-backed exercise form tutorial video that's been written and designed using the latest scientific research so I'm going to show you guys this on my app right now but when you're doing your workout you just simply tap the form guide icon and boom a tutorial video is going to instantly pop up it'll show you exactly where to put your hands how to place your feet and all the important details that you need to know in order to get the most out of each exercise and avoid injuring yourself and Guys these SE aren't your basic AI animations if you guys have seen my exercise videos on YouTube then you know how detailed I get and we apply that same level of detail to every single exercise in the buil with science Plus app you're not going to be able to find these anywhere else and the beauty about now having an app is that I can instantly update these form videos whenever new research informs my thinking I guarantee that even if you simply do the same exercises that you're doing right now you're going to get dramatically better results just by adjusting your form based on the videos I provide here is actually a perfect example of this from steel so steel joined a gym for the first time in his life with Bill with science and ended up building a superhero Physique in just eight months he' always thought about getting to the gym because he really wanted to build muscle and lean down his body but he just didn't know where to start and after joining The Bu with science program he studied the exercise form videos religiously and he very quickly mastered his form he was able to finally feel the right muscles activating and after about a month of focusing on his form he was ready to start trying to lift heavier and get stronger and the program guided him throughout that process as well teaching him how to tell when he was ready to add more weight or do more reps and from that point he was hooked seeing his numbers slowly go up every week and his muscles responding to it getting bigger and bigger it just made things so much more motivated for steel and gamified the process for him but it really is a strong Foundation of proper form that he needed and even if you're not a beginner anymore you probably have a lot of bad habits that you developed early on or you might be using outdated techniques on a lot of your exercises and trust me even small changes in your form can make a world of difference that is the reason why we dedicated so much time and effort into making these detailed form video guys videos for every single exercise in the app and you might think that you need a coach with you in person to learn proper form but look at Tamar here so when she joined she can do a push-up and she had no idea how to do a proper squat she actually remembers watching our walking lunges tutorial video and comparing it to her own and she was in shock with just how hunched over she was but as as soon as she fixed it she started feeling way more in her glutes instead of her lower back and after six months of following the program all by herself with no inperson trainer she not only lost over 30 pounds of fat but her strength skyrocketed she is's now able to do eight push-ups in a row and she's squatting almost 100 pounds with proper form but so far guys we have talked a lot about workouts and there's two more incredible features that I can't wait to dive into because they're all about the nutrition side of things which is honestly where most of your results are going to come from but wow sorry you guys I'm just getting distracted with all the notifications of people joining the app this is crazy I can't believe how many of you guys have already joined damn I am pumped all right this is huge I'm super excited for you guys to absolutely crush it in 2025 with your new plan shout out to all the new app members and if you haven't joined yet and you're still watching what are you waiting for go to build with science.com or click the link that I pinned in the chat again you get two weeks free to try it out and this week only we're giving you 25% off your plan plus only for those watching this live stream don't forget to use a code Liv stream at checkout for an additional 20% off this is the best deal we're ever going to have so take advantage of it while you still can but now let's dive into the next feature your builtin diet coach so if you've ever dieted before you might have noticed that after three to we four weeks of following your diet it stops working or maybe once you get to a certain level of leanness you get stuck and the problem here it's not your effort it's your plan see as your body weight changes your metabolism adapts it slows down in an attempt to prevent your body from losing more fat in fact research has shown that even if you lose just 10% of your body weight your body can burn about 300 to 400 fewer calories per day but most diet plans are static and they don't take this into account and as a result the exact same diet that worked for you initially will no longer work four to six weeks later and usually this is the point when people think they're genetically cursed or it's just not in the cars for them to have a lean body and so they quit and I don't blame them like I would quit too if I didn't know any better but this is why having a nutrition coach who knows what they're doing can be so valuable they can make the appropriate adjustments to your diet whenever your body starts fighting back and that is exactly what we built into our app built with science plus not only gives you a nutrition plan and targets to start out with but we built in a diet coach that adjusts your nutrition targets each week based on how your metabolism is changing so you never get get stuck or plateau in fact the app actually gets smarter and more accurate the more you use it and the more data it gets from you think of it as if I was personally your nutrition coach checking in with you every single week just do exactly what the app tells you and you're never going to get stuck but let me show you guys exactly what I mean here with my app so I'm just going to pop it up and today you can see that I have my weekly check-in ready and I'll just hit the check-in and she'll analyze my past week's data and see if anything needs to be changed and I'm saying she because we call her coach Alice anyways my goal right now in the app is to build muscle and so I actually haven't gained any weight this past week which coach Alice noticed and she's recommending that we might need to increase my calorie intake it's super detailed guys and it's literally as if I was coaching you with your nutrition every single week and to show you guys the power of this I want to show you guys cam here so cam was actually one of the very first guinea pigs for the B with science Plus app and he tested out the diet coach feature and I'm actually working on a YouTube video with Cam so you guys are actually getting a sneak peek into the results but he went from close to 30% body fat down to 14.6% which statistically now makes him leaner than 98% of men and this is not only the first time in his life he's ever had six-pack abs but we also did a dexa scan and he gained five pounds of muscle throughout the process so obviously he was incredibly happy with with his results but it's not like cam had never tried dieting in the past it's just that he'd always get stuck at around 20% of body fat but the reason he got stuck is because he never had a plan that actually evolved with his body whereas his diet coach in the build of science Plus app it could sense whenever his metabolism was slowing down and it would make slight adjustments to his nutrition plan every week and I'm going to try to pull up a screen share of his progress graph here for uh from the last few months of his journey but I want you to notice how consistently he was losing fat every week there was one part where he plateaued in the middle for maybe two weeks and as you can see in that graph it flattened out but the app caught it pretty much right away in the very next week he saw a massive drop and again all he had to do was follow what the app told him to do and here's another example of this with Chucky so I'm showing him because cam was a great example for fat loss but Chucky over here his one of his main goals was packing on some more size right and believe it or not Chucky he weighs the exact same weight in both the before and after photo 145 pounds but in the before photo the diet coach first guided him through a fat loss phase where he ended up losing 10 pounds of fat in three months but then the diet coach switched his goal to focus on building muscle where he gained 10 pounds of pretty much all muscle in about six months so even though he weighs the same he has way more muscle and way less fat now and clearly looks incredible and guys that is the power of having the diet coach right by your side to guide you through the different phases of your body transformation all you have to do is tell it your body stats and it's going to take care of everything for you and there's just one more case study I want to show with you guys because I often hear how people think that their genetics are going to hold them back well Tom here is a diabetic who literally told us genetically I don't think it's in the cars for me to have a flat stomach or pack abs well guess what after just 11 months he lost 11 in off his waist and got absolutely shredded now Tom here used our online programs because our app wasn't out yet and he did get stuck a few times where his body weight just wouldn't budge but as he learned in his program all he had to do was make a slight diet adjustment or add in a little bit more a little bit more walking into his routine and that's all it took for him to start seeing progress again CU see guys whenever you get stuck it's often just little adjustments that will make all the difference but rather than relying on you guys to make those decisions like I do in my current programs we programmed all of that into the diet coach within the built with science Plus app so you literally just have to put in your data and let the app tell you what to do if you get stuck like Tom did at times the app will make the adjustments for you believe me it's like me personally coaching you every single week all right so I have one more Super exciting feature and demo I want to show you guys for the app before we get into the Q&A but if you haven't joined the app yet go to bills.com or click the link I pin in the chat you get two weeks free to try it out 25% off your plan for launch week and if you use the code live stream I check out you'll get an additional 20% off this is the best deal we're ever going to have so take advantage of it while you still can but are you guys ready for the final feature I want to highlight trust me it's it's going to blow you away it is our AI meal scanner so to make the most out of the diet coach feature we just went through we need to know what you're eating and how much you're eating but imagine this what if all you had to do was take a picture that is exactly what we built and I'm going to show you guys a live demo in just a second but the reason that we built this is because traditional tracking apps that require you to weigh and track every single ingredient but this gets especially tricky when you're eating out or you're eating a meal that was cooked by somebody else and you obviously don't want to be that guy who whips out a food scale at the dinner table or restaurant so here's what we did with Bill science plus not only can you scan barcodes of any food and instantly log it but we also built an AI meal scanner where you just take a photo of your meal and the app instantly identifies every ingredient the portions and then uses our nutrition database to automatically log everything into your food log so with one picture you instantly get the calories and all the macros logged into your food log it's faster it's more precise and it takes away the guesswork but rather than just telling you guys I want to show you guys a live demo this so I'm G to record my screen here and just give me a sec Guys open up my app and we're going to start off easy with some almonds let's see if they can guess the almonds here so all right I'm just going to log this as lunch and then you hit the camera icon and then you see barcode now we got meal scan okay so I'm just going to take a handful of almonds here and then just take a picture and it takes a little bit to analyze let's see boom just like that 162 calories about 28 grams of vment I would say that's pretty much spot on look at that so that's that's pretty impressive but that's uh it gets better guys so uh let me just log that in okay let me try this again so I've also got some meals here okay so I have let me just set this up again guys so I have two meals that I want to scan and the first one is butter chicken so let me just set up here share my [Music] screen okay analyzing boom that is insane basmati rice it even recognized butter chicken and it got the pickled red onions that is crazy and then you just hit log items and then it'll instantly go into my food log for the day crazy all right I want to try one more one more um okay let me set this up [Music] again and I'm going to move the butter chicken and then we got some chin Chinese takeout okay this one's tough I'm not going to lie I honestly don't know if it's gonna okay we got the LOM noodles orange chicken fried rice like that's crazy and like the portions as far as I can see that's pretty bang on with with what I would say it would be interesting to like weigh that all out and compare it but this is like pretty bang on and then boom you just hit um log and it'll instantly log it into into your food log it's as easy as that guys and it's like it's super powerful and it takes away a lot of the guess work and then um helps overcome like obstacles that you guys would typically have when it comes to tracking your food it just makes it so much easier um but also like I'm not gonna lie guys I'm not going to lie and say that it has 100% accuracy it obviously can't catch anything that the camera can't see like butter or any foods that are covered up but it is pretty damn impressive with how accurate it is most of the time not only with identifying foods but also estimating the portion sizes and the calories I've even compared it to the eyeballs over our head dietitian and let's just say she's got some serious competition and also in the event that it doesn't properly recognize the foods you can always edit the log to change the food that I guessed or you can just rescan the meal and it'll you usually get it right the second time but like all the features that I went through guys it's only going to get better and more accurate with your guys' feedback and data trust me this is just the beginning we're on The Bold mission to create the world's smartest Fitness coach so that we can make transforming your body as simple and as easy as possible and this is honestly like a huge

embarking on an amazing fitness journey yourself but you're going to play an active role in helping us improve the product to make it more and more powerful and that is truly what excites me the most so if you guys haven't joined yet go to buildwi sound.com or click the link that I pinned in the chat you get two weeks free to try it out and this week only we're giving you 25% off your plan plus only for those watching this live stream use code Liv stream for an additional 20% off again this is the best deal we're ever going to have so take advantage of it while you still can okay so there are so many other features that I can talk about with the app but I just want to now take some time to do a Q&A and answer some of the questions that you guys have been asking and we've been collecting a bunch so I'll go through them but first i'm going to ask something from you it's 2025 the start of a new year and you're here for a reason you're not satisfied with where you're currently at and you know that you can do more and be more but I want you to actually commit to a better you in 2025 whether it's in Fitness or any area of your life so type I commit into the live chat right now by writing this you're making a promise to yourself and joining a community of people that are ready to take action I want to see the chat flooded with it so take these next 10 seconds make the commitment type I commit in the live chat and I'm going to be right back for the Q&A 10 three two all right guys dang you guys are awesome the live chat is flooding with I commit I love this let's go you guys are awesome okay so I've been collecting a bunch of the questions that have been coming in so I'm going to go through them and then I also have a set of questions that are just the common questions that we get about the app that I want to go through um but you guys are awesome like seeing you guys commit in the chat like that makes me so happy you guys are kicking off 2025 the right way so drop your questions in the live chat I'm just going to pick a few to go through and I'm just going to go through some of the ones that we've been collecting one of them this came up like three times is where do I get my blue tank top and this is totally unrelated to the app but I mean I wear this in pretty much every single video and to be honest I'm not 100% sure where exactly I got this tankto from I remember back when I was younger I went to the states I think the store was called Pon I was like 19 years old bought it started wearing it for videos and it was like it fits great and it's super simple for me it's like I wake up I film and it's like what do I wear I'm G wear this so that's the story of the tank top I don't have a link where to buy it unfortunately if I lose this one I'm screwed so yeah okay what else we got here can we dang you guys are awesome you're still going with the i commits let's go so can app integrate with Garmin so in terms of app Integrations we have it integrated with apple health and then also Google fit and right now we're able to pull activity steps uh because we need that in order to provide you guys with the most accurate recommendation for um your calorie intake and we have plans to start pulling more and more data but that's what we're using as a baseline because that really is the most important metric that we need right now in the app could you focus on growing glutes from Elizabeth Patrick 100% so I showed you guys like a demo earlier about the onb boarding process and uh during that process you basically just pick okay what muscle do I really focus on um so for me I pick chess and for you you simply pick glutes and then the app is automatically going to create uh the workout plan based on the area that you want to prioritize and if you don't want to prioritize any if you just want to have balance development then you pick the balance option do we need to go to the gym or can it accommodate home workouts from Franco so really good question and uh again you might have missed it in the demo that I did earlier but basically in the app you just tell it what equipment you do or don't have and then it's instantly going to create a work go plan based on what you have so whether you have a full gy maybe you're just working out at home with a few dumbbells maybe just have your body weight right um the app will create a workout plan just based on what you have let's see what else we got if you already have the built with science program can you still log into the app so if you have uh the built with science program and you get the app you can still use the existing workouts from the program into the app but we have up ated the app with a um a more updated algorithm to to create your workouts just based on the late of science so there might be slight discrepancies within it but once you're into the program once once you're into the app you just customize your workout to match it to what you were doing before if you want who did the software thing of the app not sure what software you're referring to there's a lot of different software in there um but we had some really really small smart smart people in all different Industries come together to build something truly powerful for you guys does the app help me grow chest Levi Smith 100% I mean I'm roof of it like I set the app to focus more on my chess it did all the work for me I literally just followed it and I'm not kidding like my chest has seen the most most growth than it ever has just because it was really smart with how it um how it allocated my weekly volume in terms of the different muscle groups Barbara your customer service has been great thank you so much we have a few people who are who hate me right now because their jobs have been crazy ever since we launched the app but thank you so much it's something that I really prioritize and like honestly when I when I buy a product and the customer service that you get after once they take your money and if if it's not good like I hate that and I wanted to do something about that it's not easy but thank you it means a lot can you adjust muscle growth Focus after you start yes and so that's actually one of the main things that we built into the app is maybe initially your goal is to lose fat right but once you've I don't know maybe you got your sixpack abs or maybe you got to 15% body fat whatever your goal is once you're done with that fat phase you can easily transition within the app to either maintain or then focus on building muscle and the app will guide you throughout that process right um the nutrition coach will help you tweak a nutrition plan to switch goals so if you go from Fat Loss to building muscle it'll do all the work for you right what else we got will the account apply after the twoe trial yes TCA can you produce a veggie based protein powder no way um oh seriously I didn't mean no way you're saying no way no dairy uh it's it's it could be on the road map not the Focus right now we've been so focused on on just building the app um but it's not off the table and pan buil with has built the best finish C tracking app all in one great job thank you so much appreciate that what else we got Nicole Martin congrats on this Jeremy you work so hard it's amazing seeing you developing these awesome things thank you so much means a lot all right what other questions we have one is workout customization after your workout plan is cre created can you customize it so the workout algorithm what it does is it generates uh the best workout based on your body and all the um inputs that you're giving the app and then after that you're totally able to customize it however you wish right we provide you with our best recommendation but it's not like you have to stick to that 100% so you can swap the exercises you can edit the sets and Reps you can play around with the exercise order you can add more volume here and there you can add another workout if you want to or more exercises so we provide you with that that base template but you're free to customize that how you wish and there's also an option this is more so for like intermediate and advanced users where you can build a custom workout from scratch and that's something I wouldn't recommend if you're you're a beginner novice in the gym because I want to be able to provide that science B guidance for you but it is an option for those who are a little bit more advanced all right I would love to see your road map and be excited of the new features coming in the future is there a way we can submit features and have an upvote system 100% so we actually have uh we actually beta launch this app to our existing Bill science customers feedback was amazing and um we already made a lot of improvements to the app based on what they said and we actually have a private Discord group for app users only and on there you can see uh the features that we are working on and the road map and you can actually vote on okay like Jeremy I think this one is what we're most excited for and then we'll use that um going forward cool all right keep the questions com this I'm gonna get to as many as I can and I do have some collected ones that I also want to go through so I want to go through that as well um one of them a super common question that I get is I've already tried calorie counting in the past using apps like my fitness pal so how exactly is built with science plus different and this is a great question and to answer this let me pop up how over here so he like many of you guys watching had already tried counting his calories in the past but he never really saw any results and he also found it just super tedious so he was investing a lot more time into it every day than he wanted to but this is how within a year of joining B with science and after losing over 40 pounds of so what made all the difference well the problem with calorie accounting abs like my fitness pal is that it's all that's all it does like you track your food but it doesn't actually provide science back coaching the other problem is that if us an app like my fitness pal or any calorie counter online the initial calorie Target you get that's just an estimation so even with our app we do an initial estimation of how many calories you should be eating but it's always prone to error no matter how complex we make the Alm the only way to find out if that calorie Target is appropriate for your body is to see how your body responds to the calorie intake we give you and that is the difference with the sence plus we not only give you an initial nutrition plan and targets but every single week we're assessing your progress to see if your targets are actually correct based on your body and your changing metabolism so with how his calorie Target actually changed quite a bit from when he started because his metabolism was changing and although it sounds complex all he had to do was listen to what we told him and he continued losing fat every single week Plus in the app we also made it as easy as possible for you to track your calories we've built in features where you can easily copy a meal from the day before you can scan barcodes of packages and of course of course there's the AI meal scanner which I showed you earlier where you literally just take a picture of your food and it'll instantly log it because let's be honest if you're out at a restaurant or eating with the family the last thing that you want to do is whip out a scale and start weighing everything I wanted to make it as easy as possible for you guys to stay on track and lastly let's not forget that apps like my fitness pal they only focus on the food side of things but your training needs to complement your nutrition and they need to work together that is how you're going to get the best results because if how over here if he lost 40 pounds using our nutrition plan but without our science back training plan as well trust me he would look a lot different in his after photo and not in a good way and the beauty about B science plus is that everything is all in one science back science back coaching with both your nutrition and your training all you need is one app that will take care of all the guest work for you and guys you can go sign up right now at buildwi science.com I also pinned the link in the live chat and in the description thousands of people have already signed up during the live stream and today it's crazy but we're giving you guys two weeks compl completely free to try it out no strings attached because I know you guys are going to love it as soon as you try it and if you end up signing up for this week only you get 25% off plus because you're watching this live stream I'm giving you guys a special code for an additional 20% off just use the code live stream at checkout but make sure you go to the website not the app door if you want to use this code so take advantage of it while you still can trust me you're not going to regret it but let me go back to the live chat and we'll see what other questions we got going just put them into the live chat I'm gonna try to cover as many as I can okay from Mark the app can it avoid exercises you have bad knees yes so one of the things with the app is that once it creates your initial workout plan you can easily swap an exercise for any alternative and many of the exercises within there are labeled with knee friendly friendly elbow friendly so that way if you have netive Ops here and there you can always find an alternative that will suit you and your body all right Socrates mosow answer this and I'll pay for the app ASAP okay if I do push pull legs with your trainer can I use the app with only one workout day without knowing what I will do the other three days man you got to give me some more detail here I'm not fully understanding the question but if you use our custom workout feature you can create whatever plan that you want let's say it's your trainer's plan that you're following you can put it in there so hopefully that answers your question and you got to sign up okay what else Raj can the app know if your form is right so we have exercise form tutorials for every single uh exercise in your these are super detailed I mean you guys have seen just how detailed the exercise form videos I do on YouTube are it's the exact same thing with the app and there's many exercises that you're not going to find anywhere else um in terms of how it's going to know if your form is correct aside from the videos that's actually one of the future I don't I don't want to share too much about it but that's actually one of the future updates that we're working on is the ability for us to actually tell are you using the proper form so that is one of the things that we have on the road map again I don't want to share too much but if you join the app you can see the road map and you can actually provide your direct input on the features that we're building and uh what else you would like to see and you're actually going to be one of the first people to be able to test those new features too um what else we got J corner will the app adjust your weights and Reps based on Progressive overload yes so that is honestly one of my favorite features of the app because it literally mimics as if myself or a science based coach was coaching you every single week and we created a really really smart algorithm which basically uses your last week's data and it'll it'll determine okay this week Jeremy you should lift this much do this much weight and do this this many reps um and it takes care of all the guess work for you right so yes Progressive overload every week all the guest work is taken care of for you dney Kareem should I buy this from the website or on the app buy it from the website the app if you buy it on the app like they take a huge cut um which is why the the price of the app is a lot higher from the App Store so go website I pinned it in the live chat and then there you can also use the code uh live stream at checkout to get an additional 20% off Jasmine does it have Mobility exercises as well yes so we have uh Mobility prehab routines in there as well as ab workouts and basically these are designed to supplement the weights workouts that you have in there I mean you guys know from my videos especially my OG subscribers how much I uh focus on mobility and and prehab because it's not just about the weights yes that takes care of a lot of things but supplementing with the right Mobility exercises can make the world of difference as well so yes that's in there aw is there a weight gain option for meal plans so yes the once you do our onboarding it'll determine the rate amount of calories for you and then if you go to the meals and the recipes you can filter the meals based on calorie amounts so if you want like 800 900 calorie meal because you have um a lot of calories to hit to hit your go weight gain then you can do that all right keep the questions coming guys Alice dare please answer ASAP is this app suitable for teenagers yes I wish I had this as a teenager I would have like man I think about it often you know how much more jacked would I be today if I had this app when I was a teenager so you guys are lucky but yes teenagers okay all right keep the questions coming I'm going to go back to some of the collected questions that I have because these come up quite a bit the next one I want to cover is how long does it take to get results with the app and this is uh this is a super common question and I'm not going to sit here and say you guys are GNA get a sixpack or completely jacked and weak because even with the smartest most effective approach these things take time like you didn't get to your current shape overnight so you're not going to be able to reverse it that quick either but I will say compared to the results that you guys are probably getting with your current approach I guarantee it'll be so much faster and in terms of specific timelines most of you will start seeing visual results in as little as three to four weeks but for major Transformations you're looking at least 8 to 16 weeks and let me show you some examples so Andre went from 23% to 11 % body fat in just four months now 11% body fat is lean guys that is leaner than 99% of men so four months to achieve that is actually very impressive and that's actually what you can expect if you consistently follow the plan just as we lay it out for you but what's interesting about Andre is he's super meticulous and so before before jordany built with science he would track his weight on a spreadsheet over time which I'll try to pop up and so he tried all sorts of different different workout and diet programs but as you can see in his weight on his spreadsheet it didn't budge and in fact it actually increased a little bit but when he put a marker of when he started built with science you can see boom his weight instantly dropped from the initial plan we gave him and it continued dropping with our ongoing guidance because you see guys like the problem with most Fitness plans he tried before is they didn't enough guidance he said that most plans would either just focus on workouts or they'd come with some kind of generic nutrition that just didn't have enough instructions or was just way too extreme but with his built with science program we not only gave him a step-by-step plan to start out with but we modified it over time as we learn more and more about his body this way he never reached a plateau and he was able to consistently lose fat every single week until he reached his goal and the best part is he thought this would be super timec consuming but because everything was just laid out for him to follow it was so much easier and way less time than he thought it would be I'm telling you guys with the app all you have to do is show up follow the plan and the results will quickly follow and I also want to show another example of this but with my own transformation so I recently relied on the build with science Plus app to guide me through my diet for the first time ever and after 12 weeks of just following what the app told me I was able to go from 16% body fat to 11% body fat 11.6 normally this would be a tough process and I'd reach plateaus in several weeks with my fat loss would just stall right but with the app it could actually sense when my metabolism was slowing down and it would adjust my nutrition based on that so I never actually got stuck once and I'm not kidding it was by far the easiest and fastest diet I've ever done because I had all the guess work done for me but that said guys I don't want you to get too attached to specific timelines because it also depends on your goal for example building muscle is a much slower process than fat loss so Kareem over here he took about a year to get his incredible transformation adding around 20 pounds of muscle so while you will get results much faster than you are right now I want to be transparent it really does depend on your goal and also your commitment and at the end of the day it's going to take time like most people fail with their Journey because they're impatient they expect amazing results right away and when they don't see any progress after just a week or two they quit and then they fall for the next fad and I don't want you guys to fall into that trap this year the key is to stick to the plan and the process I promise you if you just simply stick to what the app tells you you're G to get amazing results it may take as little as four weeks it may take 16 weeks or may even take a whole year to see the big change that you're after but don't let that stop you because one year from now in 2026 do you really want to be in the exact same position that you are right now literally looking and feeling the exact same because you were overthinking everything and never took action don't let that happen guys I want you to start your fitness journey today just go to bill with science talk or click the link I put in the chat again guys you get two weeks free to try it out and this week only we're giving you 25% off your plan plus since you're watching this live stream use code Liv stream for an additional 20% off again guys this is the best deal we're ever GNA have so take advantage of it while you still can and also by the way guys this is super fun for me it's my first ever YouTube live stream and I'm honestly having a blast just interacting with you guys and I hope you guys are having some fun too huge shout out to everybody who has already joined the app honestly it's it's a huge moment for me and I'm just really pumped for everyone who has joined but let me go back to the live chat and we'll see what other questions we got Jaws Alex does a work work in Mexico yes worldwide B venos I know a little bit of Spanish I took him in high school Zachary ho how long should the cut last so the belt with science app will kind of guide things for you but honestly it depends it depends on how much fat you have and then also how lean you want to get so it could last anywhere from like four to 20 plus weeks it really depends Mr Buffalo does how quickly you get to shape very person to person despite uh other factors like exercise or Diet yes I mean there's a genetic component to it and mainly the variation has to do with with muscle growth but in terms of fat loss right if you follow the the right plan then as long as you're consistent like you're going to be able to lose fat at the same rate that anybody else would I wouldn't see any reason not and the beauty about the app is that it takes care of all the variables for you right you have your steps your activity you have your nutrition you have your workouts it takes all that into consideration provides you with the best plant so I wouldn't yeah there there shouldn't be too much too much difference in terms of like other people in terms of the fat lws it really depends on the consistency and how good of a plan you're using what else we got Christian is the app buy one for Lifetime or is it a subscription model so if a subscription the programs that I had before those were one time for Lifetime access but the app is a subscription highly recommend that you get the annual subscription um that's GNA just give you the most bang for your buck and also use the code live stream at checkout for an additional 20% off with all things considered it's going to be uh around $950 per month and honestly like for an investment into yourself that's nothing compared to what you can get after just a year of of following it um I mean imagine how much you spend on just like your meals and even coffee like Starbucks I feel like a Starbucks coffee is almost $9.50 nowadays um so yeah and I'm getting a lot of questions about people asking the codes aren't working the live stream code uh honestly it can be tricky to find if especially on your when you're on mobile so on the checkout just look around there should be a drop down to enter your code on desktop is pretty clear so maybe try on desktop and make sure you're going through uh builtwith science.com to get the app rather than the App Store but that said you know as somebody said before our customer service is amazing and they're working hard right now to help you guys on boarded so just send an email to support at builtwithscience decom or contact at builtwith science.com and they will get you st ASAP Justin I bet Starbucks will hit nine bucks this year I'd be curious you know we fast forward five years from now will a coffee regular coffee be over $10 probably it's crazy okay your website makes no mention of the app it says try risk free makes you do the questionnaire and then buy the old plan I'm going to check with uh there might be let me check it seems like some people are being redirected to the programs instead of the app after the quiz uh I'm just checking with our support just to make sure we can get that sorted but if you are seeing the old programs I apologize I'm going to try to get a link uh that goes directly to the app that you guys can get but I just sent a message to our Tech and just to figure out what's going on okay let's go to the next question I have noted down which is I'm super busy and even if the plan is good I'm not sure if I have the discipline to stick to it 100% And that's a very valid concern because like honestly guys I could give you the best science back training and nutrition plan but it's going to be useless if you can't actually stick to it right but that's why my goal with the app was to create a fitness coach that not only uses the latest science to develop your plan but it also personalizes it based on your lifestyle and what what you can realistically stick to it's why we buildt things like time-saving workouts where all you need is 30 minutes in the gym in your workout routines there's also options to work out just three times a week in fact even just two times a week is plenty to still see amazing results that's literally just a couple hours a week in the gym and even for example if you don't have time or the energy to make it to the gym just use our workout generator to create a body weight workout or a workout using whatever equipment that you have at home and same thing with nutrition guys I tried to make it as easy and as convenient as possible for you guys to stay on track we have quick and easy FIV minute meal recipes for you to whip up we've got the AI scanner where you literally just log your meals with a picture and we got so much more because guys like I'm not trying to make Fitness a full-time job for you I wanted to create where even the busiest individual who doesn't have superum willpower or discipline can still get incredible results and a lot of people are under the impression that you have to stick to a plan 100% to get results but that's not true within the app we teach you a concept called The Power of 60% and there's a lot of research to back this up but basically if you can just stick to the plan 60% of the time you can still get amazing results so avoid the All or Nothing mindset I don't expect you to make it to every single workout without fail or stay on track with your meal every single day don't just take my word for it though I want to show you guys an example here with Matt so after getting married and having kids Matt's life just got super busy and he started neglecting his health right happens to the best of us um but eventually he reached the heaviest weight that he had ever been and he wanted to change so he ended up trying all kinds of stuff keto intermittent fasting and putting together Fitness plans that he found online but nothing really worked and he found that a lot of the plans that he tried using they were just unrealistic for him to stick to you but after join and built with science we created a plan for him that actually suited his busy lifestyle right we gave him quick and easy meals to whip up and a quick yet efficient workout routine and he didn't have to be perfect either there were several weeks where he missed his workouts and fell off track with his meals completely he even had a new born throughout the process but what's more important is that every time he veered off a plan he just got right back on track and just did what he could and just like that now he's in the best shape of his life so while it is going to require commitment and effort on your end even if you're super busy and not a crazy disciplined person we've built the app to work for you but again guys the first step is just to take action so if you haven't yet go to buildwi science.com or go to the link I put in the live chat and the description box and you'll get two weeks completely fre free to try it out to see if you like it plus you're G to get 25% off your plan for launch week and only for those watching the live stream because I so badly just want to help you guys succeed this year just use the code Liv stream at check out for an additional 20% off again guys it's the best deal we're ever going to have so please take advantage of it while you still can okay what other questions we got power of three spell will there be an update to add our own recipes so we uh within the nutrition part of the app you can actually create your recipe from scratch and you can create your own meals so that way once it's saved you can just click those to log it you can edit it however you wish and over time we are definitely thinking about building uh expanding the meal database so that other people like yourselves chefs can help contribute and provide meals or recipes for other users to use D Falcon does the app use AI to make schedule so like here's the thing about AI guys AI is really good at certain things and it helps enable us to do things that if I tried to build from scratch it would just be a nightmare for example the AI meal scanner that's a perfect example of where we can leverage AI to make the app more powerful but there's other areas of the app where it's much better if I can just use my knowledge and collaborate with with experts within the field to create an algorithm that does even better job and one that more importantly that you guys can trust right because I'm sure a lot of you guys use chat jpt but it can be hit or missed a lot of times and would you really trust like going to chat jpt to create your full workout plan I mean it'll do it will do a good job and you guys probably wouldn't notice but for an expert like myself looking at that I can see like okay like you probably shouldn't have done this or this is a little bit weird right so again the app is grounded in science and so we use AI where we feel that it can help but most of the other stuff the really really itty gritty stuff that's all reverse engineered from from the top science and top coaches in the world from Ludo oh man where are you from ludovi Ki I told probably totally totally butchered that I don't know if that's Italian but that's a cool name uh can I input my current workout routine and then ask the app to adjust the Reps and weights depending on my workout Port results 100% dude so again uh I mentioned this earlier but in the onboarding we create a workout plan for you which you can customize however you want and you can also build a program from scratch let's say you're following a program right now and you just want to use the app um to put your program into and start start uh recording tracking the app will still apply the progressive overload algorithm to the program that you're following right so after your first week as long as you log your data it'll start telling you um okay like lift this much do this many reps it'll start coaching you every single week so you don't have to be using the exact plan that that we give you Abram plumber just started the program super excited to get ripped for my sister's wedding in May let's go perfect timing dude I'm excited to see your progress exclusive 21 can you send a pick to the app so it knows if you should bulk or cut so we actually we have a visual uh body fat estimation and that's where you want to pick that and it'll ask you some goals to to determine the best approach for you that is a cool feature though and it is something that we have noted down still playing around with it um but if you sign up you know you're G to get access to all the future updates that we have later down the road Asahi Yamato can you Flex for our motivation all right let's see how that's looking ah this is my left it's my it's my weaker side but hopefully I gave you guys a little show okay prank watching from India what's up man Vancouver Canada here what time is it up in India asah dang bro you ripped thanks bro glad you like that all right let's keep the questions coming I broke the camera thanks dude um let's keep the questions coming in live chat I just want to go back to some of the other collected questions that I have this one actually came up in the live chat quite a bit too but I have a shoulder injury so I can't do SE exercises will I still be able to use the app and great question so one of my goals with the app was to make the workouts as personalized as possible and help you overcome any obstacles that may have typically stopped you from working out in the past and injuries is a huge one but the thing about injuries is that there's ways to work around them if you're really smart with how you program your workouts Dominic here is a perfect example so he used to struggle staying consistent in the gym because as soon as he made progress he injured his shoulder would flare up or his knee would get nagging pain but after join a bit with science he's not only leaner and more muscular than he's ever been but believe it or not he's actually lifting lighter weights than he was before and all his nagging pain went away and you see Dominic used to just try to copy what he'd see other people do at the gym but despite working out for years he never really got the results he wanted and whenever he do certain exercises it just didn't feel right and he would end up Hur hting his shoulders and knees as soon as he went a little heavier but as soon as he joined B science he not only learned the right way to do his exercises but we showed him a few simple swaps to his exercises so that he was still able to work his Target muscles but without aggravating his injuries and after implementing this he immediately started feeling the right muscles working his nagging injuries eventually went away and his muscles actually started responding and growing way better than they had in the past and with the app guys it's super simple and it's all taken care of for you so every exercise you just tap to pop up the Forum video which is going to show you how to maximize your gains without getting injured and if you do have something like a shoulder injury or an elbow injury you just tap the swap Icon and boom you're G to get a list of Alternatives and some of them are labeled with tags like shoulder friendly or knee friendly so you know exactly which one to choose if you have an injury and that way you can still work the same Target aggravating your joints because guys like so much of getting results is just about staying consistent I mean we did a poll in live chat you saw like the biggest struggle you guys had was staying consistent and believe me there's nothing more that'll hold you back than injuries but there are ways to work around around them and avoid them holding you back okay any more questions let's go are there options for vegetarians I don't even need eggs yes so in the meals uh part of the recipes uh sorry in the meals part of the app you're G to see um a bunch of meals that that you can filter based on uh whether you're vegetarian vegan or meat and that is something that we're constantly updating and going to improve Levi Smith could the app give me workout tips yes for sure um the app gives you all kinds of tips man but yeah like you one thing I actually haven't mentioned this whole live stream is uh within the app like I didn't want to just tell you guys what to do I wanted to teach you the why behind it and so we actually have daily lessons within the app um there's over 200 of them in total but basically it just teaches you a little bit about some science-backed uh training and nutrition tips and hacks that you can start applying but again the main goal was like I didn't want to just like provide you with a workout meal plan that and just like leave you with it right I wanted to teach you the why behind it so that you were empowered to actually WR lifestyle changes and be able to eventually you know maybe you don't even need the app anymore right that was that was my goal I didn't want to just hand you something and leave you to it it's like I want to teach you and Empower you with with the knowledge na is this program females can use 100% we have a ton of female members in there and um once you're in the app that's actually why we ask uh gender we're gonna modify a few things in terms of the workouts and nutrition based on your gender nap Coro is the app available in the Philippines hell yeah dude we got lots of Philippino Peno in the app I'm actually half Filipino so shout out um yes con 13 if I don't log in my food but use my fitness pile will that affect the stats so we have a quick ad feature within our app which is basically like one button you just tell us how many calories you ate that day so that would still that would be enough uh for our nutrition coach to still provide you with guidance and uh tell you if that Target is correct over time so that's how I would use it if you still use my fitness pal and use our app but once you get the app you're going to be like okay like why am I using my fitness P right what's the app called built with science plus uh what are the advantages to the App instead of a inperson trainer this one from dusk Falcon that's actually a good question and to be honest there's stuff like the app uh can't do that an in-person uh trainer can do at least for now um but the beauty about the app guys is like I mean first of all inperson trainers are really expensive um but the other thing is that like it's also hard to find somebody who's really good like how do you guys know if you can actually trust the advice of the imperson trainer that you get it's like ridiculously easy to become a personal trainer I know because I did it as soon as I was 18 I was like shocked with how easy and quick it was um so I would say like the app is just like you can trust you can trust everything that is is coming from it is science backed and again the app was not just a tracking app it's a coaching app I literally wanted to replace the need for you guys to go out and and find a coach with this app and it's only going to get better and better and we're only going to be able to better mimic um having an actual real human science pack coach along with you every step of the way see we got zenes also from the Philippines shout out comment in the live chat if you guys are from the Philippines chrish B I already purchased intermediate shred program a few months ago will I see it automatically um no so this is totally separate so you're going to want to sign up for the app and then that's going to give you a separate login you can still use the same email but you have to just create account again Chris harness TV ignorant American question how do you pronounce your last name guess I know all you guys are thinking Ethier right but no don't say that okay I'm pretty sure I even say that in some of my videos just because it's like easy to understand but it's French so it's e I'm pretty sure like the legit ways like it's like something super French game X I have the app it is really good worth it thanks bro appreciate it [Music] okay asah Yamato how long did it take you to get so jacked I want to be like that too uh you know man I don't know it's a common question I have in for myself it's like if I if I actually follow like if I had this app when I was 18 how long would it have taken me to get to the level that I'm now definitely would have been a lot shorter so I'm not going to give you a timeline but I will say join the app it's going to be a lot shorter than it would be without it all right let's go back to some of the collected questions that I have here here so the next question I have here is can I still make progress if I lift weights in the app but I don't track what I eat so this is another really common question that I get and you think because you're crushing it at the gym you can get away with eating whatever you want or not tracking anything but guys if you actually want to see results % is going to come from your workouts and 80% is going to come from your nutrition and the single most important thing you can do with your nutrition is just to start track in it because it's not just about what you eat it's about how much you're eating as well and Shane here is a perfect example of this so he focused so much on weights but neglected his diet in fact when he first joined our bitless Science Program he had no idea what protein fats and carbs really even meant but the program it laid it all for him and it started teaching him so he learned how to track his nutrition he learned the right foods to eat and how much of them to eat based on his body and boom just like that he went from 25% to 10% body fat in nine months it's why in our app we take care of all of this for you right we make it super easy to track your nutritional workouts all in one again like I showed you we even have a camera scanner so all you have to do is take pictures of what you're eating and the app will log everything for you and tell you if you need to adjust anything I'm telling you guys it's the balance between workouts and diets that's key if you've never taken your diet seriously or followed a proper science back plan you are going to get amazed with the results that you get and how simple the process really is it's all it's all laid out there for you and guys you don't have to go all in right away either it's perfectly fine to just start with training or the nutrition first and then once you build some consistency in one area move on to the next and go from there and that's actually what chaned it he first started using our workouts and then once he was ready he started applying the INRI plan and Bam that's when his results really started taking off so join the app start with the workouts and just maybe read through our nutrition lessons and then once you're ready jump into your nutrition plan it doesn't have to be all or nothing but the key guys is to get started and now it's the perfect time stop delaying and take action like invest in a better you for 2025 you're here for a reason just go to bwi.com or click the link I pinned in the chat again you get two weeks free to try it out and this week only we're giving you 25% off your plan plus since you're watching this live stream use code live stream for an additional 20% off again this is the best deal we're ever going to have so take advantage of it while you still can but so far I am just super pumped for all the people who have joined you guys have been amazing I can see all the notifications the people who have joined the app so far and it's crazy you guys are awesome shout out to everybody who's joined uh but let's see what other questions we got okay how long is this deal before it expires this week only is the is the launch deal and then after that it's going to be done and then also the live stream code we're going to wrap that up too Mr Buffalo been loving the app since November now I'm trying get the whole family to get it to shout out dude I appreciate that okay and then let's go to let's go to another common question that I get um does it work for skinny fat body types and this is an interesting question and basically skinny fat is a body type where you're skinny and you don't have much muscle but you also have a lot of excess fat mainly stubborn fat that's covering your belly your left handles and maybe your chest for example so on the one end you look skinny but you're also soft and it's a trick body type because your body needs more muscle but it also needs to lose fat but the beauty about the new app guys is that in the onboarding will be able to tell the best approach based on your body and many of you are probably using an approach that just isn't optimize as well as it could be and when you start using the program in the app it's very likely you'll be able to build muscle and lose fat at the same time and here's a perfect example of this with steel so he started out with what You' call like a skinny fat body type right right now would you believe me if I said he weighs the exact same weight in both photos you see to get lean and muscular you want to lose fat and build muscle and usually if you lose fat you lose weight and if you build muscle you gain weight but if both happens at the same time your weight will actually stay the same and that's exactly what happened to steel and it's actually very common in people who join the build of science programs because For the First Time in their lives they're following a proper optimized training nutrition program but it can get it can get confusing because the weight scale just doesn't budge so steel here even though he was seeing amazing results he was confused why his weight wasn't changing and he actually thought he was doing something wrong but the last thing you want to do is change things when your body is going through this phase it usually lasts about three to four months and you want to ride it out as long as you can to re the benefits and that's why the build with science Plus app we not only design your program to maximize your odds of losing fat and building muscle at the same time but we also have a built-in way to detect if You Are by asking you a few questions to deeper if we sense that your weight has stall otherwise if we just relied on how your weight is changing we wouldn't be able to really understand what's happening and might actually make the wrong assumptions but guys we design the app to detect where you're currently at and then create a plan that is best suited to your body so whether you're overweight and you need to lean down whether you're skinny and need to pack on size or maybe you're somewhere in the middle and you just need to lose fat while building muscle the app will do all that for you the system we built has worked for all types of body types and starting points again all you have to do is trust the process and again guys two weeks free try it and see for yourself just head to buildwi science.com don't forget to use the code live stream or checkout for an additional 20% off and I want to move on to the next question I have noted down which is what I'm doing right now I'm sitting but basically I sit all day for work and I don't move much will this be a problem so the thing is most of our bill science members they have desk jobs they're usually Engineers or Tech professionals who sit all day but comment in the live chat what you guys do for a living but believe it or not I spend most of the day sitting because I'm always writing editing working on the app and I'm not gonna lie it's not ideal for transforming your body but there's still ways to get amazing results even if you sit most of the day and JP here is a perfect example of this so after covid he started working from home and ended up sitting a lot more than he used to which led to a lot of weaking but to fix this he started searching around the internet and he put together a workout program using tips that he got from a few different YouTubers and Instagram influencers but still his body didn't change and it wasn't until he joined bu science did he realize that he had to start making changes to his diet and once he made a few simple changes to his diet combined with the training plan we gave him his body quickly transformed and he was able to get around 15% of body fat and actually see ABS in a matter of months but it's not like JP starved himself right he was still able to eat cheesecake chocolate and still enjoy the foods that he loved but he learned how to fit those in moderation and make that work with his plan and that's why with the bu of science Plus app we focused heavily on not just training but nutrition as well and we put it into one powerful app you literally just tell the app how active you currently are and what your body stats are and it's going to take care of all the guests work for you and just like JP did all you have to do is follow the plan and Trust the process again guys you can join today try it yourself you get two weeks for free plus 25% off your plan for launch week and only for those guys watching use the code live stream a checkout for an additional 20% off and again huge shout out to everybody who's joined the app so far super proud of you guys you're kicking off 2025 the most amazing way I'm pumped for you guys Egon can I still use your program while I'm from Sweden 100% worldwide the app is designed to work with wherever you are in the world the Curious dad can I continue doing f45 with your program yes just make sure that your Apple health is is synced with it so we can pull your steps your activity and then if you want you uh f45 is more cardio so I would still use the weights uh with our app and then you can use f45 mainly for the cardio workouts or outside of but I would highly recommend that you at least do a couple strength focused ex uh workouts in our app um otherwise if you just exclusively want train with f45 then I would use that and then use our app with the nutrition coaching side of things from pan not sure if this has been asked is there going to be a social aspect out of the app to add friends join groups Etc 100% that is in the road map um and again like once you join that is literally just the beginning right and you're going to see a full feature road map be able to vote on what you want to see in the future but yeah 100% man and one of the things that we actually recently added for the new year um we're actually rolling this out for a workout video that I'm doing I'm releasing this weekend but your workout plan if you create it into your app um there's a share button right and that'll generate a link so you can literally create whatever workout program that you want or have us create a plan for you in the app and then one click of a button you can share that with a friend and if they're on the app you guys can literally do the exact same plan and we're only going to make that bigger and better with some of the stuff that you said as well you know add friends join groups do challenges but yeah definitely in the road map it just makes it a lot more fun right okay let's go to the next question I have down another Super common question do I have to follow a strict meal plan my family sometimes cooks for me and I also still want to go out to eat and this honestly comes out a lot and guys I just want to make this clear the problem with a lot of Fitness and Nutrition plans out there is they just aren't sustainable sure you might get really good results in eight weeks following a super strict meal plan work routine but like what happens after eventually you just get right back to where you started because there's no way you can stick to that plan plan long term so our approach with buil with science plus was to make sure you're using a sustainable plan that gets you results for life rather than short-term results where next year you're right here looking for another solution right so for example during my recent diet where I got down to 11% body fat I was still able to eat my favorite cheat meals like pizza and pastries and my Filipino mom who loves to host dinners and cook a bunch of Filipino food and desserts I was still able to fit that in and one of the tools that I used for this was the AI scanner right in the past when I diet I would try to avoid eating meals out as much as possible because I just didn't know how many calories were in them or if I did end up eating out I would try to estimate every single ingredient in the meal which just was annoying and tedious but with the AI scan scanner it was a breeze because I could just take a picture of my plate and it would instantly log it so I could fit it into my plant now this scanner doesn't mean calories don't count nor does it mean that you can eat huge cheat meals every single day but it's just an easy way to keep track of things when you're out or you're eating something that you can prepare and you can easily fit it into your diet right and one of the Hidden benefits of it too is that it trains you to be able to better estimate the calories in various foods and I want to take Greg here for example so at over 50 years old he managed to overcome what he thought were age limitations and get in the best shape of his life and one of the tools that helped him throughout this process was being able to eyeball Foods see he loves eating out and being social but the tricky part is whenever he would eat out he had no idea how many calories or protein he was eating so he'd end up eating way more than he thought he was and as a result he never really made any really good progress but once he started getting more familiar with the calorie and protein content in different foods he was able to make smarter decisions with his meals and more accurately estimate how much he was actually eating and it's actually an essential skill that he says allowed him to live a much more Balanced Life and still be able to eat out and be social without having to bring a weight scale or calculator with him and now with the build with science Plus app it's even easier right you just take a picture of your mail and it'll instantly log everything for you and lastly guys it's not just about the tracking right in the app we teach you simple modification you can make for meals that are cooked for you or meals that you eat out in order to better align them with your goals and it's simple things it's like adding a bit more proin to the meal or how to modify your order at a restaurant because at the end of the day these are the habits and skills that we're trying to teach you that will enable you to get results long term and not have to rely on tracking calories forever right and I want to move on to the next question that I have noted down and it's I ha cardio will I have to do a lot of it to lose fat okay Believe It or Not guys I'm in the same boat I don't want to admit it but I hate cardio yes especially run but check out Dylan here so he's one of the test users for our build with science Plus app and Dylan here got down to 10% body fat with no cardio just daily walks and I know what you're thinking can you really just walk your way to a six-pack and yes I'm telling you Dylan was always under the impression that to get lean you have to kill yourself doing a bunch of cardio workouts on top of your weights in the gym and I don't blame him I mean movies and social media it makes it seem like everyone who's in amazing shape is doing these crazy intense workouts right but that's honestly all just for show so once Dylan started built with science we set him a simple goal just walk 8,000 steps a day and at first he was skeptical although it was a few thousand steps more than he was currently taking per day it just felt way too easy right uh he just started going going for walks after every meal like a quick loop around his neighborhood for 10 minutes and that was it but he trusted the process and he got 8,000 steps a day consistently and that was all it took for him to Kickstart his fat loss and continue getting leaner and leaner all the way to 10% body fat now obviously obviously guys he had to pair this with the workouts and the diet plan that we set up for him but it works because guys again like it's more about what you can do consistently as opposed to doing crazy workouts or crazy diets that you'll never actually stick to and that's why in the build with I Plus app we not only set a daily step goal for you based on how active you currently are but we also sync the app with your phone so you can easily keep track of how active you are every day it also gives us the data we need to determine if we need to adjust your nutrition at all based on how active you're being on average and again again guys the theme I'm trying to drill in here in this live stream is that regardless of if you join the app or not it's if you really want to change your Fitness and see really good improvements in 2025 it's about making this a lifestyle and just making small changes here and there that over time lead to incredible results next year like I don't want you to be in the same spot that you are right now looking for another solution because you fell for something that was promise really fast results I designed built with science plus so that it would be the last Fitness solution you ever need but in order for it to work guys you got to get started and Trust the process so again you can try it at B signs.com I put the link in the live chat also in the description and you'll get two weeks completely free to try it out see if you like it plus 25% off your plan for launch week and only for those watching this live stream because I so badly just want to help you guys use the code live stream at check out for an additional 20% off it's an amazing deal it's the best deal we're going to have so please just take advantage of it while he's still at all right guys we are getting close to the end of the live stream yo dancing Lobster man you just gave me my first Super Chat ever appreciate the truth you spread where there's all the drunk Trends out there may love and peace be with you yo man you are awesome dude I really appreciate that that's the first Super Chat I've ever gone on my first live stream this a big moment serious dude okay what else we got over here Carlos I just signed in let's go the curest dad you have adobo or car car in your whe Pine is your app able to track them yes you can search it up in the database and you can also if you know the recipe you can create a custom recipe for it as well been using the build with ice Plus app for a month now really Game Changer from a fitness journey lifestyle zenes thank you man appreciate that Lexia Bell just downloaded count weed to get started let's go shout out deathclaw Jedi just got here and you're already getting to wrap things up curse my Gen X slowness hey man watch the replay but at least at least you at least you made it now better late than ever okay let's go through some of the final questions that I have I travel a lot and don't always have access to a gym will this be a problem super common question and traveling can honestly get in the way of things because maybe you only have access to a really basic Hotel gym or maybe no gym at all and on the nutrition side of things it's tough to prep your own meals but take Daniel here right incredible transformation now would you believe me if I said this transformation was done all just with resistance bands and his body weight see during covid like many of us he had no access to equipment but in his bill with science program we taught him how to make use of resistance bands and his body weight to challenge his muscles just as much as he normally would in the gym and the result he ended up building muscle while losing over 20 pounds of fat and dropping 11 inches off his Weist and the best part after covid he got back to his normal job which involves him traveling quite a bit but he used what we taught him so whether he only had access to light dumbbells at a hotel gym or maybe just his body weight and bands in his hotel room he was still able to get results by using the science back techniques we taught him and in the built with science Plus app we've taken this to the next level you just tell the app what equipment you have that day and it'll create a science back workout for you that maximizes what you have so for example with our workout generator you can create a gym workout routine for when you're home then when you're traveling you can just generate another workout routine when you're on the road again we designed the app to be super flexible and adapt to everything that may come up and the same with nutrition guys within the app we have lessons that teach you how to manage your food while you're on the road and of course we have our AI meal scanner so you can just snap a picture of your meals and it'll log it for you that way you can still you can see if you're still on track to hit your nutrition targets even if you can't cook and track all the meals how you normally would and let's go right into the next question I have which is is this app just for fat loss or is it for building muscle too and the app is definitely not just for fat loss basically in the onboarding we're gonna ask you we're GNA assess your current body stats we're going to ask you about your goals and then determine what the best approach is for you right so some of you might be on that skinny fat side and need to lose fat while also building muscle whereas others you might be more on that skinny side and would want to focus more on gaining weight and adding size but after the app gets your initial body stats and you set your goal it'll tailor both your workouts and nutrition towards that goal and here's a good example from Danny so Danny thought he was genetically destined to be skinny he knew nutrition was important but no matter what he ate and how much he atte he just couldn't put on size but after joining The Bu with science program we showed him the right foods to eat and also dialed in ex exactly how much he needed to eat based on his body and the unique thing about his built with science program is that it actually adjusted his nutrition targets as he got bigger and stronger to make sure he was continuing to progress in the result he built over 30 pounds of muscle something that old him would have never thought was possible for his body type so in the build with science Plus app you just tell it your goal and your body stats and it's going to take care of everything for you and the more you use it guys the smarter the app gets as it learns more about your body all all you all you all you have is just follow the plan as it lays out for you it's as simple as that and this is another example with Chucky so Chucky over here he actually weighs the exact same in both photos 145 pounds but in the before photo first the diet coach in the appic guided him through a fat loss phase where he ended up losing 10 pounds of fat and then the diet coach switched his goal to focus on building muscle where he gained 10 pounds of pretty much all muscle in about six months so even though he weighs the same he is way more muscle and way less fat and all we had to do was trust the diet coach that we built into the app it's going to guide you through all the different phases of your body transformation again guys all you have to do is tell your body stats and it's going to take care of everything for you and that's also why when you go to our site buildwi science.com we have a really extensive onboarding process and we have it in the app as well just so that we're getting all the data that we need from you to create the most personalized plan to provide you with the most accurate recommendations okay we are just getting ready to wrap up I want you guys to comment in the live chat where you're tuning in from I am in Vancouver Canada it's getting nice and chilly here I had to turn the heat off in the office so I've got some Goosebumps but comment in the live chat where you guys are tuned in from also comment the

would be best if you guys had separate accounts but technically I mean you could Joey Kish Jeremy where can we buy your tank tops man I answered this earlier maybe you didn't hear but I don't even know where we can buy this man it's it's one of one for now for now Elliot yes the code is live stream Alexander are there meals in the plan that suit people that work in the trades or on the road we have tons of different meals meals there you can probably find a bunch that um are going to be uh that can help accommodate to your lifestyle and we're only going to add more and more right but yeah there's tons of like really easy quick toake meals that you can easily bring on the road rean you're amazing thank you so much for sharing your knowledge yo shout out dude means a lot man Jonathan the link on the website is now fix let's go vegan and uh vegetarian meals yes we have a bunch of those as well um just answer your question Kaja there's in the meals you can filter it actually based on you'll see tags based on uh if it's vegan or or not plenty of options Grease Monkey tuners Siri BC I've heard uh Siri doesn't have the best rep here here in BC but shout out for joining dude let me know if it's overrated if people are you know more scared of Siri than they should be Seth do you wear deodorant of giving it up uh I definitely wear deodorant I would not advise giving it up tree frog does he app account for if you have long-term injuries so I I actually went through um a big injury question like 15 minutes ago and honey M lat Siri sucks um yeah so the injury question yes the the app does accommodate for it we have plenty of Alternatives and it's listed by um it can be shoulder friendly elbow friendly so whatever injury you have just hit the swap Icon it'll drop down a bunch of um Alternatives Mike Diaz what's up I've never been to Texas but I am planning to go I think next month okay KDA what what about coming back from an injury or strengthen your affected muscles yeah so there like I would just really rely heavily on the uh exercise form videos that way you don't get injured and the progressive over the workout coach within it it's going to make sure that you're pushing your workouts just the right amount so that you don't get injured again we also have mobility and prehab routines in there um which will do a lot in terms of like mobility and just making sure that um your it lowers the risk that you're going to reinjure yourself going down the road Daphne will the charge be taken out of your accounts after the free trial or before it will be taken out after but we just need the credit card just so we have it uh in case how does your app deal with injuries example can't do hammer curls due to elbow injury the Curious dad so you just swap it and you can swap it for uh one of the exercises that is uh elbow friendly and you'll have a tag and if that doesn't work you can swap it to any exercise within our database super flexible marang where can we download the app builtwith science.com I also put the link at the top of live chat and in the description Badger will it be able to run on Apple watch I'm not entirely sure we don't have the Apple Watch app yet but we do have uh we do have it synced with uh Apple health so we can pull the data that we need IA can you get great results from adjustable dumbbell only split yes 100% I think you're just referring to the equipment that you have but yes I mean I popped up a case study earlier of somebody who got amazing progress from literally just using dumbbells as long as you let the app take care of the exercise selection and programming for you you can get amazing results whether you just have body weight dumbbells or a full out gym all right guys I am a officially going to wrap it up but I just wanted to thank you guys for for coming in and you guys have started 2025 off like the perfect way and that honestly makes me so happy that all you guys showed up like wanting to

    "title": "The Easiest Way To Fix Your Posture At Home (Just 3 Exercises!)",
    "published_at": "2020-08-23T15:43:01Z",
    "transcript": "if you're watching this video on your phone or laptop right now then i'd be willing to bet that you're probably in the falling posture your back rounded forward and your head protruding outwards i'd also be willing to bet that you just realized that you were in that posture and immediately attempted to correct yourself which brings us to the major problem nowadays with our excessive phone and computer use we get stuck into this posture for hours on end without even knowing it which over time causes our joints and soft tissue to adapt to this posture and as a result it causes this kyphotic posture to become the norm for us more specifically though what this does is it creates a lack of something called thoracic extension in our spine which is simply our ability to extend our mid back upright out of this round of posture and what often comes hand in hand with this lack of thoracic extension is a forward head posture as well since if the back is rounded and the eyes gaze straight ahead then the head is forced to stick out forwards a simple way to tell if you have these postural adaptations is to simply relax your body into your natural comfortable posture and in the mirror take a picture from the side like so if you look something like this then you've clicked on the right video now although i have made several past posture videos that do work on this issue i understand that many of you out there just won't be consistent when presented with a ton of different exercises i get it they're boring and corrective exercises are not fun for most people so in this video i thought i'd create a simple routine that shows you how to potentially get the most improvements in your posture with the least amount of effort by focusing specifically on the most common issues that i mentioned earlier since fixing those issues alone can often fix the various aches and compensations that we see upstream in the head the shoulders and the neck but also downstream in the lower back and pelvis as well and to do so there's just three moves that when executed properly and consistently in the right order can help do just that now before we dive into the actual exercises it's important that we first understand the reasoning behind them so let's take a look at the posture we talked about earlier the main problem here is that as a result of sitting hunched over your mid-back has lost some of its ability to extend upright and as a result of this lack of thoracic mobility research suggests that certain mid back muscles most notably the lower traps get weakened and their activation can actually become inhibited since the back is now in a position where the lower traps are placed at a disadvantage and becomes more difficult for you to activate as a result which worsens the whole postural problem since these muscles function to pull the shoulder blade back and down and assist in keeping your posture upright and unfortunately given this association between poor thoracic mobility and weak lower traps this is what makes the lower traps one of the most difficult muscles to learn how to get firing and activating again i mean most of you watching this are probably thinking to yourself how the [\u00a0__\u00a0] do i activate that so what's the solution well first we're going to work on mobilizing our mid back which will help us temporarily get our body alignment in a position that will better enable us to actually activate the lower traps in the first place in fact research has consistently shown that by addressing and mobilizing the thoracic spine first lower traps activation significantly improves when tested afterwards then after we mobilize the thoracic spine we'll work on a lower traps exercise to work on activating and strengthening them which is going to be the key to fixing your posture long term rather than just temporarily by doing a bit of stretching and when used all together this simple systematic approach has been shown to significantly improve the postural imbalances that we tend to see when sitting so now that you're more familiar with the reasoning behind this approach let's take a look at what exercises would be best first we're going to work on some thoracic mobilization to do so i'm going to present a few options depending on what you may or may not have a home first option is going to involve a foam roller to set up lay on your back with your knees bent and place the foam roller around the level of your shoulder blades then place your hands behind your head to support your neck from here contract your abs and then leading with your head slowly arch your upper back over the foam roller return back to the starting position and then repeat that for a few more reps make sure that as you do so you aren't letting your ribs flare up in your lower back arch instead we want the motion to come from the mid and upper back while the lower back remains neutral after you do a few more reps in that position continue moving the foam roller further down each segment of your back and you want to repeat this until you reach the end of your mid-back region ideally you do want a foam roller for this and i'll leave a link in the description box down below just something i'd recommend another option though is to place two tennis or lacrosse balls into a sock like so and then use that as a replacement now if you don't have a foam roller or tennis balls handy an alternative is to place your elbows on top of a bench or couch with your hands together sit your hips back into your heels and simultaneously drop your chest towards the ground hold that bottom position for a few deep breaths before we're turning up and then repeat for more reps again you should feel this in your mid back so avoid compensating and arching that lower back instead next we want to use an exercise that will help our body ingrain that mindful awareness of how to actually extend the mid-back to do so we're going to use something called thoracic cat cows for these get on all fours sit your hips back into your heels to round out your lower back and then from that position just slowly transition between arching your mid-back as you take a deep breath in and then exhaling as you now tuck your tailbone and round at that mid-back region while keeping your chin tucked for these just like in the first exercise we want to emphasize the movement to come from the mid and upper back region as opposed to just the shoulder blades or the lower back next once we've successfully mobilized our mid-back with the previous two exercises we're now going to temporarily be in a much better position to be able to activate and strengthen our lower traps for long-term results however to do so it's important that we choose our lower traps exercises carefully this is because what comes as a result of this hunched over posture are tight upper traps and the problem with tight upper traps is that research has shown that they can further weaken the lower traps by essentially taking over whenever we try to train them therefore to maximize your success when it comes to lower traps training we need to specifically choose exercises that have been shown to not only maximize lower traps activation but also at the same time minimizes the involvement of the upper traps as this is going to help ensure that they don't take over during the movement and luckily there's been plenty of research on this exact topic and is what we're going to rely on to guide our exercise selection so to start we're going to use something called the modified prone cobra which has been shown to activate the lower traps very well with the least activation of the upper traps when compared to several other lower trap movements to perform it lay on your stomach with your arms down by your sides next using your mid and upper back muscles raise your chest slightly off the ground while keeping your chin tucked from here lift your arms up while turning your palms out so that your thumbs point towards the ceiling hold this position and think about pulling your shoulder blades back and down as if you were reached your fingers down towards your feet as these are two of the main functions of the lower traps and key to activating them hold this top position for about 10 seconds before coming down and then repeat for more reps you should feel your lower traps as shown here working as you hold each rep almost like a pinching feeling in your mid-back practice this daily and then once you're able to activate your lower traps quite well here without compensating with your upper traps we want to then swap your lower traps exercise for more difficult progressions that can continue challenging and strengthening those lower traps to a greater degree the first progression will be a similar movement but with your hands placed behind your head lift your chest up keep your chin tucked and then reach the arms up towards the ceiling while again focusing on actively keeping the shoulder blades back and down [Music] next we're gonna change the arm position into a w shape like so keep your thumbs facing the ceiling and pull your shoulder blades back and down as if you were pulling your elbows down towards your back pockets [Music] last is our most difficult progression for these you'll want to reach out diagonally with your arms such that they make a y shape with the elbow slightly bent overhead this will put your arms directly in line with the lower trap fibers then raise your chest up keep that chin tucked and raise your arms up with your thumbs facing the ceiling and just like the other exercises hold the top position for 10 seconds while thinking about bringing those shoulder blades back and down to get the lower traps firing and you can also increase the resistance of any of these progressions by simply holding on to light weights into each hand the main goal of this is to gradually move through each of these exercises over time as you master each progression which can simply be defined as your ability to execute the progression with a high activation of the lower traps you have minimal involvement of the upper traps so take your time and don't rush through these now after you do your lower traps exercise i just want you to stand up and try to put this into practice so while standing pull your shoulder blades back and down as if you were reaching your hands down towards your feet while squeezing your shoulder blades together you should feel your lower chest working from this alone be mindful of this and even do this simple exercise as you stand or sit throughout the day just to get your brain in the habit of actually using your lower traps to keep you upright rather than slouch it over so to summarize the daily routine here is the action plan over time by consistently devoting at least just five to ten minutes a day to work through this you should notice a significant improvement in your ability to activate your lower traps and other important mid-back muscles that have been weakened over time this will then enable you to actually use these muscles more not only when you stand and sit throughout the day but also in the gym with movements like the pull up face pulls and rows that normally should be strengthening these mid-back muscles and movements that you should definitely be doing more of to counteract all the pressing that we do as a result of this you'll be able to see long lasting visual improvements in your hunched over posture which can in turn create a lot more relief upstream in your upper traps your neck and your shoulders and even potentially downstream in your lower back and other areas and for a step-by-step program that shows you exactly how to properly train these often overlooked muscles and combines it with a weekly weight routine so that you can build lean muscle while improving your posture and various imbalances in the process then simply head on over to buildwithscience.com and take the analysis quiz to discover which of our science-based programs will be best for you and where

    "title": "The Most Attractive Muscle (According to Science)",
    "published_at": "2024-08-11T13:30:15Z",
    "transcript": "biceps quads arms like here chest I don't know if I can say this on camera you can say whatever you want today I'm answering the most important question known to Jim Bros worldwide what is the one muscle girls find most attractive to find out I'm surveying over 200 girls to accurately determine which muscle ranks the highest and which ones they just don't seem to care for at the end I'll also reveal the one unexpected personality trait that actually outperformed all the muscles we surveyed but to start things off I want to first ask the guys what muscle they believed most girls would pick do we really understand what women want well this is obvious isn't it I don't know is it a well-rounded physique you got to pick one muscle shoulders nice broad shoulders yeah shoulders we're looking for that Dorito look you know what I mean that like triangle it's basically what makes up your frame you know what I mean bro classic biceps back I think back cuz like you know fills you up a little bit more and you can see it from further away I'm going to say Chas yeah chest broadens you out of bit quite a thing to to admire to appreciate quads quads the booty booty yeah how important is the booty on a guy really important how would you rank his booty oh two abs abs yeah no girls yeah I'll take Cal or deltoids cves a lot of girls love the Cales look at his CES I can see dude these are literally the biggest CS I've ever seen in my life after talking to the guys our leading predictions were chest and shoulders which means it's finally time to start talking to some ladies but I'm going to need some assistance this is Max Max has one of the best proportion physiques I know and is going to be our muscle model for the day just in case the girls need a visual reference before making their choice what Max doesn't know is I'm secretly playing Matchmaker today Max is as nice as he is buff and he's single too so as we interview girls for science let's see if we can find find someone truly special for him in case you're wondering this is Max he's our muscle model for the day clearly very well built if you could pick one muscle on the guide that's most attractive what would you pick traps okay these guys are here yeah yeah CH number one and and why is that I don't know I just like find that really attracting probably their arms arms biceps arms yeah maybe ABS would be like a second best kind of thing probably ABS just like them how would you rank his traps show show them what's going on okay yeah like a nine like pretty yeah you're up there how would you rate his chest seven seven s I'll take it ah pretty good I mean could be bigger are you single yeah you are yeah okay the great thing is Max over here is also single oh so I don't know maybe you could exchange numbers you know maybe fre me here what do you mean you freck me here I have a boyfriend I am unfortunately are you sing you are single Max is uh he's also single you'll find someone believe in you you you are brutal keep walking around turns out our first couple attempts didn't quite go as planned and even though Max is in amazing shape he's also incredibly shy yeah well for the record Jeremy didn't give me a heads up that I would be asking girls give me my give me their number today so so it's good I feel like I need to be put on the spot more it's uh it will help me grow as a person what's your type uh a girl who goes to the gym all right Jim girls where you at and while I was failing in my role as a wingman we were at least getting some really valuable answers from the girls shoulders probably shoulders and what about yourself um probably back back really yeah and why is a um my boyfriend works on his back like quads quads you were quick with that I know what I like shoulders for sure yeah uh let's say shoulders shoulders yeah kind of just gives them that nice frame probably the chest the pectoral muscles chest yeah and why is that cuz it makes you look like bigger you take up more room I don't know okay what is it about quots I just it shows like lower body takes a little bit more time uh to build and so I don't know not everyone's blessed with big legs I person like a guy that has bigger legs than me so what what is it that makes the the triceps the back of the arms so attractive I have no idea it's just yeah it's like a really pretty muscle probably arms biceps biceps that's what I said did you did you speak that to her no what what is it about biceps that makes soci I don't know I just I don't know if I can say this on camera you can say whatever you want just big arms ni in addition to having the girls picking their number one muscle I also had them rate each muscle on a scale of 1 to 10 with being the most attractive after we get enough data I'll be using a scientific tool called Anova to determine which muscle is not just most attractive but if it actually reaches statistical significance this way we can confidently say if certain muscles are genuinely more attractive and which muscles aren't you put calves as one can you uh explain this is good news for guys though are the hardest muscle for for most guys to grow I just don't think it's that important like I'm like always looking at your face so like looking down at like your calves I'm just like go I don't think it's that no I don't think it's that important a lot of girls love the Cs and at this point I was already finding one muscle group that was doing surprisingly worse than I expected shoulders nine ABS six really I'm not going to look at a guy and be like oh he has no abs like no abs are last yeah ABS I don't really care about ABS really if you just eat a bit less they show a little bit more where like you have to like really put in the work to like grow your quads and glutes and chest abs are over you hear that but before you guys ditch the diet and jump on a bulk for the rest of your life I did notice something interesting with the data although on average abs are scoring low when I count how frequently girls were picking ABS as the most attractive muscle it's actually in the top three suggesting that while on average girls don't really seem to care much for abs the ones who do really find them attractive and score them as a 10 which just goes to show you that even if a muscle doesn't score high on our study there's still someone out there who may be attracted to just that Cals would be like close second what is it about CS I have no idea but I think they're so beautiful if a guy has a good set of Cs on him a lot of girls love the Cs this is a really underrated muscle but for me be the bracho radialis muscle oh my God most people don't even know what that is so it's a muscle right here I mean I can demonstrate all show show her show her so like Flex this muscle right here if you have this your hands are also really nice it's like overall like a really nice I guess it shows like your hard working very Hands-On yeah and how important do you think muscles are on a gut um as someone that goes to the gym I find them important so yeah what makes them important um like healthy lifestyle look fit yeah just overall good Wellness okay I think that's attractive nice yeah and uh if you could rank his muscles on a 10 would you give him like an eight they're putting an effort they show up for you in ways you need them to Max showed up for me today and I really needed him so he he exhibits that quality and he he is also single are you single I am single are you single yes I am you are yeah okay well the great thing is Max is also single here and he's he's looking he's not only good-looking kills it in the gym but he's honestly one of the sweetest people I know show her your breaking where out one more time it's very nice 10 out of 10 10 out of 10 okay is that good enough to get your number may I have your number he's on one knee he's already on one knee of course I'll give you my number with Max's body and my skills as a wingman I was finally able to set max up with some potential first dates but how much of his success was coming from his muscles well this goes back to our ancestral times back then strong muscles showed that a man could protect and support his family but it wasn't just about in ability since building muscle needs protein rich food it meant that these men were good Hunters too so today even though most men get muscles at gyms rather than hunting attraction to muscles should still be hardwired into their DNA how important do you think like muscularity is when it comes to oh no it's not important no really well that's deep question it probably can move up like say like one point on a scale on to 10 that's the first thing that draws me in and then the personality will keep me there I wouldn't say it's like super important it's not that important for me but like you said for some people it's very important well I'm slightly bias cuz I'm in the fitness industry so I understand that it takes a lot of discipline and a lot of work to get a muscular physique and I personally strive to have that so I think for me it's without a doubt very important it is important for attraction I guess like a bonus but it's not like yeah okay I would just say as long as they take care of themselves I think is important where they stand in their fitness journey I don't think is super relevant to me as long as they're pursuing it yeah is that what like initially attracted you to to him no no really but but it it helps it ites sure does now while having some muscle was definitely seen as positive by almost every girl we spoke to they were generally seen as far less important than what most guys predicted so if you are hitting the gym you're probably better off picking a goal that's important to you rather than just trying to impress girls now I won't say muscle doesn't help but in my experience it typically leads to a lot more compliments from Jim Bros rather than the ladies as for the results of our survey we managed to collect over 50 responses from our interviews on the beach but based on a statistics tool called G power it recommended we aim for at least 200 to make our results statistically valid so after sending out a quick online survey we had all the data we needed and here's what we found Cavs came in at the the very bottom of our survey with only three first place votes out of 205 responses as it turns out not a lot of girls really love calves next were glutes legs and abs now while these muscles significantly outperform calves their scores will still much lower than the upper body muscles chest back and shoulders however the differences between these three muscles didn't quite reach statistical significance so although I'm confident I can't for sure say that nice shoulders are objectively more attractive than back or chest muscles however there was one muscle that reached statistical significance when compared to all the other muscles arms arms not only crushed the rankings but it was also the first place vote for over 30% of the girls we surveyed but even though building a ripped physique won't guarantee the girl of your dreams there was one personality trait that outperformed every muscle we surveyed like you can have like be super funny sorry have a good sense of humor there's no point if not funny they're funny if you can handle jokes funny guys good sense of humor hopefully they're [Music] funny so while I can't teach you how to be funnier I can

    "title": "What Happens After Taking Steroids For 30 Days?",
    "published_at": "2024-05-19T13:00:58Z",
    "transcript": "what would happen if I took steroids for 30 days I'm a lifetime Natty but nowadays it seems like so many athletes actors and even social media influencers are hopping on the juice it got me thinking how serious are the side effects what does that first 30 days on juice feel like and how much progress could it make I wanted to speak to people with firsthand experience the conversations I had were not only eye opening but they led me to a decision I never thought I would make first I reached out to a veteran to show me the ropes Jaws jaws is one of the world's top bodybuilders finishing in the top 25 as a Mr Olympia competitor grab the wrist yeah and as he coached me through one of his posing routines it was easy to see why he's one of the best in the world does your mom know you're taking steroids she's called me holding it I've never admitted it really no so she doesn't know no she doesn't know like she's never gotten me to uh admit it I'm like no Mom everything's natural just creatine Jaws won his first competition as a natural back in 2014 but once he started competing on stage against enhanced bodybuilders the decision to take steroids was essentially a must if he wanted to keep advancing first day you had it in your hands and you're about to inject yourself walking it through like what was going through yesterday nurse I didn't even want to poke myself to be honest cuz I I I was like my hand my the needles in my hand I'm like it was my glute right here so I was like I was like shaking so I didn't want to poke my butt with a quivering hand so I actually has ask my girlfriend at the time uh to do it for me while today Jaws takes a variety of PEDs for competitions he started out with the hormone most new users start with testosterone it's a natural hormone that the body already produces but injecting yourself with more than your body could ever produce naturally can lead to some pretty insane results one study took 43 men and divided them into two groups each week the guys were given either 600 mg of testosterone or a placebo but they were also split up into a group that didn't work out and a group that did 10 weeks later the guys who were taken testosterone had levels that were 3 to six times higher than normal but you probably expected that what's crazy is they found that just taking testosterone without exercising was still extremely effective for building muscle in fact it was so effective that the testosterone with no exercise group built more muscle than the group that was exercising while taking the placebo so for Jaws who had already been training naturally for 8 years with several bodybuilding winds under his belt I was curious to know how it affected him from day one did you work out that day I think it did yeah yeah and I was just like in my head thinking like I'm already feeling stronger uh that's going have too I felt like I don't know I just want a Super Saiyan and now it's like I'm on a mission like I'm I'm going after it funny enough it wasn't just Jaws who felt an immediate difference I also spoke to Clement a 26-year-old ex steroid user who had a similar experience I thought I was the biggest dude in the world like the next day I I swear I was very motivated all the time I became a definitely the typical masculine person I became very masculine made decisions super quick I was always on the goal my braina was firing 24/7 I definitely felt the difference in energy like more Vitality M like more like I'm ready to like you know up type of thing that's why I was so excited to the gym all the time just constantly thinking more progression and getting stronger and getting bigger see justone doesn't just affect your muscles creating such a big hormonal imbalance in your body can impact your mood energy levels confidence liido even your appetite I was eating more like we right away I was so hungry all the damn time like whether I was waking up right in the morning or hit like going to work after work I want to eat 24/7 like not I'm not going to lie and I indulged a lot of food the crazy thing is I wasn't gaining too too much too at the same time you're just burning through everything you eat like I would have a cheat meal every day and maintain six-pack abs so I would actually look better having cheat meals at this point I'm thinking more energy more motivation and looking better after cheat meals where can I send up and this was even before they told me how was helping them in the gym strengthwise I think it was like 2 and 1/2 weeks and 3 weeks I started noticing some strength in PES and then as we progress into the cycle that's when we were like yeah I just threw weights that I didn't know I could throw I would show up to the gym and I was like what shoulder pressing like 6 65 70 lbs before I was short up one day never even tried I was like let's just do 100 110 let's just do it let's just do it once the fourth week hit all of a sudden it went just like like I hit like NOS my strength just skyrocketed like I started to like jump in my numbers with my lifts I was like jumping up leaping up in my numbers and Progressive overload way quicker than I didn't was before now as for actual muscle growth I looked into it and according to the research natural lifters can gain anywhere from 20 to 40 lbs of muscle in their lifetime but for guys on gear it goes up to a whopping 45 to 120 lb now personally I've gained a total of around 30 lb of muscle ever since I started working out and the muscle building process has only gotten slower I'm lucky if I can gain even just a couple of pounds of muscle in a single year but how would this change if I hopped on the juice I would say like if you are enhanced you can probably put on around like 10 to 20 lbs of tissue in your first year oh really yeah I got to say after posing next to Jaws in the mirror and thinking about the possibility of being able to gain 10 to 20 pounds of muscle in a single year it's tempting but if I was about to throw away my Natty card for Life there was just one more question I needed Jaws to answer how is the size of your Tessy change I mean if you Google search it it's pretty uh it's it's out there like everyone knows your Tessy shrinks your penis does not bow okay the penis is penis stays the same so don't that's the wrong idea like uh you know the the the penis doesn't shrink if anything looks bigger because a little smaller yeah the to shrink and is very noticeable it's like almost like it goes to like so like this and then and it's like peanuts really yeah small small as for why this happens when you take an EXO enous hormone like testosterone your body essentially thinks hey I don't need to produce this anymore you're telling your brain that it's already getting what it needs from this external source and for guys since testosterone is primarily produced in the testes well they sort of just shrivel up because they're no longer needed but this can create bigger complications and then all of a sudden you hop off that test it's like that production you no matter what you do no matter what kind of compounds you take to bring back the production of it no matter how well you are optimizing your sleep your stress it doesn't change and that's when you know you're kind of bound to taking to te and for Jaws this led to some complications I didn't notice um uh Ed issues so like erectile dysfunction yeah yeah getting a little personal with it but yeah it like it was hard for me to get it up to be honest and then um it took some time to like get my hormones back to normal levels yeah this is where it started to get worried for one I didn't like the idea of being being dependent on testosterone and injecting myself with the needle for the rest of my life and as I found out from Clement not every change that comes from taking testosterone is positive I the gym buddy bumped into me and I completely flipped the switch I was just like watch where you're going man like out loud and I didn't realize that when it came out of my mouth but it was a very aggressive tone at this point my decision wasn't looking nearly as clear-cut as it used to but what about all the actors and social media influencers on juice surely not everyone who takes steroids runs into these problems right especially if they're just using them for a short period of time well I wanted to learn more about the risks from an expert luckily for me there is no better person than steroids coach and educator John JWT of j3 University so um a lot of guys are worry about short-term side effects when you're young right you're going to worry about your hair or testis shrinkage or or acne but the true dangers that I would be worried about and that should always be in the back of your mind of the long-term active steroid use which are absolutely very much pertinent even in short-term use talking to John he explained that while many people make the mistakes of taking the wrong types of steroids or the wrong dosages even if you're careful to do everything right there's still a chance you won't see the results you're hoping for I've had guys that man they take a little bit and they get every single side effect and then you have other guys that are using a bunch of steroids and they barely see any health deleterious effects genetics deter everything it's why I'm not Michael Jordan in in playing basketball right there was a interesting study injecting 500 migs of testosterone in these different subjects and some of the guys had testosterone levels that would triple while other guys didn't rise up that much at all is purely down to how they metabolize the drugs differently and the reality is if you end up having them bad reaction to steroids the side effects can become lifethreatening I was on vacation one time and for the first time time I felt like my chest area was hurting that was my first scare cuz obviously Dr Google says when you search online and a chest chest pain out of nowhere you're probably going to die I literally popped my iPhone up just to show some light on my chest and I could see my heart pumping out of my chest we see a lot of early deaths from are are from heart I've had some like close like Pro bodybuilding friends that have passed away and indirectly related right it heart heart failure issues very young and probably a degree of being naive of what they were doing and that led to like yeah early deaths like in 20s and early 30s and it's uh it can't happen the most scary thing was what I think the doctor called the Ty cardio so which was my my heartbeat was not regular yeah I had to get a lot of ECG exams I had a lot of get a lot of like um ultrasounds as well chess x-rays to make sure everything's looking good the most thing we were scared of was an enlarged heart sure what all these steroids do their main thing is that Androgen binds to an androgen receptor and what does that andrin receptor do it builds muscle or prevents muscle breakdown but you don't just have andrin receptors on muscle you have them on the heart you have them on kidneys you have them in the brain so they influence all these other tissues as well just because your favorite influencer is using it and he looks okay doesn't mean that you're going to have the same experience as he does and who knows what he's also going through privately behind the closed doors and for guys like Jaws this wasn't just about looking good on the beach bodybuilding is his passion and in his world the line between a winning physique and long-term health issues is incredibly thin honestly when you want something man you're willing to do what what whatever risk it takes right yeah but uh I don't want to do it for too long that's the thing I recommend no one actually to ever touch BS I personally as a bodybuilder I don't recommend people touch it unless there's a reason for it if you're not playing to compete that extra bit of muscle I just really don't see that that being worth that extra risk having that extra 5 lbs of muscle no one cares you know no one cares about that the Natty has to put way more way more work which is why I respect people who stay natural for the rest like for their whole lives and it's a lot like harder and more discipline and willpower to stay as a natural than if you're inhanced trying to build muscle So after talking with jaws John and Clement am I going to take the jump and start using steroids no for starters my Filipino mom who's also a doctor she'd kill me but I've also decided I would love to keep learning more about this topic so I reached out to one of jaws's clients who's just about to start taking steroids and he's agreed to let me follow his journey for the next 90 days and I want to see if I can personally coach a natural lifter to keep up with the progress of someone taking juice now we'll have more to share from this experiment in about 3 months but in the meantime if you want to discover the smartest way to build muscle is a natural then give this video watch next where I interview seven of the world's smartest muscle building experts but for those of you who need more guidance and want a proven easy to follow program that takes care of all the guest workk for you head over to
