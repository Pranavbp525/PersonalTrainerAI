    "transcript": "many likely agree pull-ups can be difficult to progress a study by sanchez mourinho and colleagues suggest trading easier on the pull-up might enable faster progress 29 men with two to four years of training experience perform pull-ups with maximal intended lifting velocities for 2 to 4 sets twice per week for 8 weeks group 1 perform reps until their lifting velocity decreased by 25 percent this corresponds to performing 50 percent of the maximum number of reps you can so if you could perform ten max reps you'd only perform five group two perform reps until their lifting velocity decreased by fifty percent this corresponds to performing eighty-five percent of the maximum number of reps you can so if you could perform 10 max reps you'd perform 8 or 9 at the end of the study group 1 saw much greater increases in pull up warner at max and the number of maximum body weight pull-ups they could perform"

    "transcript": "two popular waste Progressive overload are to increase load within a certain rep range or increase rep numbers with the same load but how do they compare for building muscle this paper out of the USA examined just this 38 trained individuals were assigned to a load or rep Group Training these exercises with these variables in the first session the load group attempted to increase load across sessions while staying in the 8 to 12 rep range the rep group maintained the load from the first session and just aimed to perform more reps across sessions growth of these muscles was measured before and after the study ultimately both groups saw appreciable growth of all muscles and the gains were very similar between both groups thus you're free to select either method or combine both however there is only so much you can add reps we know reps approximately between 6 and 35 are similarly effective for building muscle so if you manage to add reps to where you're performing more than 35 reps you're better off increasing load to get back to the ideal hypertrophy rep Zone"

    "transcript": "Interesting research by McLaughlin found that\nduring maximal bench press attempts, bar paths differed between novices and elite lifters. They both lowered the bar similarly, a slightly\ncurved diagonal line from above the shoulders to the mid to lower chest region. However, the novices lifted the bar straight\nup initially, and then back over the shoulders. Conversely, elite lifters pushed the bar back\ninitially, and then straight up. This technique seems to be substantially more\nefficient in helping you lift heavier loads, likely because it makes the exercise easier\non the shoulders.

    "title": "How Often Should You Train a Muscle? - This NEW Study Is Epic",
    "published_at": "2024-12-02T13:00:19Z",
    "transcript": "welcome to the house of hypertrophy should you train a muscle more often in a week to maximize muscle hypertrophy it's been said this allows more frequent elevations in muscle protein synthesis and more time spent in a muscle building state but is this true interestingly this 2013 analysis of 127 competitive bodybuilders reported the majority trained each muscle only once per week bro splits largely involve hitting each muscle once per week other splits like lower splits involve hitting each muscle twice a week and full body involves hitting each muscle three times per week of course there are different variations of these splits and there are other splits or hybrid splits but what does the scientific literature say on this topic a new metaanalysis including 35 studies with over 1,000 subjects has examined the effects of how often you train each muscle in a week on muscle growth this is the same metaanalysis that explored the relationship between volume hypertrophy we dissected in our last video but it had another analysis on frequency let's dive into what they found it's critical to know the researchers examine the impact of training a muscle a different number of times per week when the total number of sets performed for that muscle per week is equated as a simple example imagine we perform nine sets for the biceps in a week perhaps three sets on each the normal creature and incline curl a once per week frequency involves all those nine sets in one session while a three times per week frequency splits those nine sets across three sessions keeping the total weekly sets equated is important since we're trying to isolate the effects of frequency another critical thing is most studies had all subjects perform their sets to or very close to failure within a rep range loads are usually adjusted within and across training sessions to keep reaching within that rep range this is important with our example of Performing nine sets for the biceps all in one session you can imagine fatigue will notably build up such that those later sets are going to likely be using much lighter loads to reach failure in say the 8 to 12 rep range conversely splitting those nine sets across three sessions involves fresher sets we want to see if this leads to higher frequency producing better results the final thing we must not before revealing the results is the researchers examined if there was a superior method for counting training frequency this sounds confusing if you watched our previous volume video this is similar to what they did here but let's see how it applies the training frequency first we need to know the difference between a direct and indirect set a direct set for muscle is a set on an exercise where that muscle is the primary force generator think of the biceps and any biceps curl the tricep in any triceps extension and the chest in most bench pressing exercises an indirect set for a muscle however is a set on an exercise where although that muscle is still fairly trained it's not the primary force generator this could be the biceps in any rowing exercise and the triceps in a wider grip bench press not everyone will agree on what should be a direct and indirect set for each muscle but here's a table showing what the authors considered as direct and indirect sets for each muscle muscle these are the exercises and muscles involved in the data that's why not every muscle and exercise is shown the first method the total method considers both direct and indirect sets equally for example if we train a row on Monday and a biceps curl on Thursday this is a frequency of two times per week for the biceps the second method the fractional method considers indirect sets as half the frequency of direct sets with examp example of rows on Monday and Coes on Thursday this is a frequency of 1.5 times for the biceps the final method the direct method doesn't even consider indirect sets so with our example it would just be a once per week frequency for the biceps the researchers ultimately found that the fractional method performed the best in explaining the data with the evidence being strongly or very strongly in favor of this method this is logical indirect sets answers effective as direct sets for stimulating a muscle which might be why it was better than a total method but indirect sets still provide some degree of stimulus and should therefore still contribute to a muscle frequency which may be why it was better than the direct only method from here remember the frequency numbers you see are calculated with the fractional method with all that out the way here's the relationship between training frequency and muscle hypertrophy found there's no con istant or large effect of frequency there's an increase going from zero to a frequency of once per week which isn't that shocking as zero times per week isn't training at all there was a slight increase when going from Once to twice per week but the credible intervals indicate it's compatible with negligible effects and there's no Crystal Clear benefit of training a muscle even more times per week thus when the total number of weekly sets are equated how often you choose to train a muscle in a week doesn't seem to matter all that much this is consistent with a meta analysis earlier this year suggesting similar hypertrophy between split routines and full body programs the current data also fails to suggest a meaningful difference between trained and previously untrained individuals is there an interaction with set numbers some have fascinatingly suggested the research used too many sets meaning the higher frequency groups were not recovering they say if recoverable volumes were used higher frequencies would be better well the researcher split the studies into those using recoverable and unrecoverable volumes to be recoverable subjects training a muscle three times per week had to be performing no more than three sets for that muscle per session subjects training a muscle twice per week had to be performing no more than five sets for that muscle per session and subjects training a muscle once per week had to be performing no more than 12 sets for that muscle in the session the analyses still fail to demonstrate a clear and large benefit of higher frequencies with either recoverable or unrecoverable volumes in the spirit of scientific accuracy these particular analyses aren't as rigorous as the main model but it just seems like based on the current literature it's challenging to argue that higher frequencies are better when going below a certain number of sets it is also challenging to argue higher frequencies are better when going above a certain number of sets since the unrecoverable studies generally involve higher weekly sets this is notable because others have suggested and I believe extremely logically that training a muscle more times per week is beneficial when we're performing a lot of sets for that muscle for instance if we're performing 15 weekly sets for the biceps you would think performing all of that in one session would be excessively fatiguing such that dividing it across a couple of days leads the higher quality set and thus better growth this is something that I would think to be true and I am genuinely surprised it's not clearly supported by the literature to be clear going from Once to twice a week for a muscle did numerically result in more growth but scientifically speaking we can't say if it's a genuine clear and large effect at least not currently I'll put forth some further ideas in a second but before that I must Circle back to the recoverable values I think the researchers used since these are the values floating around social media however when considering the overall literature and not just a few papers it's within the realm of possibility to recover from doing more than these values suggest this paper had trained individuals perform this program daily for 4 days four sets for the chest and quads were performed per session subjects managed to maintain their bench press and squat performance throughout with actually a slight increase in squat performance on the final day suggesting the capacity to recover in 24 hours from four sets this paper found after trained individuals performed seven sets per muscle the majority recovered 72 hours after this third paper found after trained individuals performed 12 sets for the chest subjects were able to replicate the training session work 72 hours after on average we can even look at long-term studies like this paper which involved untrained individuals performing six sets for the quads three times per week they successfully progressed training loads across the study indicating no serious recovery problems from performing six sets 48 hours apart this paper from last year had well-trained individuals performing 11 sets for the quads twice per week and the data demonstrates they were able to progress loads across the weeks of course there most likely will be differences in recovery capabilities between people I'll return to this point shortly [Music] as seen in previous videos getting to or close to failure and performing a sufficient number of sets are more reliably related to muscle growth in the current literature now frequency has to matter to some degree if you're performing 70 sets for your triceps in one month performing that all in one session per month won't be optimal but when zooming into the 7 Days of a week as we've just seen growth across the different Trading frequencies tends to be similar at least on average this brings me to my next point maybe training frequency is highly individualized if we return to the recovery data we see some people recover faster than others summoning the spirit of scientific accuracy once again this data is technically not designed sufficiently to identify individual differences if you're interested in why I'll link this excellent paper in the description nevertheless I do think it is is the case not everyone has the same recovery abilities due to a variety of different factors this may also include recovery within a training session some might better handle and dissipate fatigue within a training session While others experience a severe drop in performance on later sets these factors could mean some people benefit from training a muscle more often While others might not thus when piling the average results from a range of studies we fail to find clear effects of training frequency now I'm not saying this is definitely true but I consider it a possibility for now but this is what I'd suggest frequency doesn't appear to be the make or break of a training program so it's best to choose a frequency that aligns with your preferences schedule and Recovery capabilities if you're training or experimenting with higher volumes for a muscle it may be practical for most to divide that volume into more days per week recall we did see a numerical although still uncertain increase from Once to twice per week but at worst training a muscle more frequently has a neutral average effect which isn't bad of course throughout your training career you can always experiment with different training frequencies and splits to see if you prefer one over another if

    "title": "The BEST Progressive Overload Way (New Study)",
    "published_at": "2024-03-11T11:59:58Z",
    "transcript": "welcome to the house of hypertrophy is there an optimal Progressive overload method to maximize muscle growth many think Progressive overload is training harder than last time I actually believe this is slightly misleading and I'll describe why a little later nevertheless two common ways to Progressive overload are to either increase the load lifted or increase the number of repetitions performed there's been a brand new study comparing these let us dissect this paper and fit it into the overall scientific research we'll also discuss other potential training strategies you might use to elevate your physique and if increasing sets or training frequency should be considered as Progressive [Music] overload this new paper recruited 39 previously untrained individuals for those disappointed about them being untrained don't worry we'll mention data on trained individuals soon the subjects trained four sets on a unilateral leg extension 2 to three three times per week for 10 weeks with one leg subjects adjusted loads to continuously reach failure in the 9 to 12 rep range every set thus this leg progressively overloaded by increasing load with their other leg they also performed reps to failure each set but they stuck with the same load from the first session so they simply progressively overloaded by increasing reps they progressed from an average of N9 reps per set to 15 reps by the end note the number of dominant legs was equally divided between the conditions and subjects alternated which leg was trained first to every session the fact subjects trained each leg with one of the conditions is great as this means the same subjects were in both conditions therefore differences in genetics nutrition and outside lifestyle are less likely to confound the study strength gains on the leg extension were similar between both conditions we'll talk more about Progressive overloading for strength a little later muscle hypertrophy indicated by vastest lateralis growth was also similar between both conditions suggesting progressively overloading by increasing reps was as effective for muscle growth as increasing load the subjects were previously untrained but we have this 2022 study previously seen at the house of hypy that was conducted on 38 trained individuals subjects perform these lower body exercises using these variables a load group attempted to increase load across sessions while staying in the 8 to 12 rep range a rep group stuck with the same load from the first session and just aimed to perform more reps across the sessions growth of these quadriceps and cve muscle regions was measured and overall growth was similar between both groups so solid data indicates increasing load or reps can be similar for building muscle in both untrained and trained people I'd say there some underappreciated reasoning behind this and this reasoning also links to the multiple different training strategies that are available for you to maximize muscle growth it also links to whether we should consider increasing sets or training frequency as Progressive overload achieving a high level of muscle fiber Recruitment and tension are key for stimulating muscle hypertrophy how is this achieved simply by taking your repetitions to or very close to failure stopping a few reps short of failure can be fine in many cases as seen in our last video by training close to failure we're going to stimulate adaptations these adaptations mean we can do more than we could before we can lift a heavier load for the same number of reps or we can perform more repetitions with the same load in both of these cases we're effectively maintaining being close to failure and by extension we maintain High muscle mus fiber Recruitment and tension so in essence increasing load or reps fundamentally accomplishes the same thing thinking of progressive overload as a cycle works well a hard training session stimulates adaptations these adaptations enable us to increase load or reps and doing this maintains a hard training session considering this Progressive overload isn't really training harder than last time rather Progressive overload Keeps Us training as hard as usual to continually stimulate growth moreover Progressive overload isn't a result of you digging to progressively deeper and deeper depths of effort instead successful Progressive overload is proof gains are happening now there is an important detail we must not neglect the current literature suggest reps between 6 to 35 provided they perform two or close to failure produce similar muscle hypertrophy reps low six probably involve too little time at high tension while reps above 35 probably involve excessive fatigue that impairs muscle fiber Recruitment and tension with this in mind there is only so much you can increase reps if you somehow get to the point of Performing more than 35 reps increasing the load is recommended and overall a combination of both increasing load and Reps over the long term is what's going to happen in most cases for instance exercises involving smaller amounts of muscle mass are harder to Progressive overload and constantly increasing load across your training sessions on these is far from always possible unless you have access to very light micr plates but as many don't adding a rep here or there on these exercises is far more typical with less frequent load increases the same logic applies as you become more trained as the magnitude of adaptations diminishes with more training experience ience adding a rep here or there may be far more common than increasing the load this part isn't related to Progressive overload across training sessions rather it's around the multiple different training strategies you could use in a training session we've mentioned that on average similar muscle hypertrophy can be seen in the 6 to 35 rep range provided you stay in this this opens up many different training paths the most common is to keep the same load across the sets and to train two or their failure in a certain rep range but one alternative as explored in this paper is to decrease the load across sets all subjects trained curls to voluntary failure with these variables on the first set of each exercise all subjects used a 10 rep max load that is a load that can be lifted for 10 maximum repetitions one group kept the same load on the remaining sets a second group actually decreased the load by 5% on the final two sets of each exercise and the third group decreased the load by 10% on the final two sets as subjects were training to failure they would have naturally added reps over time but on top of this 10 rep max strength was retested every 2 weeks to update the training loads all groups ended up seeing similar biceps hypertrophy interestingly the group that decreased the load by 10% despite also training to failure and seeing similar growth subjectively rated their training sessions as being slightly easier you could also increase load across sets resulting in fewer reps in fact this study compared doing just this to another group that trains a little more typically muscle growth was similar between both so the key here is there are many different Pathways to muscle hypertrophy as we defined it Progressive overload maintains training hard to keep stimulating adaptations increasing sets or training frequency doesn't necessarily do this for example say you perform this workout next workout all you do is just add a set nothing else the problem with this is assuming sufficient adaptations were stimulated from the first session those earlier sets are going to be easier and thus less effective the extra set you add predominantly just increases the overall work you're doing it doesn't maintain hard training on the other sets the same applies to increasing workout frequency say you perform this same workout if all you do is add another training session in a week assuming sufficient adaptations were stimulated from the first session all these sets are going to be easier so this extra session is just largely more overall work on top of this this there's only so much you can add sets or training sessions before running into recovery problems none of this is to say you should never ever increase sets or training frequency in fact in October last year we dissected this paper finding adding sets across weeks to extremely high numbers led to Greater muscle growth than performing the same number of sets every week although all groups progressively overloaded by increasing load on their sets and there were crucial details meaning this study isn't proof you have to add sets across weeks but as described in the previous video someone could experiment with this training style if it appeals to them all in all though it is absolutely fine and more common to perform the same number of sets and use the same training frequency every week with perhaps some changes over many months or years if you're searching for further guidance on programming to obtain your desired physique it can can be tricky and time consuming however

mention in the 2022 paper on trained individuals squat strength gains were similar between increasing load and Reps however two technical considerations that I've decided to detail in the pin comment to say in time tell us why these findings are likely a little misleading my current thinking is since strength is generally considered as the maximum load you can lift increasing load is likely going to be better furthermore largely training with heavy loads for fewer than six reps is great for building strength illustrating this these researchers had trained individuals trained these exercises one group adjusted loads to keep training to failure in the two to four rep range while a second group adjusted loads to keep training to failure in the 8 to 12 rep range bench press and back squat strength gains favor training with the two to four reps as they did in this study to keep training hard in lower rep ranges increasing load across training sessions is [Music] needed we mentioned how Progressive overload can be thought of as a cycle hard training produces adaptations these adaptations allow us to increase load or reps and doing this maintains hard training progressively overloading through increasing load or reps has been shown to produce similar muscle growth both in untrained and trained individuals however there are a few reasons that mean over the long term using a combination of both is probably most feasible increasing sets or training frequency predominantly increases the overall work you're performing which has its place but on the their own they do not fit our definition of progressive overload for maximizing strength gains increasing load is likely better than increasing reps thank you for watching feel free to check out the alpha progression app

    "transcript": "German volume training is typically\u00a0\nwhere in a training session,\u00a0\u00a0 you perform no more than 2 compound exercises\u00a0\nwith 10 sets of 10 repetitions with a 60%\u00a0\u00a0 one-rep max load while using 60-90\u00a0\nseconds of rest between sets.

Let us kick things off with a\u00a0\n2017 study by Amirthalingam et al. 19 men with roughly an average\u00a0\nof 4 years of training experience\u00a0\u00a0 were assigned to either a 5-set or a 10-set group. Both groups trained three\u00a0\ntimes per week for 6 weeks. On-screen is the program for both groups. Both groups trained exactly the same,\u00a0\u00a0 except the 5-set group performed only 5\u00a0\nsets for the first 2 exercises each session,\u00a0\u00a0 whereas the 10-set group performed 10 sets\u00a0\nfor the first 2 exercises each session. Therefore, the 10-set group essentially\u00a0\nperformed the German volume method,\u00a0\u00a0 while the 5-set group performed\u00a0\nhalf of the German volume method. Both groups rested 60-90 seconds between sets. Moreover, if a subject successfully completed\u00a0\n10 repetitions on the final set for an exercise,\u00a0\u00a0 the load was increased by 5-10% for\u00a0\nthat exercise in the next session. 30 minutes after a training session,\u00a0\u00a0 all subjects consumed a whey protein\u00a0\nsupplement containing 30 grams of protein. Additionally, the researchers encouraged all\u00a0\nsubjects to increase the number of calories\u00a0\u00a0 they consumed each day by 1,000-2,000. Based\u00a0\non the data provided, it appears both the 5-set\u00a0\u00a0 and 10-set groups similarly consumed\u00a0\naround 1,020 more calories per day. Before and after the 6 weeks of training,\u00a0\na range of measurements was evaluated. For strength gains, one-rep max on the bench\u00a0\npress, lat pull-down, and leg press was measured. For hypertrophy, 2 sets of\u00a0\ndifferent measurements were taken. Firstly, DXA was used to assess the\u00a0\nlean mass of the trunk, arms, and legs. Secondly, ultrasound was used to\u00a0\nassess the thickness of the biceps,\u00a0\u00a0 triceps, anterior thigh, and posterior thigh\u00a0\nat roughly the midpoints of the muscles. What the researchers found\u00a0\nwas increases in the bench\u00a0\u00a0 press and lat pull-down one-rep max were\u00a0\nsignificantly greater for the 5-set group,\u00a0\u00a0 while increases in leg press one-rep max\u00a0\nwere statistically similar between groups. As for the hypertrophy measures, increases\u00a0\nin arm and trunk lean mass were greater for\u00a0\u00a0 the 5-set group, while increases in leg mass\u00a0\nwere statistically similar between both groups. Quite fascinatingly, neither the 5-set nor\u00a0\nthe 10-set group experienced statistically\u00a0\u00a0 significant increases in biceps, triceps,\u00a0\nanterior thigh, or posterior thigh thickness. It's not clear why this is, especially because\u00a0\nstatistically significant increases in arm,\u00a0\u00a0 trunk, and leg mass were noted\u00a0\nwith the DXA measurements. In general, ultrasound measurements are considered\u00a0\u00a0 more reliable versus DXA for\u00a0\nevaluating muscle growth. Nevertheless, this study does not look\u00a0\nvery promising for German volume training. It seems performing 5 sets, instead of 10 sets,\u00a0\u00a0 was better for most strength measures\u00a0\nand some hypertrophy measures. Now, there are some limitations\u00a0\nof this study worth noting. Firstly, the subjects in the 5-set group\u00a0\nwere actually weaker than the subjects in\u00a0\u00a0 the 10-set group on the bench press, lat\u00a0\npulldown, and leg press before the study. This strength difference might actually explain\u00a0\nwhy the 5-set group was able to increase their\u00a0\u00a0 one-rep max on the bench press and lat pull-down\u00a0\nsignificantly more than the 10-set group. Secondly, there were only 19 subjects in this\u00a0\nstudy, and like most sport science studies,\u00a0\u00a0 this is a small sample size that might\u00a0\nexplain why the researchers were unable\u00a0\u00a0 to find statistically significant increases\u00a0\nin the ultrasound muscle thickness measures. Thirdly, this study was only 6 weeks. Perhaps a\u00a0\nlonger time frame would produce different results. Fortunately, a second 2018 study by Hackett et al.\u00a0\u00a0 evaluated the effects of German\u00a0\nVolume training for 12 weeks. 12 men with a minimum of 1-year training\u00a0\nexperience were assigned to a 5-set\u00a0\u00a0 or 10-set group. Both groups trained three\u00a0\ntimes per week for 12 weeks. The program was exactly the same as the previous\u00a0\nstudy. For the first 2 exercises in a session,\u00a0\u00a0 the 5-set group performed 5 sets,\u00a0\nwhile 10 set-group performed 10 sets. Both groups rested 60-90 seconds between sets. Moreover, if a subject successfully completed\u00a0\n10 repetitions on the final set for an exercise,\u00a0\u00a0 the load was increased by 5-10% for\u00a0\nthat exercise in the next session. 30 minutes after a training session,\u00a0\u00a0 all subjects consumed a whey protein\u00a0\nsupplement containing 30 grams of protein. Before, after the 6th week, and\u00a0\nafter the 12 weeks of training,\u00a0\u00a0 one-rep max on the bench press\u00a0\nand leg press was measured. Also, DXA was used to measure lean\u00a0\nmass in the trunk, arms, and legs. The researchers found that bench press one-rep\u00a0\nmax only significantly increased in the 5-set\u00a0\u00a0 group. As for leg press one-rep max, neither group\u00a0\nexperienced statistically significant increases.\u00a0\u00a0 However, the numerical mean did indeed\u00a0\nseem to increase in both groups,\u00a0\u00a0 and to what seems a similar extent. As for the DXA measurements, fascinatingly,\u00a0\nneither group experienced statistically\u00a0\u00a0 significant increases in lean\u00a0\nmass for the trunk, arms, or legs. Although, the 10-set group actually experienced a\u00a0\u00a0 statistically significant decrease in\u00a0\nlean leg mass from week 6 to week 12. This is quite interesting. It's possible\u00a0\nthe 10-set group might have been failing\u00a0\u00a0 to sufficiently recover between\u00a0\nsessions, potentially somehow\u00a0\u00a0 resulting in muscle protein breakdown\u00a0\nexceeding muscle protein synthesis levels. So, like the previous study, this study looks\u00a0\nfar from promising for German Volume Training. Now, some limitations should\u00a0\nbe considered with this study. Firstly, unlike the previous study,\u00a0\u00a0 the researchers did not track the calories\u00a0\nconsumed by the subjects. Therefore,\u00a0\u00a0 it's plausible differences in dietary factors\u00a0\nbetween groups could have confounded the results. Secondly, only DXA measurements were\u00a0\nused for measuring muscle hypertrophy.\u00a0\u00a0 As we've already noted, DXA isn't considered\u00a0\nthe best tool for measuring muscle hypertrophy. Thirdly, only 12 subjects were included in this\u00a0\nstudy, which is an extremely small sample size.\u00a0\u00a0 Again, a small sample size like this\u00a0\nmay explain why the researchers were\u00a0\u00a0 unable to find statistically significant\u00a0\ndifferences for some of the measurements. Lastly, this study was 12 weeks,\u00a0\nwhich is a fair duration. However,\u00a0\u00a0 due to the high volume and fatiguing\u00a0\nnature of German Volume Training,\u00a0\u00a0 it might have been useful for the subjects to\u00a0\ntake a one-week deload after the final training\u00a0\u00a0 session. The researchers could have also taken\u00a0\ntheir measurements after this one-week deload. Perhaps such a deload would dissipate\u00a0\nany excessive fatigue and thus\u00a0\u00a0 impact the strength and hypertrophy measurements. Nevertheless, even with the\u00a0\nlimitations of this study in mind,\u00a0\u00a0 and even with the limitations\u00a0\nof the first study considered,\u00a0\u00a0 both of these papers still fail to look\u00a0\npromising for German Volume Training. These papers indicate performing half of\u00a0\nwhat you would with German Volume Training,\u00a0\u00a0 that is, 5 sets instead of 10 sets, might be\u00a0\nslightly better for strength and hypertrophy. Having said this, if we evaluated other\u00a0\nstrength and hypertrophy research papers,\u00a0\u00a0 it becomes evident that regardless of\u00a0\nwhether we are talking about performing\u00a0\u00a0 5 or 10 sets of the German Volume\u00a0\nmethod, both are likely suboptimal. Remember, with German volume training, you\u00a0\nperform sets of 10 repetitions with a 60%\u00a0\u00a0 one-rep max load, while using\u00a0\n60-90 seconds of rest between sets. The first issue here relates to how far\u00a0\nfrom failure you would be on your sets. With a 60% one-rep max load, you can generally\u00a0\nperform approximately 20 repetitions. As a result, your 1st set\u00a0\nwith German volume training\u00a0\u00a0 is roughly 10 repetitions away from failure. For optimizing muscle hypertrophy,\u00a0\u00a0 you'd likely want to be 5 or fewer\u00a0\nrepetitions away from failure each set. Now, your successive sets will get closer and\u00a0\ncloser to failure, and your later sets will\u00a0\u00a0 definitely be well within 5 or fewer repetitions\u00a0\nfrom failure, thanks to cumulative fatigue. In fact, there is data demonstrating\u00a0\nsome individuals cannot fully complete\u00a0\u00a0 10 repetitions on the final few\u00a0\nsets of German volume training. However, this still does not resolve the fact\u00a0\nthe first few sets are probably suboptimal for\u00a0\u00a0 building muscle. Therefore, it would likely\u00a0\nbe more efficient and productive to set up\u00a0\u00a0 your training in a way where your working sets\u00a0\nare at or within 5 repetitions from failure. The second problem is that you only\u00a0\nrest 60-90 seconds between sets. Compound exercises are typically used with\u00a0\nGerman volume training, and as thoroughly\u00a0\u00a0 examined in our rest interval video, the\u00a0\nresearch suggests with compound exercises,\u00a0\u00a0 2.5 or minutes of rest between sets is optimal\u00a0\nfor building muscle, as well as likely strength. Let us briefly overview one paper by\u00a0\nSchoenfeld et al. that demonstrates this. 16 men with at least 6 months of training\u00a0\nexperience performed a range of exercises each\u00a0\u00a0 for 3 sets of repetitions to failure with an 8-12\u00a0\nrep max load, three times per week for 8 weeks. All of the exercises, except for\u00a0\nthe leg extension, are compound. Increases in elbow flexor, triceps\u00a0\nbrachii, anterior quadriceps,\u00a0\u00a0 and vastus lateralis thickness\u00a0\nfavored a group resting for 3 minutes\u00a0\u00a0 compared to a group resting\u00a0\nfor 1 minute between sets. Additionally, increases in bench press\u00a0\nand squat one-rep max were significantly\u00a0\u00a0 greater for the group resting 3 minutes between\u00a0\nsets compared to the group resting 1 minute. To conclude, combining all of the various\u00a0\nresearch papers explored in this video,\u00a0\u00a0 it's apparent the evidence looks far from\u00a0\npromising for German volume training. I think it's not unreasonable\u00a0\nto say it's inefficient and\u00a0\u00a0 likely involves suboptimal variables. It's important to say that by no means does this\u00a0\nmean no one should ever do German Volume training.\u00a0\u00a0 If it's something you like to experiment with, I\u00a0\nthink it's perfectly fine and justified to do so. Furthermore, if you've had positive\u00a0\nexperiences with German volume training,\u00a0\u00a0 by no means can the research presented take this\u00a0\naway from you or invalidate it. Some individuals\u00a0\u00a0 may highly enjoy this method and be happy\u00a0\nwith the adaptations they experience from it."

    "title": "More Sets, More Growth: This NEW Study is Surprising (&amp; Epic)",
    "published_at": "2024-11-18T14:00:00Z",
    "transcript": "welcome to the house of hypertrophy what would you say is the most important training variable for maximizing muscle growth there's a case to be made that volume is up there I'm excited to say we have a brand new meta analysis including 35 studies with over 1,000 subjects that has examined the relationship between volume and muscle hypertrophy it's our best look at it to date before diving into the paper the best way to think about volume for building muscle is simply how many sets you perform and and this is what's meant by volume in the latest meta analysis so what is the relationship between sets and gains do you maximize growth with just a few sets with no further growth with more sets or maybe more sets result in more growth or as a lot of people have hypothesized maybe it's an inverted U shape where more sets result in more growth up to a point Beyond which eventually results in less growth or perhaps it's something else entirely let's Dive In we need to understand what exactly a set is and how the researchers measured it the researchers actually did something never done before in the literature when considering how to count sets and it may change the way you think about counting sets for muscle growth a set refers to a bout of repetitions we're not counting light warm-up sets here rather we're counting what we call a working set which typically has you getting two or very close to failure to make the set as stimulating as possible here were the variables used in the studies behind the newest analysis most studies involved around 10 reps per set also most of these sets were likely perform to failure but the definitions of failure do vary between studies and my assumption is most involved getting to True momentary failure or stopping at most two reps from this failure point which we know from previous videos is likely the Zone we want to be in to maximize the stimulus of a set the researchers analyze the relationship between muscle growth and the total number of sets performed for each muscle group per week what on Earth does this mean and how do you calculate it there are different ways you could do this and the great thing is the researchers aim to determine if a certain method was best to understand the different methods we must know the difference between a direct and indirect set a direct set for a muscle is a set on an exercise where that muscle is the primary force generator think of the biceps and any biceps curl the triceps in any triceps extension and even the chest in most bench pressing exercises an indirect set for muscle however is a set on an exercise where although that muscle is still fairly trained it's not the primary force generator this could be the biceps in any rowing exercise and the triceps in a wider grip bench press make no mistake not everyone is going to agree as to what should be a direct and indirect set for each muscle but here's a table showing what the authors of the latest analysis considered as a direct and indirect set for each muscle these are the exercises and muscles that were involved in the data that's why not every muscle and exercise is shown here the simplest approach used in most previous research is to count both direct and indirect sets as equally contributing to a muscle's total weekly sets this is called the total method for example if we perform three sets of rows on Monday and three sets of standing barbell curs on Thursday both of them equally contribute to a total of six weekly sets for the biceps a more refined approach is to count indir sets as half of direct sets this is the fractional method without three sets of rows and three sets of curls example this would total 4.5 weekly sets for the biceps this isn't necessarily completely objective because you might argue that an indirect set should be less than or more than 0.5 sets in certain scenarios but the author stuck with simply counting all indirect sets as half a set the final more extreme approach doesn't count indirect sets this is the direct only method using our example we just consider there to be three weekly sets for the biceps the researchers ultimately found that the fractional method performed the best in explaining the data with the evidence being strongly or very strongly in favor of this method I'd say this makes sense indirect sets aren't as effective as direct sets for stimulating a muscle which might be why it was better than a total method but indirect set still provide some degree of stimulus and should therefore still contribute to a muscle weekly set count which may be why it was better than the direct only method from here please remember all the total weekly set counts for a muscle you see are calculated with the fractional method that brings us to the results and here was the relationship between weekly sets and muscle growth found the best best fit model was called the square root model which indicates that more volume resulted in more hypertrophy but there were diminishing returns these results are seriously interesting and perhaps surprising to many this is the most extensive analysis on volume for building muscle to date and it failed to find a plateau or even an inverted u based on the current literature growth continually increased up to 43 weekly sets per muscle Group which is an insane amount of volume here's an example of one way to achieve 40 weekly sets for just your biceps this is an incredible amount of training again just for the biceps so do these results mean you can take your gains to the next level by increasing your volume it's not a guarantee there are absolutely some crucial things we need to keep in mind so you know what these results May mean for you firstly we shouldn't ignore the diminishing returns that is in the same way that continually squeezing an orange produces less and less juice but forming more and more sets produces less extra growth in fact here's a graph depicting the diminishing returns we can see those initial sets you perform give you a great return and although there's still additional growth with more sets it becom substantially diminished the authors's approximate the later sets are onethird as stimulative as the initial sets we can see the credible intervals demonstrate greater uncertainty once we get above 25 weekly sets per muscle indeed as the authors say there aren't as many studies that have explored more than 25 weekly sets per muscle group moreover I'm actually aware of two studies not officially published yet failing to find more growth with super high volumes for these reasons I believe we would be making a big mistake if we thought this model was the final word on volume and hypertrophy especially when considering the relationship above 25 weekly sets we may eventually find a plateau somewhere this brings us to a topic that is fiercely debated across the internet swelling some argue the extra growth seen with very high volumes is not actually real muscle growth rather its muscle swelling muscles can temporarily increase in size due to fluid buildup that could be related to damage most studies behind this data measured muscle growth 48 to 72 hours after the final training session but the thing is we do have evidence that after a training session with a decent amount of volume muscle swelling May persist at least up to 72 hours so does this mean swelling clouds the data not necessarily the research that finds swelling can last for days do so after a single training session that the subjects have never performed before there's evidence that as you continue training with the same program your body produces adaptations that reduce damage and swelling this is called the repeated bout effect effect some say the repeated bout effect isn't that powerful but the strongest study to date would suggest otherwise it had previously untrained individuals perform five sets of 15 maximal eccentric only leg extensions once per week for 10 weeks maximal eccentric only training is no joke the data shows this as measures of damage and fatigue remained for at least 5 days after the first training session swelling was unfortunately not measured nonetheless across 10 weeks of training the measures of damage and fatigue became less and less subjects were recovered around a day or two after the session in the final week thus the repeated bout effect May substantially reduce the likelihood that researchers are measuring swelling after a training program moreover we currently don't have any studies comparing swelling between different volumes and it's possible higher volumes do not cause greater swelling than moderate volumes in the first place for these Reasons I'm not currently convinced swelling certainly confounds this data there are actually some studies coming soon that may further shed light onto this we'll update you at the house of hypoy if anything changes we've discussed previously at the house of hypertrophy how rest intervals possibly impact the relationship between sets and hypertrophy let me explain rest intervals are the time you take to rest between sets during training sessions it may come as a surprise to some but a few suggest longer rest between sets could be better for building muscle when set numbers are equated for example this study found when performing three sets on the leg press per session quad hypertrophy was greater when resting for 3 minutes between sets compared to 1 minute however performing approximately five sets on the leg press per session with one minute of rest between sets ultimately produce similar quad gains to the three sets with 3 minutes of Rest In other words more sets with shorter rest intervals could produce similar hypertrophy to fewer sets with longer rest intervals accordingly it's possible that higher volumes are more beneficial when using shorter rest between sets and not as beneficial when using longer rest between sets the latest analysis actually had a moderat analysis that indeed found M growth plateaued earlier with fewer sets when 3 minutes of rest between sets was used compared to 1 minute at first glance this seems like clear proof that higher volumes are only beneficial when using short rests however as the the authors describe the moderator analysis should be viewed with caution as there's not much strong data behind it they view it as exploratory further more if we accept these results we would also have to accept that very high sets with one minute rest intervals ultimately lead to the best hypertrophy which is a conclusion hard to currently justify it is also worth mentioning that the data suggesting longer rest between sets could be superior for building muscle largely used compound exercises with smaller isolation exercises some data suggest shorter rest between sets may be no less effective ultimately we need more studies to examine how the relationship between set and hypertrophy differs depending on rest intervals we'll have some recommendations in a second but before that there are a few other moderator analyses that some may find interesting the relationship between weekly sets and hypertophy was fairly similar between trained and untrained individuals as well as between 21 and 35y old individuals and the positive relationship between volume and hypertrophy remained when looking at shorter and longer duration studies but once again view these moderator analyses with caution here's what I'd recommend based on this data know that hypertrophy can be achieved with lower volumes so if you dislike or cannot train with more sets for practical reasons know that it's still possible to achieve a respectable chunk of gains if you're happy to train more in attempt to maximize muscle growth people who take the latest data at face value would say to get as close to 40 weekly sets per muscle group as you can but given the crucial considerations we've overviewed I wouldn't go that far we also mustn't forget these are averages you need to consider your individual situation and lifestyle but this is what I'd suggest I'd first ensure you're maximizing your training quality this means selecting exercises that are ideal for growing among muscle training hard enough and optimizing your rest between sets we have videos at the house viery that can help you understand what the literature says on these topics and we are working on free ultimate guides on the exercises that are possibly the most favorable for training each muscle group with your training quality optimized I would then suggest performing as much volume as you can personally and practically handle consistently if I had to guess I think this will probably be around 10 to 20 weekly sets per month musle group for most people of course you can always experiment around if you're making minimal progress and feeling burnt out try doing less alternatively if you feel your body is ready you can experiment with performing closer to or more than 20 weekly sets per muscle group also remember that you don't necessarily have to perform identical set numbers for every muscle group it may be most feasible to experiment with super high volumes with only a few or even one muscle group this is called muscle group specialization in fact one Study last year that found a benefit to super high volumes even when using longer rest between sets did so when only training the quads with this volume I also recommend gradually progressing to super high volumes I suspect this more effectively prepares your body for handling this High quantity of training before moving on to the summary some may be wondering about training frequency as well as if there's a limit to the number of sets you can perform per session and glad to say we'll have updated videos on these topics as there's new research on them coming [Music] soon in summary the most extensive analysis on volume 4 hypertrophy today has some pretty intriguing findings firstly using the fractional method to count volume outperform the total or direct only method if you skip to the summary and are confused as to what this means head back to this time Point secondly the analysis suggests more sets result in more growth but there are diminishing returns those initial sets provide a great return so it's possible to see respectable gains without high volumes in the spirit of scientific accuracy these results are based on the current literature but the current literature isn't Flawless there are just a few studies exploring more than 25 weekly sets per muscle and there are questions remaining about the influence of other things such as rest interval durations this all leads me to be extremely be cautious in definitively concluding that super high volumes are superior better quality data is needed and I know some are on the way currently my recommendation is to maximize your training quality and then perform as much volume as you can personally and practically handle then make adjustments as you see fit if you're constantly feeling burnt out with minimal progress

    "published_at": "2025-01-07T13:00:07Z",
    "transcript": "welcome to the house of hypertrophy how should you train your side dels for maximum growth I'm glad to say we have the first ever study measuring sidel hypertrophy and its findings are pretty interesting it compared dumbbell to cable lateral raises in previous videos due to the emerging research on training muscles at longer lengths we've speculated that cables could be better due to applying higher tension when the side dels are at a longer length but is this true 24 trained individuals with an average of 7.1 years of experience were recruited each subject had one arm randomly assigned to train dumbbell lateral raises and the other arm assigned to train cable lateral raises interestingly the researchers had subjects use cuffs to minimize grip fatigue this design of all subjects training both exercises is great as differences in genetics nutrition and outside lifestyle factors are less likely to conf found the findings I've said it before but it's not like your right arm eats more protein or sleeps more than your left arm with both the dumbbell and cable subjects moved from 0 to 90\u00b0 of shoulder abduction straight out to the sides in what's known as The frontal plane some subjects did have pain so instead both exercises were raised in between the frontal and scap planes the cable was positioned so that the arm and cable formed a roughly 90\u00b0 angle at the start this results in the exercise being hardest at this position where the side dels are at a longer length with the dumbbells we know they provide the greatest challenge when the arms are straight out where the side dels are at a relatively shorter length they train two times per week for 8 weeks each exercise was trained with five sets per session with repetitions to momentary muscular failure in the 12 to 16 rep range with Progressive overload applied to stay in this rep range across sessions sidel thickness was measured at a proximal and distal region it was ultimately found that growth in both regions was similar between both excises therefore as the authors note the findings suggest both dumbbells and cables present similarly effective options for eliciting hypertrophy of the side dels in trained individuals before describing how this study may fit into the overall literature on training muscles at long length in the spirit of scientific accuracy we need to keep some things in mind mind firstly a single study is never definitive proof let's say we have a coin with a 50% chance of landing on heads although unlikely it's still possible to flip heads five times in a row which may lead you to think this coin is biased towards heads but as we flip it more times things will eventually reflect the truth in the same way a single study can find things that don't reflect reality due to chance so additional studies are necessary to know we're on the right track nevertheless L this study is certainly a data point suggesting no meaningful difference between a dumbbell and cable lateral Rays secondly the amount of hypertrophy seen by both conditions was fairly small and not far off measurement error this isn't too surprising as we're dealing with an 8we study on already well-trained individuals so we can't rule out the possibility this study was underpowered to detect potentially small growth differences between the exercises thirdly remember range of motion was the the same between the dumbbells and cables but you can actually bring your arm across your body with cables to lengthen the side delts even more it remains possible doing this does yield greater growth we don't know at least not yet fourth and finally participants aim to maintain a similar rep Tempo but both conditions increased acceleration out the bottom as they approached failure with the dumbbells this will increase the tension at longer side out lengths whether this influenced the end ings is up to debate when considering the literature on training muscles at long versus short lengths I think we should split the data into three categories resistance challenge range of motion and biarticular muscles with resistance challenge with all else equal we're comparing exercises that are harder at longer versus shorter lengths and the new lateral raise data belongs to this category the only only other study in this category was conducted on untrained subjects in 2020 comparing barbell preacher Co which are harder near the start of the curl where the biceps are at a longer length to Cable preacher curs which are harder later in the curl where the biceps are relatively shorter similar to the sidel data this study failed to find any difference as biceps growth measured around the mid region was comparable between both exercises as for the range of motion category with any given exercise you can train with a full range motion which moves the joints through the largest capacity possible a shorten partial which moves through the halfway the muscle is at a shorter length or a lengthen partial which moves through the halfway the muscle is at a longer length it was once thought a full range motion was best but this was predominantly based on comparisons with short and partials three studies all un untrained individuals fascinatingly found length and partials built over R more muscle than a full range of motion however two studies in 2024 on trained individuals including a paper on just under 300 subjects that I detailed in our 2024 summary largely found length and partials to be similar to a four range motion this isn't case closed due to some nuances but it does seem clear that length and partials are not unequivocally Superior and both of full range motion and length and partial are options on the table with biarticular muscles these are muscles that cross over two joints with these muscles we can change the position of one of the joints to lengthen the muscle more for example the rectus morus is the only head of the quads that crosses both the knee and hip the rest of the Quad heads just cross the knee leaning back on the leg extension which puts the hip joint in a more extended position lengthens the rectus humorous part of the quads this grew the rectus humorus more the normal leg extensions in one study while growth of the vastest lateralis which is trained at the same length between both was similar many probably don't think about it in this way but it also applies to the gastrous heads of the calves which cross both the ankle and knee compared to Bent legal raises straight legal raises have our knees extended which lengthens the gastroc nmia heads and two papers found better gastrous growth with a straight leg while Solus growth which is trained at the same length between both was similar similar Concepts May apply to the biceps triceps and hamstrings however nearly all of these Studies have been done on untrained individuals does it apply to trained individuals the spirit of scientific accuracy would haunt me if I said I was certain so I'm not certain but my suspicion is this is the category where trained individuals will see better growth from long longer muscle lengths indeed one of the papers finding straight leg Cal raises built the gnus more involved trained individuals moreover this study on competitive bodybuilders found they experienced greater overall rectus moris activity with leaning and lying back leg extensions versus normal leg extensions the measure of activity used in this paper has been found to relate to muscle growth in a few studies so right now it tentatively seems except for the B Artic and muscle category making the exercise harder at longer muscle lengths as well as using a length and partial May largely not be superior in trained individuals but they crucially do not appear to be any worse either so you have the freedom to choose what works best for you all of this is very much a developing area of research the quantity of quality research we're getting is increasing in 2024 we had seven studies relating to training at different muscle lengths with for being the first ever set of studies on trained individuals directly measuring hypertrophy in this area I'm excited to see how our knowledge progresses in this area and other areas of muscle growth it can be frustrating because we desperately want to know everything now but we do know a lot more than 20 years ago and if the literature has shown anything so far it is that there are many different parts to Growing muscle for example if we provisionally accept the findings of the latest study if you've been training with dumbbell collateral raises you haven't been missing out whereas if you've been training with cables you still haven't been missing out all in all it's pretty hard to do something tragically wrong so don't be afraid to experiment around with things in your own training training hard with enough volume and consistency are the most important

    "title": "Cheat Reps vs Strict Reps (NEW Study)",
    "published_at": "2025-01-21T13:00:00Z",
    "transcript": "welcome to the house of hypertrophy after Decades of research on lifting weights we finally have the first ever study on [Music] this cheat Reps versus strick Reps for muscle hypertrophy proponents of strict technique may hypothesize cheating via external momentum disperses tension to other muscle groups and possibly lowers activation of the main muscles we're trying to Target but is this true [Music] 25 previously untrained individuals were recruited they trained unilateral dumbbell curls and push Downs two times per week for 8 weeks one arm was randomly assigned to cheat on all repetitions while the other arm used strict technique on all repetitions to cheat with the curl participants were instructed to swing the weight up and use external momentum to lift the weight as many times as possible until they reached failure with the push down they used external momentum and were permitted to flare the elbows and use leg drive until they could no longer perform more repetitions as for the strict reps the curl was performed with a stationary body position without any swinging they simply flexed the elbow until they could no longer complete another strict rep the same applies to the push down an upright torso with movement just occurring at the elbow until they could no longer extend their elbow down with strict technique the study supplementary material provides instructional videos that the subject saw every session four sets of 8 to 12 reps were performed and as we mentioned those reps were taken to failure for both conditions loads were adjusted across time to stay in this rep range regular viewers will know this research design of having every subject train both conditions is becoming more common in the literature there are always a few critiques of this design I see pop up so I'll quickly address them people can have one arm stronger than the other but remember we're not looking at the results of one person we're looking at the average results of two conditions which typically have a similar number of dominant arms some people think that training one arm can directly cause growth in the opposite arm but this isn't quite true what is true is that training one arm can cause strength gains in the opposite arm so this study design is not appropriate for measuring strength but it is acceptable for measuring hypertrophy there are also key advantages to this study design having 25 subjects each train both conditions is like having 50 subjects assigned to train either one of the conditions in fact it's even better since by having the same subjects in both conditions differences in genetics nutrition and outside lifestyle factors are less likely to confound the findings muscle thickness of the elbow flexors consisting of the biceps and brachialis and triceps were measured at 55% and 65% regions it was found that increases in all regions were similar between both conditions thus as the authors describe the use of external momentum neither helped nor hindered hypertrophy of the target muscles these findings are truly fascinating and may surprise a number of you so is that the death of strick Reps for hyper y since they provided no growth advantage over cheating not necessarily many suggest there are other concerns with cheating safety and tracking progression before critically analyzing these two points in the spirit of scientific accuracy we must not let a few key considerations slip our minds the authors mention it was tricky to standardize form with the cheat reps so not all subjects cheated identically it is not implausible that certain cheating styles are worse than others but this will be tricky to establish remember this study wasn't designed to examine cheat reps as an intensity technique what I mean is you can perform strict reps but then start to cheat as you approach failure to perform more total reps than you could otherwise whether this has any worthwhile Advantage remains to be tested note cheat reps are the only way to push past typical failure as the quality and quantity of research we're getting nowadays is increasing I am optimistic we'll see valuable research on these methods besides that science is ultimately a cumulative process relying on multiple studies to build a comprehensive understanding of a given topic and get us closer to the truth the single study at hand just involved untrained individuals training only their biceps and triceps for 8 weeks things could be different with any one of these variables altered some may be tempted to completely ignore this study since on untrained individuals since they claim untrained individuals grow equally from anything under the sun while it is undeniably true we cannot be certain findings on untrained individuals will extend to trained individuals it is not true untrained individuals grow equally from everything the literature is abundant with examples of untrained individuals growing more with one thing over another a few of our videos illustrate this so studies on untrained individuals are certainly not useless and at the end of the day it is an informative data point suggesting similar effects between cheat and strict reps I should also reveal that none other than Jeff nippard has stated he'll be involved with a cheat rep study on trained individuals so what about safety and tracking progression 30 individuals were originally recruited but five dropped out however none of these five dropped out due to injury as the authors describe we don't have strong direct evidence that using external momentum increases injury risk but absence of evidence is not necessarily evidence of absence whether things would change with a longer time frame or more subjects is a question left unanswered for now as for Progress the cheat condition unsurprisingly trained with heavier weights but both conditions progress throughout the intervention that said the complication when cheating is as difficult to UNT Le how much of your progression is driven by you just cheating more when maintaining strict technique you have more confidence lifting heavier for the same number of reps is due to you getting stronger which is Assurance you're making gains cheat rep proponents may say they're uninterested in untangling what's causing them to lift heavier loads if they're fundamentally seeing no less growth ultimately visual changes over the longterm and the general notion that they'll eventually be lifting a load that would have been impossible for them to cheat with back in the day is all that's needed I think that is a fair perspective but I know there are many who prefer consistent Assurance of progress provided with strict technique some individuals thinking outside the box may consider this as a paper on training at long muscle lengths in Disguise take the normal biceps curl when cheating and Swinging the way up you likely increase the tension seen earlier in the curl where the biceps are at a longer length compared to using a stricter technique with a standard Tempo since growth was similar between both you may suggest increasing the demands at longer muscle lengths isn't advantageous however since we do have other variables in the mix and it's difficult to know precisely how much tension differed at longer lengths I wouldn't consider it an ideal study for answering if challenging muscles at longer lengths benefits hypertrophy I'll also add that as described in our previous video I believe we should divide the muscle length literature into different categories and as this may tell us when and where training muscles at longer lengths can be beneficial in this case changing where the muscle is challenged the most in the motion belongs to the resistance challenge category we don't have a lot of studies in this category but the ones we do have fail to show any real benefit of making the exercise harder at longer muscle lengths anyway feel free to check out the video for more details so can we say cheat reps are as good as strick reps more evidence in wider context and perhaps some kind of Investigation of its safety is necessary before we can be sure I still think it makes sense for stricter technique to be the default but depending on how you feel this study could loosen the strictness you may have towards your reps it's likely not the end of the world if some degree of deviation and momentum creeps into your set if you're searching for further guidance on programming to obtain your desired physique it it can be tricky and timec consuming however our highquality partner the alpha progression app can help you generate an Evidence space training program that's 100% custom to your needs in less than 3

    "transcript": "welcome to the house of hypertrophy its estimated creatine sales exceed over $400 million per year and that Americans consume over 4 million kg of the supplement per year but how effective is creatine for building muscle and strength today we're going to dissect the most upto-date literature on the topic and we'll also touch on some other popular topics surrounding creatine let's dive [Music] in the Discover of creatine is credited to this person in 1832 who extracted the compounds from meat however it wasn't until the 199s where following the Barcelona Olympics in 1992 some British athletes admitted to using creatine after winning gold in the following Olympics in Atlanta in 1996 it was estimated 80% of athletes were using creatine this origin story may explain why some wonder if creatine is an anabolic steroid but rest assured creatine is most definitely not an anabolic steroid you still get to keep your naty card with creatine consumption it also appears that in 1993 a company under the name of EAS was the first to produce commercially available creatine under the name phosphagen since the '90s over 500 peer-reviewed scientific Studies have examined creatine before examining creatine's impact on muscle growth and strength let's quickly mention some crazing facts and its effects on the body the majority of creatine in the body is found in muscles the total creatine pool in muscle averages 120 mm per kilg for a 70 kg individual your body urinates about 1 to 2% of intramuscular creatine per day so around 1 to3 G of creatine is needed to maintain creatine stores some of this comes from the liver and kidney synthesizing it while for omnivores various animal Foods further provide a source of creatine vegetarians and vegans w won't obtain this and so actually tend to have lower creatine stores within their muscles this raises an interesting question do vegetarians and vegan see greater benefits from creatine this will be addressed later the upper limit of intramuscular creatine seems to be around 160 m per kogam in most individuals so supplementing with creatine can help you reach these levels attaining these levels likely enhances your performance during intense activity why muscle fibers generate energy for various processes including contraction via breaking down a molecule called ATP into ADP creatine has the ability to donate a phosphate group to ADP turning it back into ATP thereby enabling it to generate energy again ATP stores are rapidly depleted during intense muscular effort so increasing intramuscular creatine via creating supplementation enables you to replenish ATP stores faster enhancing performance creatine has been documented to enhance muscle hypertrophy and will'll uncover how much shortly but most believe creatine enhances hypertrophy because of creatine's ability to increase Exercise capacity by way of replenishing ATP but I'm skeptical that this explains the entirety of creatine's muscle building benefits or even any of it the reason for this is other supplements have been documented to similarly increase Exercise capacity but fail to enhance long-term hypertrophy as reviewed by this paper other plausible mechanisms behind creatine's gains exist creatine could directly increase activity of intracellular signaling Pathways that promote hypertrophy and or even decrease the activity of intracellular Pathways that inhibit hypertrophy don't worry if any of this sounds too complex just know there are multiple ways creatine could help build more muscle the more important question is is how much more muscle does creatine help you build since 2014 five meta analyses have explored how creatine may help the lean mass gains you see from resistance training meta analyses for those unaware combine the results of numerous studies looking at the same topic these analyses tend to find Creatine boost the lean mass gains you experience from resistance training by 1 to 1.4 kilog across largely a 7 to 14 we period however one potentially important important consideration is that lean mess since it's all the non-fat tissue which isn't just muscle tissue isn't considered the highest quality measure of hypertrophy instead directly measuring the growth of specific muscles via ultrasound or MRI is considered to be more reliable and precise fortunately we have a recent meta analysis that examines how creatine directly influenced the growth of specific muscles 10 studies were included and when looking at the triceps elbow Flex exors quadriceps and hamstrings creating supplementation produced a 0.10 to 0.16 CM greater increase in muscle thickness compared to taking a placebo the researchers measured the effect sizes of these results effect sizes are simply a measure of how big or small an effect is the overall effect size was 0.11 which the researchers noted to actually be a trivial effect that is less than small this led to the conclusion that the practical significance of creatin for hypertrophy may be minimal but there is a major problem with this conclusion the researchers used effect siiz thresholds that were derived from and tailored for interpreting strength and power gains so using these thresholds on muscle hyper data isn't necessarily sensible fortunately Greg Knuckles from Stronger by science recently formulated effect size threshold specifically tailored to and derived from the hypertrophy research the 0.11 effect size falls into into a small to medium effect making it look better furthermore if we compare this beneficial creatine effect size to the overall effects I seen in the hypertrophy research we come to the conclusion that creatine helps you build muscle onethird faster before moving on to discussing non-responders and high responders some people may be wondering what type of hypertrophy creatin might produce let me explain muscle fibers consists of the contract out proteins and the py plasm which is largely fluid but contains numerous components the current evidence indicates muscle fibers primarily grow through increasing both the contractile proteins and pyroplastic the same rates creatine is an osmolyte which means it can draw in water indeed this paper found creatine supplementation produced an increase in intracellular water content thus some of the increase in muscle size from creatine is likely due to increased fluid in the psychop of mus muscle fibers but we still have evidence creatine May enhance growth of the contracti proteins and recall we detailed potential mechanisms by which creatine could grow the contractile proteins therefore creatine is probably growing both the psychop and contract our proteins but more research is needed for determining the precise proportions one thing to keep in mind is since some of the extra gains from creatin is likely water induced its pure muscle size benefit might reduce long term since once muscle creatine levels are fully saturated presumably no extra water induced gains occur moreover once you stop taking creatine and muscle creatine levels return to Baseline presumably any water Inu size gains you had will be lost this doesn't necessarily mean creatine has little benefits over the long term as we can't rule out the possibility of creatine still producing solid extra contractile protein gains over the very long term or that it still enhances coplas growth via mechanisms independent of the water gains purely associated with the creatine molecules future research is [Music] required so creatine may help you build muscle one/ third faster yet it's important to point out this is an average some people may experience an even greater benefit While others much less as detailed in this excellent classic paper there are non-responders partial responders and high responders to create in supplementation it's estimated 20 to 30% of people could be non-responders non-responders tend to have higher initial creating stores lower muscle fiber sizes and lower fat-free mess higher responders have the opposite of all this this raises an interesting question recoil vegetarians and vegans tend to have lower muscle creatin stores does this mean they are generally higher responders to creatine there only appears to be this Canadian paper 18 vegetarians three of them actually vegan and 24 non-vegetarians supplemented with either creatine or a placebo during 8 weeks of lifting the vegetarian group that supplemented with creatine saw the greatest increases in creatine stores lean mess and endurance versus the non-vegetarians but strength gains were similar between both so overall vegetarians and vegans May indeed generally be higher responders age is another potentially notable Factor we've mentioned that this meta analysis found creatine's beneficial boost in muscle I pury equated to an effect size of 0.11 however the researchers did perform separate analysis on younger and older adults the younger adults saw an effect size benefit of 0.23 which suggests an even greater benefit of creating supplementation the older adult s an effect size benefit of 0.06 which suggests a much smaller benefit of creating supplementation I believe more studies are required to properly conclude include older adults experience relatively low hypy benefit from creatin supplementation it's also worth considering that older adults May largely not always though build less muscle so this could contribute to the seemingly lower effects of creatine but variability between older adults may still exist for example one paper in older adults still found Crea and supplementation resulted in pretty meaningful more overall [Music] hypertrophy so far we've just been talking about muscle building but what about strength gains these meta analyses established creating supplementation boosted bench press and back Squatch strength with effects that would probably be described as small to moderate in percentage terms this classic review paper indicates creatine supplementation increased strength by eight extra percentage points and muscular endurance by 14 extra percentage points but similar to the hypertrophy discussion variability between individuals likely exists for example this paper found over 12 weeks of lifting a group taking creatine increased their bench press one R max strength by 22.6 kg while a group not taking creatine increased their bench press one R max strength by 15 kg but other papers find reduced benefits such as this paper which found over 8 weeks of lifting creatine supplementation increased the bench press one R max strength by 6.8 kg while not taking creatin led to not too far off 5 7 kg increase as a final point for this section older adults do seem to reap respectable strength gains from creatine as this meta analysis which analyze studies specifically on older adults established enhanced chest press and leg press strength with these small to moderate effect sizes let us dissect what the research says about other popular conversations surrounding creatine there is evidence that creatine May enhance recovery and reduce markers of muscle damage after a single training session although it's a little ambiguous if this continues in the long term nonetheless survey data suggests a large bulk of athletes subjectively feel enhanced recovery from creatine supplementation the concern about creatine and hair loss originates from this 200 2009 study which found creatin supplementation increased DHT levels since DH has been linked with hair loss some say this means creatine causes hair loss however there are major problems with this conclusion this is merely one study on 20 rugby players that has never been replicated the increase in DHT was well within the normal physiological range and there's even a case to be made that this was a false positive I've expanded on this false positive point in the pin comment and description if you're interested plus we have other evidence finding creatine doesn't increase other androgens like free testosterone drone perhaps the most crucial final point is as explained by Greg Knuckles from Stronger by science the researchers measured serum DHT levels and this isn't strongly related to hair loss instead it's the local DHT in the scalp that is so in total it is accurate for me to say there is zero scientific evidence associating creatine with actual hair loss it would be dishonest of me to say creatines do absolutely not cause hair loss because absence of evidence does not mean evidence of absence but for now there's as much scientific evidence of creatine causing hair loss as there is evidence for apples causing hair loss but what about the anecdotes you can find many online attributing various hair problems to their creatin supplementation there's a good reason anecdotes are generally poor quality evidence they suffer from imprecise to no actual measurements and a multitude of confounders moreover the rise of the mere idea that creatine accelerates hair loss may just lead people erroneously attributing their head changes to creatine when if they went back in time and never took creatine but still paid close attention to their hair their hair would have seen identical changes ultimately there's going to be a significant overlap in the people predisposed to hair loss and people who lift weights and opt to try creatine if you're seriously concerned you may just want to wait and see if future studies come [Music] out creatine monohydrate is simply the most studied form of creatine however there are Alternative forms of creatine on the market claiming to be superior what does the research say we have this review paper firstly the researchers reviewed the marketplace and demonstrated how all the Alternative creatin forms cost more but importantly none of the Alternative forms have been proven to be superior to monohydrate and some of them don't even consistently outperform placebos therefore monohydrate Remains the most studied form that is the cheapest and effective the fundamental purpose of supplementing creatine is to fully saturate your muscle creatine levels which thereby reaps the benefits there are two approaches commonly taken the first approach uses a loading phase which has you ingest 20 to 25 G typically split into four or five daily doses for 5 to 7 days this aims to fully saturate muscle creating stores and from here you just take 3 to 5 G daily to maintain this the second approach is to forget about loading and just consume 3 to 5 G per day this will delay saturation but this does not matter long term for example taking 3 G per day probably saturates muscle creating Source in 28 days and extrapolating from other data taking 5 G per day may do this in around 14 days feel free to select the approach you prefer the second approach though delaying saturation is cheaper moreover mild gastrointestinal discomfort is seen in some individuals from creatine and this this may be more likely when taking higher doses as done during loading so the second approach may be better here too now when comparing a 3 to 5 G daily dose over the long term one paper largely finds similar strength adaptations so 3 G may be sufficient for the large majority of people and will also knowe that a classic paper established 2 G of creatine was sufficient to maintain saturated muscle creating stores after a loading phase which further supports the notion lower doses may be sufficient for the majority of people although it is likely larger individuals will benefit from doses closer to 5 G scale to body mass 0.04 G per kilogram each day may work there's no evidence that you need to cycle creatine long-term consumption is also safe some have raised concerns relating to the kidneys but this stems from a poor understanding of creatine and creatinine metabolism and a case study published in 1998 creatinine increases from supplementation are not believed to be problem and the 1998 case study had multiple shortcomings we have other data and as concluded in this massive review adverse effects are not seen when they are multiple confounders such as these are in play does the time of day you consume Creatine mattera fascinatingly a meta analysis found lean mass gains were better when supplementing with creatine after training compared to before training however there were merely three studies in this meta analysis strength gains were also similar regardless of when creatine was supplemented we've also had another paper come out since this analysis finding similar hypertrophy and strength gains between supplementing before and after training overall I'd say timing isn't a make or break factor and this is especially likely true in the long term when creatin stores are fully saturated so just consume it whenever you like at the end of the day supplements like creatine are the cherry on top consistent and effective training is going to be the source of the majority of your gains the highquality alpha progression app has all the features any lifter needs in one place

in the 1990s it has become one of the most well researched supplements that has been established to be safe and it enhances hypertrophy and strength with what we can probably describe as small to moderate effects but variability exists some may see larger benefits While others may be non-responders creating monohydrate is the most time tested form other forms are more expensive and have failed to produce Superior effects to monohydrate in the current literature you can have a loading phase if you wish but it's not essential and it technically costs more plus it may cause GI discomfort for some thank you for watching feel free to check out the alpha progression app or our recent deep dive into building the lats"

    "transcript": "welcome to the house of hypertrophy are your exercises enough to optimize growth across regions of a muscle can a muscle even grow unevenly across its regions many say it can't but it can multiple scientific studies demonstrate muscles do not always grow evenly across its regions and there are potentially two key takeaways many are probably unaware of this fascinating data today we'll dissect this to understand what this may and may not mean for developing an overall a itic physique we'll also mention some interesting new research on the biceps later on let's dive in what comes to your mind when I say Regional muscle hypertrophy classically people think about the shape of a muscle such as how some people have biceps with a high peak and others with longer biceps if you have one or the other could you train to change this unfortunately no compelling evidence suggest this precisely is possible however it does appear that the proximal middle and distal regions of a muscle do not always grow uniformly for those unaware proximal refers to the region of a muscle closer to its origin while the distal is the part further away from the origin the middle region is of course in between now unequal growth across these regions does technically cause a change in the shape of the muscle but we'll address later if this is enough to be visually meaningful let's start with the Intriguing range of motion literature there are generally three range of motions a full range of motion moves the joints in the exercise to the fullest potential such as fully extending and bending the elbow during a curl a partial at short length partially moves through the range where the muscle is at a shorter length such as the top part of a curl a partial at long length partially moves through the part where the muscle is at a longer length such as the bottom part of a curl we have a couple of studies comparing and growth across the regions of a muscle between different range of motions and there seems to be a consistent pattern this paper compar full range of motion to partial at Short lengths on the leg extension growth of the vastest lateralis at the proximal portion lean towards the full range of motion growth at the middle region was fairly similar and growth at the distal region was considerably better with the full range motion this idea that full range of motion may be considerably better for the distal regions was also found with a squat in this paper one group squatted to 120\u00b0 of knee flexion while a second squatted to 60\u00b0 the partial at short length only grew the proximal regions of the thigh and actually lost size at the distal regions the 120\u00b0 squats grew all regions fairly similarly and so the biggest difference between the two was again at the distal regions you may be questioning how it's possible for the partial to slightly lose some size I'll likely expand on this in a future video but there's evidence that certain muscle parts can decrease in size even when training anyhow what about partials at long lengths this study compared partials at long to short lengths on the leg extension growth across all three regions of the vastest lateralis favored the long length partials but it was only statistically significant and considerably different at the distal region so similar to a fullrange motion partials at long lengths also seem to produce considerably better distal region growth when compared to partials at Short lengths we've seen this with the biceps to this study compared partials at long to short lengths on the preacher curl growth at the middle region of the biceps was actually similar between both while growth at the distal region was better with the partials at long lengths are there any differences between a partial at long length and full range of motion we've mentioned previously at the house of hper that three Studies have compared them and all of them fascinatingly find overall more hypertrophy with partials at long lengths but only one examined growth across different muscle regions this paper involved training the leg extension with either a for range motion partial at long length and partial at short length and growth was measured across four regions of the vastus lateralis and rectus florus with the vastest lateralis consistent with the research we've seen the partial at Short lengths produced produce notably lower growth at the 60 and 70% regions but were fairly decent at growing the 40 and 50% regions when focusing on the comparison between the partial at long length to full range motion the biggest difference was the partial at long length tended to produce better growth at the 60 and especially 70% regions with the rectus forus again consistent with the research we've seen the partials at sh lengths produce notably lower growth at the 60 and 70% regions but were fairly decent at growing the 40 and 50% regions when focusing on the comparison between the partial at long length to full range motion we can actually see that in all regions the growth favored the long length partials with the biggest difference at the 50 and 70% regions there's not strong enough evidence to say if partials at long lengths always beat out a full range of motion yet all three Studies have been done on previously untrained subjects and there are many exercises that haven't been explored yet but as this early evidence is promising you could experiment with long length partials if you like anyhow the main point is the range of motion research clearly shows muscles do not always grow evenly across their regions and there's a pattern short length partials decently grow the proximal and middle regions of a muscle and we've seen sometimes it produces similar growth of these regions to a full range of motion or partial at long length however partials at Short lengths fail to optimize growth at the distal regions and sometimes result in essentially no growth at these regions many might not have been expecting this and may have been hoping for a precise method to optimize growth at each region we are about to detail how different excises impact growth across regions but here's the Practical takeaway for this section if your goal is to maximally grow all regions of course a full range of motion or even partial at long length is recommended but you could say that if for whatever reason you wanted to keep down growth at the distal part of a muscle a partial at short length may do this successfully remember this research was done on the quads or biceps but my best guess is it probably applies to other muscles for example the PEX distal region is near the arm while the proximal region is near the sternum and clavicle perhaps partials at Short lengths do well at developing the proximal and middle regions but are not as effective as a full range of motion or partial at long length for the distal regions likewise the lat distal region is near the arm while the proximal region is closer to the spine perhaps partials at Short lengths do well at developing the proximal and middle regions but are not as effective as a full range of motion or partial at long length for the distal regions this is speculation as there's no direct research on this yet hopefully this changes soon also all of these studies lasted a few months so it's difficult to say what happens after years for example if with a leg extension one person trained with short length partials and another with long length partials for years my best guess is you may visually see the differences with a partial at long length resulting in comparatively more pronounced development especially at the distal regions yet as there's no long-term studies I would be lying if I said I was certain [Music] another area of the research showing muscles do not always grow equally across its regions is the exercise comparison literature much of this has been done on biarticular muscles which are muscles that cross over two joints these are the main biarticular muscles for example the biceps cross the shoulder and elbow joints as alluded to in the introduction there's actually some exciting new research on the biceps that I'll reveal in a second but let's start with the quads we recently covered this study comparing leaning back to normal leg extensions all four quad heads cross the knee joint but the rectus florus is by articular as it also crosses the hip joints leaning back places the rectus foror specifically at a longer length that is it stretch more and this resulted in more proximal and distal region hypy compared to the normal leg extensions but notice that the biggest difference between the two exercises was at the proximal region further demonstrating how muscle growth can be unevenly distributed similar logic applies to the hamstrings three of the four hamstring muscles are by articular as they cross the knee and hip they are at a longer length with CA leg holes compared to lying leg holes the researchers only looked at proximal and distal region growth of two of the biarticular hamstring muscles both experienced better proximal and distal region hypertrophy with the c leol but again the biggest difference between the two exercises tended to be at the proximal regions as for the biceps data I hinted at this abstract has been revealed it's not published yet but it compared incline CO's to preacher CO's incline CO's plac the biceps at a starting longer length than preacher CO's the abstract tells us that overfall biceps hypertrophy was greater with the incline curl with the authors mentioning the biggest difference was at the proximal regions regular viewers who've seen our previous videos on the biceps may have a ton of questions but once this study is officially published I'll share all my thoughts but for now I do think incline curls are up there as one of the best biceps exercises so in total it seems that compared to training a biarticular muscle at a shorter length training at a longer length builds more muscle with larger differences at the proximal regions this could possibly apply to the triceps and gastrus too but it's not super clear based on the data we have this requires a bit of explaining so if you're interested check out the pin comment where I fully detail the research and my thoughts on Regional hypertrophy with these muscles summoning the spirit of scientific accuracy this idea of larger differences at the proximal region between training by articular muscles at long versus short lengths is based on three studies so I don't want to pretend this is an established fact yet Perhaps there's other unknown details for example example could some sort of threshold exist for instance leaning back leg extensions produced more overall growth than normal leg extensions but lying down leg extensions lengthen the rectus foror even more than leaning back but does it produce more growth it might not as this study found although lying leg extension successfully resulted in more activation especially at the proximal and middle regions compared to normal leg extensions it wasn't any more effective than leaning back if anything its activation was actually slightly lower with lying down we are working on guides to developing each muscle with a few already published these will flesh out more details about exercise recommendations so feel free to check these out and stay tuned for more updated content I'll also add that if you have any questions or confusions I'll do my best to respond in the comments similar to the discussion on range of motion these results might not have been what you wanted perhaps some of you want a certain exercise exercise to grow one region and another exercise to grow a different region but this doesn't seem to be the case rather the simple takeway is ensuring you have exercises that trained by articular muscles at longer lengths is probably a solid idea however you could alternatively say if for whatever reason the extra proximal region growth is not desired training by articular muscles at Short lengths could be useful though we've seen they are also sometimes less effective for distal growth too as some final words if you're a regular viewer of the House of hopy the information here may not have necessarily changed your training but I nonetheless hope it helps understand your own training or just your general knowledge on muscle hypertrophy in some way plus I still think this research is pretty underrated as many still believe muscles grow evenly across all regions it can be tricky and very challenging to construct your own muscle building program but the AL progression app which is

    "published_at": "2023-04-24T11:00:00Z",
    "transcript": "foreign to the house of hypertrophy it's commonly said muscles take 48 to 72 hours to recover from a workout of course the duration of your recovery will be impacted by the training variables you use and non-training related factors but based on how most people tend to train is it accurate to say muscles recover within 48 to 72 hours and therefore we should wait for this duration until we train again otherwise we compromise muscle and strength gains an interesting way to study this is to have one group of subjects perform their workouts 48 to 72 hours apart while another group of subjects performs their workouts 24 hours apart and then compare strength and muscle gains between the groups two Studies have done this let us briefly review them and then discuss their implications [Music] this 2018 stay from Singapore recruited 30 active men and assigned them to either a 24 hour or 48-72 hour group both groups train this training session with these variables three times a week for 12 weeks the 48 to 72-hour group performed the three sessions with 48 to 72 hours of rest between them the 24-hour group performed the three sessions with 24 hours of rest between them nutritional patterns were similar between both groups ultimately 10 rep max strength on a range of exercises increased similarly between both groups lean mass also increased comparably between both groups so these results fail to show it's essential to wait 48 to 72 hours until you train a muscle again for strength and muscle adaptations the second study is from 2016 out of Portugal 21 trained men were recruited and assigned to either a 24-hour War 48 to 72 hour group both groups trained this three-day per week program for seven weeks the 48 Hours a 72-hour group performed the three sessions with 48 to 72 hours of rest between them the 24-hour group performed the three sessions with 24 hours of rest between them fascinatingly neither group experienced measurable fat-free mass increases I think this is probably due to the impreciseness of fat-free mess as a hypertrophy measure if more precise measures of hypertrophy were taken hyperge 3 might have been found nevertheless bench press and leg press one red max strength gains were fairly similar between both groups interestingly the effects slightly favor the 24-hour group but the differences were not statistically different and it could just be the 24-hour group head subjects with slightly better average genetics causing the slight average difference foreign [Music] studies fail to show it's essential to a 48 to 72 hours until you train a muscle again performing three training sessions a week with 24 hours of rest produced comparable adaptations the research on trading frequency further supports the idea you don't always need to wait 48 hours or more to train a muscle again quite a few studies suggest training a muscle 5 or more days per week can be perfectly fine for building muscle and strength for example this 2019 study by zoroni recruiter trained men all subjects train the same exercises and for the same number of total sets per week but a bro split group trained each muscle only once or twice per week while a full body group trained each muscle five times per week after 10 weeks back squats bench press and row strength gains were non-statistically different between both groups but the percentages for the squat tend to favor the full body group fascinatingly triceps elbow flexor and vastus Lateralus hypertrophy tended to be superior for the full body group for a full breakdown of the scientific research on training frequency feel free to check out our video on it before moving on I'd like to tell you about a sponsor Alpha progression consistent training is crucial for long-term gains an alpha progression is a really well designed app that can help the app enables you to visually track your lifting long-term progression which is great for motivation you can input your own program or even Explore the incredibly flexible custom workout generator specify your training experience what equipment you have your trading goals whether you want to focus or neglect certain muscles and how often you want to train and for how long the app also contains a database of over 550 exercises with great text and video tutorials on each by using the link in the comments and description you'll have two weeks free of all its features plus 20 off a subscription if you do purchase the app the house of hypertria will get 50 so This truly helps support these three videos thank you so much [Music] it's logical to think that every single time we train we want muscles to be fully recovered from previous sessions but I'm wondering if training muscles under some degree of fatigue occasionally might be perfectly fine doing so isn't enough to kill the stimulus and Recovery isn't exacerbated in fact we have data showing that if you train a muscle when it's not fully recovered recovery isn't necessarily exacerbated more on this in a second in both the previously detailed studies the 24-hour group since they were training muscles on three consecutive days were more than likely training under some degree of fatigue particularly in those initial training weeks I I purposefully use the word some degree of fatigue in everything just mentioned training under extreme fatigue where the muscle can hardly contract and where you can barely move is probably not going to be worthwhile there is another factor that is very important I just said those initial training sessions for the 24-hour group were probably performed under some degree of fatigue in the later training sessions I actually believe it's likely the 24-hour group was fully recovering between their training sessions I.E they were recovering within 24 hours this is because your muscles have a superpower the repeated bout effect your body produces a range of adaptations that essentially Quicken your recovery durations these adaptations are collectively named the repeated bowel effect in my eyes the repeated bow effect is very underrated and underappreciated our next video will dissect the sign showing the power of the repeated bow effect and what this means for your training before moving on to the summary keep in mind that all the data presented in this video are averages for some individuals it could be possible that this information fails to apply at the end of the day if you experiment with training a muscle quicker than 48 hours apart it should eventually be apparent if you consistently struggle to recover and your muscle and strength gains are lackluster some individuals may be wondering about the recovery of connective tissues such as tendons and ligaments tendon injuries can arise due to the gradual accumulation of micro damage and tends to be due to a mismatch between damage and repair unfortunately it's not clear how much resistance training may damage connective tissues like tendons how long the repair time may be and how different training variables may impact this so it's not super clear if training muscles 24 hours apart increases your likelihood of accumulating fatigue damage of connective tissue even so remember if you're performing something like high frequency training although recovery time between sessions is less most perform lower set numbers per session meaning less connective tissue strain per session additionally it hits likely different tendons and ligaments throughout your body have different resistances to being damaged and of course some people have more resilient tendons and ligaments compared to others it's possible that regardless of how you train D loads are what's required to dissipate fatigue damage with active tissues again though there doesn't appear to be cellular research providing a more Crystal Clear Insight in any case I do plan to dive into this literature further and have future content around connective tissue and resistance training foreign we have data showing that compared to waiting 48 to 72 hours to train a muscle again waiting 24 hours doesn't kill muscle or strength adaptations high frequency training has also been documented to be perfectly fine for muscle hypertrophy and strength of course it's perfectly fine for you to train a muscle 48 to 72 hours or even longer apart again remember the duration of your recovery will certainly be impacted by the training variables you use and non-training related factors nevertheless the aim of this video was to show the scientific literature indicates it's certainly possible for you to construct a successful trading program where you train muscles 24 hours apart so under the right conditions why are we able to train a muscle 24 hours apart your body can produce adaptations that speed up your recovery our next video will detail the very interesting science of this also training under some degree of fatigue occasionally may be perfectly fine the training stimulus is not completely killed and we have data showing that if you train a muscle when it's not fully recovered recovery isn't exacerbated I've actually started a patreon page where I have an extra short video that details this incredibly interesting research plus we cover an interesting study that shows us what could happen to muscle and strength Gates if you're consistently training a muscle under extreme levels of fatigue so if you'd like to check out that extra content and help support the house of hypertrophy I would be thankful if you consider checking the patreon page out thank you until next time [Music]"

    "title": "The Most IMPORTANT Muscle Building Studies from 2024",
    "published_at": "2024-12-23T13:00:04Z",
    "transcript": "welcome to the house of hypertrophy what are the most important training variables for maximizing hypertrophy as 2024 comes to a close I thought it would be nice to review some excellent research this year on key topics like training to failure optimal range of motion and ideal set volume if you're a new viewer welcome this will be a great summary of the year if you're a regular viewer this will help refresh your knowledge B also introduced new research not discussed previously including a fresh paper on training to failure and a study on lengthened partials on just under 300 subjects for your ease the timestamps note where fresh new data is detailed let's dive straight [Music] in training close to failure is crucial for maximizing muscle fiber Recruitment and tension but do we need to always train to failure this year we saw the best design study on this topic to date involving trained individuals with the highest average experience in the failure research participants trained unilateral leg extensions and leg presses one leg trained to momentary muscular failure while the other leg stopped one rep from failure on the leg extension and two reps from failure on the leg press pre-study tests indicated subjects fairly accurately estimated their proximity to failure and here's footage of a subject going to failure and leaving two reps in reserve on the leg press ultimately quad gains were similar between both suggesting stopping one to two rep short of failure may be sufficient for hypertrophy a conclusion supported by other well-designed studies however as detailed in our full breakdown of this study the influence of set numbers is worth considering in the just detailed study participants maintain their pre-study quad volume with a 20% increase Midway this resulted in subjects performing between 10 to 17 weekly sets for the quads some hypothesis Iz though that training to failure might be more beneficial when performing fewer sets I'm glad to say a brand new study explored this 42 trained individuals perform this program two times a week with just one set on each exercise thereby totaling these low weekly sets for each muscle one group took each set to momentary muscular failure while another group aimed to stop with two reps in reserve analyses indicated subjects reasonably estimated how far from failure they were accuracy was high on the bench press versus Squat and they improve their accuracy across time on the bench press ultimately while the differences were not statistically conclusive the raw numbers lean towards training to failure for most measurements except the biceps which could be due to chance another study a few years back found with one set per exercise failure tended to produce better growth outcomes than stopping shy of failure so in total though this is by no means case closed the early evidence May IND deed suggest with low volumes training to failure provides some growth Advantage whereas when training with a higher number of sets stopping just short of failure May largely be [Music] similar what is the optimal range of motion for building muscle a brand new study adds to this literature firstly a full range of motion moves the joints through the largest capacity possible a short and partial move through the halfway the muscle is at a shorter length while lengthened partial moves through the half where the muscle is at a longer length it was long believed a 4in motion was superior but this was based on comparisons with shorten partials some data in the last few years found lengthen partials build overall more muscle than a full range motion however these studies were done on untrained individuals just training either the car raate leg extension or a hip extension exercise what about trained individuals and other exercises that brings us to the bra new study on just under 300 subjects with at least 6 months of experience this was a randomized traal done across 15 different locations subjects trained this two-day a week program for 12 weeks performing just one set to momentary failure per exercise one condition trained with a full range of motion on everything while another condition trained the highlighted exercises with a lengthened partial but a full range motion on the non-h highlighted exercises increases in arm and thigh muscle area were fundamentally not different between both suggesting lengthen partials may just be similarly effective to a full range motion the strength of this study was the incredibly large number of subjects however arm and thigh area were estimated from circumference and skinfold measurements which have limitations although the authors took steps to reduce this as much as possible the subjects were also not necessarily highly trained the length and partials weren't deployed on all exercises and the overall volume of training was low nevertheless we did have another study a few months ago funded by none other than Jeff nippard 25 individuals with an average of 4.9 years of experience performed this program one side of their body trained with a full-range motion on everything while the other side of their body trained with length and partials on everything increases in elbow flexor and triceps growth were similar reinforcing the idea lengthen parti may just be similar to a full range Motion in trained individuals summoning the spirit of scientific accuracy consideration still exist one hypothesis suggest lengthened partials may only be beneficial with exercises typically most challenging at Short muscle lengths including C raises rows lateral raises leg hoses and leg extensions indeed recall two of the studies on untrained individuals finding greater horty with length and partials use car phrases and leg extensions but the latest study on trained individuals did involve leg extensions and did not support the superiority of lengthen partials although another hypothesis is that lengthened partials only specifically benefit the distal regions of a muscle in both of these studies on trained individuals growth was just measured around the middle regions of a muscle meaning we cannot be certain how distal region growth compared more research is needed to clarify these nuances I'll also brief ly add that some shorten partials are completely ineffective yet they still build muscle and in some studies not all shorten partials actually grow specific regions of a muscle similarly to a full range of motion and lengthen partial a deeper dive into range of motion and the potential utility of shorts and partials is on my to-do list all in all its clear range of motion is not the most important variable for growing you can grow with all types of range of motions but my current take is if you're trying to maximize overall hypertrophy both a full range of motion and length and partial are viable options so pick your preference a mixture of both in your overall program is not impossible [Music] either how many sets should you perform this year we saw the largest analysis on this to date generally suggesting higher set numbers build more muscle but fascinatingly strength strength gains were maximized with much lower set numbers why did I bring up this strength data it is just interesting to know the results but I've also seen it argued since muscle growth is an increase in contractile units more muscle should result in Greater strength but as we see a plateau in strength much earlier surely the growth with higher set numbers is just muscle swelling not real growth in the original video I dissected whether we have enough evidence to say swelling is certainly confounding the data we don't in fact there's evidence muscle swelling post training can decrease notably as you continue with a program so what's going on with the strength data I would like to credit a fantastic article by Greg Knuckles from Stronger by science simply put using strength data to infer hypertrophy is not a great idea feel free to pause and read why the key is that under the conditions being studied it absolutely should not be surprising for strength and hypertrophy results to differ one excellent example is that any deficits appear to reduce lean mass gains but not necessarily strength gains so should you aim for very high set numbers to build muscle well remember there were diminishing returns those initial sets give you a great return while those later sets yield progressively smaller benefits so it is certainly possible to grow respectably without a turn of sets plus the credible intervals indicate more uncertainty Beyond 25 weekly sets per Master group indeed there are a limited number of of studies exploring these kinds of volumes so a true Plateau could emerge with future research in fact an individual study published just this month found no additional growth with higher set numbers I intend to dissect this soon and have a more comprehensive video on set numbers exploring other ideas such as whether things change as you become more advanced for now my general recommendation is to maximize your training quality ensure you're training hard enough and selecting exercises that are ideal for growing among muscle then perform as much as you can personally and practically handle I would guess this Force around 12 to 20 weekly sets per muscle group for most people but experimenting with more or fewer sets based on your judgment can be [Music] worthwhile before wrapping up let's briefly touch on some interesting muscle physiology research this year some researchers have begun exploring if muscles compete with each other for growth name mely does your bicep see the best growth if the only thing you did was train the biceps when training your full body perhaps some of that biceps growth is instead diverted to support the growth of all your other muscles a fascinating study this year though limited found that some muscles that weren't trained actually decrease in size possibly to support the growth of the trained muscles this was more pronounced when calorie and protein intake were lower if true dedicating periods to specialize in certain and muscles while reducing emphasis on others could accelerate their growth This research is still in its infancy so while nothing is certain yet I'm excited to see how it evolves another paper published this year provides insight into muscle hyperplasia while muscle hypertrophy is established which is an increase in the size of individual muscle fibers whether hyperplasia which is an increase in the number of fibers occurs is debated studying this in humans is challenging humans have upwards of hundreds of thousands of fibers in each muscle and there's no simple way to precisely measure this but this study used an indirect equation for muscle fiber number estimates they compared a group of trained individuals to a matched group of untrained individuals it found that the trained individuals had 70% larger muscles which involved both larger individual fiber sizes but also a greater number of muscle fibers suggesting both hypertrophy and hyperplasia contribute to the greater overall muscle size though this is just a cross-sectional study with estimations for fiber numbers I'm hopeful that as technology improves we'll see research that can causally determine if lifting weights really increases fiber numbers over time there's even more excellent research this year that's too much to fit all in this video from Progressive overload to quad

    "title": "Train LESS For More Muscle? (New Training Breaks Data)",
    "published_at": "2023-06-26T11:00:03Z",
    "transcript": "welcome to the house of hypertrophy what happens if instead of training every single week you take a complete training break every few weeks does it boost muscle and strength gains or does it hurt and reduce your gains a brand new study has examined this let's Dive In [Music] why could training breaks be beneficial besides potentially lowering fatigue some evidence suggests that as you train week after week the antibiotic Pathways that regulate muscle growth may become desensitized and that taking a break might be able to re-sensitize the anabolic Pathways suggesting that implementing breaks every so often could lead to more muscle aperture over the long term but this is just molecular data this is where the new study comes into play it's directly measured muscle hypertrophy and strength gains 39 trained individuals with an average of 3.5 years of training experience were assigned into a break or normal group both groups train their upper and lower body twice a week all the muscle growth and strength measurements were done on the lower body so we'll just focus on the lower body training which heads subjects during the Smith machine back squat leg extension calf press and seated calf raise with these variables the normal group trained every single week for nine weeks the break group trained for four weeks completely rested in the fifth week and then trained from the 6th to the final ninth week the before and after the study strength was assessed by measuring their maximal isometric leg extension strength and Smith machine back score one rep max muscle growth was assessed by measuring rectus femoris and vastus lateralis thickness at 30 50 and 70 of the lower leg length as well as medial gastrocnemius lateral gastrocnemius and Soleus thickness at 25 of the lower leg length it was ultimately found that by the end of the study all muscle growth measurements increased fairly similarly between the break and normal groups as for strength both groups increased isometric leg extension strength and Smith machine back squat owner MX but the gains were slightly greater for the normal group therefore this study suggests taking a complete break from training in the middle of nine weeks did not reduce or increase muscle growth but it did actually slightly reduce strength gains foreign so this new study does not strictly support the idea that training breaks re-sensitize your anabolic Pathways and thereby lead to Greater muscle growth but I don't think this study completely debunks the idea of resensitization you'll see potentially why a little later nevertheless there are different ways you may interpret this data since muscle growth was similar between both groups you may be thinking that it's pretty cool the brick groups or similar gains despite training less more precisely the one week break in the middle of the nine weeks resulted in them performing 40 fewer lower body sets translating into 11 less work there's also another study by Oka sawara that you may be aware of if you followed the house of hypertrophy for a while which had one group train every week across 24 weeks and another group that throughout the 24 weeks cycled between training for six weeks and then completely resting for three weeks chest and triceps growth were similar between both groups by the end of the study despite the fact that break group trained 25 percent less interestingly Benchmark strength gains were also similar between the normal and groups which somewhat conflicts with the newer study nonetheless another interpretation is that if you hate training brakes the good news is this new study and the ogre Saguaro one indicates they aren't necessary for seeing great gains and we even know strength games were slightly lowered with the breaks in the new study the subjects of the new study also did not seem to be fond of the breaks as they reported feeling lethargic after the break rather than refreshed ultimately You may wish to just take breaks or deloads whenever you feel your body and or mind requires it as opposed to scheduling them every certain number of weeks speaking of deloads which in this case I mean reducing your volume and or intensity for a week as opposed to stopping training completely it's not clear if the findings of the new study transfer to deloads from a muscle building perspective previous research has interestingly found the molecular responses to deloading and taking breaks were largely similar but future research on Dilo specifically are needed for hypertrophy and presuming sooner or later we'll have studies on this if you're curious about further ideas for creating an effective muscle building program Alpha progression can help you out it's got a flexible custom workout generator that can tailor a muscle building program to your needs with training variables that are grounded in various meta-analyzes and reviews from the scientific literature input your training experience the equipment you have available if you want to focus or neglect certain muscles how often you want to train and for how long if you prefer to have scheduled delos or Paradise set numbers and Reps in reserve those options are available too you can still edit and individualize things to your liking the flexibility is virtually endless which is something I think is truly special about the app the app also has aesthetic graphs displaying a long-term progression and there's a database of over 550 exercises with great text and video tutorials the link in the comments and description gives you a free two-week trial of all the app's features and if you like it and go beyond the link gives you 20 off a subscription foreign [Music] 24 weeks chest and triceps growth were similar between a normal empiric group however you can actually see the normal groups seemingly were nearing a plateau whereas the break group gains consistently rebounded at a fairly fast rate after the breaks perhaps due to being re-sensitized thus it's possible that in a longer time frame the group taking the breaks may have truly built more muscle maybe this also applies to the new study although over nine weeks muscle growth was similar between the normal and break groups if the study was longer perhaps the normal group's growth would net a plateau whereas the break group if they were seeing some kind of very small resensitization effects from the brakes would ultimately experience better hypertrophy for now this is very much speculative it will be interesting to see if future research provides us with insights into whether this is true or not [Music] this new study finds taking a complete break in the middle of nine weeks did not improve or hurt muscle growth but it did slightly compromise strength gains we've had other research by Oka sawara comparably finding that across 24 weeks taking a three-week break every six weeks did not hurt or improve muscle growth but in this particular ogosaurus study strength gains were also not compromised with a break your interpretations and takeaways from this data May differ depending on your point of view but one clear takeaway from this data is that breaks should not be fed we know strength gains were reduced in the newer study but the reduction in strength was only small and we still have the ogosaurus study finding strength gains were not compromised by taking training breaks so whether you have to take an unexpected break or you just like occasionally taking a break this is perfectly fine more research is needed on deloads where you reduce volume and or intensity as well as if training brakes or deloads have any benefits in the very long term you can be sure that if any new data comes along we'll be covering it here at the house of hypertrophy

    "title": "Do 5 Reps MAXIMIZE Hypertrophy? (NEW STUDY)",
    "published_at": "2022-04-04T11:00:00Z",
    "transcript": "For maximizing hypertrophy, should low,\u00a0\nmoderate, or high repetition numbers be used? Well, as we've mentioned in other\u00a0\nvideos, there's a great number of\u00a0\u00a0 studies finding loads between 80% one-rep\u00a0\nmax and 30% one-rep max produce similar\u00a0\u00a0 muscle hypertrophy, so long as repetitions\u00a0\nare performed to or very close to failure. Very broadly, this equates to\u00a0\nperforming between 8 and 35 repetitions. But, what about fewer than 8 repetitions? Say 5 repetitions, for example. Could\u00a0\nthis still optimize hypertrophy? For quite a while, I automatically\u00a0\nassumed there was good evidence showing\u00a0\u00a0 5 repetitions could build muscle optimally. In fact, I've previously said in videos reps\u00a0\nbetween 5 and 35 are similarly effective\u00a0\u00a0 for hypertrophy, provided repetitions\u00a0\nare performed to or close to failure. However, a new study by Vann et al. made\u00a0\nme re-assess this belief and re-examine the\u00a0\u00a0 research on rep ranges, and now I'm less certain\u00a0\nif 5 repetitions could optimally build muscle. Let us overview this study,\u00a0\ndiscuss its limitations,\u00a0\u00a0 and then detail how it relates to\u00a0\nthe overall rep range research. Vann et al. recruited 15 trained men\u00a0\nwith an average back squat of 167kg.\u00a0\u00a0 For these subjects, this equated to\u00a0\nthem squatting 1.9x their bodyweight. Each subject had one leg assigned\u00a0\nto a high load condition,\u00a0\u00a0 and their other leg assigned\u00a0\nto a high volume condition. Both legs were trained on the unilateral\u00a0\nleg extension and unilateral leg press,\u00a0\u00a0 three times per week for a total of 6 weeks. With the leg assigned to the high load\u00a0\ncondition, they performed 3 sets of 5\u00a0\u00a0 repetitions on both exercises every session.\u00a0\nThey also progressed load weekly by 2.5%. During the first week, they trained with\u00a0\n82.5% of the pre-study one-rep maxes on both\u00a0\u00a0 exercises, and they progressed this load by\u00a0\n2.5% each week such that by the 6th week,\u00a0\u00a0 they were training with 95% of their\u00a0\npre-study one-rep maxes on both exercises. With the leg assigned to the high volume\u00a0\ncondition, they performed the program on-screen. They trained with sets of 10 repetitions with 60%\u00a0\u00a0 one-rep max loads. They did not progress\u00a0\nthis load whatsoever throughout the study.\u00a0\u00a0 By the 6th week, they were still training\u00a0\nwith 60% of their pre-study one-rep maxes. What they did progress, however, was\u00a0\nthe volume (in the form of sets). During the first weeks, they mainly\u00a0\nperformed 1 to 2 sets per exercise.\u00a0\u00a0 But during the later weeks, they mainly\u00a0\nperformed 3 or 4 sets per exercise. Before and after the study, a\u00a0\nrange of measurements was assessed. The main one we'll explore is\u00a0\ncross-sectional area of the vastus lateralis\u00a0\u00a0 (which is an indictor of\u00a0\nvastus lateralis hypertrophy). After the study, the researchers\u00a0\nfound increases in vastus lateralis\u00a0\u00a0 cross-sectional area were greater for the high\u00a0\nvolume condition versus the high load condition.\u00a0\u00a0 In fact, the high load condition\u00a0\nsaw on average no gains. In other words, performing sets of 10 reps with a\u00a0\n60% one-rep max load, and progressing set numbers\u00a0\u00a0 but not load, produced more hypertrophy than\u00a0\nperforming sets of 5 reps and progressing load. These findings are highly interesting,\u00a0\nespecially when considering how the two\u00a0\u00a0 conditions differed in the set numbers they\u00a0\nperformed and how close to failure they trained. Exploring set numbers first, despite the high\u00a0\nvolume condition progressing their set numbers\u00a0\u00a0 across the 6 weeks, they still ultimately did not\u00a0\nperform as many sets as the high load condition. The high load condition performed\u00a0\n18 weekly sets for the quads,\u00a0\u00a0 whereas the high volume condition only\u00a0\naveraged 15 weekly sets for the quads. Despite these differences, the high volume\u00a0\ncondition still experienced more growth. As for how close to failure they trained, we know\u00a0\nthe high volume condition involved performing sets\u00a0\u00a0 of 10 reps with a 60% one-rep max load, and they\u00a0\ndid not progress load at all throughout the study. As you can probably perform\u00a0\n20 maximum repetitions,\u00a0\u00a0 give or take a few, with a 60% one-rep max\u00a0\nload, this group would have been training\u00a0\u00a0 10 or so reps away from failure per\u00a0\nset. This is very far from failure. Opposingly, the high load condition\u00a0\nperformed sets of 5 reps with loads that\u00a0\u00a0 likely meant they were largely training\u00a0\n0 to 3 reps away from failure per set. Despite the high volume condition training much\u00a0\nfurther from failure than the high load condition,\u00a0\u00a0 they experienced more vastus\u00a0\nlateralis hypertrophy. Let us now go through some limitations and\u00a0\nconsiderations with this Vann et al. study,\u00a0\u00a0 and then try and figure out how it\u00a0\nfits into the rest of the literature. Firstly, we know that by the end of the study,\u00a0\nthe high volume condition saw greater increases\u00a0\u00a0 in vastus lateralis cross-sectional\u00a0\narea versus the high load condition. These after study measurements were taken 3\u00a0\ndays after the final training session. However,\u00a0\u00a0 the researchers also took this measurement\u00a0\nagain 10 days after the final training session. For the high volume condition, they saw\u00a0\na numerical decrease in average vastus\u00a0\u00a0 lateralis cross-sectional area from 3 days\u00a0\nto 10 days after the final training session.\u00a0\u00a0 Now, this change in cross-sectional area from 3 to\u00a0\n10 days after the final session was not classified\u00a0\u00a0 as statistically signficant. Even so, as the\u00a0\nsubjects did not train in these days after the\u00a0\u00a0 final session, this numerical decrease in muscle\u00a0\nsize can likely just be attributed to detraining. However, for the high load condition, they\u00a0\nsaw a numerical increase in average vastus\u00a0\u00a0 lateralis cross-sectional area from 3 days\u00a0\nto 10 days after the final training session.\u00a0\u00a0 Now, this change in cross-sectional area from 3 to\u00a0\n10 days after the final session was not classified\u00a0\u00a0 as statistically signficant, but it's nonetheless\u00a0\ndifficult to say why the numerical average did\u00a0\u00a0 increase given they were not training. Perhaps it\u00a0\nwas some sort of delayed supercompensation thing. Overall, I don't really think any of this\u00a0\nchanges the interpretation of the study.\u00a0\u00a0 After all, 3 days after the final training\u00a0\nsession, the high volume condition\u00a0\u00a0 still experienced more vastus lateralis\u00a0\nhypertrophy than the high load condition.\u00a0\u00a0 I just nonetheless thought it would be worth\u00a0\nsharing this slightly peculiar finding. The second limitation/consideration is\u00a0\nthe study only included 15 trained men,\u00a0\u00a0 which like most resistance training\u00a0\nstudies, is a very small sample size.\u00a0\u00a0 Larger sample sizes would likely be more\u00a0\ninformative and strengthen the data. As a final limitation/consideration,\u00a0\nthe study was only 6 weeks,\u00a0\u00a0 which is on the shorter side of typical\u00a0\nresistance training studies we see. Hypertrophy is not a quick process,\u00a0\nespecially in trained individuals,\u00a0\u00a0 so it would be interesting to see how this\u00a0\nstudy design plays out in the longer term. Moving forward, what are the potential\u00a0\ntakeaway from this Vann et al. study,\u00a0\u00a0 and how does it relate to\u00a0\nthe rest of the literature? Two potential takeaway are that maybe\u00a0\nthere could be something special about\u00a0\u00a0 progressing set numbers for hypertrophy and/or\u00a0\n5 reps are simply suboptimal for hypertrophy. The first one, that there's some special\u00a0\nabout progressing set numbers for hypertrophy,\u00a0\u00a0 is difficult to verify. There simply is no\u00a0\nother research (I'm aware of) exploring how\u00a0\u00a0 progressing set numbers over weeks compares to\u00a0\ntraining with the same number of weekly sets.\u00a0\u00a0 As a result, there really is\u00a0\nnot much else to comment here,\u00a0\u00a0 we can only hope that future\u00a0\nresearch provides further insight. As for the second one, could 5 reps\u00a0\nsimply be suboptimal for hypertrophy? What does the rest of the research say? The table on screen summarizes all\u00a0\nthe current research (I'm aware of)\u00a0\u00a0 exploring how 5 or so reps compares\u00a0\nto higher rep numbers for hypertrophy. I should note all studies had subjects perform\u00a0\ntheir reps to or very close to failure. All of them indicate 5 or so reps were similarly\u00a0\neffective to higher rep numbers for hypertrophy,\u00a0\u00a0 indicating 5 or so reps might be\u00a0\nperfectly optimal for hypertrophy. However, all but one of them also had confounders. More precisely, the subjects training with 5 or\u00a0\nso reps performed more sets per exercise and/or\u00a0\u00a0 used longer rest intervals between sets than\u00a0\nthe subjects training with higher rep numbers. In many cases, performing more sets per exercise\u00a0\nand resting longer between sets (particularly\u00a0\u00a0 resting longer between sets of compound\u00a0\nexercises) seems to be better for hypertrophy. Thus, I think we could argue\u00a0\nmuch of these studies were\u00a0\u00a0 biased towards the subjects\u00a0\ntraining with 5 or so reps. If set numbers and rest interval durations\u00a0\nwere equated between all subjects, maybe\u00a0\u00a0 training with 5 reps would have been suboptimal\u00a0\ncompared to training with higher rep numbers. Now, one study by Weiss et\u00a0\nal. did actually have all\u00a0\u00a0 subjects train with the same set\u00a0\nnumbers and rest interval durations. This study did actually find that 3-5 reps\u00a0\nwere similarly effective to 13-15 reps\u00a0\u00a0 and 23-25 reps for building muscle. Nevertheless, combining the Vann et al.\u00a0\nstudy with the rest of this overall data,\u00a0\u00a0 it's clear to see it is far from crystal\u00a0\nclear as to whether 5 reps can truly be\u00a0\u00a0 optimal and efficient for hypertrophy. More research is going to be\u00a0\nhighly valuable and insightful. At the end of the day, it's really your choice on\u00a0\nhow you interpret all the data we've overviewed. If your main goal is to maximize hypertrophy, and\u00a0\nyou've been training with 5 reps and experiencing\u00a0\u00a0 perfectly fine hypertrophy, I don't think\u00a0\nthere's any solid reason to change anything. However, if you have been experiencing\u00a0\nsubpar hypertrophy from sets of 5\u00a0\u00a0 and/or you'd just like to err on the side\u00a0\nof caution to ensure you're maximizing\u00a0\u00a0 hypertrophy most efficiently, it might be\u00a0\nsensible to avoid training with 5 reps,\u00a0\u00a0 at least for the time being until\u00a0\nthere's further future research. As noted at the start of this video, there's\u00a0\na good number of studies demonstrating with\u00a0\u00a0 all other training variables equal, 8-35\u00a0\nreps are similarly effective for building\u00a0\u00a0 muscle so long as repetitions are\u00a0\nperformed to or close to failure.\u00a0\u00a0 As a result, it may be sensible to\u00a0\nstay within this repetition range."

    "title": "Is the Squat ENOUGH for Leg Growth?! (Research Overview)",
    "published_at": "2020-08-31T11:56:17Z",
    "transcript": "the back squat is probably the most popular lower body exercise it's sometimes even referred to as the king of all exercises could you get away with only back squatting for the rest of your training career and experience close to or even maximal leg hypertrophy back squat here refers to the high bar back squat but note much of this video will apply to the low bar back squat and the front squat as there are way more similarities between these movements than differences we'll also be mentioning the effect of different squat depths and stance widths throughout the video let's first figure out if the back squat is enough for maximizing quadriceps hypertrophy a study by fonseca and colleagues gives us an interesting insight 49 untrained men were split into five groups we won't mention the control group as they did not train the four groups trained twice per week for 12 weeks group 1 performed the back squat only with around 8 reps per set group 2 performed a variety of leg exercises the back squat and leg press from weeks 1 to 4 the back squat and deadlift from weeks 5 to 8 and the back squat deadlift and lunge from weeks 9 to 12. all exercises were performed with around 8 reps per set group 3 like group 1 performed the back squat only but they used a variety of rep ranges throughout the 12 weeks group 4 like group 2 perform the same variety of leg exercises but they used a variety of rep ranges throughout the 12 weeks i should mention that the back squat was performed on a smith machine and to only 90 degrees of knee flexion this sounds terrible but it probably isn't actually a big deal in my free weights vs machine video i explain why the smith machine back squat can probably produce similar growth to the back score additionally research by kubo and colleagues suggests 140 degree knee flexion squats so deep squats produce similar quadriceps hypertrophy to 90 degree knee flexion squats returning to the study cross-sectional area of the vastus lateralis vastus medialis rectus femoris and vastus intermedius was measured before and after the 12 weeks for all groups the groups that varied their exercises to groups 2 and 4 experienced statistically significant growth of all quadriceps heads the groups that only squatted so groups 1 and 3 did not group 1 did not experience statistically significant growth of the vastus medialis and directors femoris group 3 did not experience statistically significant growth of the rectus femoris therefore this study suggests that a variety of leg exercises is likely better for overall quads hypertrophy if you're not sold on this study because of the smith machine and 90 degrees of knee flexion the already mentioned kubo and colleague study provide us with further valuable details they had 17 untrained men perform either back squats with 140 degrees of knee flexion or back squats with 90 degrees of knee flexion both groups trained twice per week for 10 weeks neither group experienced significant growth of the rectus femoris the rectus femoris is the main muscle of the quadriceps that is poorly trained with the squat it crosses both the hip and knee joint and is involved in knee extension and hip flexion during the squat the rectus femoris actually remains at a fairly constant length throughout the movement and therefore hardly contracts as shown by fonseca and colleagues a variety of leg exercises can help also exercises like the leg extension and reverse nordic curl have been documented to be quite good at growing directors for morris the hamstring muscles also cross the hip joint and knee joint although the short head of the biceps femoris is an exception here the hamstrings extend the hip but also flex the knee during the squat the hamstrings like the rectus femoris seem to remain at a fairly constant length throughout the movement and therefore hardly contract returning to the kubo and colic study they also measured hamstring growth neither the group that squatted with 140 degrees of knee flexion or the group that squatted with 90 degrees of knee flexion experienced significant hamstring hypertrophy another study by bloomquist and colleagues measured hamstring cross-sectional area multiple regions of the muscle they had one group squatting to 60 degrees of knee flexion so very partial squats and another group squatting to 120 degrees of knee flexion which are around parallel squats overall there was very minimal increases in cross-sectional area in some regions and actually a decrease in cross-sectional area in other regions therefore dedicated hamstring exercises are very much necessary in the kubo and colic study gluteus maximus volume was also measured they found that the group that squatted with 90 degrees of knee flexion experienced minimal gluteus maximus hypertrophy but the group that squatted with 140 degrees of knee flexion experienced substantial gluteus maximus hypertrophy therefore with around shoulder width stances deeper squats seem to be important for growing the gluteus maximus if with a shoulder-width stance your anatomy does not allow you to comfortably squat deep wider stance squats might be favorable for gluteus maximus development emg research has suggested wider squat stances induce relatively high gluteus maximus electrical activity so does this mean the squat can be enough for glute hypertrophy it's probably still a good idea to involve other hip extension exercises such as deadlift variations or hip thrust variations these are probably useful to target regions of the glutes the squat may under stimulate moreover the other regions of the glutes we haven't discussed so the gluteus medius and minimus are heavily involved in hip abduction to maximize hypertrophy of these muscles hip abduction exercises like a cable hip abduction is likely necessary returning yet again to the kubo and colleague study a doctor volume was measured too the group that squatted with 90 degrees of knee flexion experienced minimal growth of this muscle group whereas the group that squatted with 140 degrees of knee flexion experienced significant growth of this muscle group the adductor magnus is likely responsible for this modeling research suggests that the dr magnus plays a significant role in hip extension during the squat especially at deeper depths however the squat alone is still probably not enough for overall adductor hypertrophy much of the other muscles of the adductors are primarily involved in hip adduction and so performing something like a cable hip adduction is likely necessary to significantly hypertrophy the overall adductors most already intuitively know that squats aren't going to significantly hypertrophy the calves the calves consist of the gastrocnemius and soleus both these muscles are heavily involved in plantar flexion therefore standing and seated calf raises are exercises that will heavily recruit the calves as a note seated calf raises are going to be particularly good for the soleus while standing calf raises are particularly good for the gastrocnemius to conclude regardless of the squat variation it without doubt would be a great exercise for growing a lot of your leg muscles but at the end of the day other leg exercises are still necessary to stimulate muscle groups that the squat may under stimulate or not target at all [Music]"

    "title": "The BIGGEST Muscle Building Myth Ever (Microtears)",
    "published_at": "2022-08-08T11:00:00Z",
    "transcript": "[Music] when you train hard and create micro tears in your muscle fibers you've created the primary stimulus for muscle hypertrophy your body will repair the micro tears and ultimately create a bigger and stronger muscle how many times do you think you've heard this chances are a lot these two videos with a combined net 40 million views both suggest micro tears are the primary stimulus for muscle hypertrophy if this is true the implication is you'd want to consistently train in a way that produces high levels of muscle damage if you don't you're leaving gains on the table however what if we actually examine the literature on the stimuli behind muscle hypertrophy is damage the primary stimulus for gains or is it something else well let's go ahead and summarize the current literature [Music] people have suggested micro tears drive muscle hypertrophy based on a few different arguments when muscles get damaged immune cells called neutrophils travel to the location of damage primarily removing cellular debris but neutrophils also produce reactive oxygen species and reactive oxygen species have been theorized to promote muscle hypertrophy potentially via increasing activation of the mapk signaling pathway a pathway that ultimately increases protein synthesis and thus muscle size moreover another immune cell called macrophages are also believed to produce something called myokines and myokines are small proteins that may also promote muscle hypertrophy aside from these immune cells muscle damage can also cause the buildup of fluid and proteins at the site of damage resulting in cell swelling this swelling puts pressure on various things in the muscle fiber and it's thought the cell sees this as a threat to its integrity subsequently resulting in protein synthesis increases while protein breakdown decreases ultimately leading to an increase in muscle size the final main reason behind why people have speculated damage stripes hypertrophy relates to eccentric only training during your normal exercises notice how you're challenged significantly more during the lifting termed concentric phase versus the lowering terms eccentric phase eccentric only training is where specialized machine or some equipment overloads and challenges you during only the eccentric phase this type of training produces substantially more damage than normal or concentric only training and eccentric training has been proposed to produce more hypertrophy in the long term thus perhaps the greater damage with eccentric only training causes the greater long-term muscle hypertrophy so the immune cell response cell swelling and eccentric only training are all lines of evidence that suggest damage may be important for muscle hypertrophy but does this conclusively mean damage drives hypertrophy no [Music] regarding the immune cell and cell swelling arguments though suggesting a potential avenue between damage and hypertrophy it's just a mechanistic discussion it isn't sufficient to prove more damaging training produces more long-term hypertrophy moreover although we noted reactive oxygen species may play a role in increasing mapk signaling it is also believed to have anti-muscle growth effects making its overall role in muscle hypertrophy far from crystal clear with eccentric only training some may suggest this is direct evidence more damage leads to more hypertrophy however this does not seem to be true the idea eccentric only training produces more hypertrophy comes from older research conducted before 2010 since then more research has come out and the whole body of evidence fails to demonstrate eccentric only training is superior quoting a 2017 review study we conclude that when matched for either maximum load or work similar increases in muscle size is found between eccentric and concentric resisted training interestingly eccentric only training despite similar overall muscle size increases may be able to produce a different type of hypertrophy versus concentric and normal training but will save this fascinating finding for another video progressing on we have some solid data that seriously questions the importance of damage for hypertrophy a 2011 study out of the usa by flynn and colleagues assigned 14 untrained men into a pre-trained or naive group the naive group performed eccentric exercise on a leg cycle ergometer for 20 minutes at a somewhat hard exertion level measured using a subjective scale three times a week for eight weeks the pre-trained group did the same thing but they had a three-week ramp-up phase before the eight weeks where they gradually acclimatized themselves to the training program due to this acclimatization phase they ended up experiencing little amounts of damage across the training weeks whereas the naive group experienced much higher damage levels across the training weeks yet hypertrophy of the quadriceps ended up being comparable between both groups now the naive group did on average c 1 greater gains but this might just be due to random chance and not the actual training regime as it was not statistically significant another 2016 study out of brazil by damask and colleagues further indicates damage isn't related to hypertrophy they found after untrained individuals performed a single training session myofibular protein synthesis was of course increased afterwards however this increase in my fibular protein synthesis did not correlate with muscle hypertrophy rather it seems it was directed towards repairing the damage induced by that single training session as these same subjects continued training for some weeks which resulted in them experiencing less and less damage as your body produces adaptations that make you resilient to muscle damage it was only then the my fibula protein synthesis increases after training correlated with muscle hypertrophy rephrasing all this this data suggests after an initial workout that produces much muscle damage the myofibular protein synthesis increase afterwards is mainly directed towards repairing the damage not increasing muscle size but after a few weeks of consistent training which allows the body to produce adaptations that reduce the damage experienced then the myofibrillar protein synthesis response is strongly directed towards increasing muscle size the indirect implication of this study is excessive damage might actually be counterproductive for hypertrophy and indeed a 1999 study out of the usa similarly indicates this in fact this study suggests in certain cases excessive muscle damage causes muscle loss they had six men perform five sets of ten eccentric biceps curls with 110 percent of their concentric one rep max signs of damage and swelling persisted for seven days after the session but after this subsided muscle volume actually decreased by 10 to what it was before the study and it remained at the smaller size for numerous further weeks this might be because excessive damage can cause partial or total destruction of subpopulations of muscle fibers a few other lines of evidence similarly imply excessive damage may cause muscle loss a final nail in the coffin for the idea that damage is the primary driver of hypertrophy is the existence of indirect evidence finding regimes that produce more damage do not produce more hypertrophy higher rep ranges likely cause more muscle damage but we now know from numerous studies higher and lower reps can produce similar hypertrophy short rest between sets one minute or less tends to cause more muscle damage than resting longer between sets yet we know with compound exercises at least resting 2.5 to 3 minutes between sets produces more hypertrophy than resting for one minute or less finally bro split routines where you cram all your volume for a muscle group into a single session per week will cause more muscle damage versus spreading your volume for a muscle group across more days per week as done with full body workouts yet bro splits are likely not superior for building muscle [Music] in summary muscle damage is clearly not the primary stimulus for hypertrophy so what is mechanical tension is likely the primary hypertrophy stimulus muscle fibers contain mechanosensors that can detect tension and then convert this tension into a signaling event that leads to myofibrillar protein synthesis increases thus to optimize mechanical tension we'd want to recruit as many muscle fibers as possible and expose each fiber to a decent amount of tension achieving this is not complicated you'd want to get to or close to failure with your repetitions likely at least three reps away from failure this is because getting to or close to failure ensures your effort is high and the amount of effort you put forth has a close relationship to the number of muscle fibers recruited additionally as you know failure many muscle fibers will increase their activation levels notice how this indicates a wide range of things can build muscle so long as you get to or close to failure a wide range of rep ranges and rep tempos are going to be similarly effective [Music]"

    "transcript": "I recently came across some research exploring if\u00a0\nheavy and light loads produce different regional\u00a0\u00a0 muscle growth. Put differently, could heavy and\u00a0\nlight loads result in different growth on parts\u00a0\u00a0 of a muscle? If true, this may suggest that using\u00a0\nboth heavy and light loads in your training\u00a0\u00a0 could be effective for ensuring you experience\u00a0\nmore balanced muscle growth across a muscle\u00a0\u00a0 or a muscle group. As mentioned in other videos, we\u00a0\nhave two meta-analyses indicating loads between\u00a0\u00a0 30% and 85% of a person's one rep max on\u00a0\nan exercise can produce similar muscle growth,\u00a0\u00a0 provided you perform repetitions to or very\u00a0\nclose to failure. The point at which no more\u00a0\u00a0 repetitions can be performed. Meta-analyses, for\u00a0\nthose unaware, are studies that combine the results\u00a0\u00a0 of numerous individual studies. But in nearly all\u00a0\nof the studies in the mentioned meta-analyses,\u00a0 they measured muscle growth at only one region\u00a0\nof a muscle, preventing us from identifying if any\u00a0\u00a0 regional differences in muscle growth between\u00a0\nheavy and light loads exists. Likewise, we've\u00a0\u00a0 previously explored the research assessing\u00a0\nif alternating rep ranges in your program\u00a0\u00a0 ,so using a variety of loads, could produce greater\u00a0\nmuscle growth than using only one rep range.\u00a0\u00a0 In the short term at least, 12 weeks or less, there\u00a0\nappeared to be no difference between the two. But\u00a0\u00a0 all the research explored in that video assessed\u00a0\nmuscle growth at only one region of a muscle,\u00a0\u00a0 again preventing us from knowing if any regional\u00a0\ndifferences in muscle growth exist between using\u00a0\u00a0 a variety of loads or training with only one load.\u00a0\nSo, could heavy and light loads produce different\u00a0\u00a0 regional muscle growth? The study I came across\u00a0\nwas a 1996 paper by his Hisaeda and colleagues.\u00a0\u00a0 11 untrained women were assigned to a hypertrophy\u00a0\nor strength group. Both groups trained the leg\u00a0\u00a0 extension, 3 times per week for 8 weeks. The\u00a0\nhypertrophy group performed their leg extensions\u00a0\u00a0 with a 2 second concentric phase and a 2 \nsecond eccentric phase. Each session. they performed\u00a0\u00a0 5 to 6 sets of 15 to 20 reps to failure with\u00a0\n90 seconds of rest between sets. The strength group\u00a0\u00a0 performed the concentric and eccentric phases\u00a0\nof the leg extension as fast as possible. Each\u00a0\u00a0 session, they performed 8 to 9 sets of\u00a0\n4 to 5 reps to failure. They rested however\u00a0\u00a0 long they needed between sets. Cross-sectional\u00a0\narea of the rectus femoris, vastus lateralis\u00a0\u00a0 vastus medialis, and vastus intermedius was each\u00a0\nmeasured at 30%, 50%, and 705 of the thigh\u00a0\u00a0 length. For each of those muscle heads, the sum of\u00a0\nthose three regions was used in the analysis. Also,\u00a0\u00a0 the values obtained for each head were added up\u00a0\nto give us total quadriceps cross-sectional area.\u00a0\u00a0 Total quadriceps cross-sectional area increases\u00a0\nwere similar between both groups. However,\u00a0\u00a0 looking at which heads actually grew for each\u00a0\ngroup, the hypertrophy group experienced greater\u00a0\u00a0 growth of the vastus lateralis, while the\u00a0\nstrength group experienced greater growth\u00a0\u00a0 of the vastus intermedius and rectus femoris. As\u00a0\nmentioned, the authors of the study added up the\u00a0\u00a0 cross-sectional area increases for each quadriceps\u00a0\nhead at 30, 50, and 70% of the thigh length\u00a0\u00a0 and used that value for analysis. They did\u00a0\nnot report the data for cross-sectional area\u00a0\u00a0 increases at each of those percentage regions.\u00a0\nThat said, they did state the hypertrophy group\u00a0\u00a0 experienced significant cross-sectional area\u00a0\nincreases at 305 of the thigh length, so the\u00a0\u00a0 upper regions, while the strength group experienced\u00a0\nsignificant increases at 70% of the thigh length\u00a0\u00a0 .so the lower regions. However i don't know whether\u00a0\nthis applies to only one of the quadriceps heads\u00a0\u00a0 or all of them. They unfortunately did not go\u00a0\ninto further details. Nevertheless, this study\u00a0\u00a0 indicates with leg extensions, performing 15 to\u00a0\n20 reps, which of course requires a light load,\u00a0\u00a0 targets the vastus lateralis more than the other\u00a0\nquadriceps heads , while performing 4-5 reps, which\u00a0\u00a0 of course requires a heavy load, targets the\u00a0\nrectus femoris and vastus intermedius more.\u00a0\u00a0 Furthermore, lighter loads may target the\u00a0\nupper regions of some quadriceps heads more,\u00a0\u00a0 while heavier loads may target the lower\u00a0\nregions more. Now, this study is not without\u00a0\u00a0 noteworthy limitations. In addition to performing\u00a0\na different number of reps on the leg extension\u00a0\u00a0 both groups also used a different\u00a0\nnumber of sets, rest interval lengths,\u00a0\u00a0 and repetition tempos. These could have influenced\u00a0\nthe results. The use of different repetition\u00a0\u00a0 tempos is likely a noteworthy consideration. In\u00a0\na previous video, we demonstrated some evidence\u00a0\u00a0 indicates different repetition tempos can produce\u00a0\ndifferent regional muscle growth. Therefore, the\u00a0\u00a0 results could have nothing to do with rep ranges\u00a0\nor loading rather all to do with repetition tempo.\u00a0\u00a0 However, is there any rational reason behind\u00a0\nwhy heavy and light loads may cause different\u00a0\u00a0 regional muscle growth? One such reason relates\u00a0\nto muscle fiber types. Muscles generally consist\u00a0\u00a0 of slow twitch and fast twitch fibers. Slow\u00a0\ntwitch fibers produce low amounts of power\u00a0\u00a0 but are highly fatigue resistant, whereas fast\u00a0\ntwitch fibers produce high amounts of power but\u00a0\u00a0 are less fatigue resistant. These characteristics\u00a0\nbring up an interesting hypothesis. When using\u00a0\u00a0 heavy loads, could the body selectively recruit\u00a0\nmuscle heads or regions that are more fast twitch?\u00a0\u00a0 Conversely, when using light loads, could the body\u00a0\nselectively recruit muscle heads or regions that\u00a0\u00a0 are more slow twitch? Based on a few studies, the\u00a0\nvastus intermedius, but more so the rectus femoris,\u00a0\u00a0 appear to be slightly more fast twitch than slow\u00a0\ntwitch. Could this explain why the strength group\u00a0\u00a0 ,who used heavy loads, experienced greater growth of\u00a0\nthese heads? The vastus lateralis, on the other hand,\u00a0\u00a0 is slightly less fast twitch than these muscles.\u00a0\nBased on numerous studies, it appears to be a near 50/50 split of fast and slow twitch muscle\u00a0\nfibers. Could this explain why the hypertrophy\u00a0\u00a0 group, who use lighter loads, experienced greater\u00a0\ngrowth of this head? Also, remember, the researchers\u00a0\u00a0 broadly stated the hypertrophy group experienced\u00a0\ngreater upper region growth while the strength\u00a0\u00a0 group experienced greater lower region growth. In\u00a0\nmost studies that aim to identify the fiber type\u00a0\u00a0 composition of a muscle. They take a tissue\u00a0\nsample from only one region of that muscle\u00a0\u00a0 and then calculate the number of slow and\u00a0\nfast switch fibers from that single region.\u00a0\u00a0 But there is research indicating that when taking\u00a0\nnumerous samples from many regions of a muscle,\u00a0\u00a0 the fiber type composition varies between them.\u00a0\nThis might help explain why the hypertrophy and\u00a0\u00a0 strength group experienced different growth in\u00a0\nthe upper and lower regions of the quadriceps.\u00a0\u00a0 As an extra note, if this hypothesis was true, it could also apply to repetition tempo. Slower\u00a0\u00a0 repetition tempos may selectively recruit muscle\u00a0\nheads or regions that are more slow twitch, while\u00a0\u00a0 faster repetition tempos may selectively recruit\u00a0\nmuscle regions or heads that are more fast twitch.\u00a0\u00a0 But all of this is only a hypothesis\u00a0\nand it does have problems with it.\u00a0\u00a0 The strength group experienced slightly greater\u00a0\ngrowth of the vastus intermedius than the rectus\u00a0\u00a0 femoris. However, the current research indicates\u00a0\nthe rectus femoris is slightly more fast twitch\u00a0\u00a0 than the vastus intermedius. If this fiber type\u00a0\nhypothesis was true, we would expect the rectus\u00a0\u00a0 femoris to have grown more than the vastus\u00a0\nintermedius. But this wasn't the case. Furthermore,\u00a0\u00a0 the hypertrophy group experienced the greatest\u00a0\ngrowth of the vastus lateralis. However, the current\u00a0\u00a0 evidence indicates the vastus medialis is more\u00a0\nslow twitch than the vastus lateralis. If this\u00a0\u00a0 fiber-type hypothesis was true, we would expect\u00a0\nthe vastus medialis to have grown more than the\u00a0\u00a0 vastus lateralis, but this wasn't the case. Moving\u00a0\non, as far as i'm aware, the study by Hisaeda and\u00a0\u00a0 colleagues is the only paper to have explored\u00a0\ndifferences in regional muscle growth between\u00a0\u00a0 heavy and light load traditional training. Now, I\nsay traditional training for a reason. In this case,\u00a0\u00a0 traditional training refers to performing\u00a0\nexercises that involve both a concentric\u00a0\u00a0 and eccentric phase. Many common exercises, such\u00a0\nas squat,  bench presses, and leg extensions\u00a0\u00a0 fit into this criteria. However, there is a study\u00a0\nexploring how heavy and light isometric trading\u00a0\u00a0 impacts regional muscle growth.12 untrained\u00a0\nmen were assigned to a 100% or a 60\u00a0\u00a0 % group. Both groups performed an isometric\u00a0\ncontraction for their triceps at 90 degrees of\u00a0\u00a0 elbow flexion with a dynamometer 3 times per\u00a0\nweek for 10 weeks. The 100% group contracted their\u00a0\u00a0 triceps to 100% of their force producing\u00a0\nabilities for 12 sets of 6 seconds each session.\u00a0\u00a0 The 60 group contracted their triceps at 60% of\u00a0\ntheir force producing abilities for 4 sets of 30\u00a0\u00a0 seconds each session. Triceps cross-sectional\u00a0\narea was measured at 20 regions across the\u00a0\u00a0 length of the muscle. Increases at all regions were\u00a0\nsimilar between both groups. The graph combines the\u00a0\u00a0 data for both groups and displays the average\u00a0\nincrease at all 20 regions across the triceps.\u00a0\u00a0 So this study indicates heavy and light loads\u00a0\ndo not produce different regional muscle growth.\u00a0\u00a0 But there are some important considerations with\u00a0\nthis study. Firstly, isometric contractions were\u00a0\u00a0 used. If both groups performed dynamic exercises\u00a0\nthat involved concentric and eccentric phases,\u00a0\u00a0 we don't know how this would impact the results.\u00a0\nAlso, although the researchers looked at numerous\u00a0\u00a0 regions across the length of the triceps, they\u00a0\ndid not distinguish between the triceps heads.\u00a0\u00a0 We don't know if long, medial, and lateral head\u00a0\ngrowth differed between the two groups. To\u00a0\u00a0 summarize, the Hisaeda and colleague study provides\u00a0\nus with some evidence that heavy and light loads\u00a0\u00a0 may produce different regional muscle growth.\u00a0\nHowever, the study with isometric contractions does\u00a0\u00a0 provide us with some degree of opposing evidence.\u00a0\nThere is an interesting hypothesis, relating to\u00a0\u00a0 fiber type composition, behind why heavy and light\u00a0\nloads may produce different regional muscle growth.\u00a0\u00a0 But as established, there are limitations to\u00a0\nthis hypothesis. At the end of the day, a lot\u00a0\u00a0 more research is needed in this area. Although, as\u00a0\nestablished in our alternating rep range video,\u00a0\u00a0 in the short term, 12 weeks or less, using a variety\u00a0\nof rep ranges, meaning you combine heavy, moderate,\u00a0\u00a0 and light loads in your trading program, appears\u00a0\nto produce similar muscle growth to using only\u00a0\u00a0 one rep range. In the long term though, there is a\u00a0\npossibility using a variety of loads is superior.\u00a0\u00a0 And as demonstrated in this video, there is\u00a0\na possibility that heavy and light loads\u00a0\u00a0 produce different regional growth. Meaning\u00a0\nusing a variety of loads would be effective\u00a0\u00a0 for ensuring you experience more balanced muscle\u00a0\ngrowth across a muscle or muscle group. Therefore.\u00a0\u00a0 using a variety of loads in your training program\u00a0\ncould be a sensible idea. If for some reason you\u00a0\u00a0 do not like the idea of using a variety of\u00a0\nloads, there still are other ways to ensure\u00a0\u00a0 more balanced muscle growth across a muscle\u00a0\nor muscle group. As covered in another video,\u00a0\u00a0 using different repetition tempos could be one way.\u00a0\nAnother more obvious way is to perform a variety\u00a0\u00a0 of exercises for a muscle group. We'll be exploring\u00a0\nthis concept in more detail with future videos."

    "title": "How to Change Muscle Activation With Any Compound Exercise (Maybe)",
    "published_at": "2022-01-20T11:59:59Z",
    "transcript": "in an isolation exercise more or less all the load is distributed to the isolated muscle group such as the triceps in a skull crusher compound exercises contrastingly are more complex as two or more muscle groups are actively involved in a barbell bench press the nervous system of one individual may distribute 40 percent of the total load to the pectoralis major 40 percent to the triceps and 20 percent to the anterior deltoid of course this is oversimplified for illustrative purposes in reality bones tendons synergistic and stabilization muscles also bear the load to varying degrees throughout an exercise nevertheless is it possible for an individual to change how their nervous system recruits the muscle groups involved in a compound exercise using our oversimplified example could the person alter their barbell bench press recruitment patterns for example such that the anterior deltoid now handles 40 percent of the load the pectoralis major 20 and the triceps 40 percent a fascinating study by stransker and colleagues gives us potential insight i will use the author's terms and interpretations to describe the study however there are notable limitations and considerations with this study so for those interested please watch until the end to understand what i feel to be the best interpretation of the current evidence 27 men with an average barbell bench press of 105.2 kilograms were recruited all subjects could bench at least 120 percent of their respective body weights during two 4 second maximal isometric barbell bench press contractions performed with their elbows flexed to 90 degrees and the upper arm perpendicular to the floor and three reps with an eighty five percent one rep max load on the barbell bench press surface emg which stands for electromyography recorded muscle activation from the pectoralis major anterior deltoid and triceps for each subject the researchers noted out of the pectoralis major triceps and anterior deltoid which one displayed the lowest relative activation on the bench press tests resultantly three groups were formed those with the lowest relative anterior deltoid activation the anterior deltoid group those with the lowest relative pectoralis major activation the pectoralis major group and those with the lowest relative triceps activation the triceps group then subjects went on to perform targeted isolation training for their respective lowest activation muscle performing three exercises per session each for four sets of 10 to 15 repetitions to failure three times per week for six weeks the anterior deltoid group trains the upright row lateral raise and front raise the pectoralis major group trained dumbbell flies machine flies and cable chest flies the triceps group train barbell skull crushers cable overhead extensions and incline skull crushers note all three groups also perform three sets with a four rep max load on the barbell bench press each week to ensure strength did not attenuate after the six training weeks all three groups similarly increased bench press warner at max strength relevant to our discussion all three groups re-measured their activation levels during the isometric and eighty-five percent or one-rep max bench press tests to keep things condensed i'll just present the results of the surface emg recordings from the three reps on the eighty-five percent or warner mx bench press focusing on the anterior deltoid group first compared to before the study they saw a significant increase in anterior deltoid relative activation with a concurrent significant decrease in pectoralis major and triceps relative activation the pectoralis major group compared to before the study saw a significant increase in relative pectoralis major activation with a significant decrease in triceps and anterior deltoid relative activation finally the triceps group compared to before the study saw a significant increase in relative triceps activation with a significant decrease in pectoralis major relative activation and a non-significant change in anterior deltoid relative activation stated another way this study indicates performing exclusive targeted isolation training for a certain muscle group ultimately increases its relative activation during a compound exercise with a corresponding decrease or negligible change in the other involves muscle groups however as alluded to limitations and problems exist notice i've implied surface emg measures and muscles activation this is not actually accurate instead surface emg approximately measures neuromuscular excitation which is when neurons transmit electrical signals to the muscle fibers it innervates muscle activation actually refers to when the contractile units are prepared to generate force for those with some muscle physiology knowledge it's when calcium binds to troponin to enable subsequent cross-bridge cycling the problem here is intermediate steps between neuromuscular excitation and muscle activation exist such that it's not sensible to consider them in complete unison so surface emg approximates neuromuscular excitation however notice i've said approximates i say this because research has found when actual neuromuscular excitation is kept constant manipulating the length of a muscle or joint angle produces different surface emg recordings in other words surface emg still does not truly record a neuromuscular excitation the second problem is how the researchers measured and interpreted their surface emg recordings when presenting the results earlier notice how the recordings of each muscle are expressed as a percentage of a maximum isometric contraction the researchers calculate this by first recording the surface emg response to holding a maximum isometric attraction for each respective muscle group these respective values are then used to normalize the surface emg response recorded during the 85 or one rep max barbell bench press let's use an example with the triceps to make this crystal clear imagine during the shown maximal isometric triceps contraction 100 units were recorded from the triceps by surface emg during an eighty-five percent water at max barbell bench press we recorded 85 units from the triceps as a result we say the triceps produced 85 of its maximum isometric contraction the problem here is we're basing the triceps relative contribution to an exercise on a random isometric contraction it's entirely possible if a different triceps isometric contraction was used to normalize our values we would obtain a vastly different relative activation level for instance if a different triceps isometric contraction generates 150 units from the triceps our 85 units measured from the triceps during the barbell bench press would have only equated to a 57 maximum isometric contraction based on all of this information you would see it's not really sensible to compare maximum isometric contraction values between muscles just because in a certain exercise one muscle generates a higher percentage of a maximum isometric contraction compared to the percentage of maximum isometric contraction achieved by another muscle we cannot definitively say that muscle is truly activated or involves more simply because those percentages are based on arbitrary isometric contractions the thing is the researchers did this for example we know those in the anterior deltoid group were the subjects that before the study experienced a lower percentage of the maximum isometric contraction of their anterior deltoid compared to the percentages of maximum isometric contractions of the pectoralis major or triceps during the bench press tests the researchers interpreted this as saying that anterior deltoid was the lowest relative activated muscle for these subjects but the fact is based on what we've described the equipment and methods used were simply not adequate to truly say this despite these notable limitations and problems i still think this data holds value for two reasons firstly the consistency of the findings is noteworthy after performing targeted isolation training for a muscle that muscle saw increased emg recordings during the bench press the anterior deltoid group saw elevated anterior deltoid emg recordings the triceps groups were elevated triceps emg recordings and the pectoralis major group saw elevated pectoralis major emg recordings secondly surface emg recordings were compared within the same individual that performed the same exercise with the electrodes placed at roughly the same spot this does likely attenuate potential limitations with muscle length joint angle and electrode positionings combining these two reasons and i think this study by schronske and colleagues potentially does suggest if an individual performs targeted isolation training for a muscle its recruitment may be increased during a compound exercise yet several questions remain as some examples the subjects performed quite high volume targeted isolation training they executed 36 weekly sets for their targeted muscle could the same results be achieved with the lower weekly set numbers we also know the subjects performed exclusive targeted isolation training for their specific muscle while ceasing training of all other muscle groups could the same results be obtained by continuing to train all your muscle groups by increasing the volume with a muscle you want to recruit more during a compound exercise and decreasing volume on the muscle or muscles you wish to remain similarly or less activated during that compound exercise ultimately higher quality data is unquestionably required to fully uncover the precise details and nuances thank you for watching as always i hope you found the video interesting and informative in some way"

    "title": "Cardio Can INCREASE Your Muscle Growth (Here&#39;s How)",
    "published_at": "2023-01-30T12:00:09Z",
    "transcript": "previously at the house of hypertrophy we saw the interference effect the idea cardio kills gains is not as big as people think updated analyzes failed to find combining cardio with resistance training impairs muscle and strength gains in this video however we're going to assess a thought that's probably rarely crossed most people's minds could cardio benefit long-term muscle hypertrophy the scientific literature indicates in certain cases it could [Music] a recent study from Canada recruited 14 untrained individuals one leg cycled with these variables for three times per week for six weeks the other leg in these six weeks did nothing then in the next 10 weeks both legs were trained bilaterally with squats leg presses leg extensions hamstring curls and car phrases using these variables by the end of these 10 weeks it was found slow and fast Stitch fiber growth tended to be superior for their leg that cycle for for six weeks beforehand versus the leg that didn't do anything in these first six weeks therefore cycling for six weeks before a 10-week resistance training period increased their muscle hypertrophy produced why the six weeks of cycling produce significant increases in capillary density and the researchers found a correlation between these capillary density increases and the subsequent slow and fast Rich fiber hypertrophy furthermore when the researchers examine the high responding and low responding legs the highest responding legs had greater capillary density versus the low responding legs capillaries are tiny blood vessels that deliver oxygen nutrients hormones and other things to muscle fibers and this study suggests capillaries may be quite important for muscle hypertrophy something a lot of people are probably unaware of now like all studies this study has limitations the subjects were previously untrained and had an average BMI falling into overweight range furthermore biopsies were used to assess fiber hypertrophy and as noted in previous videos these have limitations and are far from a perfect and clean measurement but even with these limitations in mind I wouldn't be so quick to dismiss this study because other supporting data exists [Music] the implication of the study is aerobic training benefits muscle hypertrophy by increasing capillary density indeed other studies support the link between capillary density and hypertrophy data on younger individuals links capillarization to satellite Cell Activation and expansion events are likely associated with recovery from training and sustaining long-term muscle hypertrophy a 2017 Canadian study in older men found those with lower capillary densities or lower far switch fiber hypertrophy compared to those with higher capillarization another 2019 USA study found similar things in older individuals those with lower capillary densities or lower fiber hypertrophy compared to those with higher capillarization as noted capillaries are tiny blood vessels that deliver oxygen nutrients hormones and other things to muscle fibers it's logical that increasing capillary density benefits recovery and supports the process of growing muscle fibers link to this Greg Knuckles from Stronger by science provides a nice potential explanation as muscle fibers grow all the stuff inside the muscle fibers get further away on average to avoid an intracellular energy crisis it makes sense that fibers either need to stop growing or experience an increase in capillary density to allow for further growth it's also worth recognizing lifting weights is quite aerobically demanding despite what it may seem for example a 200 meter sprint something considered very anaerobic still involves a 29 contribution from the aerobic system recovery between sets performance on later sets in a session and Recovery between sessions are going to be relying on the Aerobic System to a large degree so increased capillary density May benefit all these things besides capillaries other endurance gains may also be useful for muscle hypertrophy mitochondria are organelles involved in generating energy for various biochemical and physiological processes fascinating a 2018 study from the USA found those who experienced the best hypertri responses tended to have greater mitochondrial volume versus low high virtual responders the researchers speculated this may be because creating the proteins that make muscles larger is an energetically costly process and mitochondria can Aid this process furthermore in vitro Studies have Associated mitochondrial volume and function to cell growth also mitochondria will play a role in recovery between sets performance on later sets in a session and Recovery between sessions it's important to mention I'm not saying maximizing endurance adaptations is needed just enhancing them to a degree may be beneficial for long-term hypertrophy [Music] in the initial study the aerobic training performed in the first six weeks was far from Intense or demanding I'm wondering if just performing this concurrently with resistance training still provides benefit indeed although the overall literature finds no compromised hypertrophy when performing cardio and resistance training concurrently there have been some studies finding better hypertrophy with concurrent cardio and resistance training some of these studies also find that slow twitch fiber hypertrophy is enhanced when performing cardio and resistance training concurrently so this might also be a specific benefit of additional cardio training it makes selectively enhanced slow twitch fiber hypertrophy these fibers are typically harder to grow versus Fast switch fibers therefore ignoring extreme circumstances you're very highly trained to all your performing extreme amounts of volume I think it's very possible some individuals may Express enhanced hypertrophy with concurrent cardio and resistance training as an alternate to this you could aim to do something similar to the initial study alternate between periods of aerobic training and resistance training many Fair weeks of no resistance training will completely reverse all your gains and make all your previous resistance training a waste this simply isn't true this 2013 Japanese study had one group trained for 24 weeks straight while another group trained for six weeks and arrested for three weeks across the full 24 weeks after the 24th week chest triceps and bench press strength gains were similar between both groups we can see that although the group lost strength and size during their three week breaks their games were quick to rebound upon resuming training imagine during these three weeks off they performed cardio could this have benefited hypertrophy furthermore as explored in a previous video there are potential mechanisms by which resistance training breaks could reset various anabolic Pathways potentially benefiting long-term hypertrophy too a third option as detailed by Greg Knuckles is alternating between periods of concurrent training and periods where you only perform resistance training if you're highly trained and or performing very high resistance training volumes it's fine if your rate of gains is slower in the concurrent training period your gains showing the resistance training only period might be enhanced thanks to the endurance gains from concurrent training finally the data assess throughout this video may also allude to the beneficial effects of higher reps higher reps can certainly be great for building muscle and higher reps better promote overall endurance adaptations it might be speculated that in the long term including higher reps in your training could be beneficial for hypertrophy thanks to the endurance gains more data is needed to verify this moreover if you're performing cardio remember the local endurance games are specific to the muscles involved so unless a person performs a variety of cardio that covers their upper and lower body the muscle groups not trained with cardio May benefit it from higher reps in certain cases various lines of scientific evidence suggest cardio May benefit muscle hypertrophy it appears an increase in capillary density mitochondrial volume and a potentially selective hypertrophy of flow twitch fibers are candidates linking cardio to better overall hypertrophy furthermore Insurance adaptations May enhance recovery between sets performance on later sets in a session and Recovery between sessions I rarely accept sponsors at the house of

    "title": "Does the 3/7 Method Build More Muscle?",
    "published_at": "2021-09-15T11:29:47Z",
    "transcript": "When training to build strength or muscle,\nmost people use a sets and reps structure. For instance, you may perform 3 sets of 6\nreps on the bench press in a session. However, something called the 3/7 method seems\nto be gaining some degree of popularity in recent years. This method appears to have originated from\na 2005 French Fitness book. The 3/7 method has you select a 70% one-rep\nmax load (which equates to a load you can generally perform a maximum of 12 repetitions\nwith). With this 70% one-rep max load, you perform\n3 reps, rest for 15 seconds, perform 4 reps, rest for 15 seconds, perform 5 reps, rest\nfor 15 seconds, perform 6 reps, rest for 15 seconds, and then perform a final 7 reps. Generally, the first 3 and 4 rep sets are\nquite easy. But, the 5, 6 and 7 rep sets are pretty much\nnear or to failure. Could doing this be superior for muscle or\nstrength gain? Let us examine the evidence. A study by Stragier et al. had 43 previously\nuntrained men train a machine biceps exercise twice per week for 8 weeks. A normal group, each session, performed the\nexercise with 8 sets of 6 repetitions with a 70% one-rep max load, using 2.5 minutes\nof rest between sets. A 3/7 group, each session, with a 70% one-rep\nmax load, performed the 3/7 method for 2 bouts, separated by 2.5 minutes of rest between bouts. Just to emphasize this, they repeated the\n3/7 method twice in a session, with a 2.5-minute rest interval between them. For both groups, if a subject was unable to\ncomplete their respective prescribed protocol, assistance was provided. On the other hand, if a subject could complete\ntheir respective prescribed protocol for two sessions in a row, they increased the load\nthey used by 2.5-5%. After the 8 weeks of training, increases in\none-rep max on the machine biceps exercise were greater for the 3/7 group. Furthermore, increases in biceps long head\nthickness (which was averaged out from an upper, middle, and lower region) were also\ngreater for the 3/7 group. Before exploring these hypertrophy results\nfurther, I think it's first worth looking at the strength results a little further. Despite the study finding greater increases\nin one-rep max with the 3/7 method, the results do not necessarily suggest the 3/7 method\nis optimal for strength gains. Remember, 2 bouts of the 3/7 method were compared\nto 8 sets of 6 reps with a 70% one-rep max load. For maximizing your one-rep max on an exercise,\ntraining with heavier loads is likely better. For example, Schoenfeld et al. found training\nsets on the bench press and back squat with 2-4 reps with a roughly 90% one-rep max load\nproduced greater one-rep max gains on the bench press and back squat compared to training\nthem with 8-12 reps with a roughly 75% one-rep max load. Therefore, if the 3/7 method was compared\nto training with 90%+ one-rep max loads, I think it's highly likely the 3/7 method would\nbe inferior. Let us now dive into the hypertrophy results. As we noted, the 3/7 group experienced more\ngains than the normal group. However, some of you may be questioning the\nnormal group's training program. 8 sets of 6 repetitions with a 70% one-rep\nmax load sounds a little odd and doesn't really sound like something you would do to build\nmuscle. Perhaps if the 3/7 method was compared to\na more traditional hypertrophy protocol, say 3 to 5 sets of 8-12 repetitions performed\nto or near failure, the results would not have been so favorable for the 3/7 group. This was actually my initial thought when\nI first read the study. However, upon closer analysis, 8 sets of 6\nreps with a 70% one-rep max load is probably quite effective for building muscle, meaning\nthis may not be a problem. Firstly, a 70% one-rep max load is perfectly\nfine for building muscle, as we've explored in previous rep range videos. With a 70% one-rep max load, you can generally\nperform around a maximum of 12 repetitions to failure. The normal group only performed 6 reps per\nset, meaning their 1st set would have been roughly 6 reps away from failure. Now, due to the effects of cumulative fatigue,\nthe following sets would have been closer to failure. Let us assume that each successive set puts\na subject 1 rep closer to failure than the previous set. Of course, this is far from perfect. But for our purposes, it will work. When broken down in this way, it's hard to\ncall this protocol meaningfully suboptimal for building muscle. The reason I say this is because training\nto failure does not appear to be neccessary for hypertrophy. A fair few papers demonstrate that training\n3 to 1 rep away from failure per set is as effective for hypertrophy to training to failure. Out of the 8 sets for the normal group, 5\nsets would likely have been within 3 reps from failure. Furthermore, as we'll explore in future videos,\nthere actually is some evidence training 5 reps away from failure could also be as effective\nas training to failure for hypertrophy. So, perhaps even more of the normal group's\nsets could be classified as optimal for building muscle. On the basis of all of this, I think this\nstudy probably did find the 3/7 method to truly have some sort of enhanced benefit for\nmuscle hypertrophy. Why could this be? Could there be something special amount incrementally\nperforming more reps with a given load while using short rest durations. The authors of the study speculated the 3/7\nmethod superiority could be explained by it producing more metabolic stress. Metabolic stress is the build-up of metabolites\n(which are products of cellular processes) such as lactate within muscles. However, I'm skeptical of this simply because\nthe role of metabolic stress in muscle growth is far from clear. There are numerous cases in which more metabolic\nstress does not result in more muscle hypertrophy. All in all, I don't know if there are any\nlegitimate reasons as to why the 3/7 method could build more muscle. Moving on, it's essential to recognize this\nis only a single study. There are no other studies, as far as I'm\naware, exploring the effects of the 3/7 method on muscle hypertrophy. A single study is nothing near definitive\nand conclusive evidence. Because of this, we simply cannot be anywhere\nclose to certain that the 3/7 method truly builds more muscle. Furthermore, the study was conducted on previously\nuntrained individuals and so we do not know if this study can be replicated in trained\nindividuals. The closest thing I can think of to the 3/7\nmethod is rest-pause training. Rest-pause training involves performing reps\nto failure with a given load, then resting for 15 to 20 seconds, and performing further\nrepetitions to failure with that same load. This can be repeated however many times you\nwish. Of course, the similarity to the 3/7 method\nlies in the short rest between repetition bouts. Could the rest-pause training research provide\ngreater insight into the potential hypertrophic effects of the 3/7 method? By my count, there are only two studies that\nhave technically explored rest-pause training. Enes et al. had 19 men with at least 2 years\nof training experience perform the back squat, leg press, and leg extension, twice per week\nfor 8 weeks. A normal group trained each exercise per session\nwith 4 sets of 12 repetitions with a 70% one-rep max load, using 2 minutes of rest between\nsets. A rest-pause group performed 10 repetitions\nwith a 75% one-rep max load, rested 20 seconds, and then performed 6 further repetitions with\nthe same load. For each exercise, they performed 3 of these\nrest-pause sets, with 120 seconds of rest between sets. At the fifth week of training, both groups\nincreased their training loads by 5%. By the end of the study, increases in lateral\nthigh thickness (which includes the vastus lateralis and vastus intermedius), at 30%,\n50%, and 70% of the thigh bone length were statistically similar between both groups,\nsuggesting rest-pause provides no muscle growth benefit. Having said this, the rest-pause group did\nnot take their repetitions to failure, and only one extra bout of repetitions was performed\nper set, so this is potentially a limitation. Another study by Prestes et al. has 18 individuals\nwith at least 1 year of training experience perform a range of exercises four times per\nweek for 6 weeks. A normal group performed each exercise per\nsession with 3 sets of 6 reps with an 80% one-rep max load, using 2-3 minutes of rest\nbetween sets. A rest-pause group, for each exercise per\nsession, performed reps to failure with an 80% one-rep max load, and then rested 20 seconds\nbefore performing further reps to failure. They did until they reached a total of 18\nreps. After the 6 training weeks, increases in chest\nand arm thickness were similar between both groups, but increases in quadriceps thickness\nwere greater for the rest-pause group. So the results of this study partially suggest\nrest-pause training can enhance muscle hypertrophy. However, there is a limitation. It seems the normal group did not apply progressive\noverload. Recall they were performing 3 sets of 6 reps\nwith an 80% one-rep max load. In the early stages of the study, this likely\nwould have meant subjects were roughly 3 to 1 reps away from failure per set, which we\nknow is fine for muscle hypertrophy. However, as they get stronger from these initial\ntraining sessions, this 80% one-rep max load would no longer have actually been their true\n80% one-rep max, rather less. Given no progressive overload was applied,\nmeaning they did not readjust their 80% one-rep max load, they were probably training with\nmore than 3 reps away from failure per set as the study progressed. On the other hand, given the rest-pause group\nwas performing all their repetitions to failure, progressive overload would naturally have\nbeen applied. Due to this limitation, this study should\nbe considered with caution. So all in all, the rest-pause research seems\ntoo limited and insufficient to provide us with any further clues on the 3/7 method. To conclude the video, a single study does\nseem to suggest the 3/7 method can build more muscle. However, given it is only a single study,\nwe cannot be certain the 3/7 method truly builds more muscle, hopefully future research\ncan provide us with more clarity. Ultimately, there probably is no terrible\ndownside to experimenting with the 3/7 method if that's something you'd think you like to\ndo. One thing I've yet to mention is the 3/7 method\ncan be considered quite time-efficient. By my calculations, in the stragier et al.\nstudy, excluding the warm-up, the 3/7 group would have been training for 5-6 minutes per\nsession, while the normal group would have been training for 19-20 minutes each session."

    "transcript": "welcome to the house of hypertrophy what is the biggest training mistake you can make in the words of Mike mener in fact going from one set to two sets is the biggest mistake you could possibly make it's not just a mistake it's the biggest mistake possible you just doubled the exercise and therefore you doubled the inroad into recovery ability with these men Clips you often get some intriguing comments such as this as humans we are designed to empty the tank through one set one Sprint one hunt one fight after Jones who's often credited for popularizing hit training has said how many sets of the exercise one additional sets usually serve no purpose and may produce a state of overtraining with some subjects an intriguing comment left on this channel States one set to failure dummies other than that you're overtraining these are certainly some interesting and controversial comments but I thought this would be a good opportunity to overview the scientific literature on overtraining fatigue and set numbers in a way that we haven't really done previously at the house of HP hopy let's dive [Music] in the talk of fatigue and overtraining is interesting so let us start there does the fatigue from a higher number of sets spiral you into overtraining there are different ways you may Define overtraining but this 2013 consensus provides us with this definition a decrease in performance with or without symptoms lasting months or longer with no following performance gains there are dreams on either side with some believing overtraining is a myth and others as we've just seen thinking overtraining occurs from anything more than lower volumes of training considering nonfunctional overreaching which is defined as a performance decrease lasting weeks or months with no following performance gains is also worthwhile both of these can occur from resistance training but getting there seems to be incredibly difficult illustrating this this analysis examined 22 studies that deliberately tried to induce over training or overreaching from resistance training and 10 studies fail to find any meaningful fatigue that would be classed as overtraining or non-functional overreaching thus even in studies purposefully constructed to produce overtraining or overreaching it doesn't always happen for instance this paper employed this training program involving largely training the full body 5 days a week with just 24 hours of rest between sessions plus maximum strength tests on Friday bench press and squat strength performance did decrease in the second week but they rebounded and performance actually improved over time so neither overtraining nor nonfunctional overreaching occurred rather performance improved This research demonstrates that the notion that you're going to overtrain from performing more than one set is to put it bluntly ludicrous to be fair I'm not sure if Jones or the commenter considered overtraining as the definition we provided but even still although more sets will generate more fatigue this certainly does not mean your body can't handle adapt and still grow from it multiple areas of the literature lead me to conclude this this paper had trained folks perform a sixcess all to actual momentary failure on the barbell bench press yet a marker of neuromuscular fatigue was virtually fully recovered 48 hours after training to be fair this is just one fatigue marker in one paper but importantly as you continue to accustom yourself to a training program across weeks your body produces a range of adaptations that only further enhance your recovery capabilities demonstrating this these researchers had subjects perform five sets of 15 maximal eccentric contractions the fatigue of Maximum eccentric contraction should not be underestimated after the first session subject saw substantial soreness damage and fatigue for at least 5 days after but as subjects kept training across 10 weeks recovery improved by the 10th week subjects were seeing virtually no soreness or damage and they virtually fully recovered their strength 24 hours after the session and don't forget this was with five sets of maximal eccentric work the literature on how many times per week you should train a muscle ties in here on average when the total number of sets you perform each week for a muscle is kept the same the number of times per week you train that muscle doesn't matter too much for hypertrophy this means that higher frequency training where you're training a muscle 24 hours apart regularly is a viable option on the table as an example ex Le this study had trained subjects train the squats and bench press each with 12 sets in a week a three times group spread this volume across three sessions a week while a six times group spread this volume across six sessions per week this meant the six times group was performing two sets per session and just resting 24 hours between sessions despite this fat free Mass gains and strength gains were comparable between both groups in fact the fat free Mass gain somewhat lean towards the six times group interestingly there are are some limited cases of higher frequency training being Superior to lower frequencies such as this paper which had trained folks perform 15 weekly search for each muscle a low frequency group trained each muscle once or twice per week while a high frequency group trained each muscle across 5 days a week this means they would have regularly just had 24 hours to recover between sessions and multiple sets per muscle were performed each session back squat strength gains were greater for the higher frequency while other strength gains were similar muscle growth was overall better with a higher frequency this does not mean higher frequency training is undeniably the best or that you have to train this way even if you don't want to because as deciphered in other videos the overall entirety of the evidence suggests you certainly can make great gains by training a muscle once twice or three times per week individual differences can also exist due to multiple factors some people may fail to handle high frequency training nevertheless the main point I'm trying to show here is that if the fatigue from multiple sets was problematic higher frequency training should never ever be an option but we see it [Music] is what about the main thing muscle hypertrophy I'm actually going to start with this paper that I've never detailed before at the house of hypertrophy 70 previously untrained individuals train their quads with these exercises for three sets each three times a week for 16 weeks this actually totals to 27 weekly sets performed for the quads which is quite a lot but both the younger and older individuals grew well in these 16 weeks after this the subjects were divided into one of three groups for the next 32 weeks a d tring group stopped training altogether and as you can imagine they lost their gains a 1/3 group continued to train but cut their volume down by 1/3 by still training each exercise for three sets but just once a week A 1 nth group also continued to train but cut their volume down by 1 nth by training each exercise for one set once per week quite interestingly the older adults in both groups didn't make further gains they actually lost some size as for the younger adults the 1/3 condition did lead to some gains but with the 1 nth group they largely just maintain their muscle size if higher sets were problematic and if lower sets were unfailingly the best for hypertrophy in all circumstances these results should not have occurred on the flip side we have research suggesting you grow just fine if not maybe be even better when you perform more sets than usual for example this paper had trained individuals perform the unilateral leg extension and leg press with one leg all subjects perform 22 weekly sets for the quads with their other leg all subjects perform 20% more weekly sets than what they'd been performing before the study vastus lateralis hypertrophy was better with a leg that performed 20% more sets than usual another study had subjects train their lower body with a range of set numbers and found on average the subjects that experienced the best gains had increased their sets by the most compared to what they'd usually perform before the study more studies are definitely required to understand if when and how much you should increase set numbers across your training career but this research at least further demonstrates how more sets aren't inherently detrimental all this research involved changing set numbers but what about data just comparing higher to lower sets we have this paper with trained folks performing leg extensions with either one or three sets my f protein synthesis which is the creation of the proteins that make your muscles bigger was greater and longer lasting for the three sets now protein synthesis data can be clouded by muscle damage but as these subjects were trained and merely performed the leg extension I don't anticipate muscle damage being a major confounder nevertheless we of course have research actually measuring hypertrophy you can indeed find some papers failing to find the significant difference in muscle hypertrophy between training with either one or three sets per exercise but it is equally true that other papers find three sets per exercise built more muscle than one set importantly when we statistically combine all the individual papers into a meta analysis multiple sets overall result in Greater hypertrophy more precisely performing a total of nine or more weekly sets per muscle group produced greater hypoy than performing fewer than nine weekly sets per muscle a lot of this data was from untrained individuals when analyzing the data on trained individuals the most well-designed data tends to indicate that 12 to 18 weekly sets for a muscle group produced better gains than fewer sets this is an average and some individuals and muscles could see better games with fewer or more sets fascinatingly we had this recent study that found progressing up to an incredibly High 42 to 52 weekly sets for the quads led to Greater quad hypertrophy than performing 22 weekly sets now there are nuances and considerations to this paper which we've more thoroughly outlined in a previous video but it nonetheless demonstrates how anything more than lower set isn't detrimental it is worth noting in all the studies outlined here the instructions and rep number data provided in the papers indicates they were training two or very close to failure on the sets which is perfectly fine since as detailed in another video stopping three to two reps from failure is likely comparably effective to training to failure if you're searching for further guidance about training our highquality partner the alpha progression app can help you create track and

    "title": "Bodyweight Training is BAD for Muscle Growth (True or False)",
    "published_at": "2022-10-24T11:00:05Z",
    "transcript": "dude what are you doing you know body weight training sucks for building muscle you think I built this Mass through bodyweight training huh believe me I know you didn't build that mass through body weight training hey what's that supposed to mean [Music] welcome to the house of hypertrophy how effective is calisthenics that's body weight training for muscle hypertrophy can someone theoretically maximize hypertrophy using nothing more than their body weight let's have a look at what the scientific literature suggests [Music] it's widely believed that 6 to 12 rep range is superior for building muscle and given body weight training is commonly done with higher reps this may be used as evidence bodyweight training is sub-optimal for muscle hypertrophy yet this science doesn't support this a multitude of paper suggests per set reps between 6 and 35 are comparably effective for building muscle provided those reps are performed to or close to failure a strong hypothesis as to why lower and higher reps can be similar for hypertrophy is that they ultimately produce similar mechanical tension the primary hypertrophy stimuli mechanical tension is essentially the force experienced by muscle fibers they have mechanical senses that can detect the force and convert it into a signaling Cascade that produces hypertrophy to optimize overall mechanical tension we'd want to recruit as many muscle fibers as possible and have the individual fibers produce decent tension for a sufficient duration lower reps with heavier loads will instantly involve higher mechanical tension and it only increases as you near failure higher reps initially involve low mechanical tension but as you continue repping out a nearing failure more muscle fibers are recruited and many fibers may increase their Force contribution so overall mechanical tension ends up being similar between lower and higher reps it's also worth noting mechanical tension is mechanical tension your body has no sensors to detect whether free weights machines or body weight is used to generate fiber tension it's not like just because you're using a body weight exercise your fibers refuse to grow it's also worth noting other hypothesized stimuli like metabolic stress or micro tears simply do not have compelling evidence they are powerful drivers of hypertrophy we have two videos deciphering the science on this thus so long as your training bodywear exercises to or close to failure in the 6 to 35 rep range hypertrophy will effectively be stimulated we have further data supporting this a 2017 Japanese paper compared High rep bench press training to higher rep push-up training and chest and triceps growth ended up being similar between both a 2018 USA paper compared Progressive push-up training with harder variations with lower reps to lower rep bench press training and both groups saw chest growth the percentage is actually favored push-up training but the difference was not statistically significant so the difference could just be due to chance so body weight exercises can be effective for hypertrophy but does this mean in the long term body weight training as a whole is effective for hypertrophy there are some potential pitfalls of body weight training long term [Music] the most straightforward way to Progressive overload bodyweight movements is to perform more repetitions and so long as you stay within the 6-35 rep range this is perfectly fine for hypertrophy as shown in a previous video the current data indicates progressing through increasing reps is no less effective for muscle growth than increasing load now it is also technically possible to increase load with bodyweight exercises through using harder variations that have you work against the greater percentage of your body weight this can be done through manipulating body position or progressing to single limbed variations the current Research indicates a wide range of rep tempos are comparable for inducing muscle growth so attempting to slow down your repetitions or even add pauses can likely also be effective ways to Progressive overload bodyweight movements finally although strictly not body weight using added weight is also an option weighted calisthenics can absolutely be great for long-term progression this 2019 Norway study found that when load equating weighted push-ups and bench presses recruitment of the chest triceps and shoulders were similar between them so summarizing this section it is certainly possible to overload bodywear exercises well in the long term through an array of different methods so I don't believe this is a pitfall of calisthenics foreign literature indicates muscles do not grow evenly across their regions in response to training and exercise the implication is training with a few biomechanically different exercises per muscle will likely better optimize its overall regional growth thus some may feel calisthenics may be limited in this area as they feel there's not much exercise variety available yet this is not truly the case with the upper body at least you likely want to train the biceps at different shoulder angles but this can be done with body weight variations training the triceps at different shoulder angles is probably a good idea too and this again can be done with body weight variations training the chest at different incline angles can likely be useful and this can be done with body weight finally the back can also be trained with biomechanically different body weight movements so summarizing this section there are a variety of bodywear exercises that can collectively optimize regional growth of many muscles it's not necessarily a pitfall [Music] calisthenics may have some very real pitfalls around lower body training there's evidence hamstring activation patterns differ between hip extension and leg curl-based exercises so to optimize overall hamstring development you'd want both movements a Lego bodyweight variation exists with a Nordic curl and this is an excellent exercise frequently used in the athletic world but there's no proper body weight hip extension exercise that will really recruit the hamstrings with the other main lower body muscles the quads glutes and calves exercise selection isn't really a problem you have squatting variations that will hit the quads and glutes reverse Nordic curls that can hit the quads further hip thrust variations that can hit the glutes further and standing and seated calf raises for the calves the problem however is many of these are difficult to overload in the long term relative novices can perform way more than 35 reps on calf raise and hip thrust variations with squatting variations progressing to pistol squats can take a while but once you're able to rep out on pistol squats further long-term overloading with body weight alone is difficult so I think Progressive overload with some lower body exercises is a real Pitfall due to this I think it's reasonable to speculate a person cannot Max their lower body hypertrophy with calisthenic solely this shouldn't be mistaken in saying no lower body hypertrophy occurs with calisthenics this is of course false I should also note that you can still train with more than 35 repetitions it can still elicit muscle growth albeit just perhaps not as effective as staying within that 6 to 35 range [Music] body weight exercises can stimulate hypertrophy just as effectively as free weights or machines provided you're getting too or near to failure in the 6 to 35 rep range overloading body weight exercises in the long run needs a little creativity increasing rep numbers using harder variations or manipulating reptempo are all viable strategies there exists in a rate of different body weight exercise variations that can collectively contribute to producing great Regional development of your muscles finally I think it's likely bodyweight training can be extremely effective in the long term for upper body hypertrophy but it most likely won't be extremely effective for lower body hypertrophy some regions of the lower body may not be trained with body weight variations and some lower body weight exercises are going to be virtually impossible to successfully overload in the 6-35 rep range long term limiting their effectiveness if you've made it here

Measurements\u00a0\u00a0 were taken just before the 8-week experimental\u00a0\nprotocol, just after the 3rd week, which remember,\u00a0\u00a0 is when the strength phase would have just ended\u00a0\nfor the strength plus hypertrophy group, and just\u00a0\u00a0 after the 8 weeks. The measurements were a one-\u00a0\nrep max test on the back squat and leg press, for\u00a0\u00a0 strength gains. And for hypertrophy, thickness of\u00a0\nthe vastus lateralis measured at 60% of the thigh length. Increases in one-rep max\u00a0\non the back squat and leg press at the 3rd week and after the 8 weeks were significantly\u00a0\ngreater for the strength plus hypertrophy group\u00a0\u00a0 compared to the hypertrophy group. These results\u00a0\nmake sense, the current evidence indicates training\u00a0\u00a0 with relatively heavy loads and therefore lower\u00a0\nrepetitions produces the greatest increases in\u00a0\u00a0 one-rep max strength. The strength plus hypertrophy\u00a0\ngroup spent their first three weeks training with\u00a0\u00a0 1 to 3 reps for both exercises. Furthermore, \u00a0\nthe strength gains developed from this phase\u00a0\u00a0 actually allowed them to use heavier loads\u00a0\nduring their following hypertrophy phase.\u00a0\u00a0 Remember, during weeks 3 to 8 of the\u00a0\nstudy, both groups were training identically.\u00a0\u00a0 They used 8 to 12 reps on the back squat and leg\u00a0\npress. Yet, the strength plus hypertrophy group\u00a0\u00a0 used heavier loads on both exercises. Moving on,\u00a0\nincreases in vastus lateralis thickness at week 3\u00a0\u00a0 favored the hypertrophy group. However, by the end\u00a0\nof the 8th week, increases in vastus lateralis thickness were greater for the strength plus\u00a0\nhypertrophy group. In other words, although the\u00a0\u00a0 strength phase did not immediately produce much\u00a0\ngrowth for the strength plus hypertrophy group,\u00a0\u00a0 it seemed to have boosted the muscle\u00a0\ngrowth experienced in the hypertrophy phase.\u00a0\u00a0 So much so that the strength plus hypertrophy\u00a0\ngroup experienced overall greater gains by the\u00a0\u00a0 end of the study. These are some really intriguing\u00a0\nresults. What might explain them? Remember,\u00a0\u00a0 during the last 5 weeks of the study,\u00a0\nboth groups trained identically. Despite them\u00a0\u00a0 using 8 to 12 reps to failure, the strength plus\u00a0\nhypertrophy group were able to use heavier loads,\u00a0\u00a0 likely thanks to their prior strength phase.\u00a0\nThe author speculated using heavier weights\u00a0\u00a0 in the hypertrophy phase meant the strength plus\u00a0\nhypertrophy group experienced greater mechanical\u00a0\u00a0 tension and hence greater muscle growth. In other\u00a0\nwords, heavier loads mean more mechanical tension\u00a0\u00a0 and therefore more hypertrophy. However, I'd\u00a0\nargue this is unlikely and slightly misleading.\u00a0\u00a0 Let's explore why. Mechanical tension is currently\u00a0\nthe best understood mechanism of muscle growth.\u00a0\u00a0 A large component of this is active tension . Active\u00a0\ntension is equal to the force generated by the\u00a0\u00a0 contractile units of a muscle. Simply put, higher\u00a0\nlevels of muscle fiber recruitment and high levels\u00a0\u00a0 of force produced by those recruited muscle fibers\u00a0\nwould mean high levels of active tension. A great\u00a0\u00a0 stimulus for hypertrophy. Muscles produce force\u00a0\nprogressively. When your effort is low there are\u00a0\u00a0 low numbers of recruited muscle fibers and low\u00a0\nforce produced by some recruited muscle fibers.\u00a0\u00a0 As your effort increases, increased muscle fiber\u00a0\nrecruitment and increased force produced by\u00a0\u00a0 those recruited muscle fibers occurs. During the\u00a0\nlast 5 weeks, both groups trained with 8 to 12 reps to failure. All subjects would\u00a0\nhave been exerting the same relative effor.t\u00a0\u00a0 They all used a load that enabled them to perform\u00a0\n8 to 12 reps to failure. So, they all would have\u00a0\u00a0 been experiencing high levels of active tension.\u00a0\nThe fact that the strength plus hypertrophy group\u00a0\u00a0 used heavier loads does not matter. The relative\u00a0\nstimulus for both groups was the same. To drive\u00a0\u00a0 this point home, imagine we had a complete beginner\u00a0\nand an individual with three years of training\u00a0\u00a0 experience use a load they could only complete for\u00a0\n8 reps on the back squat. The beginner would\u00a0\u00a0 require a fairly light load, whereas the trained\u00a0\nindividual would be using a much heavier load.\u00a0\u00a0 Would the trained individual grow more from doing\u00a0\nthis simply because he's using a heavier load?\u00a0\u00a0 Probably not. In fact, this would likely be a much\u00a0\nbetter stimulus for the untrained individual, \u00a0\u00a0 simply due to the novelty of this event for him.\u00a0\nThere is another potential reason relating to\u00a0\u00a0 mechanical tension that could help explain the\u00a0\nstudy results. As mentioned, high levels of muscle\u00a0\u00a0 fiber recruitment and force produced by those\u00a0\nrecruited muscle fibers are a large component\u00a0\u00a0 of mechanical tension. Interestingly, there is some\u00a0\nresearch suggesting training with heavier loads\u00a0\u00a0 results in greater neural adaptations that\u00a0\nenable a person to experience greater muscle\u00a0\u00a0 fiber recruitment and/or greater force produced\u00a0\nby those recruited muscle fibers. Therefore, it's\u00a0\u00a0 possible the strength plus hypertrophy group in\u00a0\nthe last 5 weeks, despite training with the same\u00a0\u00a0 relative effort, would have been able to recruit\u00a0\nmore muscle fibers and/or produce greater force\u00a0\u00a0 with the recruited muscle fibers, thanks to the\u00a0\nneural adaptations from their previous strength\u00a0\u00a0 phase. However a limitation of this argument\u00a0\nis that some evidence suggests that neural\u00a0\u00a0 adaptations primarily occur in the early months of\u00a0\na person's training career, with little thereafter.\u00a0\u00a0 The subjects of the study had an average of 4\nand a half years of training experience So it's\u00a0\u00a0 questionable whether they would even be able to\u00a0\nexperience meaningful neural adaptations. That said,\u00a0\u00a0 I have come across some evidence indicating even\u00a0\nvery trained individuals can still experience\u00a0\u00a0 neural adaptations, so ultimately it's not\u00a0\ncompletely clear. A final potential reason\u00a0\u00a0 that could explain the study results relates to\u00a0\nre-sensitization. As mentioned, the subjects had\u00a0\u00a0 an average of 4 and a half years of training\u00a0\nexperience. Unfortunately, the authors of the study\u00a0\u00a0 did not report how the subjects trained previously\u00a0.\nBut, given the popularity of using 8-12 reps,\u00a0\u00a0 it's possible they consistently trained with this\u00a0\nrep range before this study. Taking some time off\u00a0\u00a0 from using 8-12 reps and training with 1 to\u00a0\n3 reps for a couple of weeks, as the strength\u00a0\u00a0 plus hypertrophy group did in their strength phase, could re-sensitize an individual. Meaning that\u00a0\u00a0 when they returned to using 8-12 reps in their\u00a0\nhypertrophy phase, they were more sensitive to\u00a0\u00a0 this rep range and gained more muscle as a result.\u00a0\nBut, this is just a hypothesis i'm not aware of any\u00a0\u00a0 strong evidence to support this claim. Moving on,\u00a0\nit's important to remember this is only one study.\u00a0\u00a0 Unfortunately, there are no other studies with an\u00a0\nidentical or near identical design to this study. \u00a0\u00a0 However, there is research somewhat related that\u00a0\nwould reduce our enthusiasm about the results.\u00a0\u00a0 Prestes and colleagues split 20 women with\u00a0\nat least 6 months of training experience\u00a0\u00a0 into a linear or reverse linear group. Both\u00a0\ngroups trained 3 times per week for 12 weeks.\u00a0\u00a0 They alternated between workout A and workout\u00a0\nB. Each exercise was trained for 3 sets.\u00a0\u00a0 The linear group throughout the 12 weeks gradually\u00a0\nprogressed from using a load they could perform\u00a0\u00a0 12 to 14 reps with to a load they could\u00a0\nperform 4 to 6 reps with. So they just\u00a0\u00a0 increased the load used and decreased the\u00a0\nnumber of reps performed on their exercises.\u00a0\u00a0 The reverse linear group did the opposite of this,\u00a0\nthroughout the 12 weeks, they gradually progressed\u00a0\u00a0 from using a load they could perform 4 to 6 reps with\u00a0\nto a load they could perform 12 to 14 reps with.\u00a0\u00a0 On weeks 4, 8, and 12 both groups performed 12\u00a0\nreps on their exercise sets. These weeks were\u00a0\u00a0 recovery weeks. they also only trained twice on\u00a0\nthese weeks. the reverse linear group is slightly\u00a0\u00a0 comparable to the strength plus hypertrophy\u00a0\ngroup in the Carvalho and colleague study. In\u00a0\u00a0 that they began with low reps and heavy weight and\u00a0\nended with more traditional hypertrophy training.\u00a0\u00a0 However, increases in fat-free mass, measured by\u00a0\nskin fold calipers, were significantly greater for\u00a0\u00a0 the linear group versus the reverse linear group.\u00a0\nNow, skinfold calipers aren't the best measurement\u00a0\u00a0 tool for muscle growth. MRI or ultrasound, as\u00a0\nwas used in the Carvalho and colleague study,\u00a0\u00a0 is considered much more reliable and\u00a0\naccurate, so we should keep this in mind.\u00a0\u00a0 Nonetheless, this study does somewhat conflict\u00a0\nwith the Carvalho and colleague study. Looking at\u00a0\u00a0 other research, if implementing low rep training\u00a0\nin a hypertrophy oriented program could improve\u00a0\u00a0 muscle growth, we would expect alternating your rep\u00a0\nranges to produce greater muscle growth than using\u00a0\u00a0 only one rep range. But, as we detailed in our last\u00a0\nvideo, the research finds no difference between\u00a0\u00a0 alternating rep ranges or using a constant rep\u00a0\nrange for hypertrophy, at least in the short term.\u00a0\u00a0 12 weeks or less. The Carvalho and colleagues\u00a0\nstudy did only last 8 weeks, so it somewhat\u00a0\u00a0 conflicts with this area of research. Moreover, the\u00a0\nresearch generally demonstrates that if you use\u00a0\u00a0 different rep ranges in your training program,\u00a0\nthe way you organize them does not seem to impact\u00a0\u00a0 muscle growth. Again, at least in the short term. A\u00a0\nmeta-analysis by Grgic and colleagues combined\u00a0\u00a0 the results of studies comparing linear to daily\u00a0\nundulating periodization. Linear periodization\u00a0\u00a0 ,very generally, involves gradually increasing\u00a0\nthe load you use on an exercise and performing\u00a0\u00a0 fewer reps as a result, over many weeks. Conversely,\u00a0\ndaily undulating periodization typically involves\u00a0\u00a0 mixing different rep ranges into a weekly\u00a0\nschedule. The analysis found no significant\u00a0\u00a0 difference between the two periodization\u00a0\nmodels for increasing measures of muscle growth.\u00a0\u00a0 At the end of the day, I don't believe we have\u00a0\nsufficient data to confidently suggest getting\u00a0\u00a0 strong first increases hypertrophy later. Though,\u00a0\nmuch of the opposing evidence to the Carvalho and\u00a0\u00a0 colleagues study is indirect. I think the idea\u00a0\nof re-sensitization that we covered earlier is\u00a0\u00a0 intriguing. If the strength plus hypertrophy group\u00a0\nexperienced greater hypertrophy because they were\u00a0\u00a0 re-sensitized to the 8-12 rep range, technically,\u00a0\nnone of the indirect data we looked at could\u00a0\u00a0 refute this. Hopefully future research that is\u00a0\nidentical or near identical to the study emerge.\u00a0\u00a0 This should enable greater insight. And of course, if this happens, I do plan to create updated videos."

    "transcript": "[Music] welcome to the house of hypertrophy lactic acid is crucial essential mandatory for maxing muscle growth the burn is where pain turns into gains there's a decent probability you've heard something along these lines but what does the scientific literature say on lactic acid as well as the buildup of other metabolites generally for muscle growth let's take a look before anything else it's worth debunking common lactic acid mainstream myths the first myth is the term lactic acid under normal human physiological conditions lactic acid largely does not exist rather it's lactate which is lactic acid minus a hydrogen ion that's present in humans the second myth is lactate causes fatigue this idea comes from correlational and hypothetical research conducted before the 1990s since then a multitude of higher quality evidence indicates lactate does not cause fatigue nor is it a poisonous substance in fact lactate can actually be a fuel source for muscle and brain function and contributes to an array of other positive things the third myth is lactate solely produces the pain or Burning Sensations during intense exercise this elegant 2014 paper from the USA shows this isn't the case experimentally infusing lactate to high levels alone did not induce pain sensation moreover individually infusing either ATP or hydrogen two other metabolites to high levels also did not produce pain Sensations it was only when all three of the metabolites so ATP hydrogen and lactate were concurrently Infuse the high levels that pain Sensations occur indicating It's a combination of metabolites that drive the sensations of pain individually elevating a single metabolite does not do this so humans don't truly produce lactic acid rather lactate lactate does not dry fatigue and lactate alone does not cause pain Sensations during intense exercise but it does lactate cause hypertrophy foreign this 2022 review paper from the USA nicely summarizes a multitude of papers finding lactate may play a role in muscle hypertrophy through the activation of satellite cells and their activation of various proteins involved in signaling muscle growth yet a major consideration is all of this research is either in vitro based I.E done outside the human body or animal based as an example this study found in rats treadmill running for four weeks consuming lactate and caffeine produced greater muscle hypertrophy versus not consuming these things of course the caffeine consumption does confound things here aside from in vitro and animal papers lactate increases from exercise are associated with temporary testosterone increases yet a strong amount of literature indicates temporary increases in anabolic hormones from training like testosterone are not associated with muscle growth it may be more so related to mobilizing fuel for muscle contraction in totality I'm sure many would agree this overviewed evidence isn't great for inferring lactate is a powerful driver of hypertrophy other higher quality data questions the importance of lactate for hypertrophy what if we injected humans with lactate while working out if lactate powerfully stimulated hypertrophy we would expect this to increase the activation of key proteins involved in muscle hypertrophy a 2020 Swedish study did this and found that injecting lactate into subjects arms throughout leg extension training successfully increase blood and muscle lactate levels but it did not increase activation of key proteins involved in muscle hypertrophy any more than injecting saline which is just salt and water now although injecting lactate did increase muscle lactic levels as just noted the increases were not massive it would have been better to directly inject lactate into the leg muscles as opposed to the arm to produce larger muscle lactate increases nevertheless other fascinating data still questions lactate's importance for hypertrophy sprinting for 400 meters seems to produce comparable muscle lactate increases to a lower body training session involving 5 sets of four different chord exercises yet we can certainly say lower body training session will build more muscle than 400 meter running repeated short cycling Sprints appear to produce comparable muscle lactate elevations to three sets of dumbbell curls to failure and sprint cycling is certainly not going to be the most hypertrophic stimulus in the long run different rep tempos as indicated by this 2009 Japanese paper produced different lactate increases even when reps are performed to exhaustion but the literature indicates when reps are performed to failure a wide range of rep tempos are similar for building muscle in fact the Japanese paper indicates a slower lowering Tempo produces the lowest lactate increases yet some Research indicates slower lowering tempos could build more muscle though this isn't a consistent finding and I plan to cover this more in future videos short rests between sets can increase lactate more but as noted previously at the house of hypertrophy longer rests between large muscle mass exercise sets produce more hypertrophy versus shorter rests illustrating this concept a 2016 English paper found that when training their leg press and leg extension with these variables resting one minute between sets produced greater lactate elevations versus five minutes between sets but myofibular protein synthesis I.E the creation of the proteins that make muscles bigger was largely greater after resting for five minutes between sets this 2021 Brazilian study used a novel method that further questions lactate's hypertrophic value subjects train the leg extensions with these variables one condition rested normally between sets a second condition blood flow restricted their leg with a cough during the rest between sets which ultimately led to Greater overall lactate elevations versus the first condition yet quadriceps growth ended up being similar between both conditions after eight weeks of training in my view this overviewed evidence strongly suggests lactate is not a potent driver of hypertrophy finally for this section it's worth understanding once lactate is produced by muscle fibers it doesn't necessarily stay dormant there it can be converted to fuel for contraction shuttle to other muscle fibers of the same or different muscle and even shuttle to the body's organs these facts May further blunt the idea lactate powerfully drives muscle growth [Music] lactate is just one metabolite from thousands does greater metabolite buildup overall lead to more hypertrophy as implicated by a 2019 German review paper higher reps perform two or close to failure and we can include Blood Flow Restriction Training performed with High Reps here too would likely produce greater overall metabolite buildup versus lower ribs yet the literature indicates Blood Flow Restriction higher reps and lower reps can all be similar for building muscle some may think though hypertrophy is similar between these the growth stimuli differ between them namely higher reps and Blood Flow Restriction cause muscle growth through metabolite buildup while lower rep training causes muscle growth through mechanical tension but as discussed in a great 2017 review from the USA this is most likely false mechanical tension seems to be the most powerful driver of muscle hypertrophy and it's very likely Blood Flow Restriction higher reps and lower reps all cause similar mechanical tension thus explaining the similar hypertrophy you see mechanical tension is the force experienced by muscle fibers muscle fibers have mechanosensors that can detect the force produced by them and convert this Force into a signaling event that produces muscle hypertrophy the process of force is being converted into signaling events has the cool name of meccano transduction to maximize overall mechanical tension we'd want to recruit as many fibers as possible and have the fibers produce good Force levels for a decent duration training two or close to failure accomplishes this regardless of whether Blood Flow Restriction higher or lower reps are used lower reps with heavier lows will instantly involve High mechanical tension and it only increases as you near failure higher reps and Blood Flow Restriction initially involve low mechanical tension but as you continue repping out and narrowing failure more muscle fibers are recruited and many fibers may increase their forced contribution ultimately overall mechanical tension ends up being comparable between these things as implied in the aforementioned 2017 review the metabolite buildup with higher reps or Blood Flow Restriction Training may be a byproduct of the effort and energy utilization to get to or close to failure it's not the cause of muscle growth two other fascinating papers demonstrate that metabolite buildup may play a minimal role in hypertrophy these two papers had two conditions one condition involves subjects training normally with sets of reps to failure the second condition also involves subjects training normally with sets of reps to failure but once completing this the train to Lim had a Blood Flow Restriction cough applied to it for three to five minutes this Blood Flow Restriction would have trapped the metabolites in the muscle and if metabolites could boost muscle growth this condition should see more muscle growth yet after eight weeks both studies found muscle growth was not enhanced when applying the Blood Flow Restriction after training one of the papers actually found it reduced muscle growth in the women's subjects [Music] crystallizing this video humans don't truly produce lactic acid rather lactate lactate does not cause fatigue and lactate alone doesn't drive the pain Sensations during intense exercise solid literature indicates lactate as well as metabolite buildup in general isn't a powerful driver of hypertrophy they don't seem to convert additional gains Beyond what's provoked by mechanical tension I don't want to make the mistake of saying just because more of something I.E metabolites does not mean more hypertrophy it means metabolites play a zero percent role in muscle growth it's possible there's a threshold Beyond which metabolites provide no further hypertrophy the threshold may be very low and much of the research overviewed past that threshold explaining why infusing lactate during training higher reps Blood Flow Restriction or trapping metabolites via Blood Flow Restriction provided no added hypertrophy alternatively perhaps metabolites are anabolic at extreme levels levels not feasible are possible in humans matter of fact much of the in vitro research linking lactate to muscle hypertrophy involved continuous High lactate exposure for two to six hours with some even lasting for days more research is required to pinpoint if either speculation holds any truth or if metabolites are completely irrelevant for hypertrophy what is clear is that mechanical tension should be your primary focus if the goal is to build muscle and this is simply done by just ensuring you're performing your reps too or close to failure if you've made it here I have a free ebook you might like The Ultimate Guide to bench pressing for strength and hypertrophy with more than 100

    "transcript": "[Music] it's almost a guarantee that if you got two people to perform the same training program they would get different results why is this genetics nutrition and sleep may be some factors that instantly come to your mind and all of these are unquestionably valid but another probably underappreciated factor is the psychological stress levels experienced by a person psychological stress is the emotional stress within your mind there are probably an infinite number of ways you could describe psychological stress from persistent feelings of fear anxiety anger resentment frustration grief sadness and so on and so forth most of the people watching this video are probably well aware of one form or another of psychological stress but how does psychological stress relate to building muscle and strength oftentimes we may simplify training for example in the two-factor fitness model training stimulates fitness and fatigue once fatigue diminishes your performance increases however remember we're talking about the human body an extraordinarily complex machine your brain contains around 86 billion neurons and at any given second in time one estimate suggests there are 37 with 21 zeros reactions taking place in your body thus it's clear to see simplifying training and its response is not easy the fact is your mind interacts with your physiology we saw last video that they may believe you're taking anabolic steroids when you are actually not skyrockets your strength gains in this video we'll be exploring how psychological stress impacts recovery after a training session your long term strength and muscle gains and then we'll wrap up with a brief mention on methods to potentially reduce psychological stress [Music] let us first examine how psychological stress impacts your recovery after a training session this study had 210 students in resistance training classes complete a test to determine their perceived levels of stress that is how much stress do they feel they have ultimately 31 individuals were recruited 18 of them had results indicating they were low stressed individuals while 13 of them had results indicating they were highly stressed individuals now these subjects again completed the test to redetermine their perceived levels of stress to ensure the results had not changed additionally they did a test to determine the number of stressful life events taking place thus each subject not only had their perceived stress score but also a life event stress score the subjects performed a highly intense training session it consisted of a ramping phase and burning phase all of the training was done on the leg press the ramping phase had the subjects perform a set of 10 reps with progressively heavier weights until they worked up to a weight with which 10 reps could not be completed two minutes of rest was given between these sets three minutes after this they moved onto the burning phase this consisted of performing six sets of repetitions to volitional failure with three minutes of rest between sets on the first set they used a low that could be performed for a maximum of 10 repetitions this load was of course established from the ramping phase the second set had them reduce this load by ten percent and if the subjects could perform more than ten reps on their set they kept training with this load throughout set three to six if not they used a twenty percent lighter load on the remaining sets before this training session the researchers measured maximal isometric muscle force muscle soreness subjective fatigue and subjective energy all of these measures were retested one hour 24 hours 48 hours 72 hours and 96 hours after the training session what were the findings higher stressed individuals as measured by both the perceived and life event stress measures took longer to recover their maximal isometric muscle force looking at the data low stressed individuals recovered within 48 hours while the highly stressed individuals just about recovered within 96 hours which is double the time energy fatigue and soreness also took longer to return to baseline in the highly stressed individuals as measured by life event stress perceived levels of stress did not have an effect on soreness or fatigue scores but it did have an effect on energy such that highly stressed individuals with this score took longer for their energy levels to return to baseline it's worth mentioning that before the intense training session all the measurements were similar between the highly moderately and low stressed individuals moreover all these subjects performed similar workloads and saw similar max and average heart rate responses so differences in before measurements or differences in training effort cannot explain the results we've overviewed thus the data demonstrates strongly that stress both perceived and life event stresses interfere and prolong your recovery durations [Music] how does psychological stress impact long-term muscle and strength gains for this we have this study 81 men and 54 women were recruited the subjects were classified as either low stressed or high-stressed individuals based on a test that incorporated both life event stress and their perceived stress impacts all subjects trained these exercises twice per week for 12 weeks there were three mesocycles throughout the 12 weeks the first four weeks was a hypertrophy cycle where these training variables were used the second four weeks was a strength cycle with these training variables while the last four weeks was a power cycle with these variables it was found bench press and squat strength gains as measured by one rep max were greater for the low stress versus high stressed individuals increases in upper arm and thigh circumference were not statistically different between the low and high-stressed individuals however the percentages do appear to favor the low-stressed individuals speaking very non-scientifically i think this could be a real difference that the study was just underpowered to find but at the same time it could just be due to chance it's also worth pointing out that circumference is a very indirect measure of muscle growth if more direct measures of muscle growth such as ultrasound or mri was used perhaps we would see a difference between the low and high stressed individuals but this is me speculating nevertheless at the least this study indicates psychological stress interferes with strength gains [Music] based on the data overviewed it appears psychological stress can extend recovery durations and impair long-term adaptations it's worth also noting that other data indicates highly stressed individuals are more susceptible to illnesses and injuries thus you're going to want to do your utmost to minimize stress we'll discuss some potential things that can help shortly but i also want to discuss another potential takeaway from this video that is there are cases where psychological stress is unpredictable and uncontrollable in events like these given stress will negatively influence your recovery and adaptability it might be best to go easy with your training or give yourself a break remember muscle memory is real humans and other animals too have an accelerated ability to regain loss strength and muscle so training breaks or periods of light training should not worry you moreover there's some potential reason to believe training breaks at least may be beneficial for re-sensitizing your anabolic pathways but i'll save this for another video anyway let us detail some potential ways to minimize psychological stress the first potential way is via practicing meditation now there are numerous different forms of meditation but i think pretty much all of them can reduce psychological stress the literature suggests meditation can reduce activity of the amygdala sometimes called the brain fear center and even potentially reduce the size of the amygdala in the long term while concurrently increasing gray matter in the brain regions involved in learning memory processing and emotion regulation furthermore a meta-analysis on nearly 1 300 adults found meditation may decrease anxiety with the strongest effects seen for those with the most anxiety the second potential way to reduce psychological stress is through breath work there are numerous types of breathing exercises that can help it's worth noting that when you breathe in your heart rate increases while when you breathe out your heart rate decreases so breathing in a way that results in you exhaling more than you inhale can be a great way to induce relaxation and calmness one real time tool is the double inhale followed by a long exhale i first heard about this from andrew hubermann it seems to be a great way to instantly help relieve some stress moving on from the literature there's evidence diaphragmatic breathing sessions also called belly breathing where you focus on deep inhales followed by long slow exhales can increase attention abilities enhance well-being and reduce cortisol levels cortisol is also known as the stress hormone the third potential way is to spend time in nature there's evidence visiting natural environments can be beneficial in reducing both physical and psychological stress levels of course depending on where you live spending time in nature isn't always viable another fourth potential way is just to walk more it's evident humans were designed to move and be active and we thrive when we do so higher daily step counts even potentially more than 10 000 daily steps have been associated with lower risks of dying from all causes moreover higher daily steps have been associated with lower anxiety depression anger fatigue confusion and total mood distress scores of course these are only a few of the numerous ways one could go about relieving stress and different individuals have their own preferences and methods to deal with stress but i hope at least some of the info detailed here can be of use to you until next time [Music]"

    "title": "Stretching Builds Muscle SIMILAR to Lifting Weights",
    "published_at": "2023-05-15T10:59:56Z",
    "transcript": "[Music] foreign to the house of hypertrophy how effective is stretching for inducing muscle hypertrophy and strength research conducted on animals finds that stretching produces substantial gains with increases in muscle cross-sectional area up to 141 and maximal strength increases up to 95 percent in fact I recall back in the day stumbling across this article suggesting stretching had the potential to cause a 318 increase in muscle mass however a crucial limitation of these studies are not only are they conducted on animals but the stretching protocols were extreme with stretches being held for up to 24 hours in humans the literature tends to largely indicate their stretching for durations up to two minutes fails to produce any real hypertrophy or strength gains but this begs the question could more intense stretching in humans produce hypertrophy and strength a new study by warnicki and colleagues aim to find this out [Music] 69 individuals with some degree of resistance training experience were recruited and assigned into either a stretching hypertrophy training or control group we don't need to worry about the control group they did no training and expectedly saw no gains the hypertrophy training group performed calf presses for five sets of 10 to 12 full range motion repetitions to failure three days per week the stretch and groups stretched their calves for one hour every single day with a device such as this at a pay level of seven to eight on a 10 scale after six weeks of the intervention it was found that isometric straight leg and bent knee calf strength increased in both the stretching and hypertrophy groups with non-significant differences between them interestingly the percentages for the straight leg strength favor the stretching group if we look at how each individual adapted for the groups we can see that many individuals in both groups saw comparable straight leg strength gains but some of the data points pulled it towards the stretching group no it's unclear if this could be due to error but the idea the stretching produced a better isometric straight leg strength gains might be quite logical since the stretching training which was done with a straight leg it's more specific to an isometric straight leg strength test opposed to these isometric strength tests if Dynamic strength tests were used the results would probably favor the hypertrophy group due to the hypertrophy training being more specific to Dynamic strength as for hypertrophy lateral and medial gastrocnemius thickness increased in both the stretching and hypertrophy groups and the differences between the groups were again non-significant for the lateral gastrocnemius the percentages seem to favor the hypertrophy training group if we look at how each individual grew their lateral gastrocnemius for both groups there certainly were many individuals in both groups seeing similar gains but some of the data points leaned towards slightly better growth in the hypertrophy group it's not clear if this is due to error either but it's of course logical more standard hypertrophy training better builds muscle than stretching but still remember medial gastrocnemius gains were a lot more comparable between the groups so despite some of the limitations and considerations these results nonetheless demonstrate intense stretching one hour daily produce significant hypertrophy and strength gains with some similarities to three days a week of typical hypertrophy training this is the first study to examine and establish this and so it's a pretty cool addition to the muscle I poetry and strength literature practically speaking I'm sure most people have no desire to stretch for one hour daily yet for injured or recovering individuals who cannot train normally intense stretch training could be an option for them in any case the 5 pointing that one hour of stretching daily can produce fairly comparable hypertrophy and strength gains to resistance training is pretty cool for those interested in guidance or ideas about programming for hypertrophy you may be interested in our partner Alpha progression a tremendous app

beyond the link gives you 20 off a subscription we don't just partner up with anybody at the house of hypertrophy so you can rest assured the app is seriously quality [Music] I think another notable potential takeaway from this study relates to the mechanisms behind hypertrophy as examined previously in the house of hypertrophy it appears mechanical tension may be their primary stimulus behind muscle hypertrophy this study might indirectly further support this fundamentally mechanical tension are the forces experienced by the fibers of a muscle these forces can be active as is the case when your muscle fibers are Contracting or they can even be passive as is the case when muscles are stretched within and around muscle fibers are proteins that have the ability to detect these active and passive forces generated by the muscle fibers and then convert the forces into a signal that produces muscle hypertrophy off of this I would hypothesize the reason the intense stretching training produced significant hypertrophy is since the passive tension with the stretch was meaningful enough to trigger hypertrophy in fact we've had animal studies indicating when Peak tension is equated between stretching and eccentric muscle contractions hypertrophy related signaling tends to be similar some of you may be wondering about muscle damage could this not have contributed to the hypertrophy scene from stretching I believe we can't fully rule out some level of damage contributing to hypertrophy but the problem is we simply have multiple areas of the research at least suggesting damage cannot be the primary stimulus behind hypertrophy moreover thanks to the repeated bow effect which we've examined in depth previously at the house of hypertrophy damage tends to subside as you become more accustomed to what you're training [Music] thank you"

    "title": "How Many Reps for Muscle Growth? (40+ Studies)",
    "published_at": "2024-12-16T14:00:35Z",
    "transcript": "[Music] welcome to the house of hypertrophy how many reps do you perform should you train with lower moderate or higher reps to maximize muscle hypertrophy I've seen some increasingly common suggestions that there is actually an ideal rep zone for building muscle While others say this is a myth fascinatingly a survey of 127 competitive bodybuilders found the majority tended to train with 7 to 12 reps of course this doesn't necessarily mean 7 to 12 reps is optimal what does the overall scientific literature say on this topic in this video I'll summarize the entire literature on rep Rangers for building muscle we'll answer as many questions as possible I've had previous videos on this topic but I wanted to have a video that summarizes and combines everything so you're aware of all aspects of the rep range research let's dive in in the last few years five meta analyses have compared High vers low low training for muscle hypertrophy in case you're unaware meta analyses combine the results of numerous studies and are generally some of the strongest form of evidence these meta analyses fundamentally find the same thing similar growth across a wide range of loads for example this meta analysis by Lopez compared High moderate and low loads with similar hypertrophy across the comparisons this holds even when looking at different types of muscle growth measurements as this meta analysis finds that higher and low loads produced similar increases in lean mass whole muscle size and muscle fiber size I must point out that the studies have subjects get to or at least very close to failure with a given load for a higher load this will result in fewer reps while for a lighter load this will result in a higher number of reps the exact rep numbers vary from study to study and even from set to set in a couple of papers but after going through each paper I'd say most are in the 6 to 35 rep range others do say 5 to 30 but I think 6 to 35 might represent the underlying data a little better shortly we'll examine what happens if you creep below five or six reps as well as if you go above 35 I must also point out that most studies use a pretty normal speed on each rep around a 1 to 2 second lifting and 1 to 2 second lowering duration rep speeds will naturally slow down as you near failure but the key is this 6 to35 rep Zone will likely not be applicable if you're using deliberately very slow speeds on every rep for example this study fascinatingly found that 6 to 10 reps were inferior for building muscle when each rep involved a seriously slow 10-second lifting and 4 second lowering duration so we've seen that five meta analyses including multiple different types of muscle growth measurements suggest similar growth across a wide number of reps when training two or very close to failure that seems like pretty strong evidence but some might point out that a chunk of this data was done on untrained individuals only training a few exercises they suggest the results could be different in trained individuals performing a full program is this true well we luckily have two studies which were done on trained individuals performing a full program both studies involve three sets per exercise with one group training 8 to 12 reps to failure per set and another Group Training 20 to 35 reps to failure per set measures of growth increased similarly between both meaning we have reason to believe hypertrophy is similar across a wide number of reps even in this context at this point some might be thinking sure 6 to 35 reps produce similar growth but the type of growth they produce is not the same namely higher reps better grow slow twitch fibers while lower reps better grow fast twitch fibers is this true some earlier studies out of Russia suggested this could be true but these papers crucially have a range of limitations fortunately one of the meta analyses shown earlier aimed to explore this more with better design studies ultimately fast twitch fiber growth was similar between higher and lower loads and slow twitch fiber growth was also similar between higher and lower loads thus it seems that growth of both slow and fast switch fibers is similar across a wide range of rips another paper not included in this analysis had an interesting design it explored how growth of the Solus a muscle composed of predominantly slow twitch fibers compared between training car phasers with either 20 to 30 reps to failure or 6 to 10 reps to failure it was found the solely screw similarly between both thereby again failing to support the idea higher reps are better for slow twitch fibers these results might make sense as this excellent paper on trained individuals found that when performing four sets on the leg extension with either higher or lower loads to failure activation of fast and slow twitch fibers was similar between both indeed higher loads can readily recruit both fast and slow twitch fibers with low loads initially only slow twitch fibers might be recruited but as you perform more reps and get closer to failure recruitment of those faster switch fibers can occur can you still build muscle effectively with fewer than five or six reps an interesting place to St is to see if one rep that is your one rep max can build muscle I'm aware of four studies that had one condition trained with three to four sets of 8 to 12 reps while another condition had at most five attempts to reach their one rep max each session all four of the papers find greater growth with the 8 to 12 reps and they all fascinatingly find the one rep max produce very little to no growth whatsoever so one rep doesn't seem to do much for building muscle but what about two to four reps this paper on trained individuals helps us out subjects trained these exercises for three sets each with these other variables a heavy group adjusted loads each set to hit two to four reps to failure while a moderate group adjusted loads each set to hit 8 to 12 reps to failure overall growth tended to be better with the 8 to 12 reps however another paper on untrained individuals had slightly different findings subjects train the back squat for four sets with either 3 to 5 reps 13 to 15 reps or 23 to 25 reps growth was ultimately not significantly different between all three rep ranges there are differences between these two studies but it just doesn't seem Crystal Clear if very low reps produce optimal gains now there are five other papers actually finding two to four reps to be similarly effective to higher Reps for building muscle but my big concern is these papers had the two to four rep conditions perform more sets per exercise and or rest longer between sets I view this as a PO potential problem since we have data suggesting more sets can build more muscle and resting longer between sets in certain cases could build more muscle therefore if these five studies equated set numbers and rest between sets perhaps they would find two to four reps to not be as effective there's also some other indirect data this paper compared leg extensions with reps the failure with either a 30% or 90% one rep max load on average five reps were performed with a 90% load but muscle protein synthesis was overall greater with the 30% load one limitation though is that muscle damage can Cloud our interpretation of muscle protein synthesis data and as we'll soon see higher reps and lower reps do not cause the same amount of damage there's also this paper which found that gains in lean mass somewhat stalled when subjects transition to performing three sets of three reps on their core exercises this stall did not occur for other groups training with slightly higher rep numbers one limitation is that lean mass isn't the most precise measure of growth overall though it's apparent unlike one rep two to four reps has resulted in detectable hypertrophy in some studies however since its Effectiveness on a per set basis is questionable I would generally recommend not training entirely with reps below five or six for building muscle however if some of your sets involve very low reps that might actually be fine and nothing major to worry about about for example this study had subjects train dumbbell curs with either a low 30% one rep max load or a high 80% one rep max load looking at the rep numbers across sets you can see the 80% condition involved three reps on the final set on average but growth was still ultimately similar between both conditions as another example this study by shanfeld yet again had trained subjects train these exercises for three sets three times per week a varied group trained two to four reps the failure on Monday 8 to 12 reps to failure on Wednesday and 20 to 30 reps to failure on Friday a constant group trained with 8 to 12 reps to failure in all training sessions muscle growth was ultimately similar between both some of the percentages favored the variation but this was partly driven by outliers so having some sets with very low rep numbers might not ruin your gains You could argue if this study instead had five to six reps on Monday this would have certainly resulted in varying rep r producing better results however this is currently challenging to suggest with confidence as we have two other studies that explored the effectiveness of training with a variety of reps where none of the sets went below six reps both found similar growth between training with these different rep Rangers and another group that largely trained with eight reps to failure every session so training with a variety of different rep ranges does not enhance growth but it's not any worse either so it's something you could certainly try out if you desire and of course it is also possible to train with higher reps on some exercises but lower reps on other exercises having said all that most of the studies last 12 weeks or less in a much older video I presented this study finding that after 9 months of training comparing a group training only with the 8 to 10 rep range training across a variety of rep ranges produced greater increases in fat-free Mass but I do not put a turn of stock into this as it's just one study and fat mess measured by skinfold calipers is not an ideal measure for mle growth I would like to see more long-term data in this area though how high can you go what if you go above 35 reps this is more of a theoretical question as I'm sure most people have no desire to train with very high repetitions but let's briefly examine what the literature suggests this study involved comparing dumbbell CO's performed for three sets with either a 30% or 80% one rep max load fascinatingly we can see the 30% condition involved an astonishing average of 100 reps on the first set yet they still ultimately experience similar hypertrophy to the 80% condition part of the reason the rep numbers are so high is they did not adjust the training load until the middle of the study so subjects were essentially progressively overloading by performing more and more reps till failure thereby increasing the average number of reps performed a number of other studies using light loads have subjects adjust the load every session such that they stay roughly around the 25 to 35 rep range anyhow what does other research say about Super High Reps the best design paper is probably this one untrained subjects train the dumbbell curl and leg press with roughly 3 to five sets subjects either used a 20% 40% 60% or 80% One R Max load to failure each set these were the average reps overall the 40 to 80% loads produced similar hypertrophy which is is expected as these conditions were within the 6035 rep range whereas the 20% condition which performed an average of more than 60 reps still produced growth but just not as much as the other conditions there are two other studies which compare training to valal failure with either a 15% or 70% one R Max load one of them finds similar growth while the other suggest the very light load was inferior however two considerations are these studies had the 15% condition use shorter rest time between sets and they actually stopped any set with a 15% condition when any subject hit 90 reps even if that wasn't volitional failure so in total it's clear the 35 reps is not a hard cut off it's possible more than 35 reps can still produce similar hypertrophy but based on the varying data I currently would not recommend training with super high repetitions but again I'm sure not many would be willing to train with super high repetitions even if it was as effective just out of curiosity I think think it would be interesting to see future studies on trained individuals exploring more than 35 reps I'm sure the subjects would have a fun [Music] time this might surprise some but there's evidence that higher repetitions cause more damage and take longer to recover from versus lower repetitions for example this study hand subjects train one of their legs with either a lighter 40% or heavier 80% load on the leg extensions separated by a week reps were taken into failure recovery was slower after training with a 40% load fascinatingly a decrease in strength of the opposite leg was seen immediately and up to 24 hours after training with a 40% load suggesting CNS fatigue since CNS fatigue May reduce the force of muscles not directly trained evidently the fatigue from higher reps does not seem to be severe enough to render it inferior in the literature we've seen that higher reps can still be effective in the context of an overall program and there are also three studies demonstrating higher reps were still as effective as lower reps when training with 18 or more weekly sets for a muscle group your body can also reduce damage and fatigue over time a prime example is this paper that initially found untrained subjects took more than 5 days to recover from five sets of 15 maximal eccentric reps maximal eccentric training is no joke and much more damaging than normal training yet after 8 weeks of training subjects were recovering a day or two after the session yet I wouldn't be surprised if a handful of people just simply cannot adequately handle training entirely with High Reps especially when they're performing higher volumes and overall if you're trying to create as little fatigue as possible reps on the lowest side of the spectrum May more effectively help you do that this notion has led some to suggest although hypertrophy is similar across a wide number of reps the 6 to 12 rep range Still Remains a more practical hypertrophy training Zone that is certain not a bad take however I still think it's fine for you to explore and experiment around with higher reps if you like even if that's just on some of your sets as again recoil training with a variety of rep ranges is not inferior and perhaps some of you may prefer higher reps on certain [Music] exercises we've seen in previous videos that leaving a few reps in a reserve May produce similar hypertrophy to training to failure but some have suggested this only applies to reps on the lower side of the spectrum with higher reps we must reach failure to maximize hypertrophy is this true a meta regression last year indeed suggested the effect of getting closer to failure was less pronounced with heavier loads however this isn't definitive proof as there isn't a number of strong direct comparisons behind the data set when directly looking at the comparisons I am not so sure we have some studies that unsurprisingly find with lighter loads training very from failure fails to produce as much growth as training to failure anyhow we have some indications that stopping just a few reps short of failure with lighter loads can be as effective as failure this paper involved subjects training the leg extension with a 30% one R Max load one condition involved getting to True momentary failure while another non-f failure condition stopped at voluntary discomfort the numbers provided would suggest a non-failure condition was stopping a few rep short of failure but hypertrophy was similar between both we also have Blood Flow Restriction studies which involve higher repetitions finding similar hypertrophy between training to failure and stopping a few rep short to failure we also have this paper conducted on trained individuals comparing High load lower body training with around one to three reps in reserve to high rep Blood Flow Restriction Training with around one to four reps in reserve both ultimately produced similar hypertrophy including hypertrophy of slow and fast twitch fibers you could say as these studies involved Blood Flow Restriction their finding cannot be applied to normal high rep training that might be true but the mechanisms behind Blood Flow Restriction Training could be similar to normal training I might expand on this in a future video finally in some not all of the studies that compare different rep ranges they instruct subjects to reach volitional failure which might not always be true momentary failure given it's easier to train to failure with reps on the lower side of the spectrum I wouldn't be surprised if the higher rep groups were stopping slightly further from fail compared to the lower reps yet hypertophy still ends up being similar between both which may further suggest reaching momentary failure is not essential to optimize hypertrophy from higher reps this isn't case closed but my current thinking is that stopping shy of failure may still be highly effective with High Reps however some practical considerations are in order the data indicates is more likely to underestimate how close to failure you are with lighter loads probably because higher reps are more painful which Mak May mask your true proximity to failure for this reason if you're training with higher reps it may be reasonable to just train to failure to ensure you're not under trining or at least have some sets which are to failure to remind you of that failure feeling with higher reps which may improve your accuracy if you choose to stop a few rep shorts of failure on other sets before wrapping up I must touch on individual differences as we described in some videos last year two papers suggest that some people grow better withow reps while other people grow better with higher reps but in the last year there has been an excellent paper explaining why these studies are technically not designed sufficiently to truly identify individual differences I'll leave a link to this in the description if you're interested in learning more about this nevertheless it is still possible that some grow better with one rep range over another but since we don't have sufficient enough data to know to what extent this is true and if there are any simple ways you could determine if you respond better to one rep range over another I would recommend just considering the overall results of the literature which was done in this video although you could say if you're struggling to make progress with your current training and all other factors are dialed in then you could try training with a different rep range to see if that could help considering the conflicting information

    "published_at": "2023-01-23T11:59:59Z",
    "transcript": "in this video we're examining the updated scientific literature on the health benefits of combining cardio and resistance training whether cardio kills muscle and strength gains and advice about how to go about combining cardio and resistance training [Music] cardiovascular fitness tends to have strong correlations with lowering all-cause mortality a 2018 cohort study found a higher VO2 max was associated with lower mortality risk resistance training also provides health benefits and can help preserve fast twitch fiber contractile functionality something aerobic training may not be as effective for resistance training also has been associated with lowering all cause mortality to varying degrees overall combining cardio and resistance training likely has added benefits a 2019 meta-analysis indicates resistance training alone was associated with a 21 decrease in risk of all cause mortality while cardio plus resistance training was associated with a 40 decrease in risk of all cause mortality however many have the concern that cardio kills muscle and strength adaptations let's assess if this is really a concern traveling back to the 1980s a study by Hixson seems to be the origin of the interference effect the idea cardio kills games Dr Hixson had a strength Group Training their lower body five times a week an endurance group performed cardio six times per week and a combined group that performed both the strength and endurance training after 10 weeks the combined groups or lower squat strength gains than the strength group a major consideration is the training was quite extreme subjects lifted five times a week and performed cardio six days a week the fact that combined groups saw a decrease in their strength Midway through the study May allude to them being over trained what has the research on combining cardio and resistance training found since in 2012 a meta-analysis combined the data of all the current studies up to that time and found when compared to resistance training only combining cardio and resistance training did produce lower magnitudes of strength and muscle growth many of the studies in this analysis were not as Extreme as the Hixson study involving more typical resistance and cardio training frequencies so at face value this 2012 study would seem to confirm the interference effect cardio impaired gains there are also speculations that cardio training produces an intracellular signaling response that directly inhibits the anabolic response from resistance training but the research has progressed since [Music] speculation that cardio produces a signaling response that directly inhibits the anabolic response from resistance training animal studies support this human studies fail to support this and demonstrate that these signaling pathways are complex and not mutually exclusive as for the long-term research a recent meta-analysis combined the data from the updated literature and found that combining cardio and resistance training did not lead to lower strength and muscle growth versus resistance training only importantly a subgroup analysis on the studies on trained individuals did not change things muscle and strength gains were not lowered when combining cardio and resistance training for them another 2022 meta-analysis likewise found whole muscle growth was unimpacted by combining cardio with resistance training so the updated scientific literature indicates cardio doesn't interfere with muscle and strength gains as much as once thought rather adaptations essentially are not compromised by no means am I saying cardio training will never ever impact muscle and strength context matters most of the studies included in the new meta-analysis involved pretty moderate amounts of cardio and resistance training cardio training for two to four times a week for 20 to 45 minutes a session with resistance training for two to four times a week with three to four exercises per muscle group for a few sets each so it's under these conditions cardio training has little impact on muscle and strength gains under more extreme conditions things almost certainly change prepping for a bodybuilding competition while also prepping for a marathon probably involves the interference effect following David Goggins running and cycling routine while prepping for a power lifting meet probably involves the interference effect too remember the 1980 Hixson study alludes to this high frequency cardio and resistance training impaired squat strength gains another consideration is your resistance training experience we mentioned in one of the 20 2022 meta-analyzes a subgroup analysis on trained individuals still indicated combining cardio with resistance training did not compromise muscle and strength gains yet these trained individuals were mostly not highly trained as hypothesized in the 2017 review the interference effect may become more pronounced in highly trained individuals as a final point for this section we've only been discussing muscle and strength gain so far but for those interested in power adaptations the 2012 meta-analysis as well as one of the updated 2022 meta-analyzes indicate power adaptations are quite known to be compromised when combining cardio and resistance training so if you're someone who Sprints jumps or performs Explosive Lifting like Olympic lifting there's a good chance combined cardio training will notably diminish your gains with these things cardiovascular training can generally be classed as high intensity interval training or continuous training high intensity interval training alternates between periods of intense exercise with less intense recovery periods continuous training involves exercising at a steady intensity for a duration both will generally improve your cardiovascular fitness but the precise adaptations likely differ between them as detailed in this article from a long-term perspective combining both with perhaps a disproportionate emphasis on continuous training ultimately probably produces overall better endurance adaptations nevertheless some may be wandering from a muscle and strength gain perspective is it better to perform high intensity interval training or continuous training in the updated meta-analyzes mentioned both high intensity interval training and continuous training were involved in the various studies and we know the results indicated combining these things with resistance training didn't compromise muscle or strength gains however quite interestingly one of the meta-analyzes found that when looking at fast and slow twitch fiber growth specifically combining high intensity interval training with resistance training did compromise growth versus resistance training only this wasn't the case when combining continuous training with resistance training slow and fast Stitch fiber growth was similar in this case to resistance training only this is paradoxical since the same meta-analysis found with whole muscle hypertrophy neither high intensity interval trading nor continuous training compromised gains how can whole muscle size be unimpacted by combining high intensity interval training or continuous training with resistance training but fiber growth is impaired by combining high intensity interval training specifically with resistance training this is a common problem in the research muscle fiber growth measurements don't always agree or strongly correlate with whole muscle hypertrophy changes and I believe we should be cautious of the muscle fiber growth data to assess this biopsies must be taken and they can only look at a very small number of muscle fibers so it's not always representative of all muscle fibers on top of this if you take multiple biopsies from the same person the size of their slow and fast pitch fibers can vary quite a bit this can render the measurement unreliable since different biopsies are taken before and after a study to measure the growth of the muscle fibers as a result I would not use this data to demonstrate high intensity interval training specifically can kill muscle growth the overall evidence still indicates whole muscle hypertrophy isn't compromised by adding either high intensity interval training or continuous training again the context of these studies matter moderate volumes of resistance and cardio training were mainly involved there is a case to me made that high intensity interval training is more fatiguing than continuous training so with more extreme volumes of training an individual may prefer more continuous training to keep recovery in check we've yet to discuss whether a person should perform cardio and resistance training in the same session or in separate training sessions the updated meta-analyzes involves studies performing cardio and resistance training in the same session as well as different sessions and given the overall analyzes indicated no interference effect this data might suggest it does not matter if cardio is performed in the same or different session however if we isolate studies done on trained individuals and then perform an analysis on performing the cardio in the same or different sessions which was done by a different 2021 meta-analysis strength gains are lowered when performing cardio in the same session but not when performing it in different sessions muscle hypertrophy measures won't assessed with this analysis but I presume performing cardio and resistance training in different sessions is probably going to be more favorable overall for trained folks so if it's practical for you I would recommend it if you have no choice but to perform cardio and distance training in the same session I'd recommend performing your resistance training first before cardio since if you do the reverse of this fatigue from the cardio session has an increased likelihood of impairing the energy effort and thus stimulus you can produce with resistance training we also haven't discussed the mode of cardio the two most common being running and cycling the updated meta-analyzes involve studies using both cycling and running and subgroup analyzes on either of these did not change the results suggesting both cycling and running are fine now running involves higher muscle damage than cycling and this could be an issue if you're performing High volumes of aerobic training but with moderate volumes of overall training it's probably not an issue as implicated by the updated meta-analyzes it's also worth mentioning your body does produce adaptations that make you resilient to muscle damage turn the repeated bow effect so the awful amount of damage you'll experience from running should decrease over time ultimately I do encourage individuals to experiment and find what's suitable for them [Music] combining cardio and resistance training can provide tremendous health benefits as nicely described by the folks over at Stronger by science the interference effect is becoming less scary by the day updated meta-analyzes fail to observe muscle and strength are interfered with additional cardio training now modular overall volumes of training were largely used in the studies and subjects were far from highly trained its presumable higher overall volumes of training and being highly trained increases the probability of the interference effect occurring yet I am skeptical even in these situations that the interference effect would be as large as a lot of people think it would be if it's practical it's probably more favorable to perform cardio and resistance training in separate sessions remember things like nutrition sleep and stress levels are important dialing these things in will presumably lower the magnitude of any potential interference effect lastly I do encourage individuals to not be afraid of experimenting around and figuring out what works for them if you'd

    "title": "Faster Muscle Growth: These NEW Studies Are Great",
    "published_at": "2024-07-15T13:00:00Z",
    "transcript": "[Music] welcome to the house of hypertrophy how many sets should you perform for your muscles what types of exercises should you train with and how can you build muscle with quicker training sessions three new studies add to our knowledge of these areas we'll briefly review these new studies understand how they fit into the overall scientific literature and then explain what this may mean for your training to maximize muscle hypertrophy let's Dive In much research on set numbers has been done on the quads triceps and biceps this new study is exciting as it's explored another muscle group the calves a muscle many report struggling to grow as with all studies it's not Flawless but its findings nonetheless nudges along the path to fully understanding the relationship between set and muscle hypertrophy 61 untrained women trained this straight leg C race exercise three times per week for six weeks one group performed two sets per session thereby totaling six sets for the Cs in a week a second group performed three sets per session thereby totaling nine weekly sets for the CVS a third group performed four sets per session thereby totaling 12 weekly sets for the Cs all groups trained with 15 to 20 reps to momentary failure each set with 2 minutes of rest between sets weights were increased as subjects got stronger to stay in the 15 to 20 rep range medial gastrus lateral gastrus Solus and the sum of all these was measured before and after the study for all measurements growth tended to be best for the 12 weekly set group followed by the N9 weekly set group and then the six weekly set group with the sum of all measures the 12 weekly set group saw 73.9% greater growth than a six weekly set group and 17.6% greater growth than a 9 weekly set group some differences weren't statistically significant but I've previously discussed how statistical significance is not everything now it's still worth pointing out the six weekly set groups saw respectable gains plus the jump in muscle growth was larger from 6 to 9 weekly sets compared to 9 to 12 weekly sets suggesting diminishing returns so how does this fit into the rest of the research this meta analysis combined the results of multiple other studies examining sets and gains it indeed founds performing nine or more weekly sets for a muscle produced greater growth and fewer than nine weekly sets so the new study perfectly aligns with these results just in case you're confused don't forget we're talking about the total number of sets you perform for each muscle per week for example nine weekly sets for a muscle group such as the quads may include you performing three sets on each the squats leg press and leg extension in a week returning to the meta analysis is it's still worth pointing out that again fewer than nine weekly sets still built muscle so lower set numbers are not useless it's just that you do tend to see better games with more sets summoning the spirit of scientific accuracy we must not forget this new study was done on previously untrained women and did not exceed 12 weekly sets in fact much of the data Behind The Meta analysis was likewise conducted on untrained individuals and did not exceed more than 12 weekly sets per muscle group so what about data in trained individuals and more than 12 weekly sets we've dissected this data in a previous video feel free to check that out but the gist is this trained individuals can likely still grow from fewer than 9 weekly sets but muscle growth does seem to be notably better and potentially even optimized with 12 to 20 weekly sets per muscle group it's not clear if going Beyond 20 weekly sets produces even more growth some studies do not find this but as seen in another one of our videos some research finds in certain cases it can provide additional gains so in general a solid recommendation is to perform at least 9 to 12 weekly sets for each muscle group it is perfectly fine to train with fewer than this if you're not looking to maximize the growth of the muscle or muscles in question also if you're happy to train more in the hope of maximizing your gains pushing nearer to 20 weekly sets or perhaps even beyond for at least some of your master groups could be a worthwhile experiment to see how you respond there are Endless Options of exercises you could select to be in your training program but one factor the length at which a muscle is trained appears to be quite important let us review this new study and then we'll explain this further 42 previously untrained men were recruited to understand the design of this study I need to explain a fact about muscles and a certain training style your muscles are a lot stronger when lowering a weight approximately 40% stronger in general you have probably felt this in any curl the lifting is much harder than the lowering part this fact relates to a certain training style lowering overload training here we'll Define lowering overload training as lowering a weight that would be too heavy or difficult for you to lift how on Earth can you do this well in this new study one group trained of Nordic coals this is a bodyweight hamstring exercise many people aren't strong enough to lift themselves up so the subjects in the study just performed controlled lowering only repetitions subjects progress through a weighted vest a second group performed this bending over seated leg hole how was lowering overload training done with this firstly just remember that the lifting phase of a seated leg hole is where we Bend our knees and the lowering is when we're straightening our knees to make this lowering overlow training subjects perform the lifting of the weight with two legs and then switch to one leg on the lowering face to achieve overloaded lowering for that leg once they finished the reps with this one leg they switched over to train the other leg sets and Reps were equal between both groups it was found that overall hamstrings hypertrophy was 63.6% greater for the seated leg holes muscle length is perhaps the strongest explanation for these findings let me briefly explain L the hamstrings consist of four muscles all cross over the knee joint so bend the knee but three of them also cross the hip joint and this design means they can be stretched more that is at a longer length when the hip is flexed seated leg Coes involve our hips flexed while Nordic Coes involve virtually no hip flexion accordingly these three hamstring muscles are trained at longer muscle lengths with CA leg holes and all three of the heads grew better with this EX exercise as for the muscle the biceps for more short head which is trained at a similar muscle length between both exercises it fascinatingly grew better with a Nordic coal the researchers suggest since Nordic coals may not stimulate the other three hamstring muscles as much the biceps for more short head increases its involvement alternatively it's still possible muscle length plays a roll more precisely as the biceps for moreal short head just crosses the knee it's at a longer length when the knee is straight but at a shorter length when the knee is bent seated leg holes are more challenging when the knee is bent while Nordic HS are most challenging when the knee is straighter the point where the biceps for more short head is at a longer length finally the sorus and gillus muscles also grew better with the Nordic curl you may be unfamiliar with these muscles but they assist the hamstrings in knee Bend but due to their precise Anatomy they are actually trains at a longer length with the Nordic curl so this is a strong explanation for the results so what does this study tell us before addressing what I feel to be the key takeaway some might be curious is lowering overload training any better than normal training the popular mik Menor once suggested it could be but as I've thoroughly examined in a previous video they largely seem to be similar for overall growth with that out the way the key is this study is yet another suggesting training muscles at longer lengths builds more muscle if you've been following the house of hypoy for a while you'll know there's growing research suggesting this we're gradually creating fre ultimate guides to developing each muscle group where we describe the current scientific literature on each muscle and hypothesize what might be the best exercises for them summoning the spirit of scientific accuracy This research is still emerging and developing so it's not definitive proof training muscles at longer lengths produces more growth in all circumstances rather just consider training muscles at longer lengths as a potentially promising strategy that you may wish to try out in your training also all of the studies have currently been done on untrained individuals fortunately though there's upcoming research on trained individuals and we will be updating you with the findings how can you shorten your training sessions your rate while not hurting muscle growth supersets are one proposed way they involve performing two exercises with minimal rest and then resting before performing however many more sets you desire antagonist super sets are quite popular these involve super setting two exercises that train opposing muscle groups such as a biceps and triceps exercise previous research suggests antagonist suets do not hurt your training performance that is you can perform approximately a similar number of total repetitions on your exercises to normal sets even though the work is in a smaller amount of time we also have two studies suggesting antagonist supersets produced similar hypertrophy two normal sets however these two studies just involved two exercises and the subjects were untrained luckily this brand new study examined antagonist supersets with multiple exercises in trained subjects 43 trained individuals were recruited to train these exercises twice per week for 8 weeks four sets of 8 to 12 reps to momentary failure were performed for each exercise every session a normal group performed all sets on one exercise before moving on to the next exercise they rested 2 minutes between sets a superet group suers seted the lap pull down with a Smith machine bench press the leg curl with the leg extension and the biceps curl with the push down it took them around 20 seconds to transition between the supersetted exercises and they rested to minutes between sets this resulted in the training session being approximately 36% shorter training performance was not meaningfully different between both sessions although subjects rated the suets as being harder thus the suets did not reduce the number of reps they could complete to failure even though it felt harder overall for the subjects it was ultimately found muscle growth was similar between both groups strength and endurance gains were also similar between both groups it's worth mentioning the superset group did report more nausea than the normal group but this did reduce over time as a result the researchers suggest slowly introducing supet into your routine for example you may train further from failure on your sup seted exercises or perform fewer total sets and then you progress over time thus if it interests you feel free to experiment with antagonist superet in your program where you feel it can be suitable lastly although there's currently no no direct research on this I would guess non-related superset should also be fine this is where you supet exercises that train non-related muscle groups such as a biceps exercise with a calf exercise considering the conflicting information across the web things can get pretty confusing about how you may

    "title": "Is Constant Tension the Key to Building More Muscle?",
    "published_at": "2021-06-16T13:16:29Z",
    "transcript": "In the bodybuilding world, it's not uncommon\u00a0\nto see a constant tension technique being used. Typically, this is done by avoiding\u00a0\nlocking out the joints in an exercise,\u00a0\u00a0 resulting in the muscle producing continuous\u00a0\ntension for the full duration of a set. It's hypothesized that compared to locking\u00a0\nout the joints in an exercise and allowing\u00a0\u00a0 the muscles to briefly rest, keeping constant\u00a0\ntension on the muscle is a more powerful stimulus. Preventing the muscle from\u00a0\n\"breathing\", so to speak,\u00a0\u00a0 can decrease the oxygen content in muscles\u00a0\nand result in the build of metabolites. Although it's far from crystal clear,\u00a0\nsome research indicates these events\u00a0\u00a0 may play some role in muscle hypertrophy. So, what does the research say - can\u00a0\nconstant tension enhance muscle growth? A study by Goto et al. does suggest that\u00a0\nconstant tension builds more muscle. 44 men with at least 1 year of training experience\u00a0\nwere assigned to a partial or full group. Both groups trained the triceps skull crusher. The full group began with\u00a0\ntheir elbows in full extension,\u00a0\u00a0 lowering the weight to their maximal elbow flexion\u00a0\nangle and then extending back to full extension. The partial group performed the exercise\u00a0\nfrom 45 to 90 degrees of elbow flexion,\u00a0\u00a0 meaning it was a partial range of motion\u00a0\nthat kept constant tension on the triceps. Both groups trained with 3 sets of 8 reps (with an\u00a0\n8-rep max load relative to their range of motion),\u00a0\u00a0 three times per week for 8 weeks. Increases in triceps cross-sectional area\u00a0\u00a0 (measured at 60% of the upper arm length) was\u00a0\nsignificantly greater for the partial group. For the partial group, the researchers also\u00a0\nmeasured the degree of hypoxia experienced by\u00a0\u00a0 the subjects after performing the\u00a0\nconstant tension skull crushers. In this case, hypoxia refers to a\u00a0\ndecrease in muscle oxygen levels. Interestingly, the researchers found\u00a0\na correlation between the degree of\u00a0\u00a0 hypoxia experienced by subjects and their\u00a0\nincrease in triceps cross-sectional area. Put differently, the subjects in the partial group\u00a0\nthat experienced the highest decrease in muscle\u00a0\u00a0 oxygen levels, also experienced the greatest\u00a0\nincreases in triceps cross-sectional area. Now, correlation does not prove causation. But maybe this study suggests a constant\u00a0\ntension can enhance muscle growth\u00a0\u00a0 by creating greater muscle hypoxia. However, this is only one study.\u00a0\u00a0 How does it compare with the rest\u00a0\nof the constant tension research? Pinto et al. had a comparable study\u00a0\ndesign to the Goto et al. study. 30 untrained men were assigned\u00a0\nto a partial or full group. Both groups trained the preacher curl\u00a0\nfor around 2-4 sets with 8-20 reps,\u00a0\u00a0 twice per week for 10 weeks. The full group performed the exercise\u00a0\nfrom 0 to 130 degrees of elbow flexion\u00a0\u00a0 (more or less a full range of motion). The partial group performed the exercise\u00a0\nfrom 50 to 100 degrees of elbow flexion,\u00a0\u00a0 meaning it was a partial range of motion\u00a0\nthat kept constant tension on the biceps. Increases in biceps thickness\u00a0\nfavored the full group. So, this study suggests a full range of motion\u00a0\nis superior to a partial range of motion\u00a0\u00a0 that applies constant tension. Therefore, this study somewhat directly\u00a0\nconflicts with the Goto et al. study. So, collectively, these two studies\u00a0\ncannot provide us with a clear view\u00a0\u00a0 of the effectiveness of a partial range\u00a0\nof motion that applies constant tension. There actually is another study that\u00a0\nused a constant tension technique\u00a0\u00a0 through a partial range of motion, but I'll\u00a0\ndetail this towards the end of the video. Moving on, although the studies by Goto and Pinto\u00a0\u00a0 did use a constant tension, they did so by\u00a0\nsignificantly reducing the range of motion. It is possible to use a constant tension without\u00a0\nsignificantly reducing the range of motion. A study by Tanimoto et al. explored\u00a0\nthe effectiveness of doing just this. 24 untrained men were assigned to\u00a0\nconstant tension or normal group. Both groups trained the same 5 exercises:\u00a0\nmachine squat, chest press, lat pulldown,\u00a0\u00a0 abdominal crunch, and back extension. Each for\u00a0\n3 sets of repetitions to failure each session. The normal group performed each exercise\u00a0\nwith a full range of motion, using an 85-90%\u00a0\u00a0 one-rep max load and a 1-second lifting,\u00a0\n1-second lowering, and 1-second pause phase. The pause phase enabled the\u00a0\nsubjects to rest the muscle. With these variables, this\u00a0\ngroup ultimately performed\u00a0\u00a0 around 8 repetitions to failure each set. The constant tension group avoided\u00a0\nlocking out the joints in the squat,\u00a0\u00a0 chest press, and lat pulldown, resulting in\u00a0\nconstant tension. They used a 50-60% one-rep\u00a0\u00a0 max load and a 3-second lifting and 3-second\u00a0\nlowering phase, there was no pause phase. The no pause phase meant that the\u00a0\nabdominal crunch and back extension\u00a0\u00a0 was also performed with constant tension. Interestingly, with these variables,\u00a0\u00a0 this group also ultimately performed\u00a0\naround 8 repetitions to failure each set. Now, some may be thinking\u00a0\nthe use of different loads\u00a0\u00a0 and repetition tempos between\u00a0\ngroups is confounding. However, research indicates loads\u00a0\nthat allow you to perform between 5\u00a0\u00a0 to 35 repetitions to failure each set are\u00a0\nsimilarly effective for building muscle. Furthermore, repetition durations\u00a0\nlasting from 0.5 seconds,\u00a0\u00a0 all the way up to 8 seconds, are also\u00a0\nsimilarly effective for building muscle. Therefore, the use of different loads and\u00a0\nrepetition tempos is probably not an issue. On to the results: both groups experienced\u00a0\nstatistically similar increases in thickness\u00a0\u00a0 for the chest, biceps, triceps, abdominal,\u00a0\nsub scapula, quadriceps, and hamstrings. Now, some percentages seem to favor the\u00a0\nnormal group. But, bear in mind, the\u00a0\u00a0 percentages are average. Given the results were\u00a0\nstatistically similar between groups both groups,\u00a0\u00a0 the variation within each group was greater\u00a0\nthan the variation between both groups. Therefore, we can only suggest\u00a0\nthat using a constant tension\u00a0\u00a0 that does not significantly reduce range\u00a0\nof motion produced similar increases in\u00a0\u00a0 measures of muscle growth to\u00a0\na normal full range of motion. A second study by Tanimoto et\u00a0\nal. supports these findings. 16 untrained men were assigned to\u00a0\na constant tension or normal group. Both groups trained the leg extension\u00a0\u00a0 for 3 sets of repetitions to failure,\u00a0\nthree times per week for 12 weeks. The constant tension group performed the\u00a0\nexercise from 90 to 0 degrees of knee flexion,\u00a0\u00a0 used a 50% one-rep max load and a 3-second lifting\u00a0\nand 3-second lowering phase without any pauses. This actually resulted in constant\u00a0\ntension on the quadriceps. This is because the leg extension is somewhat\u00a0\nunique, locking out the knee in this movement\u00a0\u00a0 still results in considerable quadriceps\u00a0\ntension. Moreover, at the bottom of the exercise,\u00a0\u00a0 so long as you don't pause, your\u00a0\nquadriceps are still contracting. Therefore, the constant tension group\u00a0\nwas able to achieve a constant tension\u00a0\u00a0 while still performing a near full\u00a0\nrange of motion on the leg extension. The normal group also performed the movement from\u00a0\n90 to 0 degrees of knee flexion. But they used an\u00a0\u00a0 80% one-rep max load, with a 1-second lifting,\u00a0\n1-second lowering, and a 1-second pause phase. This pause phase at the end of repetition\u00a0\u00a0 allowed the subjects to momentarily rest\u00a0\nand take tension off the quadriceps. Increases in quadriceps cross-sectional area\u00a0\nwere statistically similar between both groups. To summarize, when using a constant tension that\u00a0\ndoes not significantly reduce range of motion,\u00a0\u00a0 the current evidence suggests it is similarly\u00a0\neffective to a full range of motion. When using a partial range of motion that applies\u00a0\na constant tension, the research isn't clear. Goto et al. suggest it is superior\u00a0\nto a full range of motion,\u00a0\u00a0 whereas Pinto et al. suggests it is\u00a0\ninferior to a full range of motion. However, these aren't the only two studies\u00a0\u00a0 exploring the effectiveness of a partial\u00a0\nrange of motion that uses constant tension. In the last video, we detailed a\u00a0\nfascinating new study by Pedrosa et al.\u00a0\u00a0 finding that a leg extension performed with a\u00a0\npartial range of motion at long muscle lengths,\u00a0\u00a0 produced greater muscle growth than\u00a0\na full range of motion leg extension. A partial range of motion at long muscle lengths\u00a0\u00a0 is technically a constant tension\u00a0\ntechnique a lot of the time. Therefore, this might suggest that a constant\u00a0\ntension technique, that is applied via a\u00a0\u00a0 partial range of motion at long lengths,\u00a0\ncould be the optimal way to build muscle. If you're interested in more details\u00a0\nregarding the Pedrosa et al. study,\u00a0\u00a0 I highly recommend you check out the video on it. Nevertheless, as discussed in that video, more\u00a0\nresearch is without a doubt required before fully\u00a0\u00a0 concluding that a partial range of motion at long\u00a0\nmuscle lengths is the optimal way to build muscle."

    "title": "The Pump Is the BEST Indicator for Hypertrophy (True or False?)",
    "published_at": "2022-02-10T12:00:11Z",
    "transcript": "Anyone that's resistance-trained\u00a0\nmost likely has felt the pump. Simply, it's where the whole\u00a0\nmuscle temporarily increases\u00a0\u00a0 in size due to an accumulation of fluid within it. During muscle contraction, veins carrying blood\u00a0\nfrom the muscle to the heart get compressed,\u00a0\u00a0 whereas arteries continue to deliver\u00a0\nblood to the muscle from the heart,\u00a0\u00a0 fundamentally producing a build-up of plasma\u00a0\nwithin and around muscle fibers, evoking the pump. Moreover, the build-up of metabolites as a result\u00a0\nof chemical reactions within muscle fibers, like\u00a0\u00a0 lactate, can draw additional fluid into the muscle\u00a0\nfiber, thereby further intensifying the pump. An optimal pump can be accomplished by ensuring\u00a0\nmuscle activation is high enough to meaningfully\u00a0\u00a0 compress the veins carrying blood from the muscle\u00a0\nto the heart, and ensuring that you're performing\u00a0\u00a0 numerous or long-lasting contractions with\u00a0\nminimal rest to enable more fluid accumulation. However, is optimally evoking a pump even\u00a0\nnecessary for maximizing hypertrophy? Let's find out. Firstly, muscle fiber swelling (that is,\u00a0\u00a0 the enlargement of a muscle fiber due to\u00a0\nfluid accumulation, which occurs during\u00a0\u00a0 the pump) has been mechanistically\u00a0\nassociated with muscle fiber growth. More precisely,\u00a0\u00a0 osmosensors within muscle fibers can detect\u00a0\nthe build-up of fluid that produces swelling.\u00a0\u00a0 Such swelling may be considered a threat to the\u00a0\nintegrity of the fiber, thus initiating anabolic\u00a0\u00a0 and anticatabolic pathways that ultimately\u00a0\nhypertrophy the muscle fiber for reinforcement. Indeed, some areas of the literature\u00a0\nmay potentially be used as evidence\u00a0\u00a0 to suggest a greater pump means more hypertrophy. A drop set involves performing repetitions\u00a0\nto failure with a given load and then\u00a0\u00a0 immediately reducing the load (typically\u00a0\nby 15-25%) and performing repetitions to\u00a0\u00a0 failure again. Generally, one to three\u00a0\nload reductions are done. Moreover,\u00a0\u00a0 multiple drop sets for a given exercise can\u00a0\nbe performed with rest intervals between them. Due to the numerous bouts of repetitions\u00a0\nto failure performed back to back,\u00a0\u00a0 fluid accumulation is going to be much\u00a0\ngreater compared to performing normal\u00a0\u00a0 sets that have you rest between repetition bouts. As detailed in our drop set video,\u00a0\nwith isolation exercises at least,\u00a0\u00a0 some evidence suggests drop sets\u00a0\nmight confer greater hypertrophy. More precisely, Varovic et al.\u00a0\ncompared how performing 2-5 drop\u00a0\u00a0 sets per session on the leg extension,\u00a0\ninterspersed with 120 seconds of rest,\u00a0\u00a0 with each drop consisting of repetitions\u00a0\nto failure with 2 load reductions\u00a0\u00a0 compared to performing 2-5 sets of repetitions to\u00a0\nfailure on the leg extension, with 120 seconds of\u00a0\u00a0 rest between sets. It was found quadriceps growth\u00a0\nwas overall greater with the drop set training. Fink et al. compared a drop set consisting of\u00a0\nrepetitions to failure with 3 load reductions\u00a0\u00a0 to performing 3 sets of repetitions\u00a0\nto failure on the triceps pushdown.\u00a0\u00a0 It was found triceps hypertrophy\u00a0\nwas greater with drop set training. Consequently, although neither study directly\u00a0\nexamined it, it's possible the greater\u00a0\u00a0 pumps achieved with drop set training\u00a0\ncould explain the greater hypertrophy. Using shorter rest intervals between normal\u00a0\nsets would also evoke a greater pump,\u00a0\u00a0 as the lessened rest heightens\u00a0\nthe factors that drive the pump. As examined in our rest\u00a0\ninterval ultimate guide video,\u00a0\u00a0 the research on the optimal rest interval duration\u00a0\nwith isolation exercises isn't crystal clear. But, one study by Fink et al. found when\u00a0\nperforming sets on three triceps and\u00a0\u00a0 three biceps isolation exercises per session,\u00a0\nresting for 30 seconds between sets produced\u00a0\u00a0 greater arm cross-sectional area increases\u00a0\ncompared to resting 3 minutes between sets. It's plausible the greater pump with short rest\u00a0\nintervals could be the cause of more hypertrophy. Using a constant tension technique, which is\u00a0\nwhere you avoid locking out the joints involved\u00a0\u00a0 in an exercise during your repetitions, due to\u00a0\nforbidding intermittent muscle relaxation between\u00a0\u00a0 repetitions, would sustain higher compression of\u00a0\nveins and probably higher metabolite accumulation\u00a0\u00a0 versus performing repetitions where\u00a0\nyou more or less lock the joints out. One study by Goto et al. compared partial\u00a0\nrange of motion skull crushers that kept\u00a0\u00a0 a constant tension on the triceps to\u00a0\nfull range of motion skullcrushers.\u00a0\u00a0 Triceps cross-sectional area gains were greater\u00a0\nwith the constant tension skullcrushers.\u00a0\u00a0 Perhaps the greater pump with a constant\u00a0\ntension explains these findings. Finally, one study by Hirono et al. actually found\u00a0\na correlation between the pump and hypertrophy. Subjects trained leg extensions with 3 sets\u00a0\nof 8 repetitions with an 80% one-rep max load,\u00a0\u00a0 using 60 seconds of rest between\u00a0\nsets, 3 times per week for 6 weeks. During the first session, immediately, 5\u00a0\nminutes, 10 minutes, and 15 minutes after it,\u00a0\u00a0 quadriceps thickness was measured. This was\u00a0\nconsidered a measure of muscle swelling. 3 to 7 days after the final training session on\u00a0\nthe 6th week, muscle thickness was also measured,\u00a0\u00a0 but this measure was considered\u00a0\nan indicator of hypertrophy. Ultimately, the researchers found\u00a0\ncorrelations between the magnitude\u00a0\u00a0 of muscle swelling measured at all\u00a0\ntime points after the first training\u00a0\u00a0 session and the amount of hypertrophy\u00a0\nexperienced by the end of the study. Put another way, the subjects that saw\u00a0\nthe greatest pump of their quadriceps\u00a0\u00a0 after the first session, ultimately seemed to\u00a0\nexperience the greatest quadriceps hypertrophy. Although, it's worth pointing out the correlations\u00a0\nwere not super strong. The Spearman coefficient\u00a0\u00a0 ranged from 0.4-0.6. 1 is what would indicate\u00a0\na perfect positive linear relationship. So, some areas of the drop set, rest interval,\u00a0\u00a0 and constant tension literature, as well as\u00a0\na correlational study potentially suggest\u00a0\u00a0 training in a way that produces a\u00a0\ngreater pump evokes more hypertrophy. However, are there other areas of the\u00a0\nliterature that go against this conclusion? There are. Let us assess this data\u00a0\nand then come to some conclusions. Jenkins et al. had subjects, on different\u00a0\ndays, perform 3 sets of repetitions to\u00a0\u00a0 failure with either a 30% one-rep max load\u00a0\nor 80% one-rep max load, and immediately\u00a0\u00a0 measured quadriceps cross-sectional area\u00a0\nafter (as an indicator of muscle swelling). Quadriceps cross-sectional was greater\u00a0\nafter using a 30% one-rep max load. This makes sense, when training to or\u00a0\nclose to failure, using lighter loads\u00a0\u00a0 requires you to perform a higher number of\u00a0\nrepetitions compared to using heavier loads.\u00a0\u00a0 Higher repetitions produce longer vein compression\u00a0\nand subsequently higher fluid accumulation.\u00a0\u00a0 Higher repetitions also likely permit\u00a0\nhigher metabolite accumulation. Here's the thing, however, there's a\u00a0\nsubstantial number of studies indicating\u00a0\u00a0 when repetitions are performed to\u00a0\nor near failure, training with 30%\u00a0\u00a0 one-rep max loads produces similar muscle\u00a0\nhypertrophy to 80% one-rep max loads,\u00a0\u00a0 suggesting that the greater pump achieved with\u00a0\nlighter loads does not mean more hypertrophy. Moving on, even though we've established\u00a0\nsome areas of the rest interval and constant\u00a0\u00a0 tension literature potentially indicating the\u00a0\ngreater the pump the more muscle hypertrophy,\u00a0\u00a0 other areas of these two sets of\u00a0\nthe literature suggest otherwise. Exploring the rest of interval literature first,\u00a0\u00a0 and as thoroughly examined in our\u00a0\nrest interval ultimate guide video,\u00a0\u00a0 a few studies demonstrate with compound exercises\u00a0\nand all other variables constant, resting\u00a0\u00a0 2.5 minutes or more between sets produces more\u00a0\nhypertrophy than resting for 90 seconds or less. As it's more than likely resting for 2.5 or more\u00a0\u00a0 minutes between sets evokes a lower pump\u00a0\ncompared to resting 90 seconds or less,\u00a0\u00a0 this data indicates the pump may not\u00a0\nbe tightly associated with hypertrophy. As for the constant tension literature,\u00a0\ndespite the aforementioned Goto et al. study,\u00a0\u00a0 a different study by Pinto et al. compared\u00a0\npartial range of motion preacher curls that\u00a0\u00a0 kept constant tension on the biceps\u00a0\nto full range of motion preacher curls\u00a0\u00a0 and found no statistically significant differences\u00a0\nin biceps thickness gains between the two. Two studies by Tanimoto et al., with a\u00a0\nrange of exercises, compared how using a\u00a0\u00a0 constant tension technique compared to simply\u00a0\nlocking out the involved joints. Increases\u00a0\u00a0 in thickness gains of various muscles were not\u00a0\nstatistically different between the two methods. Consequently, these three studies fail to\u00a0\nsupport the notion that a constant tension\u00a0\u00a0 (and thus a greater pump)\u00a0\nproduces more hypertrophy. The final area of the literature worth\u00a0\nsharing that questions the pump's strong\u00a0\u00a0 association with hypertrophy is the\u00a0\nblood flow restriction literature. Blood flow restriction training is where some\u00a0\nform of pressure (typically via a tourniquet\u00a0\u00a0 cuff) is applied to the upper arms or legs\u00a0\nduring an exercise. When correctly done,\u00a0\u00a0 this partially constricts the arteries\u00a0\ncarrying blood from the heart to the muscle,\u00a0\u00a0 but completely constricts the veins\u00a0\ncarrying blood from the muscle to the heart. Blood flow restriction is likely best\u00a0\nused when performing repetitions to or\u00a0\u00a0 close to failure with loads\u00a0\nat or below 50% one-rep max. The numerous repetitions required to achieve\u00a0\nor near failure with these light loads,\u00a0\u00a0 as well as the complete compressions of veins\u00a0\nvia the pressure, would evoke a great pump. This type of blood flow restriction\u00a0\ntraining, when compared to non-blood\u00a0\u00a0 flow restriction with heavier loads (and thus\u00a0\nfewer repetitions), produces a much greater pump. Yet, a meta-analysis by Lixandrao et al.\u00a0\nfound blood flow restriction training\u00a0\u00a0 with loads between 20-40% one-rep\u00a0\nmax ultimately produces similar\u00a0\u00a0 hypertrophy to non-blood flow restriction\u00a0\ntraining with 70-90% one-rep max loads. Consequently, this data indicates a greater\u00a0\npump does not necessarily mean more hypertrophy. Summarizing the current literature,\u00a0\nalthough some areas may lead one to believe\u00a0\u00a0 a greater pump means more hypertrophy,\u00a0\nnumerous other areas suggest otherwise. As such, I think it's fair to\u00a0\nsay achieving a greater pump\u00a0\u00a0 more than likely does not mean you'll\u00a0\nexperience more muscle hypertrophy. Now, this does not necessarily mean\u00a0\nthe pump plays no role in hypertrophy. Just because more of something (the pump in this\u00a0\ncase) does not produce more of another thing\u00a0\u00a0 (hypertrophy in this case), we cannot definitively\u00a0\nconclude there is no causation at all. It\u2019s possible some small degree\u00a0\nof the events associated with a\u00a0\u00a0 pump can be directly causative of\u00a0\nsome small amounts of hypertrophy.\u00a0\u00a0 After all, recall there are mechanisms by\u00a0\nwhich cell swelling could cause hypertrophy. But even so, it's clear an individual need\u00a0\u00a0 not train in a way that maximizes\u00a0\nthe pump to maximize hypertrophy. But, I still feel there are other\u00a0\nareas where the pump can be useful. For one, remember that high muscle activation\u00a0\nis one prerequisite for achieving a great pump,\u00a0\u00a0 as it meaningfully compresses veins. Thus,\u00a0\u00a0 the pump can be considered a solid indicator\u00a0\nof what muscle/muscle regions you're training. For example, let's say you're performing pull-ups,\u00a0\u00a0 but you tend to significantly\u00a0\nround your shoulders near the top.\u00a0\u00a0 After altering this such that you maintain a\u00a0\nmore retracted shoulder position at the top,\u00a0\u00a0 you notice a greater pump in your upper back and\u00a0\nperhaps lats. In this scenario, I think it's not\u00a0\u00a0 unreasonable to assume this change of technique\u00a0\nprobably resulted in you better recruiting the\u00a0\u00a0 upper back and lats, which is a good thing if\u00a0\nthat's what you'd like to do with pull-ups. Finally, the pump can be a very\u00a0\nenjoyable part of training.\u00a0\u00a0 I'll leave you with the\u00a0\neverlasting words of Arnold"

    "published_at": "2023-06-12T11:00:00Z",
    "transcript": "welcome to the house of hypertrophy are you leaving games on the table if you're not training to failure a new analysis has explored the relationship between proximity to failure and muscle hypertrophy and some influencers say this paper proves training to failure is necessary for maximizing hypertrophy but I feel there are some critical details people are missing before dissecting this it's worth knowing prior to this new meta regression there have been three meta-analyzes in the last three years combining the results of the overall literature all finding no significant difference in muscle hypertrophy between training to failure and not training to failure an issue with these meta-analyzes is they simply compare training to failure versus non-failure non-failure is vague are we talking about one rep from failure two six eight or even 10 reps from failure this is where the new meta regression comes into play it's evaluated how precisely different proximities to failure impact hypertrophy now this meta-aggression is currently a pre-print it's not officially published or peer-reviewed changes to the paper can still be made and if any notable changes do occur I'll have an update nonetheless let's dive into the current contents of the paper foreign the new analysis collected all the studies that compared how different proximities to failure influence muscle hypertrophy for the groups that did not train to failure various estimations were made to calculate how many reps in reserve they left that is how many reps away from failure did they stop here are the average trading variables used in the studies analyzed ultimately the results indicate that muscle hypertrophy improves non-linearly as you get closer to failure this is largely the only thing you see across social media since the analysis finds greater hypertrophy with failure people have concluded failure is necessary for maximizing growth however the researchers actually detailed some interesting additional analyzes and importantly there are limitations foreign the researchers established an interaction with load with heavier loads there was less of a benefit of training narrative failure versus with lighter loads this might be quite logical narrowing failure ensures you're recruiting as many muscle fibers as you possibly can but heavier loads contrary to lighter loads readily necessitate high levels of muscle fiber recruitment in general so getting narrative failure could be less important nonetheless the researchers also outlined a range of moderators most notably in my view higher frequency of training a muscle group higher set numbers per muscle group and longer study durations with each of these moderators there was less of a benefit of training to failure in fact null Point estimates were within the confidence interval in layman's terms this leaves the potential possibility that there truly isn't a benefit to failure [Music] this new meta regression is the most comprehensive analysis of how different proximities to failure influences hyperture based on the current scientific literature at the very least this analysis only further reinforces the notion nearing failure is crucial for hypertrophy but does it as per the main analysis prove training to failure truly maximizes hypertrophy I don't believe this analysis can prove this and the researchers themselves allude to this there are inherent limitations to the existing body of literature on training to failure the definition of failure differs between studies some use the definition of momentary muscular failure While others know concentric failure but some just State volitional failure which is a lot vager recall we had moderators which meant the benefit of training to failure became less I've yet to mention that studies using a definition of failure such as momentary muscular failure or concentric failure were classed as a moderator that is in these studies the benefit of training to failure was less another consideration is the majority of the studies did not report how many reps in reserve the subjects not training to failure left meaning the researchers had to use a variety of equations to estimate reps in reserve I think the authors did as good of a job as they could have done but the estimates are simply far from laser accurate take this study by martorelli we'll focus on two groups both training the barbell biceps curl one group performed three sets of repetitions to momentary muscular failure with a 70 one rep max load per session another group performed three sets of seven reps with a 70 one rep max load per session how many reps in reserve was this well the authors of the meta-aggression considered that before the study the subjects were able to perform a maximum average of 10.37 repetitions with the 70 one Remax load thus they subtracted this from Seven meaning that this second group was estimated to be leaving 3.37 repetitions in reserve this is virtually the best single reps in reserve estimate you can give but it's not going to be laser accurate remember the subjects were performing three sets in a session the first set of seven reps likely was equal to an average of leaving 3.37 reps in reserve but the next two sets due to cumulative fatigue we're likely slightly closer to failure another consideration is that the researchers of this study only updated to 70 one rep max load during the fifth week so subjects were training with the exact same load for five weeks you get stronger as you train and so although before the study the subjects could only perform an average of 10.37 reps with this Baseline 70 one rep max load they would have been able to perform more than this as time progressed across the five weeks and thus the Reps and Reserve estimate of 3.37 would have been too low across time at least with the first set the researchers quite interestingly also included a range of studies using alternative set structures in their analysis such as cluster and resp poor sets and the equations used to estimate reps and reserves with some of these alternative set structures were also likely far from laser accurate all in all I think it may not have been worth including alternative set structures in this analysis since they are physiologically not identical to normal sets but the data from the moderator analysis section implies the inclusion of the alternative set structure studies didn't drastically impact the results nevertheless the limitations of this analysis simply preclude us from concluding it proves failure is superior we need studies that more consistently use better definitions of failure and provide better estimates of reps in reserve it's entirely possible that as time goes by and we amass high quality individual studies on training to failure versus not training to failure we'll find different results from the new analysis only time will tell [Music] due to the various limitations associated with the new meta regression I still believe analyzing individual studies specifically ones that are high quality is worthwhile this 2020 study by santianello is in my view the single best study to date on training to failure 14 men with an average of 5.1 years of training experience were recruited subjects trained both the unilateral leg press and unilateral leg extension twice per week for 10 weeks a great thing was the researchers individualized set numbers the researchers noted how many sets per week the subjects perform for their quadriceps before the study and then the subjects perform 20 more for this study for example if a subject performed 15 weekly sets for the quadriceps before the study they would now be performing 18 weekly sets a 20 increase for the quarter steps in this study evenly divided between the leg press and leg extension with one leg subjects performed every set with repetitions to momentary muscular failure with their the leg they performed repetitions till what the subjects perceived to be just prior to failure with this leg an average of 1.6 fuel reps were performed versus the failure leg suggesting this non-philia leg left 1.6 reps in reserve but it probably fluctuated between one to three reps in reserve based on the standard deviations however remember people's legs aren't always equally as strong so these estimates are broad the number of dominant legs was counterbalanced between the failure and non-failure conditions the fact each subject performed both protocols with either leg is also another strength of the study because this removes genetics and outside lifestyle from interfering with the study's findings ultimately vastus lateralis cross-sectional area increases were not significantly different between both legs interestingly the raw gains somewhat lean towards the non-failure leg so the strongest single study to date on training to failure indicates it isn't necessary for maximizing hypertrophy there are two other fairly high quality studies in my eyes all beer on untrained vigils further suggesting similar hypertrophy between training to failure and stopping shy or failure if you're searching for additional ideas about programming for muscle hypertrophy the alpha progression app can help it has an exceptionally flexible custom workout generator that uses trading variables based on meta-analities and reviews from the scientific literature specify your training experience the equipment you have and how often and how long you want to train for you can still individualize things further by editing things to your preference the app also provides neat graphs displaying your long-term progression and there's a database of 550 exercises the link in the comments and description allows you to try everything on the app entirely for free for two weeks and if you like it and go beyond the link gives you 20 off a subscription we don't just partner with anyone at the house of hypertrophy so rest assured the app is great [Music] the new meta regression is a great addition to the scientific research on training to failure but there are limitations and considerations and I believe we should still consider high quality individual studies when we do this I think it's most level-headed to conclude that training narrative failure is absolutely an important variable for building muscle but for the time being at least I don't believe we can undoubtedly say training to failure is superior rather I think sticking to the general recommendation of getting three or fewer reps from failure and this includes going to failure if you wish is most sensible feel free to experiment and decipher how to implement this in your training of course including both failure and non-failure training in your program can certainly be done moreover as many of you are probably thinking there is certainly value in having good experience with training to failure because if you've never trained to failure how do you know if you've left two reps in reserve finally other factors can interact with your decision for example we've previously seen at the house of hypertrophy that higher frequency or higher volume training can be viable for building muscle and with these it may be easier to predominantly leave reps in reserve contrastingly if you're using lower frequencies and or volumes predominantly going to failure you may be more straightforward finally the current research isn't ample enough to truly delineate the effects of proximity to failure on compound versus isolation exercises but many find it practical to leave reps in a reserve with larger compound exercises such as squats and bench presses and go to failure with smaller isolation exercises like curls and lateral raises there are some other fascinating things related to training to failure we've yet to discuss such as whether individual differences could exist and if more sets further from failure can produce similar hypertrophy to fewer sets closer to failure furthermore it seems there's another individual study in the works on trained individuals comparing training to momentary muscular failure to leaving reps in reserve we will be covering these things in the upcoming weeks and months at the house of hypertrophy

    "transcript": "[Music] welcome to the house of hypertrophy is it true that lifting weights is a waste of time for maximizing muscle growth and that instead static holds in the contracted position followed by slowly lowering the weight is the secret no doubt it's a bold claim and it's one made by Mike Miner as well as indirectly by Arthur Jones who was the founder of the hit training system Mena States I have come to discover that lifting weight is is a waste of time the positive portion of any exercise the lifting of the weight is the least for Ive in terms of stimulating and increase author Jones States the negative part of work Steve is by far the most productive and the most important part of exercise and when you leave the negative work out of exercise you have little or nothing of benefit left you may be wondering how on Earth you would use this information to help your training there are a few ways Mike menes describes his approach with my clients I have been putting a heavier weight than normal on the leg extension machine a weight considerably heavier than they can handle for 6 to 10 reps to failure I help them into the straight L contracted position and they hold it there for as long as they can literally and then I emphasize now start to lower it very slowly under control reset psychologically and let's do one more besides leg extensions leg Coes lat pull Downs pull-ups chinups lateral raises and biceps Coes are exercises where this method can be done this method May sometimes require a partner to assist you with lifting the load into the static hold position but if we forget about performing The static hold all together there are some creative ways you can challenge yourself more in the lowering part of an exercise without a partner before quickly describing these some of you may be wondering about just slowing down the lowering part of normal training the thing is your muscles are approximately 40% stronger during the lowering phase so although slowing down the lowering part of normal training provides a greater challenge throughout the lowering you're still going to be held back by your lifting strength so it's not quite optimally challenging the lowering part even so we will discuss if you should slow down the lowering part with normal training later on in this video nonetheless here are the methods that more effectively challenge the lowering parts starting with lowering only many people are not strong enough to perform the lifting part of Nordic cods and reverse Nordic CS so just training the lowering part is highly challenging the same applies to pull-ups and chin-ups if you're not strong enough to lift yourself up yet just training the lowering of the movement can be challenging you can even use weighted pull-ups or chin-ups with a load you're not strong enough to lift so that you're just challenging yourself on the lowering portion we also have the two1 method where you lift the load with two limbs but then switch to lowering with only one limb thereby providing a greater challenge in the lowering pot for that limb this can be done with a range of exercises leg extensions leg HS seated rows chest presses landmine rows and landmine presses finally there's the more risky cheat method where you use momentum and cheat to lift the load and then you control the lowering portion there are also special machines that provide a greater challenge in the lowering part such as flywheel devices but I'm assuming the majority of people don't have access to this but the information in this video certainly applies to these special machines too so should you be implementing any of these methods into your program can it unlock a new level of gains and elevate your physique to new heights well both Mena and Jones provide their anecdotes I had one client start up with Me 3 and 1/2 months ago he couldn't do the whole stack on the leg extension for even one rep but after two months he was up to the whole stack for 14 reps then he hit a sticking point he couldn't go beyond 14 Reps for three workouts this was when I started working with the idea of static contracted holes and lowering for two or three workouts in a row all he did was hold a very heavy weight in the straight leg position and lowered it doing it two times in that fashion as I described the next workout we went back to see if there was a carry over to the positive strength and his his leg extensions went up to 20 reps that's a phenomenal Improvement Mena goes on to say and I'm I'm not exaggerating when I say that this is literally one of the most stunning discoveries in recent bodybuilding science author Jones States uh in We did an experiment at the military academy at Westport in 1975 the Bengals a professional football team from Cincinnati had hired a football player uh they' signed him up to a contract had given him an $80,000 bonus the man weighed 286 lb and one of his tests in order to be accepted was he had to Chin himself a certain number of times you know do a pull up on a bar this man couldn't begin to Chin himself 12 days prior to his reporting for the training camp they sent him to us in in desperation and said make this man capable of chinning himself otherwise we're going to blow our 880,000 we've given him the 80,000 he spent it it's gone if he can't chin himself we're going to have to drop him so do something please you got 12 days to do it well you know we take him to a chinning bar he reaches up he grabs a hold of the bar he tries to pull and nothing happens so what do you do well you can't train him in a positive manner he's incapable of pulling himself up so we put him on a bench in the top position and then we removed the bench and told him to lower himself the first time we did it he went zaap to the floor he just about yanked his arms out by the roots he couldn't even do a negative chin he couldn't lower himself so we held him up we stood under him held him by the Bucks and gave him assistance so that he could do part of the negative work 12 days later he was tested he did 4 and 3/4 's chins in a normal fashion pulling himself up and lowering himself down pulling himself back up he didn't quite get five but that was more than enough to pass his test although these anecdotes from Mena and Jones are highly fascinating by no means do they sincerely prove the superiority of the methodology these are just two individual anecdotes no comparisons with other training were made and muscle growth wasn't measured fortunately the scientific research has come a long way since Mena and Jones made statements and the literature Can Shed light onto whether Mena and Jones were on to something sit back and relax as we dissect the science on this fascinating topic we'll get to the bottom of how muscle growth Compares between the lifting and lowering portions if any of the methods outlined are superior and we'll also learn about some underrated facts about how muscles generate force and adapt to [Music] training before deconstructing how growth May compare between the lifting and lowering portions I would like to dissect the first part of men's recommendation specifically which involves a static hold at the most contracted position in other words an isometric at the contracted position Mena believe this to be powerful obviously the only place that you can achieve a maximum contraction would be in the fully contracted position that is the only position of the exercise where 100% of the muscular bulk can be activated we have research verifying that static holds near the contracted position indeed stimulate hypertrophy however there is nothing Superior about this in fact the same research finds that holding static contractions at more lengthened muscle positions generates more muscle hypertrophy the research on partial range of motions further supports this notion that is partial range of motions at lengthened muscle positions tend to build more muscle than partial range of motions at contracted positions for example this 2014 paper compared leg extensions with a partial at lengthen positions to contracted positions and vastest lateralis growth was better with the lengthened partials another 2021 Japanese paper compared preach chos with a partial at lengthened positions to contracted positions and combined biceps and brachialis growth was better with the lengthened partials in fact regular viewers of the House of hypertrophy will know that emerging research specifically three Studies have found that a partial range of motion at lengthened muscle positions built more muscle overall compared to a full range of motion more research is required to verify if partials at lengthened positions are always more Superior to a full range of motion regardless all of this data would indicate that although static holes at the contracted position do evoke muscle hypertrophy there's nothing special about it why could this be after all Mensa said the contracted position was the only position of the exercise where 100% of the muscle bolt can be activated well Mena wasn't quite correct when the muscle is fully contracted and you're squeezing it you shouldn't confuse the feeling as an indicator of the actual forces being generated by the muscle fibers muscles generate Force thanks to their sarom which are the force generating units of muscles here's how a sarom looks force is generated when things called the me heads extend from the me filament and pull on the actin filament towards the mline these forces are transmitted to the tendon causing the muscle to pull on the bone when the muscle is shortened fully sometimes the sarcomas can be excessively shortened to the point where many M and heads cannot extend and attach to the acting filaments to generate Force another Factor we need to consider is your central nervous system that's the CNS which is your brain and spinal cord remember muscles produce force in the first place thanks to the electrical signals they receive from the CNS it may come as a surprise to some but most people CNS cannot fully access 100% of a muscle Force produced reducing potential there is some degree of deficit for example this study found subjects could only access 84.5% of the quadriceps maximum Force producing potential whereas it was 95% for the elbow flexes and carves these are called your voluntary activation levels quite interestingly a couple of studies indicate voluntary activation may be higher at more lengthened positions in other words your CNS has an easier time accessing the force producing potential of your muscle fibers at lengthened positions a final Factor we need to consider is passive forces besides the myosin and active interactions that generate force your muscles have structures that can generate Force when they are stretched such as Titan which is within the sarcomere itself this is a passive force and rubber bands can help you conceptualize this when you stretch a rubber band it produces passive Force to resist the stretch and when you let go of it that passive Force snaps it back into its original shape Titan operates in the same way generating passive forces when stretched all these three reasons tell us why the most contracted position isn't necessarily the position where the muscle produces the most force or where 100% of the muscle bulk is activated now although all this research outlined indicates that static holes in the most contracted position aren't special this doesn't discount men's method yet because remember the static hold is just one part the second part is controlling the lowering parts of the movement this raises the question are Mena and Jones correct is the lowering part the most productive with lifting being a waste of time and providing little benefits a paper from Japan provides a fascinating insight into how growth May compare between the lifting and lowering of an exercise 53 previously untrained individuals were assigned to a lifting only lowering only normal group or control group The control group did nothing and expectedly made no gains so we'll ignore them all the other groups train the preach Ur with a partial range of motion at the lengthened position two times per week for 5 weeks the lifting only group just performed the lifting motion with an investigator placing the weight back to the start the lowering only group just performed the lowering motion with an investigator placing the weight back at the top a normal group performed both the lifting and lowering portions as you normally would all three three groups perform three sets of 10 repetitions with the same dumbbell load the dumbbell load was progressed from 30 to 100% of their maximum isometric strength it was found elbow flexor growth consisting of the biceps and brachialis increased the most in the normal and lowering only groups with minimal gain seen from the lifting group at face value these results indicate the lowering part of the exercises are overwhelmingly responsible for the growth seen from normal training with lifting adding very little this exactly supports what Arthur Jones stated when you leave the negative work out of exercise you have little or nothing of benefit left however there is a potentially crucial limitation in the Japanese paper we don't know how close the failure subjects got all we know is the groups use the same Dumbo load which was progressed throughout the study but based on the numbers I speculate it's quite likely the subjects were trading quite far from failure for a fair chunk of the study why does this matter with the lifting phase of an exercise taking reps in close proximity to failure ensures we achieve High muscle fiber Recruitment and forces in this portion which is essential for optimizing the stimulus for growth you probably don't have to go all the way to failure getting three to two reps away from failure could suffice we have a range of studies that have had subjects train harder with lifting only repetitions and much better hypertrophy is achieved in these studies special machines were largely used that unload Ed the lowering phase so that only the lifting was resisted based on this data if we return to the paper from Japan it's likely if subjects went sufficiently close to failure we'd see lifting only to produce better hypertrophy moreover perhaps the normal group thanks to the addition of the lifting phase getting closer to failure would see even better growth surpassing the lowering only group accordingly i' speculate normal training is probably Superior to lowering only however we've just been talking talking about lowering only training with the same load that you'd use with normal training as alluded to near the start of the video when muscles are producing force during the lowering of an exercise you're a lot stronger approximately 40% stronger before going any further an interesting question is why are muscles stronger while lengthening Titan might be the answer recall Titan is a structure found within the sarcomas providing passive tension when the sarom stretches there's speculation that when your muscles generate Force while lengthening Titan Alters its structure such that it can generate even greater passive forces therefore the combination of these greater passive forces from Titan with the forces generated from myin and actin attachments may be the main reason why muscles are stronger while lengthening during muscle shortening when lifting it's only the mein and actin attachments that are really contributing to force production near the start of the video we also mentioned a range of methods you can use to more optimally challenge the lowering part of exercises I would describe these as overloaded lowering training the key with these is you're lowering away under control that you can't lift or at least would struggle to lift with the two1 method though you're lifting the load with both limbs you're then switching to only one limb to perform the lowering and presumably this one limb would struggle to lift the load with some exercises like Nordic Coes reverse Nordic Coes pull-ups and chinups assuming you're not strong enough to perform the lifting part yet just performing controlled Low Reps means you're overloading this part as for men's method I would actually say this is pretty close to qualifying as lowering only overloaded training recall he has subjects use quite heavy loads in the first place on top of this a static hold at the contracted position is held until fatigue first this would essentially pre fatigue the muscle and make it very hard if not impossible to lift the weight further thereby meaning the upcoming controlled lowering somewhat replicates the physiological condition of overloaded lowering training this raises the question how effective are lowering only repetitions when they are overloaded beyond what can be lifted remember I showed you this graph demonstrating that training harder with lifting only can produce notable growth all the studies also had other groups that were performing lowering only repetitions which were overloaded special machines were used to achieve this and these machines unloaded the lifting part so that lowering only overloaded reps was before performed this did actually produce slightly more hypertrophy versus the lifting only training as a result all the methods we mentioned that overloaded the lowering portion including menor's method are likely going to be quite effective for building muscle but does this mean they're Superior to normal training well this data is just comparing lifting only to lowering only normal training isn't just lifting it's lifting plus the underloaded lowering reps and we know as per the Japanese study underloaded lowering reps still produce respectable hypertrophy as a result normal training might end up producing similar hypertrophy to lowering only overloaded reps indeed this is exactly what this paper established as far as I know it seems to be the only paper comparing normal training to lowering only overloaded reps allbe it in untrained older individuals muscle growth was similar between both now some of you might be quite surprised at this you may be thinking wait a second considering how much muscle those under loaded lowering reps built in the Japanese paper shouldn't normal training go beyond and surpass lowering only overloaded training or conversely perhaps you've been thinking something entirely different this whole time you're thinking since men's method also involves a pref fatiguing static hold at the contracted position which we know can stimulate hypertrophy shouldn't this make it Superior to normal training well I think both are probably incorrect I think some kind of threshold to the amount of growth that can be generated from your reps exists and it may be related to the interaction between stimulus and fatigue this ultimately means the growth produced by normal training just ends up being similar to lowering only overloaded training and menor's Method research on accentuated lowering training leads me to speculate this what is accentuated lowering training we've just been discussing lowering only overloaded reps with the machines in the studies resulting in no real lifting reps performed but there are even special machines out out there that can challenge you well during the lifting phase and then increase the load to overload the lowering phase this is accentuated lowering training in fact the 21 method may be considered a form of accentuated lowering training since the lifting part is performed with two limbs you would think that accentuated lowering training should undeniably be superior for building muscle since we're challenging the muscle highly during both the lifting and lowering Parts but there have been 11 studies to my knowledge comparing how accentuated lowering training compares to normal training and the majority of them find similar hypertrophy between both perhaps because there's only so much that can be stimulated summarizing this section the lowering part of normal training does seem to contribute respectively to muscle growth but provided you're trading near to failure the lifting portion will still contribute to muscle growth lowering only overloaded training and accentuated lowering training can be effective for building muscle but the over evidence would suggest they're no more effective than normal training so far we've just been focusing on the overall magnitude of hypertrophy but based on a couple of studies some might suggest that despite the overall magnitude of muscle hypertrophy being comparable between normal training and overloaded lowering training the type of muscle growth they produce is slightly different this is actually a highly fascinating speculation let us explore it more we have some research indicating that lifting only repetitions May preferentially grow the middle regions of a muscle more while lowering only overloaded repetitions better grow the lower regions of a muscle furthermore the type of growth experienced at the cellular level could differ between lifting only and lowering only overloaded training we know sarom are the force generating units of muscles one of the primary ways muscles increase in size is by adding more sarom sarcomas can be added on top of each other which is called an increase in sarom in parallel or sares can be added next to each other which is called an increase in sarcomas in series we have some research alluding to the idea that lifting only reps predominantly increases sarom in parallel while lowering only overloaded reps predominantly increases sarom in series as a result methods that overload the lowering part may do well to grow the lower regions of muscle and stimulate an increase in sarcomas in series as for normal training remember it's lifting plus underloaded lowering reps and likely thanks to the inclusion of these underloaded lowering reps normal training has actually been documented to cause pretty impressive growth at lower regions of a muscle as well as likely an increase in sarcomas in series this seems to be particularly true when using a full range of motion that achieves a lengthened muscle position or even using a partial range of motion at lengthened muscle positions now lowering only overloaded training may still produce slightly better lower region growth and increases in Psycho series versus normal training but I don't know if these are practically meaningful enough in the long term yet therefore in the absence of other research my current speculation is that if you're just performing normal training you're probably not leaving much on the [Music] table one of the justifications from mener ditching the lifting portion was that he thought it was excessively fatiguing and prolonged recovery the that the the positive or the lifting of the weight is a negative in that it is the one portion of the exercise that makes the deepest inroad in the recovery ability meno wasn't correct we now have solid data demonstrating that lowering only overloaded training causes a lot more damage sess and strength reductions in the days after compared to lifting only training we even have data indicating that combining both lifting and lowering only overloaded training I.E accentuated lowering produced no more fatigue than lowering only overloaded training indicating the addition of the lifting did not exacerbate fatigue rather the overwhelming amount of fatigue was attributable to the lowering Parts this is something to be mindful of if you'd like to perform lowering only overloaded training it's going to be quite fatiguing at least initially but your body does produce a range of adaptations that reduce the amount of fatigue you experience over time these adaptations are called the repeated bow effect and at the house of hypertrophy we've previously dissected this study which found after a training session of five sets of 15 maximal lowering only overloaded reps substantial fatigue damage and soreness was present for at least 5 days after the training but as subjects kept training with these lowering only overloaded reps across 10 weeks they experienced a lot less fatigue damage and soreness in fact by the 10th week there was very little to no soreness damage and fatigue in the days after training therefore if you are including lowering only overloaded training your recovery from it should improve over time nonetheless the main point of this section was to demonstrate that contrary to men's thoughts at the time the evidence certainly does not support the idea that lifting is more fatiguing than lowering if you're searching for further guidance on

would like to discuss the role of tempo during normal training how far should you lift and lower this 2015 meta analysis combined the results of all the studies up to that time and found that provided you were performing repetitions to or very close to failure individual rep tempos between 0.5 and 8 seconds produced similar muscle hypertrophy note these durations combine both the lifting and lowering phases more recent research further supports the notion that both faster and slower rep speeds can be similarly effective for building muscle it had subjects trained the leg extension with reps to failure with one leg using a 1second lifting and 1 second lowering Tempo and the other leg using a 3-sec lifting and 3 second lowering Tempo here were the time under tension durations for each leg and despite the difference is muscle growth was similar between both as a result provided you're performing your reps near enough to failure you're free to train with whatever repetition speed you prefer however some people have suggested combining a faster lifting Tempo with a slower lowering Tempo could be the recipe for Superior gains what does the research say about this two Studies have indeed found that when using a 1-second lifting speed on the preacher curl using a 4sec lowering speed tended to produce better biceps gains versus using a 1second lowering speed however three other Studies have more conflicting results one paper out of Japan found that when using a 2 second lifting Tempo on the back squat thigh gains were similar between using a two and 4 second lowering Tempo another paper from Brazil found when using a 1se second lifting Tempo on the leg extension rectus for morus and vastus lateralis growth were similar between using a 2 and 4 second lowering speed but vastest medialist gains were greater for the 4 second lowering speed finally a study out of the USA found that when using a 1second lifting Tempo on the leg extension gains in anterior thigh at one region were similar between using a 1second lowering and 2C lowering Tempo but gains at another region of the anterior thigh were actually greater with the 1se second lowering Tempo all in all it's clear the research fails to currently establish a unanimously Superior lowering Tempo but it's also clear the speed you lower with isn't the make or break for your trading program you're going to make gains either way so I'd recommend using whatever lowering Tempo you prefer Mena and Jones were partly correct in that the lowering part of normal training contributes respectively to muscle growth but there claims that the lifting part was a waste of time and provided little or no benefit isn't true provided you're training near to failure the lifting portion will still contribute to muscle growth your muscles are approximately 40% stronger during the lowering and methods that get you to challenge yourself more during the lowering part can be effective for building muscle including mentor's method but the overall evidence would imply they're no more effective than normal training this should not be mistaken for me saying no one should ever perform these methods if it's something you'd like to try and you can do it safely with any of the methods outlined then that's perfectly fine bear in mind that contrary to men's claims overloaded lowering training can be quite damaging and fatiguing at least initially but your body does produce adaptations over time that decrease damage so this isn't necessarily an issue thank you for watching feel free to check out the alpha progression app or our recent video that dissects a fascinating new study on set numbers for building muscle"

    "transcript": "welcome to the house of hypertrophy can you build more muscle by implementing lengthened supersets with some of your exercises a new study is the first ever to explore this firstly what even is a lengthened superset during exercises your muscles move from longer to relatively shorter muscle lengths and some exercises are most challenging at relatively shorter muscle lengths calf Rises tend to be hardest in the plantar Flex position where you feel a squeeze of the Cals actually shorter lengths rows pull downs and pull-ups tend to be hardest when your arms are more bent and your hands are closer to your body which is where the back and biceps are at relatively shorter lengths dumbbell lateral and bent over raises are hardest when the arms are out to the sides where the shoulder muscles are at relatively shorter lengths and as a final example Leos also tend to be challenging when the knees are relatively more flexed and the hamstrings are at a shorter position if you train to failure on these exercises you tend to fail around that shorter muscle length position but at this point you can still squeeze out some more partial repetitions that have the muscles at relatively longer lengths this is what we'll call a lengthened superset where after you get to or close to failure with your normal range of motion on exercises that are hardest at shorter muscle lengths you then straight away perform as many partial reps at the lengthen position as you can now that we know this let's dive into the new study 23 untrained men were recruited they trained car phrases on a Smith machine with a foot on a step subjects moved from their most dorsy flexed position to their most planta flexed position to complete a normal full range of motion repetition with one leg all subjects train to momentary failure with their normal full range of motion momentary failure is defined as reaching the point where despite your maximal attempt to do so you you can't perform the full range of motion as we know calf raises are most challenging at the most plantar Flex position so this leg would have failed in this position where the calvs are at a relatively shorter muscle length with their other leg subjects also train to momentary failure with a normal range of motion but once they hit this point they did not stop they straight away performed as many partial repetitions as they could with the aim of failing in the more dorsy Flex position where the calves are at a relative longer muscle length the researchers plans for all subjects to get to the exact point where despite 100% maximal effort subjects could not even raise themselves up from the most dorsy Flex position however some subjects were unable to do this so the researchers had to settle with these subjects reaching what we may call valal failure around the more dorsy Flex position I think this is not a bad thing as it makes the study more ecologically valid for anyone that's ever done lengthen suets on car phrases you'll know it can get pretty excruciating here were the training variables used for both conditions when subjects were able to perform more than 20 full range of motion repetitions on the first set in either condition the barber load was increased before and after the study medial gastr nmia growth was measured the lengthen supersets ended up growing the muscle more than the normal training in raw units the growth was 0.62 mm more while in relative terms the growth was 43.3% greater some of you may be thinking 0.62 mm more that doesn't sound like much but bear in mind that both groups saw under a 2 mm average increase in thickness of the medial gastrocnemius multiple studies looking at Cal growth also tend to find between a 1 to 2 mm increase in gastrous thickness after 6 to 10 weeks of training and this isn't too surprising muscle growth can be a slow process so we're not going to see astonishing increases in sze in a few months considering this an extra 0.62 mm increase in this time frame which again was 43.3% more growth for the subjects is probably not meaningless but it may depend on your point of view fascinatingly the authors reported that around half of the subjects in the study felt this extra growth was worth a discomfort of lengthen supersets before describing how this paper fits into the rest of the literature and what the potential takeaways could be in the spirit of scientific accuracy we need to keep some things in mind firstly the subjects were previously untrained it's difficult to certainly know if this applies to trained individuals secondly just car phrases were trained so it's also difficult to certainly know if this extends to other exercises thirdly volume load the product of sets times reps times load was much greater with the lengthen super sets which is of course due to them performing extra partial reps volume load doesn't always have a strong relationship to hypertrophy but it is difficult to tease apart the contribution of volume or lengthen supersets to the results lastly some of you may be tempted to conclude this study proves that training to failure and Beyond is better for building muscle in all scenarios I don't think this is the best conclusion we've seen previously at the house of hyper that stopping one to two reps from failure can produce similar hypertrophy to training to failure and there other techniques that go beyond failure such as drop sets tend to produce similar hypertrophy to normal sets considering this I would merely interpret this study as telling us with a specific exercise car phrases which are most challenging at shorter muscle lengths going Beyond failure with a specific technique length and supersets has the potential to cause greater growth this is the first ever study to explore lengthen supersets and its results were promising in a unique way I say it adds to the growing evidence we've previously seen at the house of Hy pery demonstrating that training muscles at longer lengths is great for growth when we consider this overall research I think it first and foremost suggests selecting exercises that already place and Will challenge our muscles at longer lengths is a good idea last video we saw that leaning back leg extensions which lengthen the rectora more than normal leg extensions grew this muscle better we've also previously seen that cated leg Coes which lengthened the hamstrings more than Lang leg Coes produced greater hypertrophy triceps overhead extensions which lengthens the long head more than triceps pushdowns grew this muscle more we've also speculated that cable lateral raises and cable reverse flies due to them challenging the muscles well at long longer muscle lengths may be up there as the best exercises for the side and rear delts respectively but as we might not enjoy or even have access to exercises that adequately challenge all of our muscles at relatively longer lengths lengthened supersets May effectively help us build more muscle with exercises that are typically most challenging at shorter muscle lengths once again just car phrases were used in the newest study so we need to be cautious in extending the results to other exercises but lowering our scientific Shield we may hypothesize lengthened supersets may be effective with rows pull Downs pull-ups leg calls dumbbell lateral raises dumbbell bent over raises and any other exercises you may have that are most challenging in shorten muscle positions so feel free to experiment with this strategy in your own training if you desire there is another potential option on the table which is just a purely performed partial repetitions at long lengths instead of any full range em motion reps how effective could purely length and partial training be this paper from 2022 recruited untrained women to train a cough exercise one group used a full range of motion a second group used purely a partial at long muscle lengths and the third group used purely partials at Short muscle lengths medial and lateral gastrous growth was best with the partials at long lengths in fact medial gastrous growth was 126. n% greater for the length and partials compared to the full range of motion recall in the newest study medial gas nous growth was 43.3% greater with length and supersets considering this just length and partials maybe more effective than length and supersets but as the two studies had differences direct comparisons between purely length and partial training and lengthen superset is needed in future studies when considering other research specifically on length and partials two other studies on leg extensions and a hip extension machine further finds a partial range of motion at long muscle lengths built more muscle than a full range of motion but we do need other data on other demographics and exercises fortunately I know there is at least one study coming soon comparing full range of motion to length and partials in trained individuals we'll update you with a results when it's published for now feel free to try out the option you prefer before wrapping up let us put our scientific Shields back up and recognize with the research on Long muscle length training we are currently not talking about hundreds of studies with multiple replications across all training levels rather we're talking about an emerging and developing body of literature that has been conducted on previously untrained individuals with upcoming research in trained individuals so don't consider these things as 100% verified by science for being Superior all the time rather consider them as being promising training tips that you may wish to experiment with in your own training if you have any hesitancy you could explore them on just some of your sets for example if you're performing three sets on a row in a session the first two sets may be with a normal full range of motion while the final set may involve a lengthened super set or just purely lengthened partial reps integrated partials is yet another option this involves you alternating back and forth between between a normal full range emotional rep and a partial rep at long muscle lengths finally if you don't want to experiment with any of these training strategies that's absolutely okay you still grow with exercises that challenge short muscle lengths also methods that have staining at longer muscle lengths can be more fatiguing and depending on your individual circumstances some people may struggle to recover from training at longer muscle lengths yet the subjects in the current literature evidently were able to handle and Thrive from training at longer muscle lengths and we've discussed previously at the house of hypertrophy how your body can adapt and reduce the fatigue you experience so my current belief is in many cases we shouldn't worry about the fatigue from training at longer muscle links anyhow as you gain training experience you will hopefully gain a greater understanding of your recovery capabilities it can be tricky and very challenging to construct your own muscle building program but the alpha progression app which is essentially your personal clever muscle building assistant in the palm of your hand can easily help you with hundreds of thousands of downloads thousands of reviews speak to its unmatched quality

    "title": "The Science of Drop Sets (Vs Normal Sets) For Hypertrophy",
    "published_at": "2021-09-09T11:08:22Z",
    "transcript": "Drop sets are a so-called advanced\u00a0\nmuscle-building technique. Generally, a drop set involves performing\u00a0\nrepetitions to failure with a given load and\u00a0\u00a0 then immediately reducing the load (typically\u00a0\nby 15-25%) and performing repetitions to\u00a0\u00a0 failure again. Typically, one to three load\u00a0\nreductions are done, but more can be done. You can also perform multiple\u00a0\ndrop sets for an exercise,\u00a0\u00a0 separated by some rest interval duration. A potential reason drop\u00a0\nsets could build more muscle\u00a0\u00a0 is that when you perform repetitions to failure\u00a0\nwith a given load, your muscles are technically\u00a0\u00a0 not fully fatigued, as they could still\u00a0\nperform repetitions with a lighter load. By using drop sets and performing\u00a0\nfurther repetitions to failure\u00a0\u00a0 with lighter loads, you are enhancing\u00a0\nthe fatigue experienced by the muscle,\u00a0\u00a0 potentially implying a better\u00a0\nmuscle-building stimulus. However, do drop sets have\u00a0\nany support in the research? Firstly, we'll explore a\u00a0\nnew study by Varovic et al. Secondly, we'll fit this study\u00a0\ninto the context with the rest\u00a0\u00a0 of the drop set research\u00a0\nand make some conclusions. Varovic et al. recruited 16 men with\u00a0\nless than 1 year of training experience. This could technically include individuals\u00a0\nwith no previous training experience, but the\u00a0\u00a0 researchers unfortunately provided no further\u00a0\ndetails on whether this was actually the case. Nevertheless, each subject randomly had one\u00a0\nleg assigned to a drop set or normal condition. Both legs were trained on\u00a0\nthe unilateral leg extension,\u00a0\u00a0 mainly three times per week for 8 weeks. With the normal condition leg, each\u00a0\nsession consisted of performing 2-5 sets\u00a0\u00a0 of repetitions to failure with a 15 rep-max load. 120 seconds of rest were used between sets. With the drop set condition leg, each drop set\u00a0\ninvolved first performing repetitions to failure\u00a0\u00a0 with a 5 rep-max load, immediately reducing the\u00a0\nload by 20% and performing repetitions to failure,\u00a0\u00a0 and then reducing the load one last time by 10-15%\u00a0\nand performing even more repetitions to failure. 2-5 drop sets were performed per session,\u00a0\nseparated by 120 seconds of rest. Vastus lateralis and rectus femoris\u00a0\nthickness was each measured at 30%, 50%,\u00a0\u00a0 and 70% of the muscle's respective length\u00a0\nbefore and after the study for both legs. At all measured regions of the vastus lateralis,\u00a0\nand at 70% of the rectus femoris' length,\u00a0\u00a0 increases in thicknesss were\u00a0\nsimilar between both conditions. However, at 30% and 50% of\u00a0\nthe rectus femoris' length,\u00a0\u00a0 increases were greater for the drop set condition. Therefore, it seems drop set training was better\u00a0\nat growing more regions of the quadriceps. It's potentially notable the leg extension,\u00a0\nan isolation exercise, was used in this study. Isolation exercises involve movement at one\u00a0\njoint, meaning one muscle group is trained. When looking at the rest of the\u00a0\nresearch using isolation exercises,\u00a0\u00a0 the results similarly seem\u00a0\npromising for drop set training. Fink et al. had 16 men with\u00a0\nprior training experience,\u00a0\u00a0 but minimally trained in the last year, perform\u00a0\nthe triceps pushdown twice per week for 6 weeks. A normal group, each session, trained the\u00a0\nmovement with 3 sets of repetitions to failure\u00a0\u00a0 with a 12 rep-max load, using\u00a0\n90 seconds of rest between sets. A drop set group, each session, performed\u00a0\nrepetitions to failure with a 12-rep max load,\u00a0\u00a0 and then subsequently performed repetitions to\u00a0\nfailure with a 20% lighter load three consecutive\u00a0\u00a0 times in a row. They only performed\u00a0\nthis single drop set in a session. Increases in triceps cross-sectional area,\u00a0\nmeasured at 50% of the upper arm length,\u00a0\u00a0 favored the drop-set group. These results are quite impressive. As just noted, the drop set group only\u00a0\nperformed a single drop set in their session. The normal group, opposingly,\u00a0\nperformed 3 sets in a session. If the drop set group performed three of\u00a0\ntheir drop sets, they may have experienced\u00a0\u00a0 potentially even more growth, given more\u00a0\nvolume (in the form of sets) seems to be\u00a0\u00a0 closely related to muscle growth\u00a0\n(at least up to a certain point). Another study by Okazi et al. assigned the arms\u00a0\nof 9 untrained men into one of three conditions:\u00a0\u00a0 a high load, light load, or drop set condition. Subjects trained both arms with\u00a0\na unilateral dumbbell curl,\u00a0\u00a0 two to three times per week for 8 weeks. The high load condition, each session, involved\u00a0\nperforming 3 sets of repetitions to failure\u00a0\u00a0 with an 80% one-rep max load, using\u00a0\n3 minutes of rest between sets. The light load condition, each session, involved\u00a0\nperforming 3 sets of repetitions to failure\u00a0\u00a0 with a 30% one-rep max load, using\u00a0\n90 seconds of rest between sets. The drop set condition first involved\u00a0\nperforming repetitions to failure\u00a0\u00a0 with an 80% one-rep max load, and then immediately\u00a0\nperforming subsequent repetitions to failure\u00a0\u00a0 with 65, 50, 40, and 30% one-rep max loads. They\u00a0\nonly performed this single drop set each session. Increases in cross-sectional area of the elbow\u00a0\nflexors (which consists of the biceps and\u00a0\u00a0 brachialis in this case), at 60% of the upper arm\u00a0\nlength, were similar between all three conditions. Like the last study, the drop set\u00a0\nconditon only performed a single drop set.\u00a0\u00a0 Although, 4 load reductions were\u00a0\nperformed, which is quite a bit. Nevertheless, it's plausible if they\u00a0\nperformed further drop sets in a session,\u00a0\u00a0 growth could have been even more compared\u00a0\nto the other high and light load conditions. As for compound exercises, which are exercises\u00a0\nthat train two or more muscle groups thanks to\u00a0\u00a0 the movement of two or more joints, the evidence\u00a0\nis less promising for them with drop sets. Angleri et al. assigned each leg of a group of 16\u00a0\nmen with at least 4 years of training experience\u00a0\u00a0 into a drop set or normal condition. Both legs were trained on the unilateral\u00a0\nleg press and leg extension for 12 weeks. The leg extension is of course an isolation\u00a0\nexercise, but the leg press is compound. The normal condition, each session,\u00a0\ninvolved 3-5 sets of 6-12 repetitions\u00a0\u00a0 to or very close to failure,\u00a0\nusing 2 mins of rest between sets. For the drop set condition, each drop set involved\u00a0\nfirst performing repetitions to failure with a 75%\u00a0\u00a0 one-rep max load, immediately reducing the load\u00a0\nby 20% and performing repetitions to failure,\u00a0\u00a0 and then reducing the load one last time by 20%\u00a0\nand performing even more repetitions to failure. 3-5 drop sets were performed each session,\u00a0\nseparated by 2-minute rest intervals. Increases in cross-sectional\u00a0\narea of the vastus lateralis,\u00a0\u00a0 measured at 50% of the thigh length,\u00a0\nwere similar between both conditions. Now, one limitation of this study is that\u00a0\nonly one region of the vastus lateralis,\u00a0\u00a0 which is a large muscle, was measured. Fortunately, this limitation is\u00a0\nless so in a study by Enes et al. 18 men with at least 2\u00a0\nyears of training experience\u00a0\u00a0 were assigned into a normal or drop set group. Both groups trained the back squat, leg press, and\u00a0\nleg extension, twice per week for 8 weeks. Again,\u00a0\u00a0 the leg extension is an isolation exercise,\u00a0\nbut the back squat and leg press are compound. The normal group, each session and for\u00a0\neach exercise, performed 4 sets of 12\u00a0\u00a0 repetitions with a 70% one-rep max load,\u00a0\nusing 120 seconds of rest between sets. The drop set group, each session, involved\u00a0\nperformed 10 reps with a 75% one-rep max load and\u00a0\u00a0 then immediately reducing the load to 55% one-rep\u00a0\nmax and performing a further 6 repetitions.\u00a0\u00a0 3 of these drop sets were performed for each\u00a0\nexercise, separated by 120-second rest-intervals. Lateral thigh thickness (which includes\u00a0\na combination of the vastus lateralis\u00a0\u00a0 and vastus intermedius) was measured at\u00a0\n30%, 50%, and 70% of the thigh length. Increases at all three measured regions\u00a0\nwere similar between both groups. It's worth noting that the drop sets used in this\u00a0\u00a0 study can be thought of as less\u00a0\nintense than typical drop sets. They performed a prescribed number of repetitions\u00a0\nrather than training all out to failure. They also only performed one\u00a0\nload reduction per drop set. With more intense drop set protocols, I\u00a0\nthink there are some potential reasons\u00a0\u00a0 as to why they may not be the most\u00a0\nsuitable with compound exercises,\u00a0\u00a0 particularly with free weight compound\u00a0\nexercises like the back squat. Firstly, as compound exercises require the\u00a0\ncoordinated movement of two or more joints, they\u00a0\u00a0 generally require more skill and concentration\u00a0\nto smoothly execute versus isolation exercises Drop sets that involve repetitions to\u00a0\nfailure and multiple load reductions,\u00a0\u00a0 due to their highly fatiguing nature, may\u00a0\ncause a meaningful breakdown in technique. This problem may be more relevant\u00a0\nfor less experienced individuals. Secondly, central fatigue\u00a0\ncould potentially be an issue. Remember, muscles produce force thanks\u00a0\nto the electrical signals they receive\u00a0\u00a0 from that central nervous system\u00a0\n(the brain and spinal cord). Central fatigue refers to a decrease\u00a0\nin these electrical signals.\u00a0\u00a0 This causes a reduction in the\u00a0\nnumber of muscle fibers recruited\u00a0\u00a0 and/or the amount of force they generate,\u00a0\nsomething not favorable for optimal muscle growth. Central fatigue is likely produced\u00a0\nin many cases of training. However, drop sets with compound\u00a0\nexercises may produce central\u00a0\u00a0 fatigue to a magnitude that could be problematic. I speculate this for two reasons: Firstly, the longer the muscle contraction\u00a0\nduration, the more central fatigue generated. Due to multiple load reductions,\u00a0\u00a0 drop sets prolong the duration of your\u00a0\nsets, and thus muscle contraction duration. Secondly, there's some evidence to suggest the\u00a0\nmore muscle mass involved in an exercise, the\u00a0\u00a0 more central fatigue generated. Compound exercises\u00a0\ninvolve more muscle mass than isolation exercises. Combine these two reasons and we\u00a0\ncould hypothesize that drop sets\u00a0\u00a0 with compound exercises may produce central\u00a0\nfatigue that interferes with the stimulus. However, it's essential to recognize this is\u00a0\njust a hypothesis. The notion that compound\u00a0\u00a0 exercises generate more central fatigue is not\u00a0\ncompletely supported by the research itself. To conclude the video, the research on drop\u00a0\nsets with isolation exercises looks promising. 1 study found that with a leg extension,\u00a0\nmultiple drop sets per session produced\u00a0\u00a0 greater regional quadriceps\u00a0\ngrowth than multiple normal sets. A second study found with a triceps pushdown,\u00a0\u00a0 a single drop set produced more triceps\u00a0\ngrowth than multiple normal sets. While a third study found with a dumbbell curl,\u00a0\u00a0 a single drop set produced similar elbow\u00a0\nflexor growth to multiple normal sets. Now, in these two studies that only used single\u00a0\ndrop sets, it's potentially plausible that if they\u00a0\u00a0 performed more drop sets per session, the results\u00a0\nmay have been even more favorable for drop sets. With studies that have included compound\u00a0\nexercises, drop sets appear less promising. Two studies in which multiple drop\u00a0\nsets were performed with either\u00a0\u00a0 the leg press and back squat\u00a0\nfound no advantage with them. As a final note, it's worth mentioning\u00a0\nthat in total, there are only 5 studies\u00a0\u00a0 assessing drop sets and muscle growth,\u00a0\nwhich is far from a substantial number. The conclusions in this video are derived from my\u00a0\ninterpretations of this limited number of studies. Future research could definitely come along\u00a0\nand change the conclusions made in this video."

    "title": "The Protein Limit For a Meal (They Were WRONG)",
    "published_at": "2024-04-01T11:00:00Z",
    "transcript": "[Music] are you wasting protein by having too much all at once what do I mean it suggests that there's a limit to the amount of protein that can be used for building muscle per meal with any extra protein being oxidized on top of this it's thought you have to wait some hours before consuming protein again to be able to re-trigger the muscle building process if true this suggests to maximize muscle hypertrophy it's best to divide your daily protein intake across a few meals separated by a few hours but what if it actually exists is the limit of the protein amount you can use per meal in this video we're going to dissect the most upto-date scientific literature behind just this so that by the end you'll have a clearer picture of how you may distribute your protein for muscle hypertrophy welcome to the house of hypertrophy turning back the clock to 2013 one of the most influential papers on protein distribution was published let's see what it was about 24 trained men trained the leg extension and then in the following 12 hours they consumed 80 g of whey protein one group did this by consuming 10 g eight times every 1.5 hours a second by consuming 20 G four times every 3 hours and a third by consuming 40 G twice separated by 6 hours the result muscle protein synthesis which is essentially the process by which your body builds the proteins that can result in a larger muscle was best when consuming 20 G four times every 3 hours some other papers also find 20 G maximizes the protein synthesis response such as this one that had trained subjects train their lower body muscle protein synthesis was more or less optimized after consuming 20 G of whe protein with 40 G providing very little extra benefits so is that the end 20 g of protein is all you should have in one go anymore and that extra amount is quote unquote wasted the answer is no there are considerations multiple of them in fact one of them is that they just involve training with one or two exercises for a muscle group but most people's training sessions tend to involve training much more exercises and targeting multiple muscle groups this could change things indeed this 2016 paper had subjects train their full body with this session and this time around consuming 40 g of wheight protein successfully increased muscle protein synthesis more than 20 G another consideration is in the first study we mentioned remember subjects just consumed 80 g of weight protein over 12 hours as alluded to in our last video on how much protein you might want to consume in a day most people are going to consume more than 80 g Furthermore with the other studies we mentioned they just measured muscle protein synthesis up to 5 hours after exercise but what about Beyond this this is where an excellent recent study comes into play and it's ignited quite the buzz online this new study was seriously comprehensive but I'll relay the most crucial details for our purposes active men trained their full body with this session and thereafter consumed either zero 25 G or 100 G of milk protein muscle protein synthesis was greater and longer lasting after the 100 g of protein relative oxidation rates were also pretty small which goes against the notion that any protein in excess of 20 to 25 G is entirely just oxidized however one consideration is milk protein was used around 20% of this is whey protein which is fast digesting while around 80% is casine protein which digests slower you might suggest these results would be quite different if a proportionately faster digesting protein was served yet the authors provide some reasons as to why they think the responses in this study may not just be exclusive to predominantly slower digesting proteins anyhow what does all this mean well protein distribution may not be as important as once thought since a single single 100 G serving of protein was capable of producing larger and longer lasting growth signaling it's likely fewer larger meals can still lead to Great muscle growth additionally it demonstrates something that is also quite clear from other areas of the research how much protein you consume in the whole day is by far the most important thing about protein with other factors being far less important having said this it is worthwhile stepping back and realizing although this is a fantastic paper we are still just talking about muscle protein synthesis we know muscle protein synthesis is essentially the process by which your body builds the proteins that can result in a larger muscle however as perfectly described in this review there are established cases where muscle protein synthesis data fails to correlate with actual muscle hypertrophy the paper does a great job at outlining when and why this is also remember all the muscle protein synthesis data largely looked at the responses in the hours after training but people of course can consume protein in the hours before training everyone eats protein on the days they don't train and people tend to also consume their protein sources with other Foods thus it is ideal to look at studies that have compared different protein distributions in the context of an overall diet for actual muscle growth over many weeks of training let's do just [Music] that in 2020 This research paper was published untrained individuals trained three times per week for 12 weeks one group fundamentally had close to even distribution of protein across three meals while the second group had a distribution that meant only two of the meals could be considered as sufficient protein servings so in essence the study compared three to two sufficient protein servings a day the result strength and total leans soft tissue increases were better for the three protein servings but the differences were certainly far from large as a result this study suggests three servings of protein a day may be a little better than two this study isn't Flawless both groups consumed around 1.3 to 1.45 G per kilog of total body weight a day which as seen in our last video is definitely not terrible but you could could suggest if protein intake was higher the results would be different anyhow what about data on more than three protein servings this paper published a year later recruited male rowers who were training and bulking for 8 weeks consuming 3 to six protein servings a day was compared with total protein intake and calories equated the result all measurements including gains in fat-free mess were comparable between both thus this stud suggest although it's not detrimental consuming more than three protein servings a day fails to provide an advantage this data does come from merely 10 rowers but another paper on 24 Elite rugby players supports this notion subjects continue to train for 6 weeks and had to consume three protein shakes each day one condition consumed the shakes with every meal which resulted in four sufficiently sized protein servings a day while the other condition involved consuming the shakes between meals which resulted in six sufficiently sized protein servings a day gains in lean mass were similar between both conditions so in total the current evidence suggests three protein servings may be a little better than two with no further benefits of more than three servings bear in mind this isn't plentiful or super strong data so it's possible future research could improve our Insight if this happens we of course provide an update at the house of hypertrophy if for whatever reason you cannot or do not want to consume three protein servings don't stress about it too much once again the acute paper on 100 g of protein may ease your mind and remember the bigger picture daily protein intake is far more important and even more important than daily protein intake as depicted in our last video is training you just can't eat yourself to a great physique well constructed and executed training provides the key foundational stimulus for growth speaking about well-designed training amidst all the noise online it can definitely be frustrating and timec consuming to craft an effective program that gets

desire during a free twoe trial through the link in the comments and description if you like it and choose to go beyond the link cuts the price of a subscription by 20% I truly believe the app is exceptional with a thousand of reviews speaking to this [Music] in the quest to maximize muscle hypertrophy it has been thought how you distribute your protein intake across the day could modify the gains you see there have been papers suggesting 20 g of protein in one go maximizes the muscle building signal with no benefit to consuming more but there are multiple limitations and considerations to this data indeed in a well-designed study that overcame some of the limitations consuming 100 g of protein 6 sucessfully increased the muscle protein synthesis more than 25 g of protein in my eyes this demonstrates how protein distribution is likely not as big of a factor as once thought and you most likely can see great gains with fewer larger meals yet this data still is just measuring muscle protein synthesis in the hours after one training session ideally we want to look at research that has measured muscle growth in some way after weeks of training when we do this we see that there is evidence that three protein servings a day is a little better than two but there's no extra benefit not a downside either to consuming More Than This finally don't forget that well- constructed and executed training provides the key foundational stimulus for growth thank you for watching feel free to check out the alpha progression app or our recent deep dive into building the lats"

    "title": "The Science of What Muscle Growth Actually Is",
    "published_at": "2021-08-02T15:48:47Z",
    "transcript": "When you resistance train for a sufficient\u00a0\nduration, be it with barbells, dumbbells,\u00a0\u00a0 machines, or even your body weight,\u00a0\nyour muscles typically increase in size. But, have you ever wondered\u00a0\u00a0 what underlying changes within the\u00a0\nmuscle drive an increase in muscle size? Moreover, have you ever wondered if there\u00a0\nare different types of muscle growth,\u00a0\u00a0 and if so, can you specifically train for them? In this 5 part video series on muscle growth,\u00a0\u00a0 we'll be aiming to answer these questions\u00a0\nby going deep into the current science. In this first video, we'll be overviewing\u00a0\nall the ways a muscle can increase in size,\u00a0\u00a0 with the following videos going into\u00a0\ndepth on the science of each one.\u00a0 In the human body, muscles increase in\u00a0\nsize by increasing in cross-sectional area. By my count, there seem to be 5 underlying ways\u00a0\na muscle can increase its cross-sectional area:\u00a0\u00a0 myofibrillar hypertrophy,\u00a0\nsarcoplasmic hypertrophy,\u00a0\u00a0 myofibrillar packing, muscle hyperplasia,\u00a0\nand an increase in muscle length. Soon we'll unpack what these ways\u00a0\nspecifically are and how they can\u00a0\u00a0 create an increase in muscle cross-sectional area. But first, it is necessary we briefly\u00a0\noverview the structure of a muscle. Muscles are organized in hierarchical layers. Within the whole muscle are\u00a0\nfascicles, within fascicles\u00a0\u00a0 are muscle fibers, and within\u00a0\nmuscle fibers are myofibrils. Myofibrils are where the magic\u00a0\nof muscle contraction happens,\u00a0\u00a0 they consist of an array of sarcomeres. Sarcomeres are what generate muscle force. Specifically, when something called the\u00a0\nmyosin head extends from the myosin filament\u00a0\u00a0 and pulls on something called the actin\u00a0\nfilament towards the M-line, force is generated. Okay, now that we (hopefully) have an\u00a0\nunderstanding of the structure of a muscle and how\u00a0\u00a0 they produce force, we're in a good position to\u00a0\nunpack what underlies an increase in muscle size. Starting with myofibrillar hypertrophy,\u00a0\u00a0 we need to take a deeper look at the\u00a0\nmuscle fiber level to understand it. As we've mentioned, muscle\u00a0\nfibers contain myofibrils,\u00a0\u00a0 which are what generate\u00a0\nforce via their sarcomeres. Everything else within the muscle\u00a0\nfiber can be considered the sarcoplasm. The sarcoplasm largely consists of water but\u00a0\nalso contains other components, such as glycogen,\u00a0\u00a0 sarcoplasmic proteins, and\u00a0\nnon-contractile organelles. Myofibrillar hypertrophy is where the\u00a0\nmyofibrils and sarcoplasm grow at the same pace,\u00a0\u00a0 meaning the relative space taken up by the\u00a0\nmyofibrils and sarcoplasm remains the same. An example can help us understand this further. Let's say that 85% of a muscle fiber\u00a0\u00a0 is taken up by myofibrils, while\u00a0\nthe remaining 15% is the sarcoplasm. Let's also say that after\u00a0\ntraining for some duration,\u00a0\u00a0 the cross-sectional area of this\u00a0\nmuscle fiber has increased by 30%. However, this larger muscle fiber is still\u00a0\ncomposed of 85% myofibrils and 15% sarcoplasm. In other words, the myofibrils and sarcoplasm\u00a0\nstill take up the same relative space\u00a0\u00a0 because they grew at the same pace. As muscle fibers are within fascicles, and\u00a0\nfascicles are within the whole muscle, an increase\u00a0\u00a0 in muscle fiber cross-sectional area achieved\u00a0\nby myofibrillar hypertrophy, increases the\u00a0\u00a0 cross-sectional area of fascicles, which increases\u00a0\nthe cross-sectional area of the whole muscle. As some extra detail, myofibrils may grow\u00a0\u00a0 by increasing in number or by increasing the\u00a0\ncross-sectional area of pre-existing myofibrils. In the latter case, it's believed myofibrils\u00a0\ncan increase their cross-sectional area\u00a0\u00a0 by adding sarcomeres below or\u00a0\nabove pre-existing sarcomeres.\u00a0\u00a0 This phenomenon has been called an\u00a0\nincrease in sarcomeres in parallel. In video 3 of this muscle growth series,\u00a0\u00a0 we'll be going into more detail on the\u00a0\nscience behind how myofibrils grow. As for the sarcoplasm, as we'll explore more\u00a0\nin video 4 of this muscle growth series,\u00a0\u00a0 an increase in various components\u00a0\nthat lie within the sarcoplasm,\u00a0\u00a0 such as glycogen and sarcoplasmic proteins, are\u00a0\npotential contenders that drive sarcoplasm growth. The discussion on sarcoplasm growth brings\u00a0\nus nicely on to sarcoplasmic hypertrophy. At the muscle fiber level,\u00a0\nsarcoplasmic hypertrophy\u00a0\u00a0 is where the sarcoplasm grows at a\u00a0\ngreater pace than the myofibrils,\u00a0\u00a0 meaning the relative space taken up\u00a0\nby the sarcoplasm becomes greater. Again, let's say that 85% of a muscle fiber\u00a0\u00a0 is taken up by myofibrils, while\u00a0\nthe remaining 15% is the sarcoplasm. After training for some duration,\u00a0\u00a0 the cross-sectional area of this\u00a0\nmuscle fiber increases by 30%. However, this larger muscle fiber is now\u00a0\ncomposed of 80% myofibrils and 20% sarcoplasm. The sarcoplasm now occupies more\u00a0\nrelative space in the muscle fiber\u00a0\u00a0 because it grew at a greater\u00a0\npace than the myofibrils. It's important to emphasize the myofibrils\u00a0\nhave not decreased in size or number. Rather, the myofibrils could have very well grown,\u00a0\u00a0 but it's just the sarcoplasm\u00a0\ngrew at a faster pace. Alternatively, the myofibrils may have not\u00a0\ngrown at all, while the sarcoplasm only grew. Myofibrillar packing is the opposite\u00a0\nof sarcoplasmic hypertrophy,\u00a0\u00a0 it is where the myofibrils grow at\u00a0\na greater pace than the sarcoplasm,\u00a0\u00a0 meaning the relative space taken up\u00a0\nby the myofibrils becomes greater. Using the same example, 85% of a\u00a0\nmuscle fiber is taken up by myofibrils,\u00a0\u00a0 while the remaining 15% is the sarcoplasm. After training for some duration,\u00a0\u00a0 this muscle fiber is now composed of\u00a0\n90% myofibrils and 10% sarcoplasm. The myofibrils now occupy more relative space in\u00a0\u00a0 the muscle fiber because they grew at\u00a0\na greater rate than the sarcoplasm. Notice how in this example, I did not say the\u00a0\nmuscle fiber increased in cross-sectional area. This is because, in theory, myofibrils\u00a0\ncan grow and not increase muscle fiber\u00a0\u00a0 cross-sectional area (and hence ultimately\u00a0\nthe whole muscle's cross-sectional area). Having said this, there are two potential ways\u00a0\nI'm aware of where myofibrillar packing can still\u00a0\u00a0 drive an increase in muscle fiber cross-sectional\u00a0\narea (and thus whole muscle cross-sectional area). Firstly, in theory, it's plausible myofibrils\u00a0\ncould grow to the point where they push the outer\u00a0\u00a0 wall of the muscle fiber, causing the muscle\u00a0\nfiber to increase in cross-sectional area. Secondly, the myofibrils grow, but\u00a0\nthe sarcoplasm also grows to a degree,\u00a0\u00a0 creating an increase in muscle\u00a0\nfiber cross-sectional area. It's important to emphasize in this scenario,\u00a0\nmyofibril growth would outpace the sarcoplasm\u00a0\u00a0 growth, as this is following the\u00a0\nmyofibrillar packing definition. If the sarcoplasm grew at the\u00a0\nsame rate as the myofibrils,\u00a0\u00a0 as we know, this would be\u00a0\nmyofibrillar hypertrophy. As a mini-review, we've so far explored\u00a0\n3 underlying ways that can drive an\u00a0\u00a0 increase in muscle cross-sectional\u00a0\narea: myofibrillar hypertrophy,\u00a0\u00a0 sarcoplasmic hypertrophy,\u00a0\nand myofibrillar packing. All three of these are related,\u00a0\nas all of them have the capacity\u00a0\u00a0 to increase muscle fiber cross-sectional area. The only distinction between them lies in\u00a0\nthe ratio of myofibril to sarcoplasm growth. The 4th underlying way that can drive an\u00a0\nincrease in muscle cross-sectional area,\u00a0\u00a0 muscle hyperplasia, is more distinct.\u00a0 Muscle Hyperplasia refers to an increase in\u00a0\nthe number of muscle fibers within a muscle. Remember, as muscle fibers are within fascicles,\u00a0\u00a0 and fascicles are within the whole muscle,\u00a0\nan increase in the number of muscle fibers\u00a0\u00a0 increases fascicle cross-sectional area, which\u00a0\nincreases whole muscle cross-sectional area. Now, there appear to be two potential ways\u00a0\nin which muscle hyperplasia could occur. Firstly, completely new muscle fibers could\u00a0\nbe manufactured and added to fascicles. Or secondly, pre-existing muscle\u00a0\nfibers could split into two,\u00a0\u00a0 thereby increasing the number of muscle fibers. In video 5 of this musc\nle growth series,\u00a0\u00a0 we'll be going into depth on the\u00a0\nscience behind muscle hyperplasia. However, it's probably important that I mention\u00a0\u00a0 the research on whether muscle hyperplasia\u00a0\noccurs in humans is far from clear. Therefore, the idea that in\u00a0\nhumans, muscle hyperplasia is an\u00a0\u00a0 underlying way that increases muscle\u00a0\ncross-sectional area is tentative. Moving on, an increase in muscle length\u00a0\nis the 5th and final way I'm aware of\u00a0\u00a0 that can increase a muscle's cross-sectional area. An increase in muscle length literally refers to\u00a0\nan increase in the length of the whole muscle. Now, in the human body, muscles\u00a0\nare attached to bones via tendons. The attachment locations do not change,\u00a0\u00a0 and so if the whole muscle length increases,\u00a0\nyou don't actually visually witness it. Rather, due to the fixed attachment locations,\u00a0\u00a0 the longer muscle would bulge outwards, and\u00a0\nthis is an increase in cross-sectional area. So, what underlies this increase in whole muscle\u00a0\nlength and subsequently cross-sectional area? Well, there is a good deal of\u00a0\nevidence that resistance training\u00a0\u00a0 can increase the length of fascicles in humans. Provided fascicles run the\u00a0\nlength of a whole muscle,\u00a0\u00a0 an increase in their length would\u00a0\nincrease whole muscle length. But, going even deeper, what causes\u00a0\nfascicles to increase in length? The answer most likely lies\u00a0\nat the muscle fiber level. As we know, myofibrils are within muscle fibers. Myofibrils are believed to be\u00a0\nable to increase in length. Specifically, it's thought sarcomeres are built\u00a0\nand added in a serial line, thereby increasing\u00a0\u00a0 the myofibril length. This phenomenon has been\u00a0\ncalled an increase in sarcomeres in series. Along with this increase in myofibril\u00a0\nlength, although I wasn't able to find\u00a0\u00a0 concrete evidence on it, presumably\u00a0\nthe sarcoplasm would expand lengthwise\u00a0\u00a0 to support this myofibril length increase, thereby\u00a0\ncementing an increase in muscle fiber length. In this scenario, given the myofibrils\u00a0\nand sarcoplasm grow lengthwise\u00a0\u00a0 at the same pace, it could technically\u00a0\nbe considered myofibrillar hypertrophy. Anyway, the increase in muscle\u00a0\nfiber length achieved by this\u00a0\u00a0 would increase fascicle length, which\u00a0\ncan increase whole muscle length. And as mentioned, due to the muscle's\u00a0\nfixed attachments in the human body,\u00a0\u00a0 this results in the bulging of a muscle. Now, there are some complex considerations here. Some fascicles (and thus\u00a0\ntheir residing muscles fibers)\u00a0\u00a0 do not run the entire length of a muscle.\u00a0\nTherefore, an increase in the length of\u00a0\u00a0 fascicles like these may not necessarily be\u00a0\nsufficient to increase the whole muscle length. Furthermore, there could be fascicles\u00a0\nthat run the entire length of the muscle,\u00a0\u00a0 but their residing muscle fibers do not\u00a0\nrun the entire length of the fascicle.\u00a0\u00a0 Therefore, an increase in the length of these\u00a0\nmuscle fibers may not necessarily be sufficient\u00a0\u00a0 to increase the length of the fascicle, and\u00a0\ntherefore the length of the whole muscle. Nonetheless, in video 3 of this muscle growth\u00a0\nseries, we'll go into more depth on the science\u00a0\u00a0 of how a muscle may increase in length, as well as\u00a0\nthe specific ways you may be able to train for it. However, I should probably note,\u00a0\nas we'll explore in that video,\u00a0\u00a0 an increase in muscle fiber length (and\u00a0\nthus whole muscle length) may be limited. So there we have it, we've just overviewed the\u00a0\u00a0 5 underlying ways in which a\u00a0\nmuscle may increase in size. As we've mentioned, the idea\u00a0\nmuscle hyperplasia occurs in humans\u00a0\u00a0 is tentative. Also, an increase in whole\u00a0\nmuscle length could potentially be limited. Therefore, it's quite likely the ways behind an\u00a0\nincrease in muscle fiber cross-sectional area\u00a0\u00a0 are what commonly drive an increase\u00a0\nin whole muscle cross-sectional area. In the next video, we'll be comparing\u00a0\nthe 3 ways in which this may occur:\u00a0\u00a0 myofibrillar hypertrophy, sarcoplasmic\u00a0\nhypertrophy, and myofibrillar packing. More precisely,\u00a0\u00a0 through using the current evidence, we'll try\u00a0\nto identify if any of these three mechanisms\u00a0\u00a0 are most likely to occur with training, as well as\u00a0\nif you can specifically train for either of them. In video 3 of this muscle growth series,\u00a0\u00a0 we'll go even deeper into the science\u00a0\nof myofibrillar hypertrophy and packing. In video 4, we'll do the same thing\u00a0\nbut for sarcoplasmic hypertrophy,\u00a0\u00a0 and in video 5, we'll dive into\u00a0\nthe science of muscle hyperplasia."

    "title": "Pullovers DO NOT Train Lats? (Uh Oh)",
    "published_at": "2023-12-04T11:59:56Z",
    "transcript": "welcome to the house of hypertrophy pullovers are an isolation exercise that can train the ls and they can be performed with free weights cables or even machines allow me to present the findings of two studies at first you may be confused as to why I'm detailing them but it will make sense soon both papers had subjects perform maximum isometric shoulder extension contractions at different shoulder elevation angles both of them indicate the lats display their highest activity at lower shoulder elevation angles and incrementally display lower activ ity at higher shoulder elevation angles in this event the usage of isometric contractions likely enhances its reliability these findings do make sense as you elevate your arm and get closer to the overhead position the ls are going to have progressively lower leverage here's the important Point free weight pullovers are most challenging with the arms overhead the point where the lats have their lowest activity as a result it's been speculated three-eight pullovers are an ineffective lat exercise in fact at these higher shoulder elevation angles the middle and lower PEC regions likely have decent leverage indeed a few semg studies report that PEC trist major middle and lower regions experience relatively greater activity compared to the lats during freee pullovers so does this research conclusively mean freee pullovers aren't a great L exercise According to some on the internet their answer is a resounding yes but I am less certain because there are other aspects of the scientific literature we shouldn't ignore the ls are stretched well in the overhead position the rebuttal to this so what if the lats are stretched the fact it's not going to be activated much renders this meaningless however it's worth understanding its leverage and activity are not going to be zero it's just limited but limited activity plus stretch might still produce a good stimulus for lat hypertrophy research on the back squat and glute Max depicts this back squats are of course most challenging at the lower portion and at these deeper angles of hip flexion the gluteus maximus is stretched well but it has much lower leverage ability to produce force and displays lower activity as measured through semg despite this a paper out of Japan established deeper Squad screw the glutitis Maximus more effectively than 90\u00b0 knee flexion squats another recent paper found back squats mostly to parallel produce similar upper middle and lower glute Max hypertrophy to hip thrusts thus stretch plus limited leverage and activity may still be a fine stimulus for hypertrophy maybe suggesting create pullovers may still be effective for the ls at the end of the day if it's an exercise that interests you feel free to to try it out from a regional perspective the lower LS are probably going to have a bit more leverage versus the other regions at the overhead position so pullovers might slightly bias this region cable pullovers involve a great stretch of the lat since they attain an overhead position comparable to freeway pullovers yet compared to freeway pullovers cables involve a greater active range of motion the arms will go through lower elevation angles which we know is where the lats have greater activity thus actual electrical activity from the lats will likely be greater in the cable variation indeed there was this 2022 semg analysis from Spain comparing barbell pullovers to Cable pull Downs lat activity was greater with the cable movement the cable pull down isn't identical to a cable pullover but the shoulder motion and resistance profile are similar enough from a regional perspective since cable pullovers involve getting the arms near the side the upper region will certainly be involved well but since the movement is most challenging at that mid position the middle to lower L regions might be potentially biased for all these reasons we may speculate cable pullovers to be a bit better than freee pullovers but understand this is hypothetical you could say since freee pullovers are most challenging at that very lengthened position while cable pullovers are most challenging in the mid position freeway pullovers have their Edge yet I'm unsure if this factor is enough to make it undeniably better than cable pullovers machine pullovers assuming the machine sufficiently provides High Resistance throughout the range of motion are probably more favorable compared to freeway or cable pullovers the high tension throughout the range of motion means that the lengthen position is challenging and we have a potential slight lower lat region bias at this position like freway pullovers but the fact we also have high tension at lower angles where the lats display greater electrical activity and the portions where the upper region possesses greater leverage means we get these benefits too so if you wish to have a pullover in your program to best train the ls go with the machine pullovers of course this isn't an absolute recommendation your gym may not have this machine if yours does but the machine feels off then go with either the freee or cable variant

    "transcript": "the plate pinch press is a popular exercise across social media is it the key to unlocking impressive chest gains well the pressing motion isn't aligned with gravity and the shoulder flexion occurring is likely predominantly done by the front delts yet pinching the plates does produce a strong chest squeeze and intriguingly some research finds maximally squeezing a muscle for a solid duration evokes hypertrophy performing the exercise lying down is likely better but there are still pitfalls the excessive close grip can bias the triceps and the overall stretch of the PEX is a lot less compared to other variations which is notable since emerging Research indicates attaining a stretch during an exercise is potent for growth it's also difficult to train this movement to or close to failure and progressively overload it in the long term two things that are also crucial for long-term hypertrophy for all these reasons though these will build some muscle they are certainly not optimal feel free to check out our most recent video where we discuss some better options"

    "title": "Bench Press vs Push Ups | Which is BEST? (Two Studies)",
    "published_at": "2020-06-03T11:39:29Z",
    "transcript": "when it comes to developing the upper body the bench press is a common go-to exercise and for good reason too it's undoubtedly a time-tested exercise [Music] but can the push-up an exercise often overlook due to simplicity compete with the bench press the 2017 study by kikuchi and nakazatum compared the bench press and push-up for muscle and strength gain 18 young men with at least one year of training experience was split into a bench press group and push-up group [Music] the bench press group used 40 of their one rep max the push-up group adjusted their hands and feet to mimic a resistance that would be roughly equivalent to a forty percent of one arm load on the bench press for some participants this may have been regular push-ups while for others it may have been variations of kneeling push-ups [Music] you may be questioning the use of a 40 1 ram load however a previous met analysis by schoenfield and colleagues demonstrated that loads between 30 and 85 percent of one ram induce similar muscle growth provided reps are taken to failure both groups perform three sets of their exercise to failure twice per week for eight weeks ultrasound imaging was used to obtain thickness of the pectoralis major and triceps brachii before and after the training period one rep max on the bench press was also tested before and after the training period what the researchers found was that the push-up group similarly increased pectoralis major thickness and triceps thickness to the bench press group put differently the push-up was as effective as the bench press for hypertrophy of the pectoralis major and triceps as for increases in bench press warning max both groups experience statistically similar increases although looking at the overall percentage increases it does slightly favor the bench press group it's quite likely that the small advantage with the bench press group was a result of the principle of specificity although the push-up is quite bio-mechanically similar to the bench press it makes sense that the bench press group would have been more primed for one rep max test on the bench press given they were training the movement for eight weeks something that isn't a limitation of the study itself but in practice is that both groups use the 40 1rm load as mentioned earlier for muscle growth this is perfectly fine as we know similar muscle growth is achieved with loads ranging from 30 to 85 1rm however when it comes to maximizing strength we know heavier loads are generally preferred and therefore it could be argued that for overall strength development the bench presses superior as heavy loads can easily be used while it is undeniable the bench press is far simpler to use heavier loads with week to week you can actually create heavier resistances with the push-up through manipulating your body position a 2011 study by ebene colleagues explored what percentage of your body weight you press during different variations of the push-up during a regular push-up you are pressing roughly 64 of your body weight elevating your feet increases this percentage while elevating your hands decreases this percentage kneeling push-ups have you pressed roughly 49 of your body weight you could perform variations that have you performing a low amount of reps and you may progress through adding reps here and there but also through performing harder push-up variations thereby allowing you to continuously use heavier resistances and lower rep ranges a 2018 study by kotaski and colleagues did compare progressive push-up training to the bench press the muscle and strength gain 23 men with two to six months of training experience were randomly assigned to a progressive push-up group or bench press group the bench press group started out with 3 sets of 6 reps with a given load and aimed to add reps until they achieved 3 sets of 8 reps once they achieved 3 sets of 8 reps load was increased by 4.5 kg and they reverted back to three sets of six reps this cycle was repeated throughout the study here are the different exercises given to the push-up group if a participant in the group could perform three sets of three reps on a particular single arm progression they started on this exercise if they couldn't they started on a double arm variation they could complete for three sets of six reps once a participant could perform three sets of eight reps with a double arm variation they progress to the next level whereas if a participant was performing a single arm variation once they achieved three sets of four reps they progressed to the next level this cycle was repeated throughout the study both groups trained three times per week for four weeks ultrasound imaging was used to obtain thickness of the pectoralis major warner max on the bench press was assessed too also for both groups the level of push-up according to the table they could comfortably perform was assessed before and after for increases in pectoralis major thickness both groups experience statistically similar increases however if we looked to the raw percentages we can see the push-up group actually had a slight advantage both groups significantly increased their one-round max from the bench press with no statistically significant differences between them however looking at the raw percentages the bench press group does appear to have outperformed the push-up group this again is likely due to the principle of specificity also following the principle of specificity the push-up group on average were able to perform a push-up variation 2.78 levels higher than at the start of the study while the bench press group only progressed by 0.78 levels which basically isn't any progression at all one limitation of this study is that it only lasted four weeks it would have been interesting to see how the study design would pan out in the long term nevertheless as we can see from both the longitudinal studies detailed in this video the push-up does a very respectable job compared to the bench press it seems that for hypertrophy of the chest and triceps the push-up has similar potential to the bench press unfortunately neither of the studies looked at growth of the anterior deltoid however research by tiller found that weighted push-ups elicits similar activation of the anterior deltoid to the bench press at four different load equated conditions although emg which is used to measure muscle activation comes with its limitations given the biomechanical similarities between their exercises is likely a good chance both exercises induce similar anterior deltoid growth just as a reminder although the bench press is simple to overload ashland in a kotaski study as well as the ebbin study there are tons of harder push-up variations that can be used to apply progressive overload again a combination of adding reps and performing harder variations is what can be done other push-up variations are not shown in this video include the resistance-banded push-ups and weighted push-ups which are both great options too moreover you can combine different push-up variations for instance you could perform resistance-banded elevated feet push-ups [Music] something that is essential i mentioned is that even though this video is a comparison between the two movements we must remember that in practice we don't need to pick either all both the push-up and bench press can be included in the training program successfully [Music] when it comes to maximizing hypertrophy or strength the use of only one exercise will likely not achieve this and as we've seen from the two longitudinal studies in this video the push-up actually has quite a good carry over to bench press strength thanks for making it to the end of the video if you enjoyed it it would be greatly appreciated if you leave a like also let me know what you thought of this video what are your opinions on the bench press and push up do you perform either or even both in your training program i have plenty of more videos planned so if you think you'd enjoy my videos it'd be awesome if you consider [Music] subscribing

    "title": "How HARD Should You Workout? - This NEW Study is Epic",
    "published_at": "2024-03-04T11:59:59Z",
    "transcript": "[Music] welcome to the house of hypertrophy what would you say is the most important training variable I'd say how close to failure you train with your repetitions is arguably the most important simply because getting close to failure ensures High muscle fiber Recruitment and tension which are critical for stimulating muscle hypertrophy but how close to failure are we talking about do you actually need to train to failure the point where you physically cannot perform another full repetition some believe reaching this is NE necessary for various reasons one is that training to failure ensures we squeeze out as many so-called effective reps as possible on the other hand others say it's sufficient to stop a few reps short of failure perhaps three to one reps from failure some say this better balances stimulus and fatigue a brand new study which I'd say is the best designed one to date has compared training to failure to stopping short of failure let us dissect this paper fit it into the rest of the research and then provide some recommendations to help you more effectively put on muscle at least five things make this study truly welld designed we'll reveal these as we describe the protocol and results of the study the researchers recruited 18 trained individuals with an average of 7.7 years of training experience this is the first great thing as this is the highest level of experience to date in studies exploring training into failure half of them had competed in powerlifting or bodybuilding the subjects performed the unilateral leg press and unilateral leg extension twice per week for 8 weeks with one leg they performed all sets to complete momentary muscular failure there is actually footage of one of the researchers supervising a subject going to failure and this assures us we can be confident failure was indeed reached brutality with their other leg all leg press sets were performed with two repetitions in reserve that is they stopped at the point they felt two more reps could be completed all leg extension sets were performed with one repetition in reserve you may be thinking how do I know if subjects accurately judge their had one or two reps in reserve well the researchers tested their accuracy before the study and it was found they were highly accurate they were off by less than one repetition in both a one rep in reserve and three reps in reserve test so I believe we can be fairly confident the subjects were more or less hitting the targets here is also footage of a leg press set performed with two repetitions in reserve so this is the second great thing we have reason to be confident subjects train sufficiently hard the third great thing is the simple fact each subject trained both conditions one leg trained to failure and the other not to failure in other words the same people were in the failure and non-f failure conditions which means that factors that differ between subjects like genetics nutritional intake and outside lifestyle are less likely to confound our results moreover this design also means we have more subjects in each condition compare this to if we just assigned 18 subjects into either a failure and non-f failure group we just have nine subjects in each condition it is valuable to know the number of dominant legs was equally split in each condition and every session alternated which leg was trained first how many sets did the subjects perform the researchers recorded how many sets for the quads each subject performed in their regular training before the study and each subject continue training with this number throughout the study for example say a subject was performing 12 weekly sets for the quads before the study in this study they performed 12 weekly sets equally divided between the exercises and the training sessions halfway through the study set numbers were increased by 20% so with our 12 we set example you'd now be performing 14 weekly sets this is the fourth great thing some studies just have all subjects perform identical set numbers but the problem with doing this is some subjects may be performing way more or way fewer sets than they're usually accustomed to which possibly confounds the study as an additional note during the training sessions subjects rested 4 minutes between leg press sets and 2 minutes between leg extension sets loads were increased whenever necessary to keep subjects reaching the desired proximity to failure within the specified rep ranges the fifth and final great thing was the researchers had subjects track their nutrition with an app that gave them individualized protein carob fat and overall calorie targets to attain a monthly weight gain of 1% here are the average nutritional intake and body weight changes across the 8 weeks there is a very interesting finding surrounding Regional hypertrophy that will uncover in a second but first overall quadriceps growth which was the average of the rectus florus and vastus lateralis in this case was similar between both conditions in other words leaving one to two reps in reserve was able to produce similar growth to training to failure this is in line with what other scientific papers have found now there was a meta agression last year that seemingly suggested Ed training to failure is superior but as I detailed in the previous video I believe this meta aggression is evidence of how getting close to failure is required but as the authors of that paper mentioned there were key considerations that meant it absolutely does not prove training to failure is superior besides that we have other metaanalyses which combine the results of numerous individual studies finding muscle growth is similar between training to failure and not training to failure and here are the summaries of three other papers that I think are welld designed finding not training to failure was similar to training to failure for hypertrophy the numbers in the papers imply the subjects not training to failure were probably stopping three or fewer reps from failure with a majority of training likely leaving one to two reps in reserve I alluded to an interesting finding about Regional hypertrophy what was I told talking about remember the quadriceps growth in this study was averaged from the rectus femoris and vasus lateralis however when looking at just the vastest lateralis the growth slightly favored the leg that trained to failure but when looking at the rectus florus the growth slightly favored the leg that did not train to failure the researchers provide a fascinating speculation the leg press was always trained before the leg extension in the training sessions there's evidence as will be covered in future videos at the house of hypertrophy that the leg press better grows the vastest lateralis while the leg extension better grows the rectus femoris with the leg that trained to failure failure might have maximized the stimulus on the leg press and thus explains the better vastest lateralis growth but the fatigue from this may have subsequently impaired the stimulus on the leg extension thus explaining the slightly worse rectus foror growth if true this suggests an intriguing interaction between between failure and exercise order although there is evidence against this specifically this paper was briefly presented earlier it had trained individuals also perform the leg press before the leg extension with one leg going to complete failure and the other leg likely stopping one to two reps from failure these researchers only measured vastest lateralis hypertrophy and if the logic stated moments ago is true we'd expect the failure leg to see slightly better V lateralis hypertrophy but this didn't happen the gains were actually nonsignificantly better for the non-failure leg so in total I don't think we can definitely say what explains these slight hypertrophy differences before providing some key takeaways it is worth touching on fatigue the researchers took indirect neuromuscular fatigue measurements during the training sessions and they partially suggest as the week's went by training to failure somewhat improved fatigue resistance on the leg press for those interested in the details behind this I describ this in the pinned comment anyhow the researchers didn't measure fatigue and Recovery in the days after the training sessions but we can generally be confident recovery is always going to be quicker when not training to failure for example this paper had trained individuals perform six sets on the barbell bench press training to failure on all sets led to slower recovery and more soreness compared to leaving one and three reps in reserve considering this if you're someone trying to limit fatigue for a variety of potential reasons this is best done by not training to failure yet this absolutely does not mean the fatigue from training to failure is always concerning and unmanageable we've clearly seen it doesn't harm growth in many cases moreover as described previously at the house of hypertrophy I think it's likely as you accustom yourself to training to failure your body produces a range of adaptations that partly reduce the fatigue damage and soreness you experience it can be tricky and very challenging to construct your own muscle building program but the alpha

by 20% I truly believe the app is exceptional and I hope you'll enjoy it [Music] too stopping a few rep short to failur seems to be able to produce similar muscle growth to training to failure however there are three final things you may consider remember that in the new study subjects were performing the same number of sets they were accustomed to with a 20% increase Midway through the study the authors noted this resulted in subjects largely performing 10 to 17 weekly sets for the quads throughout the study much of the other well-designed literature on training to failure used 6 to 19 weekly sets per muscle group thus the results are specific to this broad set number range some people may like to train with a very low number of weekly sets per muscle group we know this is likely not optimal for hypertrophy on average but we've described previously how this can be a time efficient way to see some Fair growth in this context it's possible training to failure is better in fact this study had subjects largely performed two weekly sets per muscle group one group went to complete failure while another stopped just shy of failure muscle mass increases were better with training to failure although the muscle mass measures in this paper were not the most precise so more studies are needed to validate this but if you are someone who trains with a very low number of weekly sets per muscle group it is generally more manageable to train to failure the second consideration is it's entirely possible to combine both failure and non-failure training into a program there could be benefits to this and it would be neat to have future studies exploring combining both in any case one benefit is that regularly having some failure in your program can keep you accustomed to how failure feels which could help your accuracy when you choose to leave reps in reserve the third consideration is the type of exercise currently the majority of the highest quality literature on training to failure has trained the quads a muscle group that is tough to train to failure but with isolation exercises that train smaller muscles it is relatively easier and less demanding to train to failure in fact some might suggest with these kinds of exercises training to failure is superior but the current limited evidence isn't Crystal clear one study seems to suggest with a barbell biceps curl training to failure was Superior to leaving around three or four reps in reserve but another suggests with the same exercise leaving one or two reps in reserve was similar to failure anyhow If You're Happy and capable of doing so you may choose to push the failure on the majority of your upper body isolation work thank you for watching feel free to check out the alpha progression

    "title": "Muscle Confusion Produces Sarcoplasmic Hypertrophy (New Study)",
    "published_at": "2022-03-14T12:07:02Z",
    "transcript": "There are probably an infinite number\u00a0\nof ways to train for hypertrophy. Broadly, most people seem to perform the same\u00a0\nweekly workouts, at least for a few months. But, alternatively, an individual could randomly\u00a0\nchange their training variables across workouts. In one session you may perform more\u00a0\nsets on your exercises than usual,\u00a0\u00a0 the next session you may\u00a0\nuse a different rep range,\u00a0\u00a0 the session after this you change your rest\u00a0\ninterval durations between sets, and so forth. The common justification behind frequently\u00a0\u00a0 changing training variables relates\u00a0\nto confusing or shocking the muscle. The idea is usually presented as follows: your\u00a0\nmuscles very quickly adapt to a given stimulus,\u00a0\u00a0 meaning training with the same routine\u00a0\nweek after week makes a plateau inevitable.\u00a0\u00a0 To avoid this, frequency changing\u00a0\ntraining variables is necessary\u00a0\u00a0 to keep your muscles guessing\u00a0\nand exposed to the unknown. This idea is described in many articles online. Even bodybuilders, such as Arnold,\u00a0\ncan be found discussing this. So, does frequenctly changing training\u00a0\nvariables stimulate more muscle hypertrophy? A new study by Fox et al. gives us an insight. The researchers reported their results across\u00a0\n2 different papers. So when discussing the\u00a0\u00a0 results later, I would have pulled these\u00a0\nresults from the two different papers. 20 men with an average age of 26, with an\u00a0\naverage of 2.5 years of training experience,\u00a0\u00a0 were recruited. Each subject had one leg assigned\u00a0\nto a variation condition,\u00a0\u00a0 and their other leg assigned\u00a0\nto a constant condition. Subjects trained both legs twice\u00a0\nper week for a total of 8 weeks. With the leg assigned to the constant\u00a0\ncondition, each training session,\u00a0\u00a0 they performed 4 sets of 9-12 repetitions\u00a0\nto failure on the unilateral leg press,\u00a0\u00a0 and 4 sets of 9-12 repetitions to\u00a0\nfailure on the unilateral leg extension. They rested 2 minutes between\u00a0\nsets, and loads were adjusted\u00a0\u00a0 each set and over sessions to ensure 9-12\u00a0\nrepetitions to failure were performed. With the leg assigned to the variation condition,\u00a0\neach session, subjects performed either one of\u00a0\u00a0 4 different training protocols in\u00a0\na randomized and balanced fashion: The first training protocol varied repetition\u00a0\nnumbers. It had subjects perform 4 sets of\u00a0\u00a0 25-30 repetitions to failure on the unilateral\u00a0\nleg press, and 4 sets of 25-30 repetitions to\u00a0\u00a0 failure on the unilateral leg extension.\u00a0\n2 minutes of rest between sets was used. The second training protocol varied set\u00a0\nnumbers. It had subjects perform 8 sets of\u00a0\u00a0 9-12 repetitions to failure on the unilateral\u00a0\nleg press, and 8 sets of 9-12 repetitions to\u00a0\u00a0 failure on the unilateral leg extension.\u00a0\n2 minutes of rest between sets was used. The third training protocol varied contraction\u00a0\ntype. More precisely, it had subjects perform\u00a0\u00a0 4 sets of 10 eccentric contractions on\u00a0\nthe leg press and 4 sets of 10 eccentric\u00a0\u00a0 contractions on the leg extension. The load used\u00a0\nto perform these eccentric contractions was 110%\u00a0\u00a0 of the load they would have\u00a0\nused during normal repetitions.\u00a0\u00a0 2 minutes of rest was also used\u00a0\nbetween sets in this session. The fourth and final training protocol\u00a0\nvaried rest interval duration.\u00a0\u00a0 It had subjects perform 4 sets of 9-12\u00a0\nrepetitions to failure on the leg press and\u00a0\u00a0 4 sets of 9-12 repetitions to failure on the leg\u00a0\nextension, with 4 minutes of rest between sets. So, just to restate and make everything\u00a0\nclear, the constant condition used the\u00a0\u00a0 same training variables every session,\u00a0\nwhile the variation condition did not. Rather, the variation condition involved\u00a0\nperforming either one of four different\u00a0\u00a0 training protocols in a session in\u00a0\na randomized and balanced fashion. After the 8 weeks of training,\u00a0\nvastus lateralis cross-sectional area\u00a0\u00a0 increased similarly between both the\u00a0\nvariation and constant conditions. Increases in cross-sectional area of muscle\u00a0\nfibers obtained from the vastus lateralis\u00a0\u00a0 were also similar between both the\u00a0\nvariation and constant conditions. The researchers also measured\u00a0\nan array of things within the\u00a0\u00a0 muscle fibers obtained from the vastus lateralis. Perhaps the most interesting thing they found\u00a0\nwas how the two different training conditions\u00a0\u00a0 impacted the space taken up by\u00a0\nmyofibrils within the muscle fibers. Before detailing what was found,\u00a0\nit's worth ensuring we understand\u00a0\u00a0 what myofibrils are as well as the\u00a0\nrest of what makes up muscle fibers. Within muscle fibers are myofibrils. Myofibrils\u00a0\nconsist of an array of units called sarcomeres.\u00a0\u00a0 Sarcomeres are what generate force. That is,\u00a0\nthey are what generates a muscle's force. Everything aside from the myofibrils within the\u00a0\nmuscle fiber can be considered the sarcoplasm.\u00a0\u00a0 The sarcoplasm is largely water, but within\u00a0\nit also resides components like glycogen,\u00a0\u00a0 sarcoplasmic proteins, and other\u00a0\nnon-contractile organelles. Returning to the study's findings,\u00a0\nbefore the training intervention,\u00a0\u00a0 the muscle fibers from the vastus lateralis\u00a0\nwere comprised of around 70% myofibrils. By the end of the training intervention,\u00a0\nthe constant condition still had roughly 70%\u00a0\u00a0 of their vastus lateralis\u00a0\nfibers comprised of myofibrils. However, the variation condition's vastus\u00a0\u00a0 lateralis muscle fibers now\u00a0\nonly contained 61% myofibrils. What does this mean? Recall that both conditions experienced similar\u00a0\nincreases in cross-sectional area of muscle fibers\u00a0\u00a0 obtained from the vastus lateralis. That\u00a0\nis, muscle fiber hypertrophy was similar. Given the constant condition saw no change in\u00a0\nthe relative space taken up by the myofibrils\u00a0\u00a0 (it remained at roughly 70%), muscle\u00a0\nfiber hypertrophy was achieved\u00a0\u00a0 via proportion growth of the\u00a0\nmyofibrils and sarcoplasm.\u00a0\u00a0 In other words, the myofibrils and sarcoplasm\u00a0\ngrew at the same pace, resulting in the\u00a0\u00a0 myofibrils still occupying the same relative\u00a0\nspace (again, 70%) of the muscle fiber. This type of muscle fiber hypertrophy,\u00a0\nwhere the myofibrils and sarcoplasm\u00a0\u00a0 both grow at the same pace, can be called\u00a0\n\"conventional\" or \"myofibrillar\" hypertrophy. Contrasting to this, given the\u00a0\nvariation condition saw a decrease\u00a0\u00a0 in the relative space taken up by the\u00a0\nmyofibrils (from roughly 70% to 61%),\u00a0\u00a0 muscle fiber hypertrophy for this condition would\u00a0\nhave been achieved via the sarcoplasm growing\u00a0\u00a0 relatively more than the myofibrils, resulting in\u00a0\nthe myofibrils now taking up less relative space. This type of muscle fiber hypertrophy,\u00a0\nwhere the sarcoplasm grows relatively\u00a0\u00a0 more than the myofibrils, can be\u00a0\ncalled \"sarcoplasmic\" hypertrophy. As a side note, sarcoplasmic hypertrophy does not\u00a0\nmean the myofibrils decreased in size. Rather,\u00a0\u00a0 they might have grown to some degree, or they\u00a0\nmay not have grown at all. The key point with\u00a0\u00a0 sarcoplasmic hypertrophy is just the sarcoplasm\u00a0\ngrew relatively more than the myofibrils,\u00a0\u00a0 which is why the percentage of space\u00a0\noccupied by the myofibrils decreases. To summarize the key findings of the study,\u00a0\nfrequently changing training variables does\u00a0\u00a0 not produce more hypertrophy versus training with\u00a0\nthe same routine, but it is not any worse either. Therefore, this study does not support the\u00a0\nnotions of muscle confusion or shocking. Intriguingly, despite similar\u00a0\nmagnitudes of hypertrophy,\u00a0\u00a0 the type of hypertrophy at the muscle fiber\u00a0\nlevel seemed to differ between conditions. Frequently manipulating training variables\u00a0\nappeared to produce sarcoplasmic hypertrophy,\u00a0\u00a0 while maintaining the same training variables\u00a0\nappeared to produce myofibrillar hypertrophy\u00a0\u00a0 (also called conventional hypertrophy). Why would this be the case? Currently, it's not clear whatsoever. The research\u00a0\non what occurs within muscle fibers is very much\u00a0\u00a0 in its infancy, and it's very difficult\u00a0\nto scientifically pinpoint why certain\u00a0\u00a0 training methods would cause sarcoplasmic\u00a0\nhypertrophy or myofibrillar hypertrophy. But allow me to share one speculation. Myofibrillar hypertrophy, as it\u00a0\ninvolves proportional growth of\u00a0\u00a0 the myofibrils and sarcoplasm, would most\u00a0\nlikely be quite beneficial for strength,\u00a0\u00a0 as remember, the myofibrils\u00a0\nare what generate force.\u00a0\u00a0 Perhaps training with a constant routine and\u00a0\noverloading by progressing load (which is what\u00a0\u00a0 the constant condition more or less involved)\u00a0\nis conducive towards this type of hypertrophy. Conversely, the variation condition actually ended\u00a0\nup accumulating more volume load (the product of\u00a0\u00a0 sets x reps x load) by the end of this study.\u00a0\nPerhaps this, the fact it involved more work,\u00a0\u00a0 was more conductive towards sarcoplasmic\u00a0\nhypertrophy. I speculate this is as\u00a0\u00a0 although it's far from clear what drives the\u00a0\ndisproportionate sarcoplasm growth relative\u00a0\u00a0 to myofibril growth (which we know is what\u00a0\nsarcoplasmic hypertrophy is), it's possible\u00a0\u00a0 an increase in energy generating components\u00a0\nwithin the muscle fiber could be involved. I should again note this is purely speculation.\u00a0\u00a0 As noted earlier, the researchers did measure an\u00a0\narray of things within the muscle fibers obtained\u00a0\u00a0 from the vastus lateralis. We explored\u00a0\nthe myofibril space measurements already. But, they also found that a range of\u00a0\nenergy-generating components within the sarcoplasm\u00a0\u00a0 was unchanged by either training condition,\u00a0\nwhile total sarcoplasmic protein concentrations,\u00a0\u00a0 perhaps paradoxically, actually only\u00a0\nincreased with the constant condition.\u00a0\u00a0 These details POTENTIALLY oppose\u00a0\nthe notion the variation condition's\u00a0\u00a0 sarcoplasmic hypertrophy would be explained by\u00a0\nan increase in energy generating components. Overall, I think the findings of\u00a0\nthis study are extremely interesting.\u00a0\u00a0 It emphasizes how although two different\u00a0\ntraining programs may produce similar whole\u00a0\u00a0 muscle hypertrophy or similar fiber hypertrophy,\u00a0\nthe changes within the fiber may not be identical. This makes me think about the broader resistance\u00a0\ntraining literature, where it's common to see two\u00a0\u00a0 training protocols producing similar\u00a0\nwhole muscle or fiber hypertrophy. For example, light loads (30% one-rep max\u00a0\nloads) have been shown to produce similar\u00a0\u00a0 whole muscle and fiber hypertrophy\u00a0\nto heavier (80% one-rep max) loads. In some other areas, different training\u00a0\nfrequencies and volumes have also been\u00a0\u00a0 shown to be similarly effective\u00a0\nfor whole muscle hypertrophy. Despite this, I wonder if growth within the\u00a0\nfibers is different between these various things. Ultimately, the research of exploring what\u00a0\noccurs within muscle fibers is in its infancy,\u00a0\u00a0 and it will be extremely interesting\u00a0\nto how this research area develops\u00a0\u00a0 in the future and the potential\u00a0\nimplications it may put forth. Before closing out the video,\u00a0\u00a0 I think it's worth touching on some\u00a0\nnoteworthy limitations of the study. Firstly, there were actually some\u00a0\nmeasurement disagreements. Let me explain. We already detailed how training impacted\u00a0\nthe space taken up by myofibrils within\u00a0\u00a0 the muscle fibers. These measures were done\u00a0\nvia something called phalloidin staining. However, using a method called SDS-PAGE, the\u00a0\nresearchers aimed to determine the amount of\u00a0\u00a0 actin and myosin heavy chain per mg of wet\u00a0\ntissue from the vastus lateralis fibers. Actin and myosin heavy chains are\u00a0\nboth proteins found within myofibrils. If we saw no change in the amount of actin or\u00a0\nmyosin heavy chain per mg of wet tissue after\u00a0\u00a0 training, unless I'm mistaken, this fundamentally\u00a0\nimplies these myofibril proteins still take up the\u00a0\u00a0 same relative space within the muscle fibers.\u00a0\nThis is indicative of myofibrillar hypertrophy. Conversely, if the amount of actin or myosin\u00a0\nheavy chain per mg of wet tissue DECREASES after\u00a0\u00a0 training, unless I'm mistaken, this fundamentally\u00a0\nimplies these myofibril proteins take up less\u00a0\u00a0 relative space within the muscle fibers. This\u00a0\nis indicative of sarcoplasmic hypertrophy. What the researchers found was the amount of\u00a0\nactin per mg of wet tissue decreased for the\u00a0\u00a0 variation condition, while it remained\u00a0\nunchanged for the constant condition.\u00a0\u00a0 This indicates the variation condition\u00a0\nperhaps experienced sarcoplasmic hypertrophy,\u00a0\u00a0 while the constant condition\u00a0\nexperienced myofibrillar hypertrophy.\u00a0\u00a0 As we know, this is in line with the\u00a0\nconclusions from the phalloidin staining. However, the researchers found that the\u00a0\namount of myosin heavy chain per mg of\u00a0\u00a0 wet tissue decreased both for the\u00a0\nvariation and constant conditions,\u00a0\u00a0 thereby potentially implying both\u00a0\nconditions saw sarcoplasmic hypertrophy. Unless I've misinterpreted\u00a0\nsomething, this is conflicting,\u00a0\u00a0 and it's difficult to reconcile these measurement\u00a0\ndisagreements. I believe different tissue samples\u00a0\u00a0 would have been used for these various measures,\u00a0\nso this might play some explanatory role. The second noteworthy limitation is\u00a0\nthe potential sarcoplasmic hypertrophy\u00a0\u00a0 experienced by the variation condition\u00a0\nCOULD merely be a result of swelling. Allow me to explain. In response to lifting weights that produce\u00a0\na high amount of muscle fiber damage,\u00a0\u00a0 muscle fibers can swell for\u00a0\nnumerous hours and days after. This swelling is a build-up\u00a0\nof water within muscle fibers,\u00a0\u00a0 and thus technically can be\u00a0\nconsidered sarcoplasmic hypertrophy. This swelling is only transient\u00a0\nand dissipates eventually. When lifting weights for weeks on end, your\u00a0\nbody does incrementally adapt such that the\u00a0\u00a0 amount of muscle damage it experiences\u00a0\nafter training decreases over time. The adaptations produced by\u00a0\nyour body to be resilient to\u00a0\u00a0 damage have been called the repeated bout effect. However, and this is the key point,\u00a0\nthe repeated bout effect is likely best\u00a0\u00a0 when you are consistently training with\u00a0\nmore or less the same training variables\u00a0\u00a0 (which is what the constant condition involved). When frequently changing training variables\u00a0\n(as the variation condition involved),\u00a0\u00a0 it's likely the repeated bout effect\u00a0\nwould occur to a lower extent. Based on this, perhaps the variation condition has\u00a0\nnotable muscle swelling after the study (due to\u00a0\u00a0 muscle damage), thus explaining the sarcoplasmic\u00a0\nhypertrophy measured by the researchers. Stated another way, it was not\u00a0\ntrue sarcoplasmic hypertrophy. The researchers took their measurements\u00a0\n3 days after the final training session,\u00a0\u00a0 but it's not clear if this\u00a0\ntimeframe is sufficient to allow\u00a0\u00a0 any potential swelling to disappear under\u00a0\nthe training intervention's circumstances. Ultimately, this all is merely\u00a0\nspeculation, it might or might not be true.\u00a0 Unfortunately, the researchers did not\u00a0\ntake any measurements to assess if swelling\u00a0\u00a0 could have confounded the results, so\u00a0\nnothing definitive can be concluded. Anyway, Thank you for watching,\u00a0\nI truly hope you found the video\u00a0\u00a0 interesting and informative in some way!"

    "transcript": "It's not uncommon to hear that\u00a0\nvolume drives muscle hypertrophy. Specifically, it's thought more volume\u00a0\ncould produce more muscle hypertrophy,\u00a0\u00a0 probably up until a certain point. However, volume is quite a broad term. In\u00a0\ngeneral, it refers to how much work you perform. This can be quantified in a variety of ways,\u00a0\nincluding the number of sets you perform for\u00a0\u00a0 an exercise or muscle group, the product of\u00a0\nthe number of sets and repetitions you perform,\u00a0\u00a0 the product of the number of sets,\u00a0\nrepetitions, and loads you use,\u00a0\u00a0 or even the product of the number of sets,\u00a0\nrepetitions, load, and range of motion you use. Volume load is the product of the number of sets,\u00a0\nrepetitions, and loads you use. For example,\u00a0\u00a0 if you perform 3 sets of 10 repetitions on\u00a0\nthe barbell bench press with a 100kg load,\u00a0\u00a0 this equals a volume load\u00a0\nof 3000kg for this exercise. It's not uncommon to see individuals state that\u00a0\nvolume load is what drives muscle hypertrophy.\u00a0\u00a0 I've even come across numerous researchers\u00a0\nwho have suggested this in their papers. In this video, I'll detail why this is a mistake,\u00a0\u00a0 and why I believe volume load is\u00a0\nactually unrelated to muscle hypertrophy. First, we'll evaluate some research that may lead\u00a0\nyou to believe volume load drives hypertrophy,\u00a0\u00a0 then we'll then look at numerous other papers\u00a0\u00a0 which demonstrate volume load\u00a0\nis not related to hypertrophy. Finally, we'll briefly touch on what form of\u00a0\u00a0 volume likely drives hypertrophy.  \nLet us begin with the research that\u00a0\u00a0 may lead you to assume volume\u00a0\nload drives muscle hypertrophy. One example comes from the research on rep ranges. Schoenfeld et al. had 17 men with at least\u00a0\u00a0 1 year of training experience\u00a0\nperform a range of exercises. One group of subjects, who we'll call a\u00a0\nstrength group, performed each exercise for\u00a0\u00a0 7 sets of 3 repetitions to failure (the point\u00a0\nat which no more repetitions can be peformed). Another group of subjects, who\u00a0\nwe'll call the hypertrophy group,\u00a0\u00a0 performed each exercise for 3\u00a0\nsets of 10 repetitions to failure. The reason the strength group performed more sets\u00a0\u00a0 per exercise was to equate the\u00a0\nvolume load between both groups. Both groups attempted to increase the load\u00a0\nthey used within their rep range every week. After 8 weeks of training, the\u00a0\ntotal volume load performed on\u00a0\u00a0 each exercise was similar between both groups.\u00a0\u00a0 Moreover, increases in a biceps growth\u00a0\nmeasurement were similar between both groups. Therefore, given volume load was similar\u00a0\nbetween both groups, and both groups seem to\u00a0\u00a0 have experienced similar hypertrophy, you may\u00a0\nthink volume load may be driving hypertrophy. Another example comes from the\u00a0\nresearch on rest intervals. Schoenfeld et al. had 13 men with at least 6\u00a0\nmonths of training experience perform a range of\u00a0\u00a0 exercises each for 3 sets of repetitions to\u00a0\nfailure with an 8-12 rep-max load, three times per\u00a0\u00a0 week for 8 weeks. All subjects aimed to increase\u00a0\nthe load used within the rep range every week. One group of subjects, who\u00a0\nwe'll call a long rest group,\u00a0\u00a0 performed this while resting\u00a0\nfor 3 minutes between sets. Another group of subjects, who\u00a0\nwe'll call a short rest group,\u00a0\u00a0 performed this while resting\u00a0\nfor 1 minute between sets. Throughout the 8 weeks of training, the long\u00a0\nrest group was achieving greater volume loads on\u00a0\u00a0 all their exercises versus the short rest group.\u00a0\nThis makes sense, as resting for longer between\u00a0\u00a0 sets enables you to perform more repetitions\u00a0\nto failure, thus increasing the volume load. By the end of the study, increases in\u00a0\ngrowth measurements for the elbow flexors,\u00a0\u00a0 triceps brachii, anterior quadriceps, and\u00a0\nvastus lateralis favored the long rest group. Therefore, as the as the long rest\u00a0\ngroup peformed higher volume loads,\u00a0\u00a0 and experienced greater muscle growth,\u00a0\u00a0 the results would lead you to assume higher\u00a0\nvolume loads drive more muscle hypertrophy. So, the two examples we've just given support\u00a0\nthe idea that volume load may drive hypertrophy. If studies like these were\u00a0\nthe only ones that existed,\u00a0\u00a0 the evidence would be indeed promising that\u00a0\nvolume load is a driver of hypertrophy. However, there does exist many other\u00a0\nstudies in which volume load appears\u00a0\u00a0 to be unrelated to hypertrophy.  \nIf we examined the research on rep\u00a0\u00a0 ranges in more depth, we'd find great evidence\u00a0\nvolume load does not drive muscle hypertrophy. As explored in previous videos, there's quite\u00a0\na bit of evidence that with all other training\u00a0\u00a0 variables equal, performing repetitions to\u00a0\nor very close to failure with a 30% one-rep\u00a0\u00a0 max load is as effective for muscle hypertrophy as\u00a0\u00a0 performing repetitions to or very close\u00a0\nto failure with an 80% one-rep max load. As a note, an individual can roughly perform\u00a0\n30-ish repetitions to failure with a 30%\u00a0\u00a0 one-rep max load, and roughly 8 to 12 repetitions\u00a0\nto failure with an 80% one-rep max load. Now, here's the thing, the volume load\u00a0\nyou achieve with a 30% one-rep max load\u00a0\u00a0 is greater than the volume load you\u00a0\nachieve with an 80% one-rep max load. For instance, Lim et al. had 21\u00a0\npreviously untrained men train the\u00a0\u00a0 leg press and leg extension each for three\u00a0\nsets, three times per week for 10 weeks. One group of subjects performed repetitions\u00a0\nto failure each set with a 30% one-rep\u00a0\u00a0 max load, while another group of subjects peformed\u00a0\u00a0 repetitions to failure each set\u00a0\nwith an 80% one-rep max load. The average volume load used for\u00a0\nboth exercises was greater for the\u00a0\u00a0 subjects that trained with a 30% one-rep max load. However, growth of slow-twitch\u00a0\nand fast-twitch fibers from the\u00a0\u00a0 vastus lateralis muscle was similar between\u00a0\ntraining with a 30% and 80% one-rep max load. Therefore, the rep range research\u00a0\ndemonstrates that higher volume loads do\u00a0\u00a0 not neccessarily produce more muscle hypertrophy. Additionally, the rep range research also\u00a0\ndemonstrates that your ability to increase\u00a0\u00a0 the volume load you perform overtime probably\u00a0\ndoesn't relate to muscle hypertrophy either. Illustrating this, Schoenfeld et al. had a group\u00a0\nof men with between 1.5 to 9 years of training\u00a0\u00a0 experience perform a range of exercises each\u00a0\nfor 3 sets, three times per week for 8 weeks. One group of subjects,\u00a0\u00a0 who we'll call a high rep group, performed\u00a0\n25-35 repetitions to failure each set. Another group of subjects, who\u00a0\nwe'll call a moderate rep group,\u00a0\u00a0 performed 8-12 repetitions to failure each set. Both groups attempted to increase the load they\u00a0\ncould lift within their rep ranges every week. By the 8th and final week of the study,\u00a0\nthe high rep group had increased their\u00a0\u00a0 volume load performed for all exercises\u00a0\nby 31,305kg compared to the first week. Opposingly, the moderate rep\u00a0\ngroup, compared to the first week,\u00a0\u00a0 increased their volume load performed\u00a0\nfor all exercises only by 10,714kg. However, as we know from other data, both the\u00a0\nhigh rep and moderate rep groups would likely have\u00a0\u00a0 experienced similar muscle hypertrophy, indicating\u00a0\nyour ability to increase volume load overtime is\u00a0\u00a0 likely not related to muscle hypertrophy. Progressing further, the research on\u00a0\ntraining to failure further supports\u00a0\u00a0 the idea volume load is not a\u00a0\ndriver of muscle hypertrophy. Training to failure would result\u00a0\nin a higher volume load compared\u00a0\u00a0 to stopping your repetitions\u00a0\na couple short of failure. However, the research generally seems to show\u00a0\nthat performing your repetitions 1 to 3 reps\u00a0\u00a0 away from failure is similarly effective to\u00a0\ntraining to failure for muscle hypertrophy. For example, Santanielo et al. had men\u00a0\nwith an average of 5 years of training\u00a0\u00a0 experience perform the unilateral leg\u00a0\npress and unilateral leg extension\u00a0\u00a0 with a 75% one-rep max load,\u00a0\ntwice per week for 10 weeks. Subjects trained one leg with repetitions to\u00a0\nfailure, we'll call this the failure condition. Their other leg performed repetitions\u00a0\nroughly 3-1 reps away from failure.\u00a0\u00a0 We'll call this the non-failure condition. The total volume load performed in the 10\u00a0\nweeks was greater with the failure condition.\u00a0\u00a0 However, growth of the vastus lateralis\u00a0\nwas similar between both conditions,\u00a0\u00a0 further supporting the idea volume\u00a0\nload does not drive muscle hypertrophy. As a final point, there's evidence\u00a0\nif you equate training volume load\u00a0\u00a0 between a condition that trains to failure,\u00a0\u00a0 and one that trains very far from failure,\u00a0\nmuscle hypertrophy outcomes are dissimilar. Demonstrating this, a study by Lasevicuis\u00a0\net al. had previously untrained men perform\u00a0\u00a0 the unilateral leg extension with a 30%\u00a0\none-rep max load, twice per week for 8 weeks. Each session, subjects trained one leg\u00a0\nwith 3 sets of repetitions to failure.\u00a0\u00a0 We'll call this the failure condition. With their other leg, they aimed performed\u00a0\nroughly 7 sets of repetitions that were\u00a0\u00a0 roughly 14 repetitions away from failure.\u00a0\nWe'll call this the non-failure condition. By the end of the study, total training volume\u00a0\nload was similar between both conditions.\u00a0\u00a0 However, quadriceps growth was much\u00a0\ngreater for the failure condition,\u00a0\u00a0 demonstrating volume load is not\u00a0\nnecessarily related to muscle hypertrophy. To conclude,\u00a0\u00a0 despite there being some evidence that may lead\u00a0\nyou to believe volume load drives hypertrophy,\u00a0\u00a0 other studies falsify this by demonstrating\u00a0\nvolume load is unrelated to muscle hypertrophy. So, if volume load is not the form of volume\u00a0\nthat relates to muscle growth, what is?. It seems the number of sets you perform for your\u00a0\u00a0 muscle groups is what appears to\u00a0\nbe related to muscle hypertrophy. More precisely, in this case, a set would\u00a0\nprobably be defined as a bout of repetitions\u00a0\u00a0 between 5 and 35, performed 3 or fewer\u00a0\nrepetitions from the point of failure. Next video, we'll be attempting to\u00a0\nuncover the precise relationship\u00a0\u00a0 the number of sets you perform\u00a0\nhas with muscle hypertrophy. We'll be aiming to answer questions such as\u00a0\ndo more sets always equal more hypertrophy?\u00a0\u00a0 Is there a point where more sets provide\u00a0\nno further benefit for muscle hypertrophy,\u00a0\u00a0 or even a point where more sets\u00a0\nactually reduces hypertrophy?"

    "transcript": "welcome to the house of hypertrophy in this video we're discussing some misconceptions in the muscle and strength building realm that aren't frequently discussed precisely we're touching on strength versus size Progressive overload and how stiff lifting weights may make you some suggest getting stronger directly causes you to get bigger a couple of studies on High level power lifters find very strong correlations between lean mass and strength on the bench press Squat and deadlift therefore some may use this data to suggest getting strong clearly causes muscle hypertrophy however I believe this is the wrong way around instead getting bigger causes you to get stronger you see muscle hypertrophy is largely achieved by increasing the number of force generating units muscle fibers have and this can directly increase in muscle strength so it's more accurate to say getting bigger causes you to get stronger not the other way around if it was the other way around you'd expect to lifting the heaviest loads you can for a single rep multiple times per week to be effective at building muscle this is called to training with your one rep max however we have three studies that find although one rep max training was highly effective for producing strength gains It produced virtually no hypertrophy whatsoever I plan to have more videos on strength versus size and there are many complexities and controversies for now know my thoughts are that on an individual level the strongest version of yourself will likely require you to be near the most muscularly developed version of yourself again I'll have more in-depth videos in the future dissecting why I believe the literature indicates this despite various areas of complexities and controversies [Music] typically people Progressive overload their training sessions by lifting heavier or performing more repetitions some suggest Progressive overload causes muscle and strength gains strictly speaking this isn't wrong but it is somewhat deceptive if you purely believe Progressive overload cause muscle and strength gains this may lead to two mistakes the first is you always try to force Progressive overload unintentionally you may compromise your form to lift heavier or perform more repetitions the second is you may always try to select exercises that are easier to Progressive overload long term this isn't inherently bad but assuming exercises that are easier to Progressive overload are superior for muscle hypertrophy isn't always correct I'll have an example in a second what most people tend to miss is that your ability to Progressive overload is caused by your muscle and strength gains but by you applying Progressive overload thanks to your muscle and strength gains you have maintained a high quality training stimulus that will continue to stimulate muscle and strength gains so in this sense the idea Progressive overload causes muscle and strength gains is correct as shown on screen thinking of progressive overload as a cycle is probably a great way to think of it so yes Progressive overload can cause gains but your Progressive overloading is also because of your gains now I mentioned that full hypertrophes specifically selecting exercises that are easier to Progressive overload with the belief they build more muscle isn't correct for example this 2022 Japanese study compared overhead extensions to pushdowns and subjects progressively overloaded the push Downs to a larger extent yet triceps hypertrophy was Superior with the overhead extensions why is this due to various biomechanical factors certain exercises allow you to lift heavier loads and so have a greater capacity to be progressively overloaded long term yet these biomechanical factors that enable you to lift heavier loads on an exercise do not always mean that the muscles involved in the exercise are receiving a greater muscle building stimulus and working on a series of free Ultimate Guide videos to developing each muscle group and these will provide insights into what exercises may be the most favorable for each muscle the biceps are the first muscle we'll examine and that will be released the week after the next oh it can be common to assume lifting weights leads to your muscles being stiffer and less flexible but the evidence fails to support this a 2021 meta-analysis out of Portugal combined the results of 11 studies and found no significant difference in joint range of motion gains between lifting weights and stretching most of the 11 studies had the subject's lift full range of motion while two of them actually used a partial range of motion at long muscle lengths while the stretching training was largely static it's also worth noting that 11 studies in the meta-analysis were quite different from each other so I don't believe this meta-analysis is definitive evidence lifting weights is always as good as dedicated stretching training for increasing joint range of motion but at the very least it certainly qualifies as evidence lifting weights does not make you stiff in fact when lifting through a full range of motion or even a partial range of motion at long muscle lengths numerous studies find it can increase the length of your muscle fibers presumably conferring flexibility fits consistent training is crucial for long-term gains and Alpha progression is

    "transcript": "welcome to the house of hypertrophy how should you train to maximize triceps hypertrophy the triceps are roughly 2.5 times larger than the biceps so undeniably play a crucial role in enhancing arm size in this video we'll be deconstructing the latest scientific research examining how different compound exercises and isolation exercises may impact triceps hypertrophy so that by the end you'll have a clear riew of how you may train for complete triceps growth the triceps can be trained with compounds and isolation exercises compound exercises involve movement at two or more joints while isolation exercises primarily involve movement at one joint an excellent study from 2020 gives us a fascinating insight into how compound and isolation exercise is compared for triceps growth 43 men either train the barbell bench press only the barbell skull crusher only the bench press and then the skull crusher user or the skull crusher and then the bench press these were the training variables used in the sessions unsurprisingly the groups that trained the bench press saw the best PC major growth but it is highly interesting that training skull crushes before the bench press led to slightly less Peet growth in performing the reverse of this presumably Skull Crushers fatigued the triceps to where it subsequently became more of a limiting factor in the bench press thus compromising the PEC stimulus as for the triceps just training the bench press produced lower gains than the other groups that involved Skull Crushers interestingly the order in which the bench press and skull crusher was performed didn't have a major impact on triceps growth looking at these results you may say although the bench press grows the triceps we get much better results from the skull crusher so there's nothing special about the bench press however this isn't necessarily the correct conclusion why well the researchers examined growth across each of the three triceps heads for the long head Skull Crushers grew this very well something the bench press failed to do for the medial head both exercises grew this muscle but the percentages imply its growth what's better from Skull Crushers but for the lateral head the bench press actually grew this head very well something which the skull crusher failed to do accordingly the special thing about the bench press is when compared to a skull crusher at least although it doesn't develop the long and medial heads as well it does a better job growing the lateral head now this data just involved the barbell bench press with a two-time shoulder width grip what about closer grips and even other compound exercises with closer grips it's possible they enhance overall triceps growth there's no research comparing wider to closer grip bench pressing for actual triceps hypertrophy all we have is EMG research that inconsistently observes higher triceps activity with closer grips either way could closer grips change the pattern of growth across the three triceps heads a 2013 paper delivers potential Insight subjects perform the neutral grip dumbbell bench press this exercise is performed in the same plane as close grip barbell benching no not that plane I'm talking about plane of movement both of them occur in what we call the sagittal plane using T2 weighted Imaging to infer muscle activity which has been documented to have some associations with actual muscle hypertrophy it was found the size displayed High lateral and medial head activity this aligns with the data on wide grip barbell bench pressing that finds similar lateral and medial head hypertrophy as for the long head activity was much lower and indeed the researchers found after training this exercise for 12 weeks L head thickness did not increase thus just like the wide grip bench press closer grips likely fail to meaningfully grow the L head there's likely a sound reason for this all three heads of the triceps cross the elbow joint so can all contribute to Elbow extension but the L head additionally crosses over the shoulder joint so can partially contribute to shoulder extension and adduction during the bench press we need to lift the bar and this involves flexing the shoulder since the L head is partially involved in shoulder extension a strong contraction of it would fight against us trying to lift and flex the shoulder so it makes sense the nervous system wouldn't highly activate this muscle this logic extends to all other horizontal pressing compound exercises machine chest press variations and push-up variations it even applies the incline presses decline presses and dips so all of these exercises probably won't train the L head much rather the lateral and medial heads are likely trained in comparable ways to the bench press what about vertical presses like overhead presses since overhead presses require us to flex and autod duct the shoulder to lift the load a strong lad contraction may still fight against this and pull the arm down so perhaps this also not trains much here yet the shoulder angles traversed with vertical presses are different from horizontal presses and without direct research I'm unsure if this Alters things as for the lateral and medial heads I'm unaware of any reason to believe they wouldn't be trained at least fairly decently with vertical presses but how this compares to horizontal presses remains to be determined by Future research nevertheless summarizing this section compound exercises will absolutely contribute to developing your triceps and we saw direct evidence horizontal presses are likely great for the lateral head however it does seem likely we need isolation triceps exercises to maximize triceps hypertrophy we saw barbell Skull Crushers have been documented to grow the long and medial heads quite well and something we've yet to mention is data suggesting this likely extends to the dumbbell skull crusher very quickly this 2012 paper found the dumbbell variation produced the low activity of the lateral head which aligns with the results of the barbell skull crusher producing minimal lateral head hypertrophy as for the long and medial heads the dumbbell skull crusher produced High activity of both which aligns with the results of Baro skull crushes producing great hypertrophy of both of them but what about other triceps isolation exercises fortunately we have some great research here a 2022 paper out of Japan recruited 21 men with one arm they trained overhead extensions with their other arm they trained push Downs a supern hand grip was used and both exercises move the elbow from 90 to 0\u00b0 here were the training variables used subjects progressively overloaded whenever they could to keep training hard with the Reps subjects were able to lift heavier absolute loads on the push down through out the study despite this LGH head hypertrophy was better for the overhead extensions I think it's not a stretch to suggest the strongest explanation for this is stretch as the researchers implied in the paper and as seen in previous House of hypertrophy videos growing evidence suggests training at long muscle lengths can build more muscle remember although all three heads cross the elbow joint the long head additionally crosses the shoulder joint this actually means elevating the arm to an overhead position lengthens the L head such that overhead extensions train the L head at a relatively more stretched position compared to push Downs as for the lateral and medial heads the researchers had to combine both heads into one measurement due to problems with differentiating between them it was found this combined lateral and medial head growth was also better with the overhead extensions this was an unexpected finding and it's currently not Crystal Clear what could explain this after all the lateral and medial heads just crossed the elbow so shoulder position isn't really going to influence how much they are stretched it is also unfortunate that the researchers couldn't differentiate between the lateral and medial heads as remember Skull Crushers fail to grow the lateral head much so it would have been interesting to see how lateral head growth looked with these two exercises anyhow this study nonetheless indicates overhead extensions may be an excellent exercise for the triceps this study measured muscle volume which is a three-dimensional measure that considers all muscle regions but an interesting question is although overhead extension seem to produce overall more growth could there be some differences in the precise regions grown between the two movements this is where a 2018 Greek paper can assist us nine individuals were recruited and like the last study one arm trained overhead extensions while the other arm trained push downs but unlike the last study the elbow angles traversed by both exercises were different here were the training variables used and Progressive overload occurred the researchers only took measurements from the L head lad thickness at 50% and 60% of approximately the upper arm length lean towards the overhead extensions L head cross-sectional area at the lower portion also favored the overhead extensions but quite fascinatingly cross-sectional area at the upper portion was actually better with the pushdowns therefore these results suggest the two exercises May grow different parts of the L head it's important to mention this study has its differences from the previous one but one similarity is that both papers had each arm trained with one of the exercises this is actually a great thing to do since it means the same subjects performed both exercises this means that all non-training factors that influence muscle growth such as genetics nutrition and outside lifestyle factors were equal between both conditions after all your right arm doesn't sleep more or even more protein than your left arm but this Greek paper was merely conducted on nine subjects while the other paper included 21 subjects the Greek paper was also just 6 weeks while the other paper was double this duration finally besides the range of motion differences between the studies the Japanese paper had subjects Alternate which exercise was trained first every session which is the perfect thing to do contrastingly the Greek paper had subjects perform the push that Downs before the overhead extensions every session this is a potential problem since the general fatigue from performing the push Downs first could have slightly impaired the overhead extension stimulus therefore if this study had subjects alternate back and forth which arm was trained first each session better hypertrophy might have potentially been seen for the overhead extensions considering all this it's quite clear we want to put more stock into the paper from Japan however I'm currently not going to write off the regional lad growth differences between the two movements earlier we saw this graph established from Skull Crushers suggesting it may indeed be true that some regions of a tricep head could display greater activity than other parts furthermore the notion that overhead extensions better develop the lower parts of the L head might make sense remember that overhead extensions place the L head at a more stretched position and we have evidence that training muscles at stretched positions better develop the the lower portions of the muscle for example this paper compared preacher curls with a range of motion that train the muscle at a shortened position to a range of motion that achieved a relatively more lengthened position growth of the biceps at the 50% region was similar between both but growth at the 70% region was better with a lengthened position if you only wanted to train with one isolation triceps exercise I think it's reasonable to recommend overhead extensions based on the data we've overviewed the scientific papers dissected used cables but freeway overhead extensions are a possibility there are no direct comparisons between the two but based on one small study of five participants dumbbell overhead extensions resulted in appreciable triceps hypertrophy lad penti angle also increased appreciably and this measure is believed to represent the addition of contractile units in parallel which is what a large part of muscle growth is now some of you might be wondering what about Skull Crushers Skull Crushers achieve a better stretch of the long head compared to push downs but overhead extensions achieve a better stretch than both so in the absence of other research I suspect overhead extensions may still be better as for the lateral and medial heads it's difficult to say how their growth May compare between the two movements hopefully future research fills this Gap if you don't like overhead extensions rest assured you're still going to grow your triceps respectably with skull crushes or push Downs so feel free to alternatively train with either if you're someone who's happy to perform more than one isolation triceps exercise this could be worthwhile due to the possibility of it resulting in more uniform triceps growth although we know it had notable limitations the Greek paper hints at the combination of overhead extensions with push Downs possibly enabling the complete development of the upper and lower lad regions besides this the combination of overhead extensions with Skull Crushers may not be bad either as something we haven't mentioned about the data on Skull Crushers is it displayed High lad activity at the uppermost portion it is of course not impossible to have all three in a well constructed program something we also can't rule out is potential regional growth differences in the lateral and medial heads between these exercises making the combination of them possibly ideal for this speculative reason too there are also other triceps exercises in existence we've largely focused on these three since they're currently the most studied but you could experiment with any alternatives you think might work one final study potentially further supports the effectiveness of training the triceps with a few different exercises 22 individuals were assigned into either a nonv varied or Vari group both groups trained three times per week for 8 weeks the nonv varied group involved just training the triceps push down while the varied group involved training the push Downs on Monday cable seated extensions on Wednesday and cable Kickbacks on Friday overall triceps thickness was measured across three regions and the varied group tended to see better results the more favorable gains for the varied group could be entirely just a result of the inclusion of the cable SE extension which trains the L head at a more stretched position rather than the variation itself causing this even still it's still nonetheless demonstrates how this combination of isolation movements tended to produce more favorable gains than merely training the push Downs I should point out that bench press variations were also trained by both groups and we can be confident this contributed to some of the growth but I'm assuming the differences between groups were predominantly driven by the triceps isolation exercises if you're searching for further guidance on

    "title": "The Cross-Education Effect (Training One Limb Increases Strength + Size of the Opposite Limb)",
    "published_at": "2020-11-18T12:45:42Z",
    "transcript": "cross-education is the term given to the increase in strength and potentially even size of an opposite limb after training only one limb for example let's say you trained only your left arm with dumbbell bicep curls for the next few months before and after doing this you test a one rep max dumbbell biceps curl with your left arm and right arm additionally you measure the size of both of your biceps the left arm the arm you trained would of course experience increases in strength and size however despite you not training the right arm it will also likely experience some increases in strength and perhaps even some size this is cross-education there are many other synonyms for cross-education like the contralateral effect cross-limb transfer interlimb transfer bilateral transfer and many others i'm sure many would be questioning the mechanisms behind cross-education how is it possible that training only one limb results in strength and potentially size gains in an opposite limb that you did not train we'll explore the potential mechanisms a little later but first let us explore just how much strength and size gains we might expect with a cross-education effect let's first explore strength gains a meta-analysis by manca and colleagues gives us an insight into this area by the way meta-analyses are studies that combine the results of numerous individual studies that address the same topic 31 studies were included in this meta-analysis the average duration of these studies was around five and a half weeks they range from only three weeks to 12 weeks in duration so keep this in mind when interpreting the results based on the 31 studies the untrained opposite limb which could be the muscles of an arm or leg experiences an 11.9 percent increase in strength straight away we can see this is a meaningful strength increase but it would also be useful to know the strength increase for the trained limb as this would allow us to make comparisons between the two percentages unfortunately this meta-analysis did not report the average strength increase for the trained limb nonetheless from the 31 studies i decided to go out and collect the percentage increases in strength for the trained limb i should note that this isn't exactly the way meta analytics do it there is a little more detail to it but it should give us a rough idea of what we are after out of the 31 studies there were five studies i could not get the data from this was either because i could not get access to the paper or because they did not report the strength increase for the trained limb from the 26 studies i looked at on average training one limb resulted in a 27.6 increase in strength for that limb putting it all together training one limb increases the strength of that limb by 27.6 while the opposite limb that you did not train at all experiences an 11.9 increase in strength we mustn't get carried away with these numbers simply because the 31 studies these numbers are from are quite divergent some studies had participants train the muscles of one side of their upper body whereas other studies had participants train the muscles of one side of their lower body contraction modes also varied some studies use typical exercises that involve concentric and eccentric phases called isotonic exercises some used concentric early training others with eccentric only training and even some with isometric only training fortunately this meta-analysis included sub-analyses that looked at these various areas when isolating the studies that looked at training one side of the upper body the train side experienced a 24.3 increase in strength while the untrained side experienced a 9.4 increase in strength when isolating the studies that looked at training one side of the lower body the train site experienced a 30.9 increase in strength while the untrained side experienced a 16.4 percent increase in strength note the percentage increases given for the train site is from my analysis detailed earlier not the meta analysis nevertheless it's apparent that the cross-education effect is more pronounced with the lower body for contraction type training one side of your body isometrically resulted in a 22.9 increase in isometric strength for that side the untrained side experienced the 8.2 increase in isometric strength training one side of your body concentrically resulted in an 11.3 increase in concentric strength for the opposite side of your body unfortunately from the 26 studies i assessed none looked at concentric only training so i could not calculate the average increase for the trained limb training one side of your body eccentrically resulted in a 17.7 percent increase in eccentric strength for the opposite side of your body unfortunately from the 26 studies i assessed only three looked at eccentric only training and the percentage increased from each very dramatically meaning it was not sensible to average them out isotonic training resulted in a 15.9 percent increase in strength for the untrained limb the trained side based on my analysis experienced a 33.1 increase in strength so overall eccentrically overloading one side of your body results in relatively the greatest cross-education effect the meta-analysis also found somewhat of a correlation between the strength gained in the trained limb and the strength gained in the untrained limb implying that the greater strength gain you experience for your trained limb the greater strength gain the untrained limb would experience let's now move on to muscle size unfortunately there are no meta-analyses looking at cross-education and muscle size but nonetheless i went out and searched for as many studies as i could assessing how training one name can impact the size of the untrained opposite limb i found 11 studies of these four found that the untrained limb did experience growth but the remaining seven found no growth of the untrained limb of these seven studies three of them did not find growth of the trained limb either in other words the protocols used in these three studies were likely not sufficient to induce muscle growth the other four studies did find growth of the trained limb but no growth of the untrained limb so when looking at the current evidence although some evidence suggests that untrained limb does not experience growth we do have full studies suggesting growth may occur in untrained limb let's get a quick overview of these four studies in hope of drawing some conclusions brown and colleagues had 14 elderly untrained men perform unilateral elbow flexions or two to four sets three times per week for 12 weeks cross-sectional area of the trained elbow flexors increased by 17.4 percent while cross-sectional area of the untrained elbow flexes increased by 7.2 percent bezara and colleagues had 10 untrained subjects before maximal isometric knee extensions with their right leg three times per week for six weeks unfortunately they did not provide the actual numbers but they did present a graph looking at the graph we can see that as expected the right leg experienced significant increase in quadriceps cross-sectional area however for the left leg although it was not classified as statistically significant we can still see there was slight increase in quadriceps cross-sectional area magnus and colleagues split 23 untrained subjects into a training group or a control group training group trained one side of their body with a variety of shoulder exercises three times per week for four weeks thickness of the supraspinatus and anterior deltoid increased by a significant amount for the trained side the untrained limb did not experience any supraspinatus growth but there was some anterior deltoid growth despite it not being statistically significant lastly bayer and colleagues split 17 untrained men into a training group or control group the training group trained their dominant leg with a unilateral leg extension for three sets three times per week for four weeks thickness as well as cross-sectional area was measured for the vastus lateralis and rectus femoris as expected significant increases were observed for all measures done on the trained leg as for the untrained leg although the increases were not statistically significant we can see some increases in measurements mainly with the thickness and cross-sectional area of the vastus lateralis so overall we do have some evidence that an untrained limb can grow in response to training the opposite limb but the amount of growth does not seem to be much it only appears to be a slight increase in muscle size moreover the four studies were conducted on untrained individuals although i could not find any research on trained individuals i think it's very likely they would experience smaller increases in muscle size or perhaps even no growth with cross-education one of the real world applications of the cross-education effect is when you injure one side of your body if your injury is severe enough it may need to be put in a cast meaning it is immobilized immobilizing a limb for an extended period often results in strength and size decreases for the muscles in that immobilized limb training the limb that is not immobilized can help attenuate any strength and size loss that may have occurred in the opposite immobilized limb thanks to the cross-education effect none of the studies we have looked at so far in this video had participants immobilized their untrained limb in all of the studies participants continued using their untrained limit in normal life nevertheless there do exist studies investigating the cross-education effect when the opposite untrained limb is put in a cast a review paper by andrew andrewsko and colleagues assess the research in this area five studies have investigated how training one arm can impact the size and strength of an opposite immobilized arm all five of these studies had a control group for comparison purposes these control groups had one arm immobilized but they did not train either of their arms note i am indeed saying arm as far as i'm aware there are no studies assessing the effects of cross-education when one leg is immobilized let's first look at strength when averaging out the five studies the training groups experienced a 26 increase in strength for the trained arm for the opposite immobilized untrained arm they experienced a 4.6 increase in strength the control groups on average experienced a 2.5 decrease in strength for their non-immobilized arm and a 13.3 percent decrease for their immobilized arm therefore cross-education not only attenuated strength loss for the immobilized arm but it also helped to increase strength these five studies were conducted on untrained individuals i think it's highly likely that if they were well trained cross-education would probably not increase strength of the immobilized limb but it likely would go some way to attenuating any strength loss moving on to muscle size the training groups experienced a 3.9 increase in size for the trained arm and a 0.2 increase in size for the opposite untrained immobilized arm the control groups experienced a 0.6 decrease in size for the non-immobilized arm while their immobilized arm decreased in size by 3.8 percent therefore training one arm was effective at pretty much maintaining the size of the opposite immobilized arm again the subjects were untrained with trained subjects i'm not sure if training one limb would be effective at maintaining the muscle mass of an immobilized limb but it probably would go some way to minimizing decreases in muscle mass okay let's now explore the potential mechanisms behind the cross-education effect let us start with muscle size there are two hypotheses i've come across the first hypothesis relates to hormones the second relates to mirror activity let's explore the first hypothesis muscle growth can simply be thought of as a result of muscle protein synthesis exceeding muscle protein breakdown over time at the cellular level an increase in protein synthesis as well as a decrease in protein breakdown is a result of various signaling pathways signaling pathways are where various proteins interact in a chain reaction fashion and in our case would result in a synthesis of proteins or more simply the creation of the proteins that make our muscles bigger moreover some proteins as part of signaling pathways can inhibit the activation of other proteins one particular pathway involved in muscle hypertrophy is the pi3k akt mtor pathway a protein called pi3k activates a protein called akt akt then activates m2c1 which is a protein complex m2c1 can activate s6k1 s6k1 then initiates muscle protein synthesis in ribosomes ribosomes can be considered the factory in which proteins are created this particular pathway can also decrease muscle protein breakdown akt is thought to inhibit foxoproteins these foxoproteins are involved in muscle protein breakdown i should note this is a fairly simplified view of this pathway but for this video it will suffice so how are signaling pathways initiated one way is through hormones lifting weights temporarily elevates the levels of various anabolic hormones such as growth hormone igf-1 and testosterone growth hormone is believed to primarily exert its anabolic effects through its stimulation of igf-1 production from the liver igf-1 binds to igf-1 receptors on the membrane of muscle fibers this binding initiates the p13k akt m2 pathway similarly i've come across evidence suggesting testosterone could play a role in initiating this pathway too through binding to a different receptor also testosterone is thought to bind to androgen receptors within the muscle fiber this event is also thought to play a role in muscle growth when performing unilateral resistance training these anabolic hormones could be released into circulation and they could potentially through the events just discussed induce growth in the opposite untrained limb however there are no worthy limitations to this proposed mechanism multi-joint exercises that involve large amounts of muscle mass result in the circulation of these anabolic hormones single joint exercises such as the ones that would be used during unilateral training and hope of eliciting the cross-education effect hardly if at all result in the circulation of these anabolic hormones moreover even if unilateral single joint exercises did result in the circulation of anabolic hormones there does not appear to be much of a correlation between acute hormonal responses and muscle hypertrophy meaning that despite the logical rationale behind why exercise-induced elevations and anabolic hormones may contribute to growth the weight of the current evidence suggests that training programs that elicit high elevation of those various anabolic hormones hardly if at all produce greater muscle growth than training programs that do not elicit much elevations in anabolic hormones on to the second hypothesis mirror activity refers to the phenomena that during unilateral resistance training the corresponding opposite muscle not being trained experiences slight activation magnus and colleagues found that during isometric training for one biceps brachii the opposite biceps brachii not being trained which was immobilized was activated at 3.1 percent of the biceps brachii being trained similarly during isometric training for the triceps brachii the opposite triceps brachii not being trained which was immobilized was activated at 6.1 percent of the triceps brachii being trained another study by andrewsko and colleagues found that during unilateral wrist flexor training the opposite wrist flexors not being trained which was immobilized was activated at 5.6 of its maximum voluntary contraction so there does seem to be something going on during unilateral training that results in the opposite limb experiencing some activation however it is very slight and i'm not sure this level of activation would be sufficient to induce muscle growth during everyday life people probably experience this level of activation or even slightly more with numerous muscles during simple tasks but of course these events do not usually result in a hypertrophy ultimately both hypotheses have their limitations but i don't think we can completely rule both of them out much more research would be needed in this area what about the mechanisms behind the increase in strength of the untrained limb as established although the untrained limb could increase in size the growth isn't significant therefore muscle growth probably cannot explain a large part of the significant strength gain observed in that untrained limb accordingly adaptations in the nervous system which is the brain and spinal cord likely explain this to understand these potential adaptations we first need a basic understanding of how the nervous system interacts with your muscles the reason muscles contract is because they receive electrical signals that originate from the brain there are two neurons also called the nerve cells in this system an upper motor neuron and a lower motor neuron upper motor neurons originate in the cerebrum which are the hemispheres of the brain and are mostly endo particular region in the spinal cord lower motor neurons mostly originate from the spinal cord and end at a muscle as just mentioned the cerebrum consists of two hemispheres [Music] the right hemisphere controls the muscles of the left side of the body while the left hemisphere controls the muscles of the right side of the body let's look at the simplified events of contracting your left bicep upper motor neurons from the right hemisphere of the cerebrum send an electrical signal down its length at an area where the medulla is located some upper motor neurons cross over to the opposite side of the body the other upper motor neurons continue down the same side at the spinal cord regardless of whether the upper motor neurons crossed over they can transmit the electrical signal to lower motor neurons once these lower motor neurons get sufficiently excited they send the electrical signals down their length and transmit the signal to the muscle they enervate which in our example is the left bicep the electrical signal within the bicep ultimately causes it to contract the upper and lower motor neurons have names the fibers of the numerous upper motor neurons that come down from the cerebrum are collectively known as the corticospinal tract cortico refers to the cerebral cortex this is the outer layer of the cerebrum which is the location of where the upper motor neurons originate spinal of course refers to the spine which is where upper motor neurons mostly end the lower motor neurons that receive signals from the corticospinal tract and subsequently transmit these signals to contracting muscle fibers are called alpha motor neurons as established the corticospinal tract originates in the cerebral cortex the outer layer of the cerebrum ultimately there are numerous regions of the cerebral cortex that play a role in causing muscle contraction a review paper by fraser and colleagues suggest that the dorsal pre-motor cortex supplementary motor area and cingulate cortex on one side of the cerebral cortex have strong connections to the homologous zone on the opposite cerebral cortex meaning that there are connections between the right and left dorsal premotor cortex connections between the right and left supplementary motor area and connections between the right and left cingulate cortex remember when training only one side of your body one hemisphere of your cerebrum and therefore cerebral cortex would be primarily activated adaptations that occur in the activated regions of one hemisphere particularly the regions just discussed could be somewhat transferred to the opposite hemisphere through their existing connections this transference of adaptations to the untrained hemisphere which controls the opposite untrained limb could somehow result in an increased strength of that limb another potential mechanism behind the strength gain of an untrained limb relates to an increased excitability or decreased inhibition of the corticospinal tract associated with that untrained limb to understand what this means we first need to understand the structure of a neuron remember numerous fibers of upper motor neurons make up the corticospinal tract a neuron has a cell body from which dendrites are an extension these dendrites are primarily responsible for receiving signals from other neurons one neuron receives many signals from many neurons if most of the signals a neuron receives are inhibitory then the likelihood of the neuron generating an electrical signal is low conversely if most of the signals unknown receives are excitatory an electrical signal will then likely be generated this signal is transmitted along the axon on the axon we can see these structures called myelin sheaths they allow the electrical signals to travel along the neuron quicker as we continue along the neuron we can see the axon branches out these branches are called axon terminals the axon terminals essentially transmit the electrical signal to other neurons an increase in corticospinal excitability would imply that the neurons making up the corticospinal tract receive more excitatory signals from the neurons they communicate with this means the muscle this corticospinal tract is associated with which in our case is an untrained muscle will receive more signals resulting in greater muscle contraction which is the same thing as saying it is now stronger although there is evidence finding an increase in corticospinal excitability with cross-education as noted in the review paper by fraser and colleagues there are numerous papers finding no effect on corticospinal excitability with cross-education there actually seems to be stronger evidence supporting a decrease in corticospinal inhibition a decrease in corticospinal inhibition would imply that the neurons making up the corticospinal tract would experience less inhibitory signals from the neurons near their dendrites this decreased inhibition would make it more likely for the neuron to fire an electrical signal ultimately resulting in more signals to that untrained muscle meaning it is stronger the last potential mechanism we will look at relates to inter-hemispheric inhibition inter-hemispheric inhibition refers to the phenomena where one cerebral hemisphere inhibits the opposite cerebral hemisphere one study found that an increase in strength of an untrained limb was accompanied by a 31 decrease in inter-hemispheric inhibition from the trained hemisphere to the untrained hemisphere this would imply that the untrained hemisphere as a result of the decreased inhibition from the other trained hemisphere would be able to transmit more electrical signals that ultimately end up at the untrained muscle though there are also studies finding no impact on inter-hemispheric inhibition with cross-education at the end of the day despite the potential mechanisms behind the strength increase of an untrained limb being more studied than the hypertrophy increases of an untrained limb more research is still very much required to fully understand the mechanisms behind it you"

    "title": "Squats vs Hip Thrusts for Glute Growth (NEW Research)",
    "published_at": "2023-07-03T10:59:58Z",
    "transcript": "welcome to the house of hypertrophy the glute Max is the largest individual lower body muscle and it is the quest of many to only further grow this muscle across the interwebs there are Fierce debates about what exercises May best develop this muscle one of them being how the hip thrust May compare to the classic back squats a brand new study has directly compared these two exercises for glute adductor hamstrings and quadriceps hypertrophy and there are also some additional interesting findings let's dive into things laughs before we analyze the new study we have this previous study by barbalio that you may be aware of if you followed the hypertrophy scientific literature for a while it caused quite a stir across social media and it compared hip thrust to back squats and purportedly established back squats evoked approximately 2.5 times more gluteus maximus hypertrophy compared to hip thrusts but there is a massive problem the author of the study barbalia has been the author of numerous studies that have improbable data patterns to the extent it's likely his studies cannot be trusted thus we can consider this new study as the first legitimate one comparing hit for us to back squads [Music] 34 untrained individuals were assigned into either a squat or hip thrust group the hip thrust group trains exclusively the barbell hip thrust while the squat group exclusively trained the barbell back Squad to as deep as comfortable the author noted four of them attained ACG while the majority of the rest attained a parallel depth both groups performed 8 to 12 repetitions to volitional failure per set the number of sets they perform as per workout increased across the study duration and training was done twice per week Progressive overload through increasing load was applied across the sessions to ensure subjects kept training to volitional failure within the 8 to 12 rep range quadriceps and adductor growth was greater for the squat group while neither group experienced notable hamstrings hypertrophy these findings make a ton of sense squats move the knee joint through a much greater range of motion relative to hip thrusts and quite importantly squats attain a great stretch of the quads so it's expected squats produce greater quad hypertrophy furthermore the adductor Magnus specifically has been documented to have great leverage near the bottom position of the squad so we'd expect it to grow very well with the squats finally although the hamstrings have leverage for hip extension but no squats and hip thrusts involve knee Bend and this places the hamstrings into a position where it cannot effectively generate Force so it makes sense both exercises generate minimal hamstrings hypertrophy as for gluteus maximus hypertrophy it was ultimately found growth at an upper middle and lower region increased similarly between both groups both exercises produce the greatest growth at the lower region followed by the middle region and then the upper region why was this the lower region of the glute Max is simply likely the region that contributes the most to hip extension whereas although the upper regions still perform hip extension they also play a good role in hip abduction interestingly there is another Factor worth noting that is previous research indirectly suggests that upper glute regions may contain proportionally more slow twitch muscle fibers while the lower regions contain proportionally more fast switch fibers with all else equal fast twitch fibers have greater growth potential so this may also contribute as to why the lower region experience is the best growth the researchers also measured gluteus medius and Minimus growth and changes in the size were also similar between both groups but neither group really saw meaningful growth which makes sense since these muscles more so play a role in hip abduction and hip external rotation the researchers also assess some strength measurements increases in back squat strength were unsurprisingly greater for the squat group while increases in hip thrust strength were unsurprisingly greater for the hip thrust group interestingly the researchers also measured deadlift strength before and after the study and both groups experienced similar gains having now detailed a study there are two considerations firstly the subjects were previously untrained so we strictly cannot be 100 certain we'll establish the same thing in trained folks secondly remember subjects perform their reps to volitional failure it is easier for researchers to use this definition but a limitation is that it's vague thus we cannot be 100 certain we'll establish the same results if a different Criterion for stopping a set of reps was used so there we have it that's the summary of the new study before wrapping things up there are actually two other studies directly measuring gluteus maximus hypertrophy that I think are important to be aware of [Music] this 2019 study by Kubo compared 90 degree knee flexion to 140 degree knee flexion squats and established a 140 degree knee flexion squats produced greater glute Max hypertrophy why was this the 114 knee flexion group presumably attained a greater stretch of the glute Max and the scientific literature indicates attaining a stretch during an exercise can be powerful for building muscle for example this 2021 Japanese study compared seated to Lang leg holes seated Lego stretch out of the hamstrings more and they evoked greater hamstrings hypertrophy another 2022 Japanese study compared triceps overhead extensions to pushdowns overhead extensions stretch out of the long head of the triceps more and they produce the greater overall triceps hypertrophy this talk of stretch raises an interesting question in the new study I noted the majority of the subjects reached parallel squat depth but what if all of them squatted deeper than this would this have resulted in the glute Max growing better with the squats we can't rule this out we currently don't have any research directly comparing glue Max High perch food between parallel and deeper squats it could be possible there's a threshold to the amount of stretch that's beneficial so perhaps there's no difference in glute Max growth between parallel and deeper squats future research is required here nevertheless some of you may be pondering even though the majority of subjects performance parallel squads this still attains a greater stretch of the glute Max compared to hip thrusts so if attaining a stretch is powerful for building muscle why didn't the parallel squats generate greater glute Max hypertrophy versus The Hip thrusts my current working hypothesis is the glute Max is a bit of an odd muscle let me explain with the triceps and hamstrings data we just mentioned we know overhead extensions stretch out the long triceps head while seated Legos better stretch out the hamstrings but both of these exercises will involve High overall contractile forces from the muscle too that is overhead extensions involve High contractile forces from the triceps and seated leg holes involve High contractile forces from the hamstrings this is important because it's likely the combination of high contractile forces plus stretch throughout the range of motion that is probably the recipe for best muscle growth here's the key point with the glute mix we know it's stretched in deeper angles of hip flexion but at this point it actually appears to have lower leverage for producing hip extension compared to the hamstrings and a duck to Magnus thus although we're successfully stretching the glute Max at lower portions of the squad it may fail to experience a high dose of overall contractile forces the adductor Magnus since it has better Leverage is presumably what sees a high dose of contractile forces with the hamstrings we know due to the knee bending it won't really be involved much so with traditional exercises we may not be able to simultaneously have the glute stretched while experiencing a high dose of contractile forces throughout the range of motion so this is why I think the squats didn't produce Superior growth compared to the hip thrusts remember this is just a hypothesis and I'm certainly open to being wrong nonetheless moving on to the other study exploring glute Max hypertrophy which is this recent one by Casiano and colleagues that it had 33 untrained women trained three times per week across 10 weeks one group trained just a leg press and stiff-legged deadlift to each with these variables a second group also trained the leg press and stiff like a deadlift but they added the hip thrust the addition of the hip thrust caused this second group to perform higher volume that is number of sets per week ultimately glute Max hypertrophy was greater for this second group thus this study adds to the notion that the hip thrust is a perfectly fine exercise to elicit glute Max hypertrophy of course the fact the second group performed more sets probably plays a large part in the great hypertrophy since as indicated by this meta-analysis higher set numbers can produce more muscle hypertrophy on average in just 15 seconds let me tell you about the alpha progression app with an advanced generator it creates a program precisely fitted to your needs the training variables are grounded in research aesthetic graphs display your long-term progression and there's a vast exercise database to assist you try the app free for two weeks with a link in the comments and description and if you like it you get 20 off a subscription [Music] so this new study found squats and hip thrust did a similar job at growing the upper middle and low region of the glute Max although since quadriceps and a duct hypertrophy what's better with escorts we can generally say squats are a better overall developer of multiple muscle groups while hip thrust better isolate the gluteus maximus outside of the lab you can of course train both in a program a notable consideration related to this is that since hip thrust trained the glutes at a more shortened position they are probably easier to recover from so if you're particularly trying to accelerate glue Max development using the hip thrust as a tool to train the groups with higher volumes can be a fine strategy indeed we know a recent study by Casiano found that having subjects at the hip thrust on top of a leg press and stiff-legged program which increase the overall training volume was a perfectly fine way to enhance glute Max hypertrophene is training to failure essential for hypertrophy check out our most recent video on the related research"

    "title": "Become Laser Accurate When Leaving Reps in Reserve (New Research)",
    "published_at": "2021-11-15T11:04:00Z",
    "transcript": "Last video, we detailed how the current research,\u00a0\u00a0 as well as mechanistic reasoning, imply\u00a0\nstopping between 0 to 3 repetitions away from\u00a0\u00a0 failure can produce similar muscle\u00a0\nhypertrophy to training to failure. For clarification, when I say stopping\u00a0\nbetween 0 to 3 repetitions away from failure,\u00a0\u00a0 I'm referring to leaving between\u00a0\n0 to 3 repetitions in reserve.\u00a0\u00a0 That is, leaving 0 repetitions in reserve\u00a0\nindicates you stopped at the point where\u00a0\u00a0 you feel you cannot perform another full\u00a0\nrepetition, while leaving 3 repetitions\u00a0\u00a0 in reserve indicates you believe could\u00a0\nhave performed 3 more full repetitions. Additionally, failure refers to technical failure,\u00a0\u00a0 the point at which no more repetitions\u00a0\nwith correct execution can be performed. This definition was essentially\u00a0\nused in the studies we assessed,\u00a0\u00a0 and I believe this is probably the most\u00a0\nsensible definition as it makes little\u00a0\u00a0 sense to significantly deviate from using\u00a0\nthe correct execution for muscle hypertrophy. For example, in a barbell biceps curl,\u00a0\ntechnical failure would refer to the\u00a0\u00a0 point where you can no longer flex your elbows\u00a0\nupwards while maintaining a fairly rigid posture,\u00a0\u00a0 as your elbow flexor muscles can no\u00a0\nlonger produce the required force. If you were to try to continue\u00a0\nand start introducing momentum,\u00a0\u00a0 either via swinging your back or using your\u00a0\nlegs, your spinal erectors or leg muscles would\u00a0\u00a0 be contributing towards moving the weight, your\u00a0\nelbow flexors would not be doing any more work\u00a0\u00a0 (and in some instances, its\u00a0\nrecruitment might actually decrease). Of course, in the real world, your execution\u00a0\nwill likely deviate slightly as you get closer\u00a0\u00a0 and closer to failure, but it's likely sensible\u00a0\nto try your best to minimize any deviation. Returning to the topic of this video,\u00a0\nas noted, leaving 0 to 3 repetitions in\u00a0\u00a0 reserve likely produces similar muscle\u00a0\nhypertrophy to training to failure. But, there's a potential\u00a0\nproblem with implementing this. A person might be inaccurate at\u00a0\nestimating how close to failure\u00a0\u00a0 they truly are. An individual may think\u00a0\nthey've left 3 repetitions in reserve,\u00a0\u00a0 but they might have truly left 5 or\u00a0\neven more repetitions in reserve. How common is underestimating\u00a0\nproximity to failure? Moreover, how could an individual ensure greater\u00a0\u00a0 accuracy in estimating how\u00a0\nclose to failure they are? A recent 2020 meta-analysis by Halperin\u00a0\net al. answers these questions. They combined the results of 12\u00a0\nstudies that examined how well\u00a0\u00a0 individuals estimate their proximity to failure. Before detailing the findings, it's worth briefly\u00a0\nunderstanding the design of the included studies. The 12 studies had a mix of designs. The studies ranged from having subjects\u00a0\nperform repetitions to failure with a 50\u00a0\u00a0 to 90% one-rep max load. Most of\u00a0\nthe studies used compound exercises,\u00a0\u00a0 with the back squat and bench\u00a0\npress being commonly used. Although, other exercises like leg\u00a0\npresses, chest presses, trap bar deadlifts,\u00a0\u00a0 as well as biceps and triceps isolation\u00a0\nexercises were also used in a few studies. Some studies had subjects estimate\u00a0\nhow many repetitions they think they\u00a0\u00a0 could perform with a given load on an\u00a0\nexercise before performing the set,\u00a0\u00a0 others had subjects estimate at some point during\u00a0\nthe set. For instance, a few studies had subjects\u00a0\u00a0 stop at the 10th repetition with a 70% one-rep\u00a0\nmax load to report how many more repetitions\u00a0\u00a0 they think they could achieve before they\u00a0\nwent onto complete repetitions until failure. Furthermore, a few studies alternatively had\u00a0\nsubjects report once they felt they reached a\u00a0\u00a0 certain number of repetitions in reserve. For\u00a0\nexample, subjects reported once they felt they\u00a0\u00a0 hit the point of 3 repetitions in reserve before\u00a0\nreturning and performing repetitions to failure. Let's move on to the results. Combining the 12 studies results,\u00a0\u00a0 on average, subjects actually only underestimated\u00a0\ntheir proximity to failure by 1 repetition.\u00a0\u00a0 Although, as evidenced by the graph,\u00a0\nthere was quite some variation. A fair\u00a0\u00a0 few subjects underestimated their proximity\u00a0\nto failure by 1 to 3 repetitions. However,\u00a0\u00a0 some subjects underestimated their proximity\u00a0\nto failure by as much as 10 to 13 repetitions. Let's now explore some meta-regressions\u00a0\nperformed that can aid an individual\u00a0\u00a0 in improving their accuracy at\u00a0\nestimating proximity to failure. Accuracy increased when subjects gave\u00a0\ntheir predictions closer to failure.\u00a0\u00a0 This means that studies in which subjects\u00a0\nreported how many repetitions they thought\u00a0\u00a0 they could perform before a set produced less\u00a0\naccurate estimates compared to studies in\u00a0\u00a0 which subjects reported estimates at some\u00a0\npoint during a set. Also, during a set,\u00a0\u00a0 making a prediction closer to failure is better\u00a0\nthan making a prediction father from failure. These findings imply that if an individual\u00a0\nplans to train with repetitions in reserve,\u00a0\u00a0 it's likely best to avoid pre-planning how\u00a0\nmany repetitions you think will achieve\u00a0\u00a0 this before the set. Instead, you should\u00a0\nsimply perform your repetitions and\u00a0\u00a0 end the set only once you truly feel you've\u00a0\nreached the desired proximity to failure. Accuracy was much better when subjects trained\u00a0\nwith heavier loads that resulted in fewer\u00a0\u00a0 repetitions. Using loads that resulted\u00a0\nin more than 12 repetitions performed\u00a0\u00a0 generally resulted in greater underestimations.\u00a0\nThese findings make sense, with higher repetitions\u00a0\u00a0 (and thus lighter loads), there's\u00a0\na lot more room for error.\u00a0\u00a0 Additionally, lighter loads and higher\u00a0\nrepetitions have been shown to produce\u00a0\u00a0 greater perceived exertion and discomfort compared\u00a0\nto using heavier loads and fewer repetitions.\u00a0\u00a0 These factors can mask an individual's ability\u00a0\nto truly delineate their proximity to failure. For muscle hypertrophy, we know\u00a0\nit's quite likely loads between 30%\u00a0\u00a0 to 85% one-rep max are similarly effective at\u00a0\nbuilding muscle. Therefore, it's probably sensible\u00a0\u00a0 for individuals to train on the heavier side of\u00a0\nthis if they wish to use repetitions in reserve. Accuracy slightly improved during predictions\u00a0\nin later sets compared to earlier sets. This could be for a couple of reasons.\u00a0\nFirstly, remember that technically the\u00a0\u00a0 subjects of the studies took\u00a0\nall their sets to failure,\u00a0\u00a0 they just estimated their proximities to failure\u00a0\nat certain time points before achieving failure.\u00a0\u00a0 As a consequence, those earlier sets to failure\u00a0\nmay have acutely made them more accustomed\u00a0\u00a0 and aware of the feeling of failure, thereby\u00a0\nenhancing their prediction accuracy in later sets. The potential implication of this\u00a0\nis that if you're someone who\u00a0\u00a0 prefers to mix in failure and leaving\u00a0\nrepetitions in reserve in a session,\u00a0\u00a0 it might be better to perform\u00a0\nyour failure sets first. For example, let's say you perform 4 sets\u00a0\nwith a certain load on the triceps skull\u00a0\u00a0 crusher in a session. Performing the\u00a0\nfirst 2 sets to failure may set you\u00a0\u00a0 up for being more accurate if you were to use\u00a0\nrepetitions in reserves for the last two sets. Accuracy was slightly worse with lower body\u00a0\nexercises versus upper body exercises. It's\u00a0\u00a0 useful to be aware of this and recognize you may\u00a0\nhave to push slightly harder than you naturally\u00a0\u00a0 anticipate if you use repetitions in\u00a0\nreserve with lower body exercises. Finally, and quite unexpectedly, training\u00a0\nstatus minimally impacted accuracy.\u00a0\u00a0 That is, on average, having multiple years\u00a0\nof resistance training experience seemingly\u00a0\u00a0 did not significantly enhance an individual's\u00a0\nability to predict how close to failure they are. It's not clear why this is. Although I'm not certain, it might simply be\u00a0\nbecause many of the trained individuals in\u00a0\u00a0 these studies may not have had a fair degree\u00a0\nof experience with training to failure. It seems reasonable to think if the researchers\u00a0\ndivided the trained individuals into those with\u00a0\u00a0 minimal to no experience of training to\u00a0\nfailure and those with a fair degree of\u00a0\u00a0 failure training experience, an effect might\u00a0\nbe seen such that those with failure training\u00a0\u00a0 experience would be more accurate than\u00a0\nthose with no failure training experience. If true, which I think it probably\u00a0\nwould be as it makes logical sense,\u00a0\u00a0 gaining experience and familiarity with\u00a0\ntraining to failure should enhance your\u00a0\u00a0 accuracy when you use repetitions in reserve. Perhaps you may perform a select few of your sets\u00a0\nfor a given exercise with repetitions to failure,\u00a0\u00a0 or you could dedicate occasional blocks where\u00a0\nmost of your sets are performed to failure. In summary, the current literature, although\u00a0\nthere is some variability, intriguing\u00a0\u00a0 indicates individuals only underestimate their\u00a0\nproximity to failure by one repetition on average. Generally, it's best not to pre-plan how\u00a0\nmany repetitions you should perform with a\u00a0\u00a0 given load to reach a certain proximity to\u00a0\nfailure, rather simply perform repetitions\u00a0\u00a0 with this load and stop only once you truly feel\u00a0\nyou've reached your desired proximity to failure. Training with heavier loads and lower\u00a0\nrepetitions likely makes it easier to\u00a0\u00a0 estimate your proximity to failure versus\u00a0\nlighter loads and higher repetitions. It's worth being aware individuals tend to be\u00a0\nmore accurate with estimates in later sets,\u00a0\u00a0 as well as with upper body exercises\u00a0\ncompared to lower body exercises. Finally, it's likely gaining a fair degree\u00a0\nof experience with training to failure is\u00a0\u00a0 beneficial for being accustomed and familiar\u00a0\nwith how failure feels to you, thereby plausibly\u00a0\u00a0 enhancing your ability to estimate your closeness\u00a0\nto failure when you do use repetitions in reserve."

    "title": "Is Adding More Load or Repetitions Better for Hypertrophy and Strength?",
    "published_at": "2022-02-21T12:00:11Z",
    "transcript": "Progressive overload is necessary for making\u00a0\nlong-term hypertrophy and strength gains.\u00a0\u00a0 Simply, it refers to progressing\u00a0\nyour training sessions in some way. Conceptualizing progressive overload as a cycle\u00a0\nworks well. A challenging training session evokes\u00a0\u00a0 muscle and strength gains. These gains enable\u00a0\nyou to apply progressive overload, and in turn,\u00a0\u00a0 this application of progressive overload\u00a0\nsustains a challenging training session. Two popular ways to progressive overload are\u00a0\nwith all other training variables constant,\u00a0\u00a0 either increasing the load you use or\u00a0\nthe number of repetitions you perform. However, how do these two progressive overload\u00a0\u00a0 forms compare to one another for\u00a0\nlong-term hypertrophy and strength? To my knowledge, there hadn't been\u00a0\nany studies addressing this. But,\u00a0\u00a0 a new study by Nobrega et al. changes\u00a0\nthis. Let's thoroughly examine it. The researchers did not\u00a0\nactually conduct a new study.\u00a0\u00a0 Rather, they used data from two of their\u00a0\nprevious studies to create this analysis.\u00a0\u00a0 The researchers justified this as the\u00a0\ntwo studies were quite comparable. The data taken from study one\u00a0\ninvolved 14 previously untrained men,\u00a0\u00a0 while the data taken from study two\u00a0\ninvolved 10 previously untrained men. In both studies, subjects trained the\u00a0\nleg extension for 3 sets of repetitions\u00a0\u00a0 to failure per session, with 2 minutes\u00a0\nbetween sets, for a total of 24 sessions. In study one, which we'll hereafter\u00a0\ncall the subjects of this study the rep\u00a0\u00a0 overload group, the total 24 sessions were\u00a0\nachieved by training two times per week\u00a0\u00a0 (on non-consecutive days) for 12 weeks. Furthermore, this rep overload group used an 80%\u00a0\none-rep max load on the leg extension in the first\u00a0\u00a0 session and did not adjust this initial load at\u00a0\nall throughout the full study. As subjects were\u00a0\u00a0 performing repetitions to failure every\u00a0\nset, this would have meant this group\u00a0\u00a0 was increasing the number of repetitions\u00a0\nperformed per set across their session.\u00a0\u00a0 That is, they progressively overload via\u00a0\nincreasing the number of repetitions performed. Now, I did kind of just lie. During the\u00a0\n6th week (corresponding to after the 12th\u00a0\u00a0 training session), leg extension one-rep max was\u00a0\nre-tested to return the rep overload subjects to\u00a0\u00a0 training with a relative 80% one-rep max load.\u00a0\nBut this was only done once, and subjects kept\u00a0\u00a0 this exact new load with no further adjustments\u00a0\nfor the remaining 6 weeks during which they\u00a0\u00a0 would have again been simply progressively\u00a0\noverloading via increasing repetition numbers. In study two, which we'll hereafter call the\u00a0\nsubjects of this study the load overload group,\u00a0\u00a0 the total of 24 sessions was achieved\u00a0\nby training three times per week\u00a0\u00a0 (on non-consecutive days) for 8 weeks. Furthermore, this load overload group\u00a0\nadjusted their load every set and across\u00a0\u00a0 sessions to ensure they performed roughly\u00a0\n9-12 repetitions to failure every set.\u00a0\u00a0 This means they would have predominantly been\u00a0\u00a0 progressively overloading via increasing the\u00a0\nload used to fall within the 9-12 rep range. As you probably noticed, although both groups\u00a0\nultimately performed 24 training sessions,\u00a0\u00a0 they did not do so identically. Training\u00a0\nfrequency and total study duration differed.\u00a0\u00a0 This is a limitation that\u00a0\nwill be returned to later. Nevertheless, before and after\u00a0\nthe 24 training sessions,\u00a0\u00a0 one-rep max on the leg extension\u00a0\nand vastus lateralis cross-sectional\u00a0\u00a0 area at approximately 50% of the\u00a0\nthigh bone length were measured. Additionally, total volume load (calculated\u00a0\nas the product of sets x repetitions x load)\u00a0\u00a0 accumulated by the end of\u00a0\nthe 24 training sessions,\u00a0\u00a0 as well as volume load progression across\u00a0\nthe 24 training sessions was measured. By the end of the study, total volume\u00a0\nload, despite being numerically greater\u00a0\u00a0 on average for the load overload group, was not\u00a0\nstatistically different between the two groups.\u00a0\u00a0 However, progression of volume\u00a0\nload across the 24 sessions was\u00a0\u00a0 statistically greater for the load overload\u00a0\ngroup compared to the rep overload group. PAUSE After adjusting the data based on baseline\u00a0\nvalues via an analysis of covariance,\u00a0\u00a0 increases in relative and absolute\u00a0\nleg extension one-rep max were not\u00a0\u00a0 statistically different between the two groups. Note, relative increases can be\u00a0\nthought of as percentage changes.\u00a0\u00a0 With this data specifically, the rep\u00a0\noverload group saw an average 31.4%\u00a0\u00a0 increase in leg extension one-rep max, while the\u00a0\nload overload group saw an average 38.3% increase. Absolute increases can be thought\u00a0\nof as measurement unit changes.\u00a0\u00a0 With this data specifically, the rep\u00a0\noverload group saw an average 14kg leg\u00a0\u00a0 extension one-rep max increase, while the load\u00a0\noverload group saw an average 15.3kg increase. PAUSE Moving forward, also after adjusting for\u00a0\nbaseline values via an analysis of covariance,\u00a0\u00a0 increases in relative and absolute\u00a0\nvastus lateralis cross-sectional\u00a0\u00a0 area was statistically greater for the load\u00a0\noverload group versus the rep overload group. So overall, this data potentially\u00a0\nsuggests for increasing one-rep max,\u00a0\u00a0 there may be no difference between progressively\u00a0\noverloading via increasing load or repetition\u00a0\u00a0 numbers. But for hypertrophy, increasing load\u00a0\nmay be superior to increasing repetition numbers. Quite interesting, when combining both group\u2019s\u00a0\ndata, although the researchers did not find a\u00a0\u00a0 significant correlation between the total volume\u00a0\nload accumulated by the end of the 24 sessions\u00a0\u00a0 and one-rep max or vastus\u00a0\nlateralis cross-sectional gains,\u00a0\u00a0 a significant correlation was\u00a0\nfound for volume load progression\u00a0\u00a0 across the 24 sessions and gains in one-rep\u00a0\nmax and vastus lateralis cross-sectional area. As the load overload group saw greater\u00a0\nprogressions in volume load across the\u00a0\u00a0 24 sessions, this led the authors\u00a0\nto suggest this greater volume\u00a0\u00a0 load progression may explain the greater\u00a0\nhypertrophy experienced for this group. Having detailed all of this, there are\u00a0\nsome extremely important limitations\u00a0\u00a0 and counterevidence. Let\u2019s explore this\u00a0\nto derive some more informed conclusions. Firstly, recall this study combined and\u00a0\nanalyzed two independent studies together,\u00a0\u00a0 and as such it was not a\u00a0\nrandomized controlled study. Secondly, it\u2019s interesting that both\u00a0\ngroups saw similar one-rep max gains.\u00a0\u00a0 Yet, it\u2019s more than likely all subjects\u00a0\ntrained suboptimally for strength.\u00a0\u00a0 Both groups trained with loads that\u00a0\nenabled 8 or more repetitions per set.\u00a0\u00a0 Yet, the current evidence indicates training with\u00a0\nloads that result in you performing 5 or fewer\u00a0\u00a0 maximum repetitions is probably more favorable\u00a0\nfor one-rep max gains. For example, Schoenfeld\u00a0\u00a0 et al. found with the back squat and bench press,\u00a0\nadjusting loads every set and across sessions to\u00a0\u00a0 maintain 2-4 repetitions to failure produced\u00a0\nlarger bench press and back squat one-rep max\u00a0\u00a0 gains versus adjusting loads every set and across\u00a0\nsessions to maintain 8-12 repetitions to failure. One question arising from this is what if both\u00a0\ngroups simply started with a 2-4 rep max load,\u00a0\u00a0 with one group progressively overloading\u00a0\nvia adding reps from hereafter,\u00a0\u00a0 and another group simply adjusting loads every set\u00a0\nand across sessions to maintain 2-4 repetitions,\u00a0\u00a0 would both still be similarly\u00a0\neffective for promoting one-rep\u00a0\u00a0 max gains? Hopefully future\u00a0\nresearch explores this. Thirdly, we know that although both groups\u00a0\nultimately performed 24 training sessions, they\u00a0\u00a0 did not do so identically. The rep overload group\u00a0\nperformed 3 leg extension sets 2x per week for 12\u00a0\u00a0 weeks, meaning they performed 6 leg extension sets\u00a0\nper week. The load overload group performed 3 leg\u00a0\u00a0 extension sets 3x per week for 8 weeks, meaning\u00a0\nthey performed 9 weekly leg extension sets. However, using other data, it\u2019s actually\u00a0\ndifficult to say this is a true limitation. The evidence indicates when performing 10 or\u00a0\nfewer weekly sets for a muscle or exercise (as\u00a0\u00a0 both groups were doing), training frequency does\u00a0\nnot seem to matter for strength or hypertrophy.\u00a0\u00a0 That is, whether you perform these 10 or fewer\u00a0\nweekly sets for a muscle all in one session,\u00a0\u00a0 or across two or more days does not\u00a0\nreally matter. So neither training two\u00a0\u00a0 or three times per week are inherently\u00a0\nsuperior to each other in this regard. However, the load overload group did\u00a0\nperform 9 weekly sets on the leg extension,\u00a0\u00a0 while the rep overload group only\u00a0\nperformed 6 weekly leg extension sets.\u00a0\u00a0 Based on the current data, it\u2019s\u00a0\nprobably likely that on average,\u00a0\u00a0 performing 9 weekly sets for an exercise or muscle\u00a0\nis better than fewer for hypertrophy and strength.\u00a0\u00a0 Thus, on a per week basis, the load\u00a0\noverload group was likely gaining more.\u00a0\u00a0 However, remember the load overload group only\u00a0\ntrained for 8 weeks to reach the 24 sessions,\u00a0\u00a0 while the rep overload group trained for\u00a0\n12 weeks to reach the 24 total sessions,\u00a0\u00a0 thus these study's duration differences likely\u00a0\ncancel out the per week growth differences.\u00a0\u00a0 Ultimately probably meaning that use of different\u00a0\ntraining frequencies may not be a major problem. Having said all of this, it\u2019s important to\u00a0\nnote muscle and strength gain are not constant.\u00a0\u00a0 Generally, each week an individual would\u00a0\nincrementally experience fewer gains.\u00a0\u00a0 This throws another curveball and\u00a0\nmakes the comparisons pretty confusing. Therefore, overall, it\u2019s truly\u00a0\ndifficult to comment on how these\u00a0\u00a0 difference in training frequency and\u00a0\nstudy durations between the two groups\u00a0\u00a0 impacts the results. It would have been much\u00a0\nbetter to have controlled these variables. The fourth limitation is that\u00a0\nthe sample sizes were small,\u00a0\u00a0 as is most commonly the case\u00a0\nwith resistance training studies.\u00a0\u00a0 14 subjects were in the rep overload group,\u00a0\nand 10 subjects in the load overload group. Small sample sizes increase the\u00a0\nchance of errors. Let me explain. Different individuals, despite training\u00a0\nwith exactly the same training variables,\u00a0\u00a0 can have very different outcomes. For example, Hubal et al. had 243 men and\u00a0\n342 women train preacher and concentration\u00a0\u00a0 curls for 12 weeks. On screen is a graph\u00a0\nillustrating how the subject's biceps\u00a0\u00a0 cross-sectional area was impacted by training.\u00a0\nMost individuals tended to experience a 10-30%\u00a0\u00a0 increase in biceps cross-sectional area,\u00a0\nbut there were individuals experiencing\u00a0\u00a0 well above this as well as individuals\u00a0\nexperiencing gains well below this. Here\u2019s the thing, with small sample sizes,\u00a0\u00a0 your chance of selecting subjects that vary\u00a0\nwidely in response abilities is increased. Expanding on this, we know the Nobrega data found\u00a0\nthe load overload group experienced higher vastus\u00a0\u00a0 lateralis cross sectional area gains versus the\u00a0\nrep overload group. But it\u2019s entirely possible,\u00a0\u00a0 due to the small sample sizes, the load\u00a0\noverload group consisted of subjects\u00a0\u00a0 with an average better muscle building\u00a0\nability versus the rep overload group.\u00a0\u00a0 Thus, this would explain why the load overload\u00a0\ngroup saw greater vastus lateralis gains,\u00a0\u00a0 and not necessarily that overloading\u00a0\nvia load increases is superior. The fifth limitation relates to the\u00a0\nmeasures and variables used in the study. Vastus lateralis thickness (at\u00a0\nroughly 50% of the thigh bone\u00a0\u00a0 length) was measured). But what about gains\u00a0\nat other regions of the vastus lateralis,\u00a0\u00a0 and even gains at other regions of\u00a0\nthe quadriceps muscles. For instance,\u00a0\u00a0 other data indicates leg extension training\u00a0\n(the exercise trained by subjects) heavily\u00a0\u00a0 grows the rectus femoris part of the quadriceps.\u00a0\nThus, what did growth look like in this muscle? Only the leg extension was trained,\u00a0\nwhat about other exercises? The subjects were also\u00a0\npreviously untrained individuals,\u00a0\u00a0 do these results apply to trained individuals? Finally, although I would not\u00a0\nconsider this a limitation,\u00a0\u00a0 rather potential counterevidence, it\u2019s quite\u00a0\ndifficult to explain the finding of the load\u00a0\u00a0 overload group experiencing greater\u00a0\nvastus lateralis cross-sectional area\u00a0\u00a0 gains compared to the rep overload\u00a0\ngroup when considering other data. There\u2019s quite a bit of data indicating\u00a0\nloads between 30% and 80% one-rep max,\u00a0\u00a0 so long as repetitions are performed very close\u00a0\nor to failure, produce similar muscle hypertrophy. One of the reasons for this is likely because\u00a0\nwhen performing repetitions very close or to\u00a0\u00a0 failure within this loading zone, you\u2019re going to\u00a0\nbe evoking quite high mechanical tension levels.\u00a0\u00a0 More precisely, muscle fiber recruitment and\u00a0\nforce production by the individual muscle fibers\u00a0\u00a0 is going to be quite high (these are two parts of\u00a0\nmechanical tension). The reason this matters is\u00a0\u00a0 because mechanical tension is currently the\u00a0\nbest categorized stimulus for hypertrophy. If you start with a given loading, let\u2019s say 80%\u00a0\none-rep max, and progress via increasing your\u00a0\u00a0 repetition numbers over sessions, the relative\u00a0\nload you\u2019re training with will technically\u00a0\u00a0 decrease. But so long as you\u2019re performing\u00a0\nrepetitions to or very close to failure,\u00a0\u00a0 and that relative loading remains\u00a0\nin the 30 to 80% one-rep max zone,\u00a0\u00a0 you would presumably think hypertrophy\u00a0\nshould more or less be optimally stimulated. If you start with a given load that has you\u00a0\nperform a certain number of repetitions,\u00a0\u00a0 and you opt to try and maintain the precise\u00a0\nrelative loading (and subsequently rep range)\u00a0\u00a0 every session via increasing the load, provided\u00a0\nyou\u2019re performing repetitions to or very close\u00a0\u00a0 to failure, and the relative loading you\u2019re\u00a0\ntrying to maintain is within the 30 to 80% zone,\u00a0\u00a0 you would also presumably think hypertrophy\u00a0\nshould more or less be optimally stimulated. My point with all this is there currently\u00a0\ndoes not appear to be any rationale as to\u00a0\u00a0 why progressively overloading through\u00a0\nincreasing load may be superior\u00a0\u00a0 to progressively overloading via\u00a0\nincreasing repetition numbers. However, recall the authors\u00a0\nof the study proposed that\u00a0\u00a0 the greater volume load progression\u00a0\nachieved by the load overload group,\u00a0\u00a0 compared to the rep overload group,\u00a0\nmight explain the greater hypertrophy. Put another way, greater volume load progression\u00a0\nweek to week might mean more hypertrophy.\u00a0\u00a0 Indeed, the researchers, when combining\u00a0\nthe data for all subjects, did note a\u00a0\u00a0 correlation between volume load progression\u00a0\nand vastus lateralis cross-sectional gains. However, the problem here is that not only\u00a0\ndoes correlation not indicate causation,\u00a0\u00a0 but other areas of the research suggest volume\u00a0\u00a0 load progression is completely\u00a0\ndissociated from hypertrophy. Schoenfeld et al. had a group of men with 1.5-9\u00a0\nyears of training experience perform a range of\u00a0\u00a0 exercises each for 3 sets, 3\u00a0\ntimes per week for 8 weeks. One group of subjects (a high rep\u00a0\ngroup) performed each exercise\u00a0\u00a0 with 25-35 repetitions to failure each set. Another group of subjects (a moderate rep group)\u00a0\u00a0 performed each exercise with 8-12\u00a0\nrepetitions to failure each set. Note, both groups adjusted loads every\u00a0\nset and across sessions to ensure\u00a0\u00a0 subjects kept training to failure\u00a0\nwithin their respective rep range. Across the 8 weeks, volume load progression was\u00a0\ngreater for the subjects training with 25-35 reps,\u00a0\u00a0 versus the subjects training with 8-12 reps. If volume load progression itself\u00a0\nwas truly important for hypertrophy,\u00a0\u00a0 training with 25-35 reps should be\u00a0\nsuperior to training with 8-12 reps.\u00a0\u00a0 Yet, as we\u2019ve mentioned already,\u00a0\nloads between 30% and 80% one-rep max\u00a0\u00a0 (which would include the aforementioned\u00a0\nrep ranges) are likely comparably effective\u00a0\u00a0 for hypertrophy when repetitions are\u00a0\nperformed very close or to failure. Another study by Brigatto et al. either had\u00a0\nmen with 2-8 years of training experience\u00a0\u00a0 target a specific muscle all in one session\u00a0\n(the 1x group), or across 2 sessions a week\u00a0\u00a0 (the 2x group). All other training variables\u00a0\n(including weekly set numbers, exercise selection,\u00a0\u00a0 and rest interval duration between\u00a0\nsets) were the same between both groups. Across 8 weeks of training, volume\u00a0\nload progression on the exercises\u00a0\u00a0 was greater for the 2x group versus the 1x group. Yet, increases in thickness of various\u00a0\nmuscles were similar between both groups,\u00a0\u00a0 again indicating volume load progression\u00a0\nmay not be predictive of hypertrophy. Two studies by Souza Junior et al.,\u00a0\nwhich we\u2019ve thoroughly evaluated\u00a0\u00a0 in a previous video, fundamentally seemed\u00a0\nto compare progressively overloading via\u00a0\u00a0 decreasing rest interval duration\u00a0\nbetween sets to increasing load.\u00a0\u00a0 Despite volume load progression across\u00a0\n8 training weeks being larger for the\u00a0\u00a0 subjects increasing load, increases in arm and\u00a0\nthigh cross-sectional area were similar between\u00a0\u00a0 the subjects decreasing rest interval durations\u00a0\nbetween sets and the subjects increasing load. Finally, as just mentioned, these two Souza\u00a0\nJunior et al. studies indicated that as a\u00a0\u00a0 form of progressive overload, decreasing\u00a0\nrest interval durations between sets was\u00a0\u00a0 as effective as increasing load. Of course,\u00a0\nthese studies did have their own limitations,\u00a0\u00a0 which we\u2019ve addressed in a previous video.\u00a0\nHowever, If we took these findings literally,\u00a0\u00a0 and combined it with the findings of\u00a0\nthis Nobrega study (that is, we\u2019ll\u00a0\u00a0 literally assume increasing load is better than\u00a0\nincreasing repetition numbers for hypertrophy),\u00a0\u00a0 using some illegal maths, we would come\u00a0\nto the conclusion that as decreasing rest\u00a0\u00a0 intervals is similarly effective to increasing\u00a0\nload for hypertrophy, but increasing load is\u00a0\u00a0 better than increasing repetition numbers for\u00a0\nhypertrophy, decreasing rest interval durations\u00a0\u00a0 between sets would be better than increase\u00a0\nrepetition numbers for hypertrophy. I\u2019m sure\u00a0\u00a0 many would agree this is an odd conclusion.\u00a0\nThe only way to truly assess the validity of\u00a0\u00a0 this would be to have further studies comparing\u00a0\nthese different forms of progressive overload. In summary, although this analysis by\u00a0\nNobrega et al. was highly interesting,\u00a0\u00a0 numerous limitations and potential counter\u00a0\nevidence exist. As such, I believe we can\u00a0\u00a0 be nowhere close to definitively concluding\u00a0\nthat increasing load is better than increasing\u00a0\u00a0 repetition numbers for hypertrophy, or that both\u00a0\nmethods are similarly effective for strength. Further research is unquestionably required. Before closing out, I should note I came across\u00a0\na post by Menno Henselmann briefly detailing this\u00a0\u00a0 Nobrega et al. analysis in an Instagram post,\u00a0\non which Brad Schoenfeld (a resistance training\u00a0\u00a0 researcher) not only gave his brief thoughts\u00a0\nbut also stated that his team has conducted\u00a0\u00a0 a study on this topic, with the results to be\u00a0\nreleased soon. When his study does get published,\u00a0\u00a0 I 100% plan and look forward to covering\u00a0\nit on the House of Hypertrophy channel. As always, thank you for watching. I hope\u00a0\nthis video was insightful in some way!"

    "transcript": "welcome to the house of hypertrophy Ryan humerston recently purchased electromography that's EMG equipment naming it a game changer it seems he plans to make a series of videos evaluating the best exercises for each muscle group using this EMG equipment believing this is truly science based many of his fans love the idea and are highly anticipating future EMG videos but as we'll dissect in this video the prevailing scientific literature indicates EMG has several flaws that render it extremely Limited in inferring the best exercises for hypertrophy I would go so far as to say that any of Ryan's conclusions from his EMG equipment have a high probability of just being plain wrong or at least misleading first things first I never actually planned to make videos on anybody else's content this will probably be the only exception I felt this video had to be made as not only are many of my subscribers sub to Ryan's Channel but his triceps EMG video was amongst the most watched by my Subs viewers deserve to know just how limited EMG is in reality before they go about changing their own training based on shoddy data this absolutely isn't a personal attack on Ryan whatsoever rather it's a scientifically Critical examination of what he shares in his recent videos [Music] EMG is said to measure muscle activation not only by Ryan but by multiple scientific researchers too the problem as detailed in this 2017 article is this isn't precisely true muscle activation is when the force generating components within muscle fibers are in motion strapping electrodes to a muscle doesn't record this so what does it record remember the reason a muscle activates in the first place is that it receives electrical signals from the brain and spinal cord EMG measures the strength of these electrical nerve signals delivered to the muscle the term for this is neuromuscular excitation now neuromuscular excitation comes before muscle activation but there are some steps between them meaning there isn't always a one-to-one relationship between neuromuscular excitation and muscle activation fatigue Dynamic contractions or fluctuating neural input can blur the relationship between neuromuscular excitation and muscle activation foreign measures neuromuscular excitation not truly muscle activation but guess what this is also somewhat of a lie as EMG does not reliably measure neuromuscular excitation a 2017 Italian study wonderfully illustrates this these researchers electrically stimulated the tibialis anterior muscle of subjects at a constant intensity at three different foot angles because the researchers electrically stimulated the muscle at a constant intensity at all three foot angles rather than the subjects producing their own voluntary muscle forces actual neuromuscular excitation would have been the same at all three foot angles if EMG reliably measured neuromuscular excitation it should find the same amplitude across the three different foot angles but this did not happen the EMG recording showed different amplitudes at each three different foot angles so this study demonstrates even if actual neuromuscular excitation is the same simply changing angles can produce different EMG recordings this matters as if we're comparing EMG recordings between exercises training and muscle at subtly different angles we can get different EMG recordings unrelated to actual neuromuscular excitation differences a muscles recruitment strategy can also influence the EMG recordings independent of actual neuromuscular excitation changes remember muscles contain many many fibers as a fun fact it's estimated the mere biceps contains anywhere from 172 000 to 418 000 muscle fibers these muscle fibers are layered and even if actual neuromuscular excitation is kept the same a muscle that recruits fibers from the deep to superficial level would produce different EMG recordings to a muscle that recruits fibers from The Superficial to deep level this is notable because if during an exercise we see higher EMG recordings with one muscle versus another muscle that muscle may not be truly experiencing greater neuromuscular excitation rather the different EMG recordings could be down to recruitment strategies in the scientific literature EMG recordings are consistently higher when training with heavier loads versus lighter loads even if repetitions are performed to failure in both situations this is a powerful argument against emg's ability to infer muscle growth as we know long-term research that actually measures muscle growth consistently finds both heavier and lighter loads are similar for muscle growth where reps are performed two or close to failure thus When comparing EMG recordings between exercises if one is technically heavier loading it can produce higher EMG recordings even though it might not actually be more hypertrophic as a potential example Ryan found that compared to close grip push-ups dips produced higher EMG signals from the triceps heads I have a feeling this might be because dips are technically heavier loading versus close grip push-ups if we compare the exercises with reps performed too failure at their long-term study design that measured muscle both after triceps gains could be similar between them as is the case When comparing heavy and light load training to failure [Music] our souls actually have elements in their Force generating units that can produce passive forces when stretched and EMG does not measure any of these passive forces as it only records electrical stuff this is noteworthy as the literature indicates passive tension stimulates muscle growth for example a new German study indicates that intense static stretching of the calves produce notable gastrocnemius growth matter of fact the magnitudes of gastrocnemius growth were similar to what's seen in studies that train was seated and standing calf raises furthermore exercises training muscles in stretched positions seem to be more powerful for hypertrophy we thoroughly examine this literature in our previous video a strong reason for this is passive forces at stretched muscle links augment their active contractor forces thereby leading to a more potent muscle building stimulus so emgs is nothing to inform us of these potentially critical passive forces this might relate to another one of Ryan's findings he stayed days incline Coast poorly hit the long biceps head and it hit the brachialis more yet we know incline coals would train the long head in a stretched position and again emg's does not pick up on stretch given that other evidence indicate stretch in an exercise is favorable for hypertrophy it's sensible to hypothesize incline coals would indeed be great for Long Head biceps gains it's Crystal Clear to see EMG has several flaws that preclude its usefulness in comparing the muscle growth value of different exercises no there might be some situations in which EMG may be potentially useful comparing EMG recordings between two exercises involving similar relative loading and angles might not be that bad for example comparing equivalently loaded weighted push-ups to bench presses with a similar range of motion maybe an alright comparison with EMG comparing EMG recordings before and after a training program in the same person may also be an alright thing to do finally comparing EMG recordings on the same exercise between different individuals might potentially be an okay way to assess muscle recruitment differences between people though there are some potential pitfalls with this one specifically in any event long-term research comparing actual measures of muscle growth after training with different exercises is

    "transcript": "[Music] previously at the house of hypertrophy we saw the scientific literature strongly indicates a wide range of rep numbers are similarly effective for muscle hypertrophy provided those reps are performed to or close to failure per set 6 to 35 reps are likely similar 3 to five reps may be less efficient per set so need extra sets to see similar hypertrophy to fewer sets with more reps though these different rep numbers produce similar hypertrophy magnitudes do they differ in the exact type of hypertrophy evoked it's hypothesize certain rep ranges promote denser appearing muscles While others produce puffy appearing muscles the idea of density and puffy muscles comes down to how muscle fibers grow there are three different ways a muscle fiber can technically grow before detailing them we must understand the muscle fibers contain myofibrils myofibrils contain the contractile Machinery that generates a muscle's force growth of the my fibros via increases in numbers or size of pre-existing ones will benefit strength as this means more contractile Machinery to generate Force aside from my fibros everything else in the muscle fiber can be considered the psychop lasm the psychop is largely water but also also houses other components like glycogen psychl proteins and non-contractile organel of course growth of the psychop alone does nothing for strength capacities One Way muscle fibers grow is through the my fibros and psychop growing at the same rate this is called myapi hypertrophy another way is through the myop fibros growing at a faster rate than the psychop this is called Mya packing for for this video I'm going to merge together Mya hypertrophy and Mya packing and collectively refer to them under the term myi hypertrophy the similarity between the two is they involve significant myof fibral growth the third and final way muscle fibers can grow is through the sarcoplasm growing at a faster rate than the my fibros this is called sarcoplasmic hypertrophy it's thought Mya hypertrophy creates a denser muscle appearance while psychop plasmic hypertrophy creates aier appearance as we noted it hypothesized certain rep ranges could Target myi or psychl hypertrophy more some broadly believe lower rips produce myi hypertrophy while higher rips produce soplas hypertrophy others refer to comparisons between bodybuilders and weightlifters or powerlifters for example the very popular book The Science and practice of strength training suggest Elite weightlifters see myi hypertrophy while bodybuilders see psychop plasmic hypertrophy of course weightlifters and powerlifters tend to train with five or fewer rips while bodybuilders with 8 to 15 rips in this video we'll address both arguments how do muscle fiber adaptations compare between lower and higher ribs as well as bodybuilders and power athletes certain scientific literature suggest rep Rangers May influence the type of fiber hypertrophy evoked a 2015 study from England compared muscle fiber characteristics from the vastest lateralis between 12 bodybuilders six power athletes and 14 untrained subjects the power athletes were American football players track and field athletes and weightlifters they were broadly described as training High high intensity the bodybuilder Diaries reveal they mostly trained with 8 to 15 rips it was found the specific tension of the bodybuilder fibers was 62% lower than the power athletes and 41% lower versus the untrained subjects the obvious question here is what on Earth is specific tension it measures the force a muscle fiber can produced per unit of its cross-sectional area remember the my fibos in the muscle fiber are essentially what produces Force so specific tension fundamentally measures how much of a fiber is taken up by my fibral so as the bodybuilders had lower specific tension versus the power athletes and control subjects their muscle fibers contain the lower myofiber amounts per cross-sectional area unit indirectly this implies their fibers contain more psychop potentially suggesting they've experienced psychop lasic hypertrophy whereas the power athletes more so my fi hypertrophy another 2008 study from Japan compared Elite bodybuilders to Elite weightlifters the bodybuilders had larger triceps cross-sectional areas and produced the greater overall triceps isometric Force however the ratio of triceps cross-sectional area to isometric triceps force was lower in the bodybuilders per another way per cross-sectional area unit the bodybuilder triceps were weaker than the weightlifters out of many possible explanations one is the bodybuilders triceps just contained a lower mifable amount and greater psychop Space versus the weightlifters in other words they've experienced psychop lasm hypertrophy the researchers also found in both the bodybuilders and weightlifters there was a correlation between triceps cross-sectional area and triceps isometric Force but the correlation was slightly stronger in the weightlifters this stronger correlation may be because their tricep size contains a higher myof fial amount versus the bodybuilders that is they've experienced myi hypertrophy creating the more precise relationship between their muscle size and strength we also have an array of other studies establishing in powerlifter specifically there are strong relationships between measures of muscle mass and their strength on the bench press Squat and deadlift this would suggest the power lifter's muscle size presumably consists of a ton of my fibros perhaps attained via my hypertrophy causing the strong relationship to strength a final piece of evidence comes from a 2010 study from Canada which compared four sets of repetitions to failure with either a 90% One Rate Max load or 30% One Rate Max load of course the 30% one R Max load achieved way more repetitions across sets 24 hours after the session psychop plasmic protein synthesis was greater for the 30% condition this very indirectly suggests the 30% one R Max load May produce psychl hypertrophy as one thing that could cause disproportionate psychop growth is an increase in psychop proteins that draw in additional water into the fiber so the data we've overviewed suggests bodybuilding tra training may cause psychop lasm hypertrophy while powerlifting or weightlifting may cause my fi hypertrophy also higher reps May produce psychop plasmic hypertrophy over lower reps a number of notable limitations exist with the studies just assessed in the English study that found a lower specific tension in bodybuilders and the Japanese study finding a lower ratio of tricep size to strength in bodybuilders anabolic steroids could be a confounder both studies involved highlevel competitive bodybuilders in fact the English study noted that nine of the 12 bodybuilders involved admitted to anabolic steroids usage this matters as it's very possible independent of rep ranges and overall training anabolic steroids may increase the occurrence of psychop hypertrophy unfortunately I'm not aware of any science that can truly validate this but in the words of Greg Knuckles from Stronger by science a lot of people report gaining a lot of weight very quickly when they go on steroids much more than could be explained by plain old Mya hypertrophy and losing it very quickly when they come off likely indicating shifts in the amount of water they're storing another limitation with the English and Japanese studies is causation cannot necessarily be drawn remember they just compared muscle fiber properties between bodybuilders and power athletes at one time point they cannot truly suggest the bodybuilders training caused the psychop lasm hypertrophy signs it remains possible the bodybuilders in these studies even way back before they even began training just had lower specific tension or lower size to strength ratios finally with the study finding greater psychop plasmic protein synthesis 24 hours after training with a 30 % versus a 90% One Rate Max load it's just a shortterm measurement in the absence of long-term measures it cannot prove greater psychop protein synthesis rates actually translate into measurable psychop hypertrophy furthermore the study actually found that 4 hours after the training session psychop plasmic protein synthesis rates were greater for the 90% one R Max condition so it's clear the current dat suggesting rep ranges can modulate the type of muscle fiber growth experienced is notably limited do we have any better quality evidence we do indeed and this evidence may suggest rep ranges do not influence the type of muscle fiber growth [Music] experienced we have an array of long-term studies directly finding myi hypertrophy here's a summary of them notice how all of them involve training with largely 7 to 12 repetitions these rep numbers are what bodybuilders commonly train with now this doesn't mean fewer Reps don't produce my hypertrophy it's just no research has longitudinally explored this in any case this is pretty strong evidence classic bodybuilding rep Rangers do not preferentially produced psychl lasic hypertrophy what about higher rep numbers we have some interesting research here too per set 6 to 35 reps are probably similarly effective for muscle hypertrophy provided those reps are performed too or close to failure yet strength gains as measured by one rep max on an exercise always tend to be better with a lower rep numbers and thus heavier loads for example we've partly overviewed this two 2015 study from New York and other videos they had trained men perform three sets per exercise hypertrophy outcomes were similar between training with 8 to 12 and 25 to 35 reps to failure per set yet bench press and squat strength adaptations were greater for the 8 to 12 rep group some may speculate that given 25 to 35 reps produce similar muscle size gains to 8 to 12 reps but lower strength gains the 25 to 35 reps may not be increasing myofibril amounts as much and hence must be producing psychop plasmic hypertrophy the problem with this speculation however is it ignores other factors besides myi growth that may contribute to one R max strength a one R Max is a skill there's evidence with the same exercise the precise technique and muscle recruitment patterns used differ between using light and heavier loads thus training with heavier loads would better develop your one red Max skill and specialized neural adaptations compared to lighter loads resultantly in the New York study finding greater one rep max strength gains with 8 to 12 versus 25 to 35 reps part of this is likely attributable to 25 to 35 reps producing lower skill and specialized neural adaptations versus 8 to 12 reps so we cannot be certain the lower War rate max strength gains with 25 to 35 reps have anything to do with psychop plasmic hypertrophy as opposed to measuring War R max strength testing isometric strength may be better in our context isometric strength tests involve a much lower skill component thus allowing us to better compare how increases in myofiber content compare between light and heavier low training when looking at the data that has done this as summarized by a 2017 meta analysis is out of New York isometric strength gains end up being similar between light and heavier load training in this case the heavier load training largely involved 8 to 12 repetitions to failure per set while the lighter load training involved 20 to 35 repetitions to failure per set now I know many people don't call 8 to 12 reps heavy training but for our purposes here we're just noting 8 to 12 reps is heavier training versus 20 to 35 reps to failure nevertheless this data would suggest that 20 to 35 reps are increasing myof fial content just as effectively to 8 to 12 reps furthermore recall many long-term studies find the 7 to 12 rep range is associated with Mya hypertrophy so extrapolating this and we can infer that 20 to 35 reps are also producing Mya hypertrophy summarizing this section the stronger evidence outlined provides good ground to infer different rep ranges may not produce different types of muscle fiber growths it appears a wide range of rep numbers can produce my fulara [Music] hypertrophy here's a table of all the current long-term studies finding psychl hypertrophy notice how three of the five used High volumes defined as performing 21 or more weekly sets per muscle group for example one of the studies by McDougall involved training with a minimum of 27 sets for the triceps per week another study involved training the quadriceps with 36 sets per week returning to the studies finding my fi hypertrophy notice how non used High volumes rather low to moderate volumes consequently High volumes may be what Drive sarcoplasmic hypertrophy yet I still advise caution in this conclusion as only three studies find an association between High volumes and psychop lasic hypertrophy however if High volumes do cause psychop hypertrophy this could explain the findings of earlier papers we assist remember the English and Japanese studies finding bodybuilders showed potential signs of psychop hypertrophy had notable limitations but it's also possible those bodybuilders trained with high volumes explaining their psychop plasmic hypertrophy indicators rather than rep Rangers per se in any event future research is still needed to truly establish if higher volumes cause psychop hypertrophy I also want to mention with the studies finding psychop hypertrophy except in one of them the magnitudes of relative psychop expansion were largely not that much for example in the mcdouall study involving at least 27 sets for the triceps per week although the triceps fiber cross-sectional area increased by 23% the relative space taken up by the my fibros in the fibers decreased by 2% only this indirectly indicates the psychop took up 2% more relative space I'm skeptical this small added relative space taken up by the psychop would manifest as more puffy looking muscles so in the real world and particularly for Naturals I don't think psychop hypertrophy is necessarily an aesthetic worry the degree of psychop relative expansion may just be trivial but again more research is certainly needed on psychop lasic hypertrophy overall including examinations of the magnitudes of psychop expansion in summary there scientific research one may use to suggest rep ranges preferentially caused my FIB or psychop lasm hypertrophy has very notable limitations much stronger evidence suggest that rep ranges may not impact what muscle fiber growth is experienced in fact this data seems to suggest a wide range of rep numbers can produce Mya hypertrophy finally some preliminary evidence indicates rather than rep ranges higher volume training may be what causes soplas hypertrophy if you've made it this far I have a

    "published_at": "2020-12-21T12:40:01Z",
    "transcript": "short rests or long rests which is better for maximizing muscle growth traditionally short rest intervals were believed to be optimal for building muscle indeed a 1987 study by kramer and colleagues found that bodybuilders used around 10 to 90 seconds of rest between sets this was in contrast to power lifters who rested around 120 to 140 seconds between sets even today if you follow any social media general fitness pages or have read any classic personal training textbooks you may have come across the notion that shorter rest periods are superior for building muscle whereas longer rest periods are better for building strength the idea shorter rest intervals are superior for muscle growth thus have origins in scientific research research has shown that when using shorter rest intervals anabolic hormones mainly growth hormone are elevated significantly more than using longer rest intervals it speculated this greater acute elevation in anabolic hormones would result in greater muscle growth however we cannot necessarily assume just because something induces a greater acute hormonal response it will cause greater muscle growth interestingly when looking at the current research greater acute anabolic hormone elevations do not appear to be correlated to muscle growth as a result the idea that shorter rest intervals produce greater muscle growth due to the greater acute hormonal response is not supported opposed to the research assessing the acute hormonal responses to various rest intervals it would be much better to look at research assessing measures of muscle growth before and after a set duration in groups using different rest intervals let us evaluate this research for compound exercises the weight of the current evidence suggests that longer rest intervals may be superior to shorter rest intervals for building muscle compound exercises involve the movement of two or more joints resulting in multiple muscle groups being trained examples include the back score bench press deadlift barbell row overhead press and many more let's briefly overview the research on compound exercises and rest intervals longo and colleagues had 28 untrained individuals perform leg presses for three sets to failure which is the point at which no more repetitions can be performed with an eighty percent one rep max load twice per week for ten weeks increases in quadriceps cross-sectional area were superior when resting for three minutes between sets compared to resting one minute between sets schoenfeld and colleagues had 13 men with at least six months of training experience perform a range of exercises each for three sets to failure with an 8 to 12 rep max load three times per week for eight weeks the exercises were the back squat leg press leg extension bench press overhead press lat pull down and cable row except for the leg extension all of these exercises are compound increases in elbow flexor triceps brachii anterior quadriceps and vastus lateralis thickness favored the group resting for three minutes compared to the group resting for one minute between sets baresh and colleagues split 12 men with some training experience but not in the three months before the study into a group resting 2.5 minutes between sets or a group resting one minute between sets both groups trained four times per week for 10 weeks with workout 1 and workout 2 each repeated twice per week a range of compound exercises were used the group resting 2.5 minutes between sets experienced greater increases in thigh and arm cross-sectional area fink and colleagues split 14 untrained individuals into a group resting 2.5 minutes between sets or a group resting 30 seconds between sets both groups train the bench press and back squat for four sets to failure with a 40 one rep max load twice per week for eight weeks you may be questioning the percent one rep max load however for hypertrophy this is perfectly fine the current evidence suggests that loads between 30 percent and 85 percent warn rep max produce similar hypertrophy provided reps are performed to failure increases in triceps cross-sectional area were similar between both groups but increases in thigh cross-sectional area favored the group resting 2.5 minutes between sets there actually is one paper finding shorter rest intervals to be superior for muscle growth with compound exercises villanova and colleagues split 22 untrained elderly men their average age was 68 years old into a group resting four minutes between sets or a group resting one minute between sets both groups perform the leg press machine chest press lat pull down seated row dumbbell step-ups dumbbell romanian deadlifts knee extensions and leg curls for two to three sets with 46 reps three times per week for eight weeks increases in lean body mass were superior for the group resting one minute between sets however this study does have limitations the subjects were elderly men later we'll explore how age impacts recovery between sets but more importantly volume load the product of sets times reps times load was equated between the one minute rest group and the four minute rest group this would have meant that the one minute rest group was training closer to failure to illustrate this let's say your one route max on the bench press is 100 kilograms and you had to perform three sets of eight reps with 75 kilograms which would be more difficult resting one minute between sets or resting four minutes between sets of course resting one minute between sets would be harder as you would be training closer to failure on your subsequent sets thanks to the decreased recovery time therefore it's unclear what the result of the villanova and quality study would look like if both the one-minute rest group and four-minute rest group took their sets to failure remember the four studies we have looked at so far finding greater hypertrophy for longer rest intervals had subjects take their sets to or close to failure so the current evidence suggests that when subjects train with the same program and proximity to failure longer rest intervals so 2.5 to 3 minutes seems to produce greater hypertrophy than shorter rest intervals one minute or less with compound exercises the same training program detail is worth elaborating on the same training program would imply that a longer rest group and a shorter risk group perform the same number of sets on their exercises there is some evidence suggesting that if you use shorter rest intervals performing more sets may be compensatory meaning that more sets and shorter rest intervals could produce similar hypertrophy to fewer sets and longer rest intervals returning to the longer and colleague study they found that when subjects trained twice per week for 10 weeks performing four to five sets to failure on the leg press with an eighty percent one remax load and one minute of rest between sets produce similar increases in quadriceps cross-sectional area to performing three sets to failure on the leg press with an eighty percent one rep max load and three minutes of rest between sets italian and colleagues found that resting two minutes between sets produced similar increases in quadriceps cross-sectional area to resting five minutes between sets when participants performed an average one more set when resting two minutes between sets although two minutes of rest between sets would not be seen as a short rest interval to many people another way one could potentially interpret this study is that despite the more sets two minutes of rest between sets could be sufficient and resting for longer may not be required unfortunately there currently isn't any other papers comparing two minutes or rest between sets to other longer rest intervals for hypertrophy as a result we can only conclude that based on the current evidence with all else equal longer rest intervals so 2.5 to 3 minutes produce greater hypertrophy than shorter rest intervals of one minute or less with compound exercises however when all else is not equal this might not be the case specifically performing one or two more sets with shorter rest intervals may be able to produce similar hypertrophy to longer rest intervals unfortunately with isolation exercises the evidence is less clear on how long you should rest isolation exercises primarily involve movement at one joint resulting in primarily one muscle group being trained examples include bicep curls triceps push downs lateral raises leg extensions leg curls and many more returning to the baresh and colleague study a range of isolation exercises were used as already mentioned increases in arm and thigh cross sectional area were greater for the group resting 2.5 minutes between sets compared to the group resting one minute between sets therefore this study implies longer rest intervals are also favorable with isolation movements however it could be argued that the use of compound exercises in the study somewhat confounded our ability to truly deduce if longer rest intervals are better with isolation movements what about the research evaluating rest intervals with isolation exercises exclusively fink and colleagues had 22 individuals perform bicep curls preacher curls hammer curls close grip bench presses tricep skull crushers and dumbbell extensions except for the close grip bench press all of these exercises are isolation but the close grip bench press was used to isolate the triceps so this is not really a problem the researchers had one group perform these exercises with a 20 rep max load and 30 seconds of rest between sets and another group performed them with an 8 rep max load and 3 minutes of rest between sets both groups took their sets to failure and performed the same number of sets for some reason the paper did not state the number of sets performed both groups trained twice per week for eight weeks increases in arm cross sectional area favored the group using a 20 rep max load and 30 seconds of rest between sets therefore this study suggests that with isolation exercises shorter rest intervals may be superior load was not controlled the group that rested 30 seconds between sets used a 20 rep max load while the group that rested 3 minutes between sets used an 8 rep max load it could be argued that this somewhat confounded the study recall earlier i mentioned that the current evidence suggests that loads between 30 and 85 percent of one rep max produce similar growth when reps are performed to failure this would imply that the use of different loads should not matter another study by okazi and colleagues assigned to each arm of nine untrained men into one of three conditions three sets to failure with an eighty percent one rare max load and three minutes of rest between sets three sets to failure with a thirty percent one rate max load and ninety seconds or rest between sets or a drop set condition the drop set condition had the arm perform an initial set to failure with an eighty percent one rep max load immediately after they performed four drop sets to failure starting with a sixty five percent one rep max load then a fifty percent one rep max load then a forty percent one ramx load and finally a thirty percent one rep max load all three conditions involve training the unilateral dumbbell biceps curl two to three times per week for eight weeks increases in cross-sectional area of the elbow flexors which included the biceps braca and brachialis were similar between all three conditions therefore this study implies that with isolation exercises rest intervals may not matter at all not only did three minutes of rest produce similar growth to 90 seconds of rest but virtually no rest between sets the drop set condition was not any worse now the drop set condition did technically perform five sets which is two more than the other two conditions more sets generally result in more growth and so this could have helped out the drop set condition so the current evidence is completely conflicting with regards to rest intervals and isolation exercises with one paper finding longer rest intervals to be superior another finding shorter rest intervals to be superior and even one finding no differences between various rest intervals to mighty the waters even further there is one paper finding drop set training so no rest between sets to be superior to traditional training for hypertrophy with an isolation exercise finke and colleagues split 16 men untrained in the last year into a normal set group or a drop set group both groups trained the triceps push down twice per week for eight weeks the drop set group performed a single set to failure with a 12 rep max load immediately decreasing the load by 20 each time failure was reached three times in a row the normal set group performed three sets to failure with a 12 rep max load and 90 seconds of rest between sets increases in triceps cross-sectional area favored the drop set group in this study the drop set group did technically perform one more set than the normal set group similar to the ocassion colleague study this could have helped out the drop set condition given the conflicting evidence we don't really have any grounds to conclude if shorter rest intervals or longer rest intervals are better for hypertrophy with isolation exercises i think it's sensible to suggest that one should aim to rest however long they feel is comfortable and practical with these movements although we were unable to conclude if longer or shorter rest intervals are preferred with isolation exercises we did conclude that with compound exercises longer rest intervals appear to be favorable why might longer rest intervals produce greater hypertrophy with compound exercises some researchers have suggested this is because longer rest intervals allow for a higher volume load the product of sets times reps times load for instance in the already mentioned longo and colleague study they measured the volume load completed over the 10 week duration in the two conditions performing three sets on the leg press twice per week for 10 weeks total volume load was higher in the condition that arrested three minutes between sets versus the condition that arrested one minute between sets the authors contended that this higher volume load accumulated with the three minute rest condition explained the greater increases in quadriceps cross-sectional area observed for this condition however this assumes that higher volume loads result in more growth when overviewing the research this isn't the case to be clear volume in the form of weekly sets is related to hypertrophy for instance a meta-analysis by schoenfeld and colleagues found that with all else equal the more sets that are two or close to failure performed per week the greater the muscle growth but the number of weekly sets that are too close to failure and volume load is not the same thing remember in the longer and colleague study both the three minute rest condition and one minute rest condition involve three sets to failure on the leg press each session but as just mentioned volume load was higher for the three minute rest condition here's the important point we have strong evidence volume load is unrelated to muscle growth this comes from research on rep ranges as already mentioned loads between 30 percent and 85 percent one rep max appear to produce similar muscle growth provided reps are taken to failure based on this three sets to failure with an eighty percent one rep max load should produce similar muscle growth to performing three sets to failure with a sixty percent one rate max load let's say an individual's warner max is 100 kilograms on an exercise when performing three sets to failure with an 80 one rep max load so 80 kilograms assuming a longer rest interval we might expect them to get seven reps on the first set six reps on the second set and five reps on the final set this would give us a volume load of four thousand three hundred and twenty kilograms when performing three sets to failure with a sixty percent one rep max load so 60 kilograms providing a longer rest interval we might expect them to get 15 reps on the first set 13 reps on the second set and 11 reps on the final set this would give us a volume load of seven thousand and twenty kilograms if volume load was an indicator of muscle growth we would expect three sets with a sixty percent one rep max load to produce greater hypertrophy than three sets with an eighty percent one rep max load but from the research on rep ranges both protocols would probably produce similar hypertrophy therefore the idea that longer rest intervals produce greater hypertrophy because they enable higher volume loads cannot be true moreover if volume load was the reason why would this not apply to isolation exercises longer rest intervals would allow a greater volume load with isolation exercises yet as established the research on rest intervals and isolation exercises is conflicting a stronger hypothesis behind why longer rest intervals appear to produce greater hypertrophy with compound exercises relates to central fatigue i must credit chris beardsley eric helms and james krieger from where i initially came across this hypothesis it was their work that inspired me to research this area much further to understand this hypothesis we need to understand central fatigue the reason muscles produce force is because they receive signals originating from the central nervous system the central nervous system consists of the brain and spinal cord there are two neurons involved here an upper motor neuron and a lower motor neuron upper motor neurons originate in the cerebral cortex which is the outer layer of the cerebrum the cerebrum refers to the two hemispheres of the brain upper motor neurons mostly end at a region in the spinal cord lower motor neurons mostly start at a region in the spinal cord and end at a particular muscle upper motor neurons transmit electrical signals to lower motor neurons which relay this signal to a muscle causing muscle contraction central fatigue refers to a decrease in these electrical signals to the muscle [Music] at the level of the muscle this means that not only do the recruited muscle fibers produce less force but fewer muscle fibers are recruited overall this is the opposite of what we want for maximizing muscle growth we want high levels of muscle fiber recruitment and high levels of force produced by each of those recruited muscle fibers during a set on an exercise two or close to failure central fatigue likely develops there are numerous potential mechanisms behind how central fatigue occurs during exercise one particular mechanism that is linked to hypertrophy training sets is afferent feedback afferents are neurons that transmit information from organs to the central nervous system there are sensory neurons linking muscles to the central nervous system two of these group three afferents and group four afferents have been associated with central fatigue group three afferents are primarily sensitive to strong levels of muscle contraction but they do also appear to respond to the build up of metabolites group 4 afferents are primarily sensitive to the buildup of metabolites within the muscle but they do also appear to respond to strong levels of muscle contraction just to be clear the build-up of metabolites refers to the increase of various products linked to chemical reactions in the muscle such as lactate inorganic phosphate and hydrogen ions when training to or close to failure the majority of a muscle's fibers would be producing strong contractions additionally the buildup of metabolites likely occurs too especially during higher repetition sets in response to these conditions group 3 and group 4 afferents can directly or indirectly reduce the electrical signal sent down by lower motor neurons [Music] this means less force production from recruited muscle fibers as well as a reduction in the overall muscle fibers recruited which as established is what we do not want it's impossible to remove central fatigue during our sets however we would want to begin our next set once this central fatigue has disappeared and this is the basis of the hypothesis it's believed longer rest intervals would make it less likely for us to begin a set when central fatigue is still present however why would this particular argument only apply to compound and not isolation exercises some evidence indirectly implies that the more muscle mass involved in an exercise the greater the central fatigue generated because compound exercises involve a greater amount of muscle mass compared to isolation exercises this would imply that sets of compound exercises produce greater central fatigue and thus require longer rest intervals compared to isolation exercises but i have come across research opposing this central fatigue hypothesis a review paper by weevil and colleagues actually suggests that the less muscle mass in an exercise the greater the central fatigue generated an isometric unilateral elbow flexion contraction produced greater central fatigue than unilateral knee extensions these knee extensions also produce greater central fatigue than cycling out of these three modes of exercise cycling involves the greatest amount of muscle mass followed by unilateral knee extensions and then unilateral elbow flexion contractions furthermore as far as i'm aware there are no studies investigating how quickly central fatigue disappears after sets of typical weight training exercises but there is indirect data that would imply central fatigue disappears fairly rapidly kennedy and colleagues had subjects perform a maximum voluntary contraction of the quadriceps for two minutes immediately after there were minimal signs of central fatigue another study by kennedy and colleagues had subjects perform a two-minute maximum voluntary contraction of the adductor pollicis which is a muscle of the hand central fatigue had almost fully dissipated after one minute of rest todd and colleagues had subjects perform a two-minute maximum voluntary contraction for the elbow flexors central fatigue had dissipated within 30 seconds of completing the exercise of course these protocols are not identical to sets with typical weight training exercises most exercises are performed with a concentric and eccentric phase while the mentioned studies involved maximum isometric contractions moreover all of these studies involve two-minute contractions most typical sets last far less than two minutes this is an important point there seems to be a belief that heavier loads and therefore shorter set durations cause the most central fatigue however this is a misconception lighter loads and therefore longer duration sets seem to cause greater central fatigue this study had subjects perform an isometric contraction with their quadriceps for 33 straight minutes at 15 percent of their maximum voluntary isometric contraction strength the authors noted central fatigue dissipated within three to nine minutes after this protocol another study had subjects perform an isometric contraction with their elbow flexors for 43 straight minutes at 15 percent of their maximum voluntary isometric contraction central fatigue took roughly 20 minutes to disappear smith and colleagues had subjects perform an isometric contraction with their elbow flexors for 70 straight minutes at five percent of their maximum voluntary isometric contraction 30 minutes after finishing this central fatigue was still present they did not take any further measurements after these 30 minutes so we do not know when central fatigue fully dissipated therefore given typical hypertrophy sets are generally shorter in duration than two minutes their indirect evidence would suggest that central fatigue should disappear quicker than the values we saw for the various two-minute isometric contractions potentially implying that central fatigue disappears after 30 seconds or less of typical hypertrophy sets but as we saw with the research 2.5 to 3 minute rest intervals produced greater hypertrophy than one minute or less with compound exercises as a result there seems to be a potential flaw with the central fatigue hypothesis i should note the research we have looked at assessing how long it takes for central fatigue to disappear used isometric contractions for only one muscle group essentially meaning they are isolation exercises but remember although there is some indirect evidence suggesting compound exercises could induce greater central fatigue than isolation exercises the review paper by weevil and colleagues suggests otherwise at the end of the day to truly know if central fatigue could be the reason behind why longer rest intervals are superior with compound exercises we would need research assessing how long central fatigue takes to disappear after various sets with compound exercises as well as isolation exercises aside from distinguishing between compound and isolation exercises it's often overlooked that sex age and even your current strength levels can play a role in determining the duration of rest intervals most of the studies looked at so far had men as their subjects though a few studies did have both men and women as their subjects but this clouds our ability to draw out any potential differences between men and women some evidence suggests women may be able to recover quicker between sets compared to men rata mess and colleagues recruited 22 men and women with at least one year of training experience the subjects performed three sets on the bench press with a 75 one rep max load on three separate occasions they perform this protocol with either one minute two minute or three minutes of rest between sets the subjects were encouraged to perform 10 reps per set looking at the results regardless of the rest interval used women performed a higher number of reps over the three sets compared to the men indicating they had a greater recovery ability other studies also have similar findings however the authors noted that when they adjusted for bench press strength there was no difference in repetition performance between men and women over the three sets this would suggest that gender per se did not explain the faster recovery rather it appears your strength level impacts how quickly you recover in other words the weaker you are on an exercise the quicker your performance can recover conversely the stronger you are on an exercise the longer it would take for your performance to recover in this study the woman's average bench press one rep max was 36 kilograms while the men's average bench press warner at max was 112 kilograms given the women were weaker than the men in this study this seemed to explain why they were better able to sustain their repetitions from set to set to further test this idea the researchers had a second part of the study 22 men were split into a low one rep max group or a high one rep max group on average the low one rep max group's bench press was 81 kilograms while the high one rep max group's bench press was 141 kilograms the subjects performed three sets on the bench press with a 75 one rep max load on three separate occasions they performed this with either one minute two minutes or three minutes of rest between sets the subjects were encouraged to perform 10 reps per set looking at the results regardless of the rest interval used the low warner max group were able to sustain their repetitions across the three sets better than the high warner max group therefore regardless if you're a man or woman the weaker you are on an exercise the faster you can probably recover between sets of that exercise and so your rest intervals need not be excessive here having said all of this there is other evidence suggesting that when women and men are matched for strength women are still able to recover faster philco and colleagues match nine men and nine women for strength of their doctor policies the researchers had subjects perform a fatiguing isometric contraction of their doctor pollicis one minute after this the woman had recovered to 71 of their baseline strength while the men only recovered to 65 of their baseline strength research comparing various physiological and anatomical differences between men and women also support the idea women may intrinsically have the ability to recover quicker between sets some evidence indicates women have greater blood flow than men greater blood flow to the muscle would accelerate the recovery process between sets additionally some evidence suggests that women have a higher proportional area of type 1 muscle fibers compared to men type 1 fibers often called slow twitch muscle fibers have faster recovery abilities and are more fatigue resistant compared to type 2 fibers which are often called fast twitch muscle fibers based on this woman would not only be able to recover quicker between sets but each set would also generate less fatigue so irrespective of whether their exercise is isolation or compound women can probably rest shorter than men would without any problem although we could not conclude anything with isolation exercises we did conclude that with compound exercises 2.5 to 3 minutes of rest between sets was superior to shorter durations but this conclusion was from studies that mainly involved men women may be able to get away with resting one to two minutes between sets of compound exercises [Music] all but one of the studies assessed so far have focused on young men and women two studies suggest that elderly men and women may be able to recover faster between sets than younger men and women theo and colleagues recruited 20 young women between 20 and 30 years old and 16 elderly women between 60 and 80 years old the researchers had these subjects performed three sets with an eight rep max of load on an isokinetic dynamometer designed to provide knee extension and knee flexion resistance on three different days they performed this with either 15 seconds 30 seconds or 60 seconds of rest between sets for both the young and elderly women 60 seconds of rest resulted in the maintenance of knee extension torque throughout the three sets while the 30 and 15 second rest intervals did not neither the young or old woman were able to maintain knee flexor torque across the three sets with 15 seconds of rest between sets but both were able to maintain knee flexor torque with 60 seconds of rest between sets but the elderly woman were also able to maintain knee flexor torque throughout the three sets with 30 seconds of rest between sets this implies that for the elderly 30 seconds of rest between sets was sufficient to recover knee flexion talk whereas the younger woman required 60 seconds of rest between sets therefore this study partially supports the idea that elderly women may be able to recover quicker between sets compared to younger women another study by botaro and colleagues recruited 17 young men their average age was 25 years old and 20 elderly men their average age was 66 years old the subjects performed knee extensions for 3 sets of 10 reps on two separate occasions they performed this with either 60 seconds or 120 seconds of rest between sets with both rest intervals the young men experienced a greater decline in peak knee extension torque across the three sets compared to the elderly men indicating the elderly men had a quicker recovery between their sets in the two studies the elderly subjects were weaker compared to the younger subjects as discussed already this strength difference likely would partly explain why the elderly may be able to recover quicker between sets however there is also evidence that with aging there is a decrease in the size of type 2 muscle fibers and an increase in the proportion of type 1 muscle fibers as mentioned type 1 fibers have quicker recovery abilities and are more fatigue resistant compared to type 2 fibers this would be another potential reason behind why the elderly may be able to recover quicker between sets compared to the young when we looked at the research on compound exercises and muscle growth the study by villanova and colleagues was conducted on elderly men the average age was 68 years old increases in lean body mass were greater for the group resting one minute between sets compared to the group resting four minutes between sets on the face of it this would support the idea that the elderly can successfully use shorter rest intervals but recall volume load was equated between the two groups meaning the one minute rest group would have been training closer to failure than the 4-minute risk group therefore it's unclear how this study would conclude if both groups took their sets to failure so more research would be required to truly get an idea of what rest intervals promote greater hypertrophy in the elderly ultimately from the acute research the elderly can probably wrestle less between their sets compared to the young with isolation exercises the only sensible advice to give based on the current evidence would be to select a rest interval the elderly may find comfortable and practical for compound exercises given the majority of the evidence implies that 2.5 to 3 minutes of rest between sets produces greater hypertrophy than shorter restorations in young men it could be assumed that the elderly may be able to achieve optimal muscle growth with a rest interval shorter than this perhaps one to two minutes of rest between sets of compound exercises is sufficient [Music] there is some evidence that a person could over time slowly decrease the duration of their rest intervals without compromising muscle hypertrophy de souza and colleagues split 20 men with at least one year of training experience into a constant rest group or a decreasing rest group both groups trained six days per week for eight weeks for the first two weeks both groups trained identically they performed all exercises for three sets with a 10 to 12 rep max load and two minutes of rest between sets workout 1 and workout 2 were each performed 3 times per week from weeks 3 to 8 both groups performed each exercise for 4 sets with an 8 to 10 rep max load but their rest intervals differed their weekly workout schedule also changed the constant rest group continued using two minutes of rest between sets the decreasing risk group throughout these six weeks gradually decreased the duration of their rest intervals weekly from 105 seconds to 30 seconds of rest between sets after the 8 weeks increases in thigh and arm cross sectional area were similar between both groups put differently gradually decreasing your rest duration week to week appeared to not compromise muscle growth in comparison to a group consistently resting two minutes between sets a range of compound and isolation exercises were performed by both groups returning to our findings much earlier the research is conflicting on whether long or short rest intervals are optimal with isolation exercises but with compound exercises 2.5 to 3 minutes of rest between sets produced greater increases in muscle hypertrophy versus shorter rest durations based on this information you could argue that the constant rest group was not resting optimally anyway as they rested only 2 minutes between sets given 2.5 to 3 minutes of rest is preferred for compound exercises we cannot truly conclude that gradually decreasing rest intervals does not compromise muscle growth at the same time though it's important to consider that the conclusion 2.5 to 3 minutes or rest is preferred for compound exercises comes from research comparing this rest interval to durations of one minute or less it's possible that when comparing 2.5 to 3 minutes of rest to 2 minutes or rest between sets with compound exercises there would be no difference in muscle growth but there is no research assessing this hopefully future research looks at this so although the preliminary evidence on the use of decreasing rest intervals is somewhat promising more evidence is still most definitely required also once an individual has reached a short rest interval and decides to maintain this rest interval it's not clear how this would compare to someone using a longer rest interval in the long term for example in the dasosa and quality study the decreasing rest group used 30 seconds of rest between sets in their final week what if they maintain this rest interval for say the next 10 weeks would increases in arm and thigh cross-sectional area still be similar to the constant rest group using a two-minute rest interval again future research would be needed to address this question [Music]"

    "transcript": "welcome to the house of hypertrophy what is the most effective way to build as much muscle while training as little as possible today we're dissecting the latest science behind just this step by step we'll uncover how to effectively manipulate all the trading variables as well as utilize Advanced Techniques to successfully cut the amount you train while still trying to gain as much as possible let's dive straight in at the house of hypertrophy we've seen countless times that reps between 6 to 35 produce similar muscle hypertrophy provided you're getting two or close to failure reps below six can still build muscle but appear to require extra sets for example one paper finds per exercise seven sets of three reps produced similar muscle gains to three sets of 10 reps a second paper found that seven sets of four reps produce similar muscle gains to three sets of 12 reps thus if time is of the essence it's best to train within that 6 to 35 rep range sticking to the 6 to 12 rep Zone May save time due to fewer total reps although this does require you to load up heavier weights which sometimes cancels out time saved as for repetition speed despite it being widely believed slower tempos are needed for maximum growth this recent review established that scientific literature finds repetition durations between 2 to 8 seconds are likely comparably effective for building muscle so you may lean toward the faster end of the spectrum to save time some prefer combining a faster lifting Tempo with a slower controlled lowering Tempo there is some evidence this builds muscle better but it's not a consistent finding nevertheless I believe this is a perfectly fine thing to do if you enjoy it the scientific literature suggests the total number of sets you perform is likely more important than how many times per week a muscle is trained so let's start with sets to make sure we're all on the same page say you train two sets of back swats on Monday two sets of leg presses on Wednesday and two sets of leg extensions on Friday this totals up to six weekly sets for the quads on average the available data points towards 12 to 20 weekly sets per muscle group probably being n ideal recent data suggests more than this might be better under specific circumstances but can we still see notable gains with fewer sets as suggested by this meta Anis the answer is yes meta analyses combine the results of numerous papers firstly I need to mention that the published paper of this analysis actually contains counting error many people are unfortunately unaware of this and so when you see the numbers of this analysis in other videos it is not entirely correct here I'll be reporting the fixed numbers I obtained from an article by one of the authors of the paper the analysis found fewer than five weekly sets for a muscle still produced measurable hypertrophy It produced 53% of the growth that training with more than 10 weekly sets per muscle group achieved now fewer than five sets is vague but most studies use two to four weekly sets per muscle thus this may be the minimal amount of training needed to see some Fair gains but I would lean towards four weekly sets per muscle as inferred in this review on time efficient hypertrophy however there are some considerations most studies used untrained indiv uals but we still have a paper finding that three weekly sets per muscle elicited measurable gains in trained men regardless as these results are averages it's likely some trained individuals and perhaps even untrained individuals struggle to grow from these lower sets in fact this recent paper found some previously untrained older adults hardly grew with two weekly sets for the quads but experienced much better gains with eight weekly sets for the quads therefore consider 2 to four weekly sets as a general recommendation if it's not working for you or if you want a higher chance of seeing more growth bump up the numbers if this is too time consuming don't worry we'll soon describe how you can utilize Advanced Techniques that technically enable you to train with higher volumes while saving time we mentioned how 6 to 12 reps is generally a good Zone to be in with your sits but do you need to perform these reps to actual failure a recent meta regression suggests training to failure is superior but understand that there were limitations that led the researches to emphasize caution when dissecting what I feel to be the highest quality papers stopping one to three reps from failure seems to produce similar muscle gains to training to failure but these papers involve training with six or more weekly sets per muscle it's possible with fewer sets pushing harder and training to failure is better the closest paper that can help us is this one which had subjects largely perform two weekly sets per muscle one group went to complete failure while a second group performed their reps just shy of failure muscle mass increases were better with training to failure as this is one study and the hyper measure wasn't the most precise it's most definitely not conclusive evidence anyhow I think it's a solid idea with few assists to do your best to train to failure or at least get as close as you can how many days per week should you distribute your weekly sets for a muscle across on average the most recent scientific literature suggests that when the total number of weekly sets per muscle is kept the same muscle growth is largely similar regardless of how many days per week you distribute those sets across thus you're free to select Whatever frequency you prefer we'll provide some training program examples in the next section on exercise selection [Music] here I'll be providing two different approaches to exercise selection compound exercises train multiple muscle groups making them time efficient for instance squatting motions can significantly grow the quads gluteus maximus and adductors pushing exercises like the bench press can effectively grow the chest triceps and front delts as a bare minimum the simple first approach is to have a push exercise pulling exercise squatting motion and hip dominant exercise these collectively stimulate nearly every muscle in the body if you have extra time adding some isolation exercises to Target your choice of muscles can be worthwhile to balance things be it isolation for the biceps triceps side delts or even leg isolation here's a very simple example we're largely getting two to four weekly sets per muscle and it may be most practical to divide this into two sessions per week besides the simple approach a more complex second approach is to divide our sets across greater exercise variety for more complete muscular developments at the house of hypertrophy we currently have an ongoing series on optimally developing each muscle and the knowledge in these videos can help you identify which exercise combinations can be beneficial even so here's an example two-day a week program that I crafted with the help of the excellent Alpha progression app largely involving two to four weekly sets per muscle for the quads we have squats on one day which highly develop the vasty quad heads and leg extensions the other day which targets the rectus foror of the quads much better than squatting motions for the hamstrings we have ROM remaining deadlifts on one day and seated leg curls on the other and these different motions likely Target slightly different haming regions for the glutes both the squats and rdls will help develop it for the chest we have the bench rest on one day an incline on the second day which can help bring up the upper chest for the back we have pull Downs on one day and barbell rows on the other day and these likely preferentially Target slightly different areas of the back finally we have some isolation exercise to potentiate biceps triceps side Del Cal and ab growth some machine exercises are involved but this is perfectly fine as the scientific literature finds Mach gen exercises can be similarly effective to free weights for building muscle a lot of these exercises involve attaining a great stretch this is purposeful as emerging evidence suggests these types of exercises are powerful for building muscle for example seated leg hes attain a greater hamstring stretch than lying leg hes and appear to produce Superior hamstrings hypertrophy overhead extensions attain a greater tricep stretch than push downs and appear to produce Superior triceps hypertrophy thus exercises attaining a stretch can help us reap even more gains from our few sets now there is contention about whether the benefit of stretched exercises persists in the long term but I'll discuss this in a future video If you dislike this general program or are just interested in potential Alternatives the alpha progression app may help you out it can generate a program tailored 100% to your needs in a minute or less just select the equipment you have if you want fewer or more sessions per week the session duration and if you want to focus or neglect certain muscles to reduce training time more sets can be reduced to the recommendations from this video plus there are Advanced methods we'll describe soon during workouts the apps algorithm dissects your past performance to provide progression recommendations to assist you with making continued gains there are aesthetic graphs that automatically track your progression and a massive exercise data space with simplified text and video instructions the link in the comments and description gives you a free 2E trial and if you like it the link gives you 20% off a subscription the app's numerous reviews speak to its high quality back to the video remember that if these lower set numbers aren't working bump up the numbers if this is a time constraint or if you would just like to shorten training time even more the scientific literature suggests we can utilize some Advanced methods but but before that it's worth discussing rest time between sets how long should you rest between your exercise sets Shor rests are commonly recommended for hypertrophy yet the research actually finds when total sets are equated resting around 2.5 to 3 minutes between sets builds more muscle than shorter rest times compound exercises are overwhelmingly used in the research finding this with isolation exercises it's possible short rest could be fine regardless this still means a significant chunk of typical training is spent resting interestingly it might be possible to build up tolerance to short the rests so that muscle gains are not compromised this concept comes from two papers that found progressively decreasing rest time between sets across weeks produced similar muscle gains to a group using the same rest time more studies are needed to properly validate it but you could try out if it's not appealing don't worry let's now describe some other Advanced time-saving methods the following methods can generally cut your training time down by 50% super sets tend to have you perform two exercises back to back and then rest super setting exercises that train different muscles are the best for minimizing fatigue and maintaining performance with antagonistic suets being quite popular these involve training opposing muscle groups for example instead of Performing three sets of bench presses and then three sets of rows you perform them suers seted research suggest antagonistic supersets largely do not compromise performance in fact there are some documented cases of increased performance such as this paper that founds performing leg Coes before leg extensions increased the number of reps on the leg extension as for research measuring hypertrophy we have two studies one supersetting a biceps and triceps exercise and the second Su setting leg Coes and leg extensions both largely finding non-significant differences in muscle gains to normal sets non-related super sets are likely also a fine option on the table going back to our example program we could employ these antagonistic suets and non-related suets the alpha progress regression app has a neat feature that enables us to do just this Based on metaanalytic data drop sets seem to be mostly similarly effective for building muscle to normal sets there are different ways drop sets can be performed but from a Time efficiency perspective the best approach may be to perform reps 2 or n failure with a load then immediately reduce the load by 20% and perform reps two on N failure again 2 to four drops are recommended and we have researched suggesting three or four drops may be equivalent in stimulus to three normal sets while cutting training time down by more than 50% drop sets like these are going to be super challenging and tough and they are probably best used with isolation exercises like the highest quality research on this topic has done going back to our example as opposed to Super setting some of the isolation movements we could just use drop sets again the alpha progression app has a neat feature that permits us to do this here I'll Define rest por training as performing reps two or n failure resting for a short duration and then performing reps two or n failure again with the same load you repeat this a couple more times or until you reach a desired total number of Reps for example you may have a target of Performing 20 overall repetitions with a load you can perform 10 Max reps it may look like this fascinatingly two papers using rest pause methods such as this have found Superior hypertrophy compared to normal sets with one of the papers reporting it cart training dime down by 38% yet a potentially critical limitation of these papers is the normal set largely trained much further from failure thereby limiting our ability to say they prove rest pause is superior also I came across this unpublished paper suggesting myor reps a form of rest Porche training produced comparable muscle gains to normal sets hopefully this paper gets published so we can critically dissect it but all this data at least indicates rest po training can stimulate time efficient gains thus if this appeals to you you may explore this method on any exercises you think it could work well with the 37 method seems to originate from a 2005 French Fitness book it has you select to load you can perform around 12 maximum reps with it you perform three reps rest for 15 seconds perform four reps rest perform five reps rest perform six reps rest and then perform a final seven reps the final reps are where things get tough the only published paper on this method found that with a machine biceps exercise two bouts of the 37 method produced Superior bicep gains to eight sets of six reps with the same load now this is is an odd comparison as the normal group would have been far from failure on many sets and a more typical normal set structure would have been a better comparison so this paper is most certainly not proof the 37 method is superior even so some may enjoy this novel form of training and if it appeals to you you may explore it with any exercises you think it could work well [Music] with so there we have it we we have thoroughly dissected from top to bottom how time efficient hypertrophy can be attained here are the summary points perform two to four weekly sets for your muscle groups divided across however many days you prefer using anywhere from 6 to 12 reps per set and aiming to get two or at least as close to failure as possible using some exercise variety and selecting movements that attain a great stretch of the muscle can help get the most muscular development out of our fewer sets here's an example two-day a week program now some people can see minimal gains from lower set numbers so if this happens bump up the set numbers to save even more time we can use these range of Advanced Techniques if you're a viewer who skipped to the summary head to these time points to fully understand the execution and science of these methods remember

    "transcript": "welcome to the house of hypertrophy what are the most effective and efficient exercises to maximize quadriceps hypertrophy the findings of a brand new study have some potentially important details it has compared two different leg extension variations some of you may be thinking why leg extensions aren't squats and leg press variations the best way to grow the quads as we'll see later these exercises absolutely can grow the quads well but they aren't enough because they fail to meaningfully grow a certain head of the Quad leg extensions on the other hand have been documented to grow all four heads of the quads well especially the region that squats and leg presses minimally grow we'll also mention some underappreciated alternative two leg extensions if you can't train [Music] them 22 untrained men were recruited with one leg subjects trained the typical leg extension the hips were flexed at 90\u00b0 and they moved the knee joint from one 110 to 0\u00b0 with the other leg they train the leg extension with a Hip Flex to 40\u00b0 with a knee joint also moving from 110 to 0\u00b0 so the only difference was this variation has us leaning back the subjects trained both exercises with these variables whenever subjects reach 20 reps on the first set load was increased to keep them in the 15 to 20 rep range the fact each subject trained with both exercises was great since this means the same subjects were in both conditions therefore differences in genetics nutrition and outside lifestyle factors likely won't confound the study the quadriceps consist of four heads and the researchers measured both rectus femoris and vastus lateralis growth each at an upper and lower region the result rectus fous growth at both regions was 1.4 to 2.7 times greater with a 40\u00b0 Hip Flex leg extension how on Earth is this possible the rectus femoris is what we call two-joint muscle it crosses both the hip and knee joints so besides contributing to knee extension it also contributes to hip flexion consequently with a leg extension leaning back allows us to lengthen the rectus femoris more that is it's in a relatively more stretched position this is important as mentioned previously at the house of hypertrophy training muscles at longer length seems to build more muscle and this new study adds to this body of literature with a rectus growing better with a leg extension variation that positions it at a longer length the other three quad heads are one joint since they just cross the knee so all contribute to just knee extension so provided we're moving the knee joint through the same range of motion which was done in this study we'd expect these muscles to grow similarly between both variations as they're moving through the same muscle lengths indeed vastest lateralis growth at both regions was fairly similar between the two leg extension variations there are at least three questions you might have the subjects were previously untrained what about trained people what about laying down to 0 de of hip flexion and what about alternatives to leaning back leg extensions a paper from Japan published last year potentially answers the first two questions nine bodybuilders were recruited they performed the leg extension with 0 40 and 80\u00b0 of hip flexion during each muscle activation was indirectly measured with MRI both the zero and 40\u00b0 hip flexion leg extensions produced higher upper and middle rectosis activity than the 80\u00b0 variation lower rectos morus activity did not statistically differ between them but we still see the values tended to be higher with a z and 40 degree variations therefore this study suggests trained individuals might also benefit from leaning back leg extensions but there doesn't seem to be a greater benefit for 0\u00b0 compared to 40\u00b0 of hip flexion if anything the raw numbers favor the 40\u00b0 variation however I will note that although this muscle activation measurement has been associated with actual muscle growth in previous analyses the context of these papers are important none of these papers verified that this muscle activation measurement successfully predicted muscle growth when comparing exercises at different muscle lengths and I think it's possible this measurement fails to fully account for Passive forces that occur when a muscle is at longer lengths I say this to say it's possible these results underestimate the muscle growth potential of 0 degree hip flexion leg extensions thus hopefully we get research comparing the 0 to 40\u00b0 variations for now we can at least say it's likely both zero and 40\u00b0 hip flexion leg extensions are better than a traditional variation for overall rectus sorous development but what if you can't perform leaning back leg extensions the reverse Nordic curl and squat are both potentially great Alternatives both are performed with virtually no hip flexion just like the0 degree hip flexion leg extension but unlike the Z degree hip flexion leg extension both of the exercises allow us to bend our knees to an even greater degree of flexion so in addition to lengthening the rectus furus even more all other three quad heads are going to be trained at even longer muscle lengths than what we achieve with leg extensions does this mean these two exercises can grow these three quad head even more than any leg extension variation maybe but it is also possible that there's a threshold to the amount of muscle lengthening that's beneficial for growth such that these two exercises don't build the three quad heads more than any leg extension variation there are also some other subtle differences between these exercises hopefully future research Compares them to tease out any potential differences in growth for now at least I believe we can hypothesize both of these are going to be excellent alternatives for growing the quads particularly the rectus femoris depending on your current level these two exercises may be too hard or easy to perform but I've mentioned some training and progression tips in the pinned comment if you're interested this discussion so far has been centered around maximizing muscle hypertrophy but I will say if you just rather train with normal leg extensions that is perfectly fine at the end of the day although it may not be the biggest bang for your buck it still will build mus [Music] musle the exercises mentioned so far largely involved to isolated knee extension but the quads are commonly trained with combined knee and hip extension exercises we have multiple studies suggesting all of these exercises likely minimally grow the rectus phorus but develop the other vastest muscles well the lack of rectos moros growth from these exercises can likely be explained by the simple fact that rectos morus is a joint muscle during the bottom position of any combined knee and hip extension exercise we need to produce both knee extension and hip extension but since the rectus sorus is involved in hip flexion the opposite of hip extension a strong contraction would fight against us trying to get up the other vastus muscles are just involved in the extension so are free to highly contribute to the extension in these exercises so it makes sense these grow well from these exercises some of you may be Be Wondering the leg extension also still grows the vastest muscles how does this growth compare to that achieved from combined knee and hip extension exercises most of the electromyographic analyses I found comparing leg extensions to squats lunges or leg presses showed that the latter exercises elicited higher activity of the various vastus muscles now as mentioned at the house of hypertree previously electromyographic Studies have limitations but as described by researcher Brad shanfeld there seems to be an upcoming study finding When comparing leg extensions to leg presses leg presses grew the vastest lateralis better and that the leg extension Target direct as for moris which is the mid mid quad muscle MUSC that goes down the center of the quad and the vast lateralis one of those three vast muscles ler on the lateral aspect of the Quad was targeted to a greater extent with the leg press some degree of upper to lower Regional differences could exist this study compared Smith machine squat to leg extension training in trained subjects unsurprisingly the leg extensions grew the rectus foror as more especially at the lower region as a note based on the data we've seen we can hypothesize if leaning back leg extensions were performed much better upper and middle rectus morus growth would have been seen vastest lateral growth at the upper and middle portions tended to be better with the Smith machine squats while growth at the lower portion fascinatingly favored the leg extensions I should note there were a couple of limitations with this study so I would like to see another study like this but in total the available evidence leans towards the idea that growth of the vestus muscles at least in certain regions can be better with combined knee and hip extension exercises so to maximize overall quad growth having both an isolated knee extension and combined knee and hip extension exercise is probably a great idea we'll have future videos at the house of H pery exploring and comparing different squat leg press and lunge variations so stay tuned for that considering the conflicting information across the web things can get pretty confusing about how you may want to train I hope the

    "transcript": "[Music] to maximize muscle hypertrophy what is the exact amount of protein you need across the web there's split views some say it's a lot While others provide a specific amount also how important is protein intake relative to your training in this video we're going to answer these questions by dissecting the most up-to-date scientific literature on protein and muscle hypertrophy welcome to the house of hypertrophy in the scientific world metaanalyses are generally considered some of the best evidence as they combine the results of numerous individual studies on the same topic in the last 6 years there have been three metaanalyses examining how daily protein intake relates to muscle growth here are the relationships established in each firstly it is unsurprising that all show a relationship between protein and gains secondly they all allude to more and more protein not necess necessarily being required the 2018 one found a plateau at 1.6 G per kilog of total body weight a day the 2021 found a plateau with this model at around 1.5 G per kg of total body weight a day the 2022 one owing to their different approach to modeling the data may lead you to believe that more and more protein does lead to more growth but the confidence intervals get wider with higher protein intakes which suggests there's more uncertain certainty about these higher intakes a few studies that have used methods such as nitrogen balance or the indicat amino acid oxidation technique demonstrate this too with the predicted benefits of daily protein intake on muscle growth stopping at around 1.5 to 2 G per kilog of total body weight a day so how much protein should you consume well before providing an answer I think it is worth revealing something that is quite underappreciated credit goes to Eric T formerly of the stronger by science podcast who made a few of the following observations it is worthwhile to visually see the data points that go behind these lines and the 2018 paper is excellent for this we know this analysis found a plateau at 1.6 GS but if we more clearly see the data points that contributed to this line but remove the actual line what do you see I see there appears to be an association between protein intake and growth but it's truly difficult to say you're absolutely better off with a certain intake of course there's a reason statistics are used to derive the line of best fit but the point is it's quite clear 1.6 G isn't an ultra precise cut off point as some may believe on top of this if we only look at protein intakes at or above 1.25 G per kilogram of total body weight per day things are even more open to debate in fact the r s value is 0.0 111 which means that in this range protein intake only explains 1% of the variance in the gains in fat-free Mass the same applies to the 2022 analysis we can visually see that above a certain protein intake it's hard to say for certain you're better off with higher intakes so back to our question how much protein should you consume I believe providing definitive and absolute statements isn't warranted based on the current scientific lature rather I believe presenting a spectrum is more sensible 1.2 to 1.59 G per kg of total body weight a day is possibly enough for maximizing gains based on some of the data we've seen 1.6 to 2 G per kg of total body weight a day is almost certainly enough for maximizing gains and more than 2 G per kog of total body weight a day is very likely more than enough and although it's compatible with maximizing gains it's likely Sim L not essential for many at the end of the day it depends on how you think you could aim for the higher end if you absolutely want to leave nothing on the table as some scientific researchers have suggested but others may be perfectly fine with consuming at least 1.6 G but if for a variety of reasons you can't hit this amount rest assured this is not the end of the world and you may indeed be leaving very little to nothing on the table with somewhat lower intakes other factors like protein quality and your age could factor in in some cases diets that contain a higher proportion of lower protein quality and or if you're older protein intakes ner to the higher end may be a good idea however there is still Nuance here that will likely describe in future videos at the house of hypertrophy besides these there are three other factors that many say impact protein intake but do they actually some hypothesize the harder you train and the more experienced you are the more protein you need what does the research say this classic paper had novice bodybuilders train intensely for 1.5 hours 6 days a week for 4 weeks strength and muscle gains were similar between consuming 1.35 and 2.62 G per kog of total body weight per day their nitrogen balance data suggested 1.6 to 1.7 G per kilogram of total body weight a day may be ideal this paper recruited eight bodybuilders considered to be near their maximum muscular potential using the indicator amino acid oxidation technique protein intake requirements were estimated to be 1.7 G per kilogram of total body weight per day this third classic paper also recruited Elite bodybuilders and estimated protein intakes were only 1.2 G per kilogram of total body weight a day finally as for Recovery of the muscle tissue this intriguing paper had subjects perform this training session and measurements of Muscle Recovery were similar between consuming 1.8 to 2.9 G per kilogram of total body weight a day thus the available data does not consistently suggest harder training or more experience increases protein intake requirements again it depends on your thought process some may prefer higher intakes to have a comfortable safety margin in much of the data comprising the associations between protein intake and muscle growth the subjects were consuming the same or more calories than needed to maintain body weights but what about if you're trying to reduce your weight by consuming fewer calories than normal in this scenario some say to protect your muscle mass more protein is needed there are three areas of the scientific literature that might support this this first paper found in trained men that reduced their calories by 40% while still training for 2 weeks maintenance of lean body mass was better when consuming 2.3 versus 1 G per kg of total body weight a day the second paper found in untrained men that reduced their calories by 40% while training for 4 weeks fat loss and lean mass increases were greater when consuming 2.4 versus 1.2 G per kilog of total body weight a day the third area is a review in 2014 that based on the data they collected suggested that higher protein intakes May May better protect against muscle mass loss in trained people having detailed this data there are some key considerations two of the papers involved a 40% reduction in calories and the lowest protein intakes were 1 to 1.2 G but what if the reduction in calories was less severe and or if the lowest protein intakes were instead around the 1.6 G area plus we have some evidence also with some limitations that indeed find higher protein intakes on always better during calorie restriction overall better quality research is needed for now although this is definitely hypothetical the lower your body fat percentage and or the more aggressive reduction in calories the higher the protein intake You may wish to consume to stay on the safe side what if you're trying to gain weight through consuming more calories than normal we already mentioned how in much of the data subjects consume the same or more calories than needed to maintain weight yet in the literature some data has led various people to suggest higher protein intakes on a bulk can minimize the fat gain we see however there are some key limitations to This research that I'll uncover in a future video on bulking at the house of hypertrophy for now just know I don't think higher than recommended protein intakes are needed on a bulk I think it's worthwhile to frame protein intake in the bigger picture as established and described in the 2018 meta analysis resistance training is the much more potent stimulus accounting at least according to this meta analysis for a substantially greater portion of the variance in muscle and strength furthermore this 2021 analysis found that during 3 days of immobilizing one of their legs higher protein intakes fail to do a better job at maintaining strength and muscle than lower protein intakes this is not to say protein intake is unimportant of course we've seen sufficient protein intake allows us to realize the best gains we can see from our training but at the end of the day you can't force your way to muscle growth by just eating tons of protein well-designed and hard training provides the foundational stimulus speaking about well-designed training amidst all the noise online it can definitely be frustrating and timec consuming to craft an effective program that gets you closer to your desired physique but our highquality partner the alpha progression app which is fundamentally your personal muscle building assistant in the palm of your hand can help you other apps truly craft garbage programs but this app intelligently formulates a program effective for complete muscular development with the training variables fine-tuned and inspired by the scientific literature best of all it is 100% tailored to what you want let it know the equipment you have how how much you can train and if you want to preferentially Target or neglect certain muscles this can all take you less than a minute during workouts the apps algorithm carefully

if you like it and choose to go beyond the link cuts the price of a subscription by 20% I truly believe the app is exceptional with a thousand of reviews speaking to this before summarizing things there are two final things worth dissecting firstly we know the literature we mentioned considered protein intake in relation to your total body weights but if you have significant more body fat this tends to overestimate your protein needs considering protein intake in relation to your fat-free mess can be more accurate here although most don't know their precise fat-free Mass so you may just estimate what you'd approximately weigh at lower body fat levels and then use these numbers secondly some have health concerns about higher protein intakes but as described in this position stand this stems from data on renal failure patients and educational Dogma that hasn't been Rewritten despite contrary evidence in otherwise healthy individuals there is no indication of harm even in investigations involving well above 2.2 G per kilogram of total body weight a day in summary optimizing your protein intake can help you realize your maximum growth potential but just don't forget that well constructed and executed training is the foundational stimulus I don't believe providing a definitive value for protein intake is currently sensible rather we presented this spectrum on the likelihood of maximizing gains across different protein intakes ultimately it's your choice some may aim for the higher end to have no doubts While others may be perfectly comfortable on the Lower Side knowing that at the very worst they're getting the line share of their gains thank you for watching feel free to check out the alpha progression app or our recent deep dive into building the LS"

    "transcript": "[Music] how long does it take for muscle growth to plateau according to this 2017 review study out of the usa it plateaus quicker than you think based on an array of experiments examining the time course of muscle growth the authors make some bold statements regarding the lower body muscles they say these studies support the hypothesis that a large percentage of an individual's muscle growth potential will likely be achieved within the first three months of training they go on to say it seems unlikely that individuals will increase their muscle mass by appreciable amounts beyond what is gained by the time of plateau regarding the upper body they say initial statistical change in muscle size from baseline often occurred prior to weeks four to six of training with a plateau three to four weeks after this initial response they go on to say it can be expected that muscle growth is unlikely to meaningfully increase further in a trained population many would agree these statements seem extraordinarily surprising and perhaps controversial in this video we're going to examine the research behind these statements with the aim of answering the question does master growth plateau far quicker than we think let's get into it [Music] let's detail some of the research that led the authors of that review study to make the statements they did first we have this 1999 study out of japan which had 37 untrained individuals perform these exercises with these training variables both the men and women of the study saw a significant drop-off in quadriceps development by the eighth week of training furthermore the men in the study saw notable drop-offs in biceps and triceps growth by week eight while the women in the study also tended to see a triceps growth plateau by the eighth week a 2011 study out of the usa had untrained mentoring the leg press and leg extension with these training variables an established thigh growth tended to level off after six weeks of training a 2013 study out of brazil had subjects trained eccentric leg extensions with these variables and found directors for morse growth tended to level off at the eight week mark a 2015 study out of england had subjects trained leg extensions with these training variables and found the vastus lateralis grew well from week zero to week three it did not really grow much further from week three to week 6. now progressive overload was applied in these studies so a lack of progressive overload cannot explain the plateaus [Music] the studies just overviewed are highly interesting and collectively support the author's conclusions that muscle hypertrophy shows signs of plateauing and notably dropping off within three months yet are there studies opposing this there are two a study out of japan all the way back from 1970 had untrained men trained maximal isometric biceps contractions with these training variables and found muscle growth did not show signs of plateauing across 100 days another 1996 study out of switzerland had untrained men trained leg extensions with these training variables quadriceps growth continued to increase consistently across six months of training thus we do have some data indicating muscle growth shows no signs of plateauing within three months despite this opposing data the other study suggesting muscle growth levels of notably within three months still exist because the results are so surprising i know it can be easy just to ignore the data and pretend it does not exist however this is not good scientific practice so i don't believe we should discard or ignore them rather i think we should assess them a little further and try to evaluate their limitations and as we'll see in a second there are notable limitations with the data and from them we can derive some useful conclusions that can help you yourself limit plateaus [Music] a major limitation with the studies observing signs of plateauing within three months is none of them mentioned factors away from training and this includes nutrition given the subjects were previously untrained and given no nutritional instructions it's reasonable to assume many were not eating optimally for muscle hypertrophy this matters as both caloric and protein intake have been shown to modulate the amount of muscle growth you experience a 2002 study out of the usa had previously untrained men weight trained for eight weeks and found subjects consuming a 2000 calorie surplus gained around three kilograms in body mass and virtually all of this was fat free mass another group eating at approximately calorie maintenance saw much lower changes in body and fat free mass a 2019 study out of brazil found in competitive bodybuilders higher calorie consumption around 6500 calories produced greater muscle mass gains versus a lower calorie consumption around 4 500 calories this review study summarizes calorie surplus recommendations for untrained and trained folks protein intake is also notable this 2018 meta-analysis out of canada observed on the basis of 49 studies that intakes up to 1.6 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight enhanced fat-free mass gains with all this in mind we may arrive at a different interpretation of the studies finding signs of plateaus within three months namely the data may demonstrate untrained individuals can see significant muscle growth while not optimizing variables outside the gym for three months or so but to experience appreciable adaptations further optimizing variables outside the gym nutrition being a critical one here likely becomes progressively more important another limitation of the studies demonstrating muscle growth plateaus within three months is that there was minimal variation in the training variables used except for the fact progressive overload was applied all other variables including exercise selection volume and rep ranges were maintained exercise selection is potentially a notable one all the studies had subjects trained their muscle groups with largely only one exercise it's possible training a muscle group with a few different exercises in a program is beneficial for sustaining long-term gains but more research is needed to verify this at the very least though performing a few different exercises per muscle group in a program does tend to grow more regions across that muscle demonstrating this is a 2021 study out of brazil a non-varied group performed the same exercises for their muscle groups across three sessions per week a varied group on each of the three days per week performed different exercises per muscle group before and after eight weeks of training growth of the upper middle and lower regions of the rectus femoris vastus lateralis elbow flexors and triceps was measured overall though gains in some regions were similar between groups the varied groups or more gains in other regions thus exercise variety can cause growth in more regions of a muscle with regards to rep ranges training with a single rep range potentially could be sub-optimal for hypertrophy now most studies lasting 12 weeks or less find muscle growth to be similar between training with a single rep range or using a mix of different rep ranges but one study with a 9-month duration recruited previously untrained women with one group using the same rep range across three sessions per week and another group varying their rep ranges across three sessions per week ultimately increases in fat free mass were greater for the group varying their rep ranges now i should mention this is a single study and more research is needed to verify whether varying rep ranges truly promotes greater muscle growth in the long term volume in the form of sets performed is also a notable factor there's emerging research suggesting in trained individuals modestly increasing the number of sets performed enhances muscle growth for example a study from usa had trained men who back squatted an average 165 kilograms trained their quadriceps with a variety of weakly set numbers fundamentally their results established that those who grew their anterior thigh the most were the individuals who performed an average six more weekly sets for the quadriceps compared to what they were doing before the study lower responders less individuals who grew their anterior thigh less only performed one to four more weekly sets for the quadriceps compared to what they were doing before the study [Music] another 2022 study out of brazil recruited trained men and had them trained the unilateral leg extension and unilateral leg press twice per week for eight weeks with one leg each subject individually performed 20 percent more weekly sets for their quadriceps than what they were doing before the study with their other leg all subjects performed a prescribed number of weekly sets for the quadriceps this was 22 weekly sets it was found vastus authorized growth was greater for the leg performing 20 more weekly sets so a progressive increase in weekly sets 20 seems to be beneficial for muscle growth an interesting point is for eight out of the 16 subjects the prescribed number of 22 weekly sets was actually more than 20 percent of the weekly sets they'd been performing for their quadriceps before the study it ranged from being 30 to 120 more weekly sets than usual for these subjects yet results still favored the leg that performed 20 percent more weekly sets this finding emphasizes that larger jumps in the weekly sets 30 to 120 percent are not necessarily better than more modest 20 increases in weekly sets for muscle hypertrophy therefore these two studies suggest modestly increasing the number of sets you perform may be an extremely effective way to get past plateaus all of the studies finding signs of plateaus understandably had subjects trained week after week yet as we've explored in a previous video there's some research suggesting training breaks may be effective for restoring responsivity to training and perhaps enhancing long-term muscle and strength gains for example this study from japan had mentoring the barbell benchmarks with these training variables one group trained for 24 weeks straight a continuous group while another group trained for six weeks rested for three weeks and repeated this for a total 24 weeks a periodic group ultimately growth of the triceps and pectoralis major as well as bench press one rep max strength gains ended up being similar between both groups this was possible because the continuous group rate of gains gradually slowed down in other words they were nearing a plateau whereas the periodic group despite losing muscle and strength during the three-week breaks gains muscle and strength at faster rates during their training weeks the training breaks taken by the periodic group may have re-sensitized their body thereby explaining their faster rate of muscle and strength gains during the training weeks for more details on training breaks check out the full research breakdown we did on it but i should mention more research is needed to truly establish the effectiveness of training breaks but the current research is promising and an individual may wish to experiment with it depending on the interpretations of the data as well as their feelings on it in summary we do have research showing muscle growth may show signs of plateauing within three months of training yet i don't believe this data proves muscle growth truly plateaus in this time period rather i believe the data demonstrates an untrained person can see great gains while not worrying about dialing in other factors for three months or so but to experience further appreciable gains dialing in other factors such as calorie and protein intake becomes progressively more important with training experience as we know the subjects in the mentioned studies likely did not optimize nutritional factors moreover training factors also matter exercise and rep range variation are potential strategies for better long-term gains though more research is needed to validate this emerging evidence also suggests that modestly increasing the number of sets you perform may be helpful for getting past plateaus and enhancing muscle growth finally training breaks could be beneficial for re-sensitizing your body to training stimuli due to everything we've overviewed in this video needless to say i don't agree with the conclusions of the review study we mentioned at the start of the video with a well-designed training program and lifestyle i think it's very likely individuals can see appreciable muscle development across numerous years moreover we see this in the real world individuals can see notable improvements despite having numerous years of prior experience [Music]"

    "transcript": "welcome to the house of hypertrophy what key facts do you need to know about the exercises required to optimize muscle hypertrophy yet another great study has been released that helps us out it has put the leg press up against the leg extension and the straight leg car phas against the bent leg car phase will also reveal how the findings of this study potentially relate to other muscles like the triceps and biceps let's Dive In 28 trained individuals were recruited one leg was assigned to train the leg press while the other trained the leg extension one leg also trained straight leg C phases and the other bent leg car phases this study design is powerful as all 28 subjects trained all four exercises as the same subjects were in all conditions differences in genetics nutrition and outside lifestyle factors were controlled after all your left leg hopefully doesn't sleep more or eat more protein than your right leg in each session these were the variables used weights were adjusted within and across sessions to keep subjects reaching failure in the 8 to 12 rep range the researchers measured the growth of two of the quadriceps heads the rectus femoris and vastus lateralis summed across three regions it was found the rectus foror grew better with the leg extension while the vastest lateralis grew better with the leg press as for the calves growth of the lateral gastrus medial gastrus and Solus was measured each at one region medial gastrus growth was clearly greater for the straight leg Rays lateral gastrus growth also favored the straight leg although not quite as clearly contrastingly Solus growth favored the bent leg but the benefit was not super compelling and some may just regard this as similar hypertrophy there are two key principles that help us to understand the findings of this study and these principles likely apply to other muscles such as the hamstrings triceps and potentially even biceps the first principle is that biarticular muscles experience suboptimal hypertrophy when one of their functions opposes what happens in a compound exercise the second principle actually tells us how we might be able to maximize the growth of B articular muscles it suggests positioning one of the two joints it crosses to place it at a longer length seems to produce more hypertrophy your head may be spinning in complete confusion but it's simpler than it sounds let's break it down principle one likely explains why the rectus moror suboptimally Grew From the leg press and required the leg extension forget about the details of principle one for now and understand that all four quadricep heads cross over the knee in a way that means they all contribute to knee extension however the rectus morus also crosses over the hip in a way that means it contributes the hip flexion since the rectus sorus crosses Two Joints we say it's B articular the other three quadriceps heads can be described as mono articular since they only cross the knee joints now during any compound exercise that trains the quads well such as a leg press and squat we need to extend our knees and extend our hips to lift the weight but although the rectus for moris is involved in the extension we just saw it's also involved in hip flexion the opposite of hip extension so a strong contraction of it would partly pull us down making it logical that the nervous system would minimize rectus thorus involvement thus all of these compound exercises likely suboptimally grow the rectum amorus this is principle one a biarticular muscle such as the Reus sorus experiences suboptimal hypertrophy when one of its functions opposes what happens in a compound exercise such as the hip flexion from the rectus phorus opposing the hip extension from these compound exercises as a result isolated knee extension training is more effective for rectus fous growth principle one likely extends to the other main key biarticulate muscles in the human body I'll briefly detail how this applies to the triceps and biceps but feel free to check out the pinned comment for details on the hamstrings and gastr nemus the triceps consist of three heads all cross over the elbow joint in a way that means they extend the elbow but the long triceps Head is by articular because it also crosses the shoulder joint in a way that means it's involved in shoulder extension and shoulder adduction during any compound pushing exercise such as the bench press and overhead press we extend the elbow but these movements also involve shoulder flexion and or shoulder abduction which are the opposing shoulder motions the L head contributes to if you're struggling to see how shoulder flexion or abduction happens in these movements just focus on the upper arm anyhow a strong long head contraction would partly fight against us lifting the weight so it makes sense it's not highly involved indeed we have direct data demonstrating that pushing exercises such as the bench press suboptimally grows the long head of the triceps but does a better job at growing the lateral and medial heads isolated elbow extension excises have been documented to be very effective for growing the L head although certain compound exercises such as this pullover extension hybrid likely trains the lad effectively since this involves combined l elbow extension and shoulder extension which both are L head functions but right now we don't have direct data on how effective these are and I'm skeptical they are superior to isolation elbow extension as for the biceps this one is quite controversial and you'll see why the biceps consist of the long and short head both cross the elbow joint and everyone knows they are involved in elbow flexion but both also cross the shoulder joint in a way that means they can contract during shoulder flexion and shoulder Abduction the biceps can also perform what we call superation at the forearm and there's also evidence that biceps activity is higher when we're elbow flexing with a supinated grip anyhow during any compound pulling exercise such as rows pull-ups and chinups elbow flexion occurs but shoulder extension and or shoulder adduction also occur which are the opposite movements the biceps have at the shoulder once again if you can't see how shoulder extension or adduction happens in these movements focus on the upper arm indeed we have direct evidence dumbbell Rose even with a sulated grip produced much lower elbow Flex ey pery than dumbell Co the reason I said this is controversial is that many people suggest chinups are one of the best biceps exercises the popular mik men even suggested this and it just so happens to be true audience the close grip Palms up pull down is the best bicep exercise in the world how could this be possible well those who believe the biceps are trained effectively with compound pulling exercises would say what we've detailed is wrong for at least three reasons firstly they may say although the biceps do cross the shoulder joint there's research suggesting their involvement in shoulder the motion is minimal meaning your nervous system can effectively activate the biceps during these exercises secondly they might also reference this study that fascinatingly found pronated grip laap pull Downs produced similar elbow Flex of growth to barbell Coes finally some electromyographic research also finds High biceps activity during pull-ups and chinups and so many people feel their biceps are highly involved I actually believe these three arguments are pretty good but there are some solid counter points firstly although the biceps involvement in shoulder motion is indeed little it's still partially shortening in these movements which may mean it nonetheless fails to optimally contribute to pulling exercises secondly as for the study finding similar growth between pull downs and curs this was elbow flexor growth which in this case consists of of both the biceps and brachialis the brachialis is a muscle under the biceps it's just a monoarticular muscle involved in elbow flexion due to this muscle being in the measurement we can't be certain biceps growth was truly similar between both exercises moreover to be completely transparent the author of this particular study has been involved in multiple studies with statistical anomalies so some might question the study's validity finally the electrom myographic data is interesting but as detailed at the house of hypertrophy previously there are cases where electrom myographic data can probably be useful and other cases where it's not here it might not be useful for example we've seen the triceps lad minimally grows from compounds pushing exercises but some electromyographic research finds High triceps lad activity during the bench press so this is misleading in this circumstance as for people people reporting they feel their biceps highly with some pulling compound exercises someone might say you're actually feeling the brachialis not the biceps so who's right it would be interesting to hear what you think on this matter so feel free to drop a comment below to truly get an answer I would love to see a study directly comparing chin-ups to a normal biceps curl until then I'm on the fence as to whether principle one applies to the biceps I know I know it's for strating that I remain on the fence but if it's any consolation my hypothesis would be that all compound pulling exercises are not optimal for biceps hypertrophy if it's not for principle one I think it would be because the back musculature is typically the limiting factor in pulling exercises so your biceps may fail to reach maximal activation and tension so I think it comes as no surprised that to maximize biceps hypertrophy direct isolation biceps training is recommended Ed let us now move forward to principle 2 which tells us how we could maximize the growth of biarticular muscles principle 2 suggests positioning one of the two joints a b articular muscle crosses to place it at a longer length appears to produce greater muscle hypertrophy we'll understand what this exactly mean soon but this principle likely explains why the gastr nemus grew better with straight leg C raises versus bentle C raises actually we have another study published in December 2023 which had untrained individuals train bent leg Cal raises with one leg and standing straight leg Cal raises with their other leg using these variables both lateral and medial gastonia's volume increases were better with the straight leg C raises while Solus growth was fairly similar between both exercises so comparable to the new study it generally shows better gastrous growth with straight leg raises and uncompelling evidence the Solus grows much better with bent leg raises okay all three calf muscles the lateral gastrus medial gastrus and Solus cross over the ankle in a way that means they perform calf raising however the lateral and medial heads are B Artic as they also cross the knee joints this means they can shorten and contribute to knee flexion as the knees are flexed in a bent like C phase both gastr nmia heads are already shortened which likely compromises their Force generation this connects to the idea of active insufficiency which refers to when a biarticular muscle is shortened at both of the joints it crosses which limits Force strictly speaking some mono articular muscles could experience meaningfully impaired Force at Short lengths but this is a discussion for another day and we'll stick to this notion of active insufficiency see today with the bentle calf raise all the calf muscles are shortened at the top of the calf raise but since we started with the knees already bent the gastr nemas are excessively shortened extending our knees will lengthen the gastrus so straight leg C raises train the gastrus at longer lengths which avoids active insufficiency this is principle two positioning one of the two joints a biotic muscle cross es to place it at a longer length such as how positioning the knee in a straight position lengthens the gash nemus seems to result in more muscle hypertrophy if you've been following the house of hypertrophy for a while you'll know growing evidence suggests training muscles at longer lengths builds more muscle we've seen it with research suggesting that shortened range of motions fail to grow as much muscle at some regions to a range of motion that reaches longer lengths and we're also seeing it with selecting exercises that have biarticular muscles at longer lengths which is what we're focusing on here across the web opinions conflict about the mechanisms behind training muscles at longer lengths but in my view avoiding active insufficiency is one potential mechanism behind wi trting muscles at longer length can be beneficial in some cases but other mechanisms are almost certainly in play too regardless of the mechanisms we've seen principle 2 with the hamstrings in the same way that straightening the knee can lengthen the gasto nemus the hamstrings can be lengthened by hip flexion seated leg Coes involve the hips flexed while lying leg Coes do not indeed overall hamstrings hypertrophy was found to be superior with seated leg Coes in another paper so I would certainly recommend seated leg Coes overlying leg Coes we've seen it with a rectus sorus the new study analyzed in this video used normal leg extension but leaning back on the leg extension will lengthen the rectus sorus more and we saw in a recent video this produced greater rectos sorus hypertrophy than normal leg extensions feel free to check out that video for the full details of the study and possible alternatives to leaning back leg extensions we've seen it with the triceps the triceps L head can be lengthened with shoulder flexion overhead extensions involve the shoulders flexed while push Downs do not L head hypertrophy has been documented mented to be superior with overhead extensions in another paper interestingly combined medial and lateral head hypertrophy was also greater with the overhead extensions an unexpected finding now many people do like pushdowns so I wouldn't completely ditch it if you don't want to but I would at least recommend a triceps exercise with the shoulders at a more flexed position to cover your bases as for the biceps I know there are a few studies currently in the works on them I'm excited to see what they end up finding and we'll of course update you whenever they're [Music] released we've seen that principle one likely explains why the rectus florus grow suboptimally from the leg press and principle 2 likely explains why the gastr nemia's heads tended to grow better with the straight legar razes but why was vastest lateralis growth better with the leg press and why was Solus growth not drastically different between between straight and bent leg Rises with the Solus some might speculate as Gast nemus involvement is reduced with bent leg raises the solier should increase its involvement and thus grow more this certainly sounds logical but according to the results we've seen it just doesn't seem to happen at least not significantly therefore straight leg cough raises might be all you need although bent leg raises could be useful for isolating the Solus if you'd like to do that as for the vastest lateralis you might speculate since the rectus moris is suboptimally involved in all compound exercises the other quad heads like the vastest lateralis must increase their involvement and thus grow more but this is similar to the solest argument we just proposed which doesn't appear to significantly occur though of course things could differ between muscle groups although another possible explanation is most compound exercises like leg presses tend to involve more knee flexion than normal leg extensions this will effectively train and stimulate the vastest muscles at longer lengths which could explain the greater growth nevertheless to maximize overall quadriceps hypertrophy it seems a solid recommendation is to have both an isolated knee extension exercise for optimal rectus femoris growth and a quad focused compound exercise for optimal vastus growth I intend to have future videos with more research on the quad s so stay tuned for that if you're searching for

    "transcript": "welcome to the house of hypertrophy how many sets do you need to optimize hypertrophy there's somewhat been a Resurgence of hit training with its proponents believing lower sets could be superior however others standby the believe higher sets are the path to maximal gains in this video we'll be critically breaking down the overall scientific research on how many sets may be needed to build muscle effectively before diving in know that we'll be exploring how many sets per week you may want to be performing per muscle so if you perform three sets of squats on Monday three sets on the leg press on Wednesday and three sets on the leg extension on Friday that's nine weekly sets for the quads in all the studies each set is repetitions performed at least three reps away from failure which as detailed in the previous video is virtually ideal for hypertrophy warm-up sets are not included in these weekly set counts let's dive [Music] in this meta analysis published in 2017 combined the results of all the studies at that time finding performing nine or more weekly sets per muscle produced greater muscle gains than fewer than nine sets the researchers also split the numbers like this indicating that 10 or more weekly sets per muscle produced greater gains than 5 to9 and fewer than five weekly sets per muscle it may be worth emphasizing although higher sets built more muscle the lower num still produced respectable gains there are two considerations to this meta analysis the majority of studies involved untrained subjects and did not involve more than 12 weekly sets this raises the question what about trained individuals performing more than 12 weekly sets per muscle a 2022 meta analysis helps us out based on available data they were able to compare how intrainstitutional difference in gains between moderate and higher volumes but for the triceps higher volumes did produce Superior growth at face value these results indicate between 12 to 20 weekly sets may be sufficient to maximize biceps and cord growth in trained individuals while more than 20 weekly sets may be needed for the triceps however I believe there's an important limitation to this meta analysis the researchers combin studies using shorter and longer rest durations between sets which might not TR truly be appropriate why longer rest might make each set more effective for building muscle meaning fewer sets are needed to optimize gains illustrating this concept this paper found when performing three sets on the leg press quad hypertrophy was better when resting for 3 minutes between sets compared to one however performing five sets with one minute of rest produce similar quad hypertrophy to the three sets with 3 minutes of rest therefore sh rest appear to make each set less effective perhaps meaning a higher number of sets may be required to to optimize gains indeed when analyzing the studies using short rest intervals they all find more sets produced more growth up to quite high 30 to 45 weekly sets per muscle it's worth noting all three studies had subjects divide these sets across three days per week we need to mention both compound and isolation exercises contributed to these sets that is one set on the bench press was treated as one set for the triceps in the same way that one set on triceps push Downs would likewise one set on the row was treated as one set for the biceps in the same way that one set on CS would the show Ando study actually just had compound exercises for the biceps and triceps while for the other two studies in blue are the weekly set numbers from isolation exercises for the biceps and triceps moving forward to studies that have used longer rests between sets as longer rest may make each set more effective we may hypothesize that higher sets aren't necessarily needed indeed all three studies find growth was optimized in the 12 to 18 weekly set per muscle range with no clear benefit to more it's worth noting all three studies had subjects divide these sets mainly across two days per week again this data counts both compound and isolation movements here are the set numbers in blue if we just counted isolation sets for the triceps and [Music] biceps before discussing individual differences let's sum up some of what we've covered with additional key points if you're using short rest between sets very high set numbers May optimize gains but the sustainability and practicality of this long-term is questionable all three studies mention that all subjects perform their sets to momentary muscular failure and I know there are some people who are skeptical of this truthfully I don't know if all subjects did this and it could have varied across subjects what I do know is that in practice training with the necessary proximity to failure is much more challenging when using short rest with a high number of sets especially with lower body AC exercises the cardio challenge May mask and impair your ability to get close enough to True failure furthermore I would like to bring up this study it had trained individuals train the biceps and triceps with quite High volumes 28 weekly sets for each muscle from isolation exercises and 46 weekly sets if we included the compound exercises short rests were also used one group actually stretched between sets of the first and final exercises in a session while the second group rested normally here are some GR depicting how each individual grew their arm muscles in both groups there were some cases of people growing well but there were a number of cases of people experiencing very little gains including cases of some people decreasing their size potentially due to excessive muscle damage this study didn't have any other groups performing different set numbers but I bring it up to demonstrate not everyone experiences positive gains from very high sets and short rests moving on we know in studies using longer rest between sets there's no clear benefit to more than 18 weekly sets per muscle and even 12 weekly sets were sufficient for Quad gains in one study however we've just been speaking about the average results from the studies but luckily some of them provide individual data here's how each individual in each group in the show andf study group which was one of the papers finding more average growth from more sets with short rests between sets some trained individuals still saw respectable hypertrophy with the lowest set numbers in fact some subjects in the lowest number groups saw similar or more gains to others in the higher set groups here's how each individual in each group grew in the heel grave study which was one of the papers finding biceps hypertrophy was best with 18 weekly sets when longer rests were used again some trained individuals still saw respectable hypertrophy with the lowest set numbers with some subjects in the lowest set group growing similar or more versus the highest set groups now this data does not necessarily prove these subjects grow best from lowest set numbers because if if these subjects were in the highest set groups they could have grown even more fortunately though some clever studied designs can tell us if some people grow more from lower set numbers or vice versa three studies provide Insight this recent study by Van vossel was actually analyzed in our last video it had 21 untrained men perform 6 to eight weekly sets per muscle with one side of their body but 9 to 12 weekly sets per muscle with their other side of their body average Squad hamstrings biceps and triceps growth was Superior with the 9 to 12 weekly sets and actually the large bulk of individuals aligned with the average seeing more growth from the 9 to 12 weekly sets there were only a few cases of similar gains between both and even fewer cases of better gains with the 6 to8 weekly sets however another study by Damas had 19 untrained men performed 6 to9 weekly sets for the quads with one leg and 15 weekly sets for the quads with the other leg the results of this study were a little more mixed around 32% of subjects grew better with the 15 weekly sets another 32% better with the 6 to9 weekly sets while the remaining 36% experienced similar Hy pery between both finally a Norwegian study had 34 untrained individuals perform six weekly sets for the quads with one leg and another leg performed 18 weekly sets for the quads 13 individuals saw a clear benefit from their 18 weekly sets while three individuals saw a clear benefit from the six weekly sets the rest saw fairly similar hypertrophy between both collectively considering this data some degree of individual differences appears to exist certain individuals may not always see additional benefits the highest set numbers there are some caveats with this data firstly the van vossel and Damas papers also involved different training frequencies secondly all three studies involved untrained individuals but I'm unaware of any strong reason to believe this concept wouldn't extend to trained individuals it's currently not clear why some may grow more more from lower or higher sets and there's no established method you can use to know what you may respond best to at least yet I would just keep this information at the back of your mind if you're really struggling to make progress with your current program you could try lower or higher sets depending on your preference and perception speaking of progress tracking your own training progress over the long term can be very useful our high quality partner the alpha progression app can save you time by automatically generating graphs that track your progression with all areas of your program which could help you understand what may work best for you some of you

if you like it and decide to go beyond the link gives you 20% off a subscription the app is truly top tier with a review speaking to this in summary we saw this 2017 meta analysis finding that nine or more weekly sets per muscle led to Greater gains than fewer sets the majority of the day dat behind this was conducted on untrained individuals and did not exceed 12 weekly sets and I do think 9 to 12 weekly sets per muscle is a solid recommendation for beginners with trained individuals assuming longer rest between sets are used the current data indicates there's no clear benefit to performing more than 18 weekly sets per muscle and even 12 weekly sets were sufficient for Quad gains in one study all of these are averages which are solid General guidelines however there is some data pointing towards individual differ differences some people may grow more with higher or lower sets as a result if these average values don't work for you one tool in your toolbox is to try reducing or increasing sets depending on your preference and perception finally you may be wondering about gradually adding sets across weeks a recent study has examined this and it's caused quite a stir across social media mainly as it involved the highest set numbers reported in the literature to date in the next video at the house of hypertrophy we'll be deciphering this paper and its potential takeaways"

    "title": "Is the Bench Press Enough for Triceps Hypertrophy?",
    "published_at": "2020-07-01T11:41:58Z",
    "transcript": "the use of single joint exercises has actually been questioned in the literature with the 2016 review concluding that the use of single joint exercises provided no additional benefit to multi-joint exercises for hypertrophy however as pointed out by response to this review by Riviere and colleagues they existed only three studies and therefore there were many others single joint and multi-joint exercises not explored making the conclusions of the review premature this begs the question are multi-joint exercises enough for stimulating optimal hypertrophy more specifically in this video we'll be taking a look at the bench press and awesome whether the bench press alone is enough for growth of the triceps this is what a recent 2020 study by brand\u00e3o and colleagues explored 43 untrained men was split into one of four groups a multi joint group a single joint group a multi joint plus a single joint group or single joint plus multi joint group the multi joint group performed the bench press only the single joint group performed triceps skull crushers only the multi joint plus single joint group performed the bench press followed by tricep skull crushers the single joint plus multi joint group did the reverse of this they performed triceps skull crushers first followed by the bench press for the exercise or exercises the group's performed at 80 percent of 100 max load was taken to failure each set 3 minutes of rest was given between sets all four groups trained twice per week for 10 weeks from weeks one to four three sets per exercise were performed for all groups from weeks 5 to 8 4 sets per exercise were performed for all groups from weeks 9 to 10 5 sets per exercise were performed for all groups EMI was used to measure cross-sectional area changes of the pectoralis major and triceps brachii before and after additionally cross sectional area of each triceps brachii head was measured before and after what the researchers found was that for pectoralis major cross sectional area the multi joint group the multi joint plus single join group and the single join Plus multi-drug group experienced significantly greater increases compared to the single joint group and this makes sense the single drunk group were the only group not training the benchpress which of course primarily trains the pectoralis major interestingly despite the lack of between group significance performing the triceps skull Crusher's before the benchpress resulted in a lower relative growth of the pectoralis major compared to the two groups performing the benchpress first it could be speculated that performing the triceps skull Crusher's before the benchpress fatigues the triceps resulting in the triceps being more of a limiting factor and benchpress performance meaning the pectoralis major receives less of a stimulus for triceps cross sectional area increases were statistically similar between all groups however I believe this is probably a type two error as looking at the percentage increases the multi joint group did experience half the gains compared to the other three groups performing triceps skull Crusher's therefore it seems the bend rest alone is not enough for triceps hypertrophy this is further supported when looking at the growth of each triceps head interestingly the benchpress does seem to be good for growth of the lateral head as of the groups that were performed with the benchpress displayed significantly greater growth of this head compared to this single drug group that only performed triceps core crushers however for the long head there were significantly greater increases for the groups performing triceps skull Crusher's compared to the multi run group that only performed the Benjamites increases in cross sectional area for the medial head were statistically similar between all groups however again this is likely a type two error as the groups that train triceps skull Crusher's experienced roughly double the growth compared to the multi drug group training only the benchpress so as we can see the benchpress does seem to be good for growth of the lateral head however for the medial head and especially the long head the bench rest alone is not enough concerning the long head its anatomy can help us to understand why the bench press is ineffective the long head is the only head of the triceps that crosses the shoulder joint therefore aside from elbow extension it is also evolved as shoulder extension which is putting arms behind your body and adduction which is putting your arms by your side as a result during the eccentric phase of the benchpress as the shoulders are extending the long head is shortened therefore on the upcoming concentric phase it cannot contract much further and so its ability to produce force is limited with triceps skull Crusher's the shoulders are maintained in a flexed position meaning the long head can produce force effectively throughout the movement interestingly putting our shoulder into even more of a flexed position such as during overhead tricep extensions should stretch the long head even more potentially meaning eclipses are even greater force but regardless for optimal development of the triceps in the long run it's probably a good idea to include various elbow extension exercises at different shoulder elevations [Music] additionally as we have seen the benchpress and even other multi-turn exercises like overhead presses will undoubtedly contribute to hypertrophy of the triceps however the use of single joint tricep exercises are very shoulder elevations is still necessary to ensure we target the three heads optimally"

    "title": "The BENEFITS of Combining Rep Ranges",
    "published_at": "2022-09-26T11:00:02Z",
    "transcript": "[Music] it's not uncommon for individuals to train with only a single rep range in their whole program of course this isn't bad positive adaptations will unquestionably still take place but as we'll examine in this video training with different rep ranges May provide a variety of potential benefits When I say training with different rep ranges I'm mainly referring to training and exercise with different rep ranges on different days of the week but training a specific muscle group with different exercises performed with different rep ranges also applies for example you may train your quads with leg presses squats and leg extensions either in a session or a weekly schedule you may train the squats with sets of six repetitions the leg extensions with sets of 12 reps and the leg extensions were set of 25 reps let's dive straight in [Music] before detailing what training with different rep ranges can do it's worth understanding what it doesn't do as a misconception around this exists as mentioned in other videos per set reps between 6 and 35 are similarly effective for increasing overall muscle size provided those reps are performed two or close to failure some speculate despite the similar increases in muscle size low and higher reps May grow different muscle fiber types very broadly muscles contain slow and fast twitch fibers slow twitch fibers are highly fatigue resistant but produce low forces fast touch fibers Produce High forces but are very fatigable it speculated lower reps with heavier lows preferentially grow fast twitch fibers while higher reps with lighter lows preferentially grow slow twitch muscle fibers so combining a low and higher reps in a program ensures optimal development of all fiber types yet the evidence suggests this isn't quite correct a meta-analysis by gergic combined the results of five studies in the papers the higher reps involved around 20 to 40 reps performed two or close to failure with loads between 30 and 50 percent one rep max while the Low Reps involve 3 to 10 reps perform two or close to failure with 75 to 90 percent one rep max loads it was found both low and High Reps similarly grew the slow and fast twitch muscle fibers thus so long as reps are performed two or close to failure both low and higher reps are similarly effective at developing slow and fast switch fibers [Music] though different rep ranges produce similar hypertrophy including similar slow and fast twitch fiber hypertrophy as just established other Fitness attributes are optimized with either higher or lower reps so training with different rep ranges can be a highly efficacious way to concurrently develop different Fitness attributes this can be great for overall health and well-being a point notable for non-professional or non-competitive lifters lower reps better optimize the maximum load you can lift for a single rep turns your one rep max via increasing your skill with heavier loads and better promoting neural adaptations that enhance your ability to recruit and expose your muscle fibers to tension the literature consistently finds strength is notable for longevity one cohort study found regardless of muscle mass low muscle strength was independently associated with an elevated risk of death from all causes in individuals above the age of 50. lower reps with heavier loads May potentially be superior for bone strength though High Reps can certainly enhance bone density the literature seems to more consistently find heavier loads produces greater effects higher reps of course better promote endurance adaptations numerous studies indicate higher reps more effectively increase the number of reps you can complete with a given percentage of your one rep max these endurance gains may be explained by higher reps better producing mitochondria and blood vessel alterations mitochondria are components within muscle fibers that play a crucial role in generating energy for things including muscle contraction and more blood vessels increase the ability of the body to deliver oxygen and nutrients to the muscle as well as remove waste products a 2019 Canadian study found as we'd expect training too failure with a 30 one rep max load was similarly effective for slow and fast-itch fiber hypertrophy to an 80 one rep max load yet increases in the content of several mitochondrial related proteins were Superior when training with a 30 One Rate Max load having healthy mitochondria function and numbers plays a crucial role in overall health as for blood vessels one study actually found no statistical difference in capillarization between training with 20 to 25 reps or 8 to 12 reps yet the percentages did favor the 20 to 25 reps physiologically there's reason to believe higher reps would more consistently produce the formation of new blood vessels as the stimuli that achieves this is hypoxia and shear stress two things that are going to be enhanced with higher reps over the long term concurrent development of various Fitness attributes achieved through training with different rep ranges may not only benefit overall health but also potentially hypertrophy let's explore this [Music] most studies find no difference in hypertrophy between training with a single rep range or training with different rep ranges but a limitation is these studies largely last 12 weeks or less in the long term as just alluded to there could be a difference between the two for example a 2003 study from the USA found in previously untrained women training for nine months compared to training with the same rip range training with different rep ranges per week ultimately led to Greater increases in fat-free mass now this is far from strong evidence it's just one study conducted on previously untrained women and fat-free mass is far from the most precise muscle growth measurement nevertheless an array of potential paths Exist by which training with different rep ranges could benefit hypertrophy firstly we know lower reps optimize neural adaptations that enhance your ability to recruit and expose your muscle fibers to tension this is notable because mechanical tension is the primary hypertrophy stimulus that is muscle fibers can detect the tension they produce and transduce it into a signaling Cascade that produces hypertrophy thus having a better ability to recruit and expose your muscle fibers to tension via neural adaptations can enhance the overall mechanical tension you experience during your set of repetitions the fact is not all individuals have an equal capacity to recruit and expose their fibers to tension moreover it can depend on the muscle in question one study established around 15.5 percent of the muscle activation potential of the quadriceps was inaccessible to individuals whereas these values were five percent for the elbow flexors and coughs so in cases where muscles cannot be easily recruited from the onset neural adaptations from lower reps may change this and enhance one's ability to expose a muscle to Greater overall mechanical tension secondly the endurance benefits provided by higher reps such as the formation of new blood vessels like capillaries may have hypertrophic benefits interestingly some data indicates capillarization may have associations with hypertrophy a 2017 study from Canada found in older men those with higher capillarization of fast twitch muscle fibers from the vastus lateralis ultimately saw the greatest fast twitch fiber hypertrophy in response to lifting weights another 2019 study found similar things in older men subjects with greater capillarization of vastus laterized fiber so greater vastus Lateralus hypertrophy in younger individuals a fascinating 2022 study from Canada found those who saw the greatest fast witch fiber capillarization from aerobic training in the vastus lateralis tended to see greater vastus lateralis fast touch fiber growth in response to a subsequent 10-week resistance training period on top of this it's important individuals recognize lifting weights is fairly aerobically demanding despite what it may seem for example a 200 meter sprint something considered very anaerobic still involves a 29 contribution from the Aerobic System also recovery between sets performance on later sets in a session and Recovery between sessions are going to be relying on the Aerobic System to a large degree so the aerobic adaptations provided by higher reps can enhance all of these things finally higher reps are more painful than lower reps but developing the capacity to withstand pain and continue can be beneficial getting accustomed to the pain associated with a set of 20 to 30 reps two or close to failure is going to make a set of eight reps two or close to failure feel like a breeze I should note dedicated aerobic training is going to be superior for aerobic adaptations versus higher reps especially for Central adaptations related to the heart so this is one reason why I believe aerobic training can be of great utility to lifters plus it just makes you feel great more on this in the future in any case I still believe High Reps have their place even if you're performing aerobic training as remember mitochondria and blood vessel adaptations are specific to the muscle being trained So High Reps can help spur aerobic adaptations in muscles not involved in your dedicated aerobic training modality [Music] the research tends to find that training with different rep ranges does produce greater strength adaptations versus training with a single rep range however a notable limitation is the groups training with different rep ranges ultimately trained more frequently with lower Reps versus the groups training with a single rep range so this may explain the greatest strength gains rather than using different rep ranges per se so more research is needed to determine if training with different rep ranges truly enhances long-term strength gains in any event this data at least shows training with different rep ranges is unquestionably going to be effective for strength gains both low and High Reps similarly increase faster and slow twitch fiber size so training with different rep ranges on the assumption that different rep ranges preferentially Target slow or fast Edge fiber growth is incorrect however training with different rep ranges can be effective for concurrently developing different Fitness attributes something beneficial for overall Health and Longevity furthermore there are potential Avenues by which training with different rep ranges could potentially enhance long-term muscle growth as for strength more research is needed to determine if training with different rep ranges is superior if

    "title": "Free Weights vs Machines for Muscle Hypertrophy (New Study)",
    "published_at": "2020-07-29T11:44:24Z",
    "transcript": "in a general strength or hypertrophy training program there are many different ways we can categorize the exercises used one of these ways is to categorize exercises as either free weight which includes barbells and dumbbells or machine based some consider free weights to be superior mainly due to the increased stabilization requirements it's theorized the greater instability with free weights can result in greater muscle fiber recruitment on the other hand a stable environment with machines could allow an individual to focus more on the intended muscles additionally some machines are designed to match the strength of an exercise meaning they challenge the working muscle or muscles to a high degree throughout the range of motion so which is best for hypertrophy free weights or machines this is what a recent study by schwann beck and colleagues assessed 15 men and 21 women with an average of two years training experience were randomly assigned to either a free weight group or a machine group for both groups training consisted of cycling two days of training with one day of rest on day one both groups train the chest back and triceps on day two both groups train their legs shoulders and biceps this whole cycle was repeated for eight weeks the freeway group on day one for the chest back and triceps performed the flat barbell bench press incline barbell bench press bent over barbell rows chin ups tricep skull crushers and dumbbell kickbacks the machine group on day one for the chest back and triceps perform the smith machine bench press smith machine incline bench press machine seated row lap pull down machine triceps press down and a rope press down the freeway group on day two for the legs shoulders and biceps perform the barbell back squat straight leg deadlift lunge single leg calf raise dumbbell shoulder press dumbbell lateral raise easy bar curl and preacher curl [Music] the machine group on day two for the legs shoulders and biceps perform the smith machine squat leg extension seated hamstring curl machine calf raise machine shoulder press machine lateral raise machine biceps curl and machine's preacher curl for the first three weeks both groups performed each exercise with four sets of eight to ten reps to failure with one minute of rest between sets for the next three weeks both groups performed each exercise with four sets of six to eight reps to failure with one minute and 30 seconds of rest between sets for the last two weeks both groups performed each exercise with three sets or four to five reps to failure with two minutes of rest between sets throughout these three phases if subjects were able to load was increased on any of their exercises ultrasound was used to measure thickness of the quadriceps and biceps before and after the training period for both groups for strength one rep max on the barbell bench press and one rep max on the smith machine bench press was assessed before and after the training period for both groups additionally a six to ten rep max on the barbell back squat and a six to ten rep max on the smith machine score were measured for both groups before and after the trading period these six to ten rep maxes were used to predict one rep max values for both their exercises starting off with the strength results both groups actually experience similar increases in barbell bench press warner max [Music] four one rep max on the smith machine bench press the machine group experienced greater gains compared to the freeway group four predicted barbell back squat one right maxes both groups experienced statistically similar increases however it's very clear to see that percentage-wise the freeway group experienced greater gains four predicted smith machines caught one rare maxes both groups experienced similar increases according to the principle of specificity we would expect the free weight group to experience greater gains for the barbell exercises while we would expect the machine group to experience greater gains for the smith machine exercises this was true for the smith machine bench press and barbell back squat but intriguingly this did not seem to apply to the barbell bench press or smith machine score nevertheless this study did only last eight weeks in the long run it's very likely that if your aim is to maximize strength on the barbell bench press or smith machine score performing that particular exercise frequently will be necessary moving on to the hypertrophy results both groups experience similar increases in biceps thickness and quadriceps thickness in other words both free weights and machines appear to produce similar hypertrophy now of course it would have been more informative if the researchers could have assessed hypertrophy of a few other muscle groups as both groups did train the majority of their body but regardless when looking at the mechanisms of muscle growth reasoning does seem to suggest that both free weights and machines can produce similar hypertrophy mechanical tension is the best categorized driver of muscle growth currently mechanical tension consists of active tension and passive tension active tension is the force generated by the contractile units of the muscle if we were to look at the layers of a muscle within muscle fibers i found myofibrils sarcomeres which are the contractile units of muscle are located here forces generated when something called the myosin head extends from the myosin filament and pulls the actin filament towards the m line shortening the length of the sarcomere the force generated from this is partly transmitted longitudinally but mainly laterally to the extracellular matrix where these forces end up pulling on the tendon causing muscle contraction it's believed meccano sensors detect this force and initiate a signaling cascade that ultimately results in muscle hypertrophy now here's the thing regardless of what's used a barbell dumbbell machine or even body weight taking a movement close to failure with a load between 30 and 85 warner max will result in sufficiently high amounts of active tension overall for a sustained period so although it's possible freeways recruit more fibers early on in the set due to the instability implying greater overall active tension early on as reps approach failure this likely would not matter with regards to passive tension this is the force generated when elastic elements within muscles are stretched when components within the extracellular matrix and a molecule called titan found within the sarcomere are stretched passive force is generated similar to active tension mechanosensors are believed to detect this force and subsequently initiate a signaling cascade that ultimately results in muscle hypertrophy recent evidence suggests that titan may alter its function during eccentric contractions such that it produces force throughout this phase again barbells dumbbells machines and even bodyweight training typically include an eccentric phase additionally depending on the working sarcomere lengths of a particular muscle passive tension from titan but also the extracellular matrix occurs when contracting at long muscle lengths for instance the sarcomeres within the vastus muscles of the quadriceps appear to be stretched at long muscle lengths meaning passive tension can effectively occur here bear in mind this isn't the case for every single muscle the barbell back squat can work the quadriceps at long muscle lengths but so can the smith machine score or another machine like the hack squat to return to the overall point both freeways and machines have the ability to produce high amounts of mechanical tension likely explaining a big part of why they can produce similar hypertrophy you"

    "published_at": "2024-09-30T14:03:39Z",
    "transcript": "[Music] welcome to the house of hypertrophy what would you say is the most effective way to perform your exercises for maximum muscle growth many people train with a full range of motion where with any given exercise they move through the largest distance they can but is this actually optimal or essential it is possible to use a partial at Short muscle lengths where you move through the half where the muscle is at a shorter length or a partial at long lengths where you move through the half where the muscle is at a longer length are these any better well the scientific literature tends to find that partials at Short lengths aren't as effective as a full range of motion or partials at long lengths and when comparing a four range motion to partials at long lengths we fascinatingly have three studies suggesting partials at long lengths built more overall muscle however these studies were done on untrained individuals I'm thrilled to say we finally have the first study in trained individuals comparing a full range of motion to partials at long lengths let's dive straight in 25 trained individuals with an average of 4.9 years of experience were recruited here are some real life photos of some of the subjects they trained these exercises twice per week for 8 weeks one side of their body trained with a full range of motion on all exercises while the other side of their body trained with a partial at long lengths on all exercises I've mentioned this in previous videos but the design design of having one side of the body trained in one way and the other side of the body trained in another way is fantastic as it means the same subjects were in both conditions thus differences in genetics nutrition and outside lifestyle factors are much less likely to confound the results after all the left side of your body hopefully doesn't sleep more or eat more protein than the other side both sides train to momentary failure with the defined range of motion muscle thickness of both the elbow flexes and triceps was measured at 40 5 and 55% of the humoral bone length it was ultimately found growth at all regions was similar between both types of training thus partials at long lengths weren't any better than a full range motion but it wasn't any worse which I believe is still a very impressive finding it was once thought that using a full range of motion to achieve both the stretch and Peak contraction was essential but these findings demonstrate partials at long lengths might be an appropriate alternative it seems that the peak squeeze achieved by a full range emotion may not deliver additional gains having said this there are some crucial things we need to keep in mind but before detailing that I feel something is worth mentioning as the authors allude to these results are great as you have the flexibility to train according to your preference if you follow the house of hypertrophy for a while you'll know that there are many different training Styles and Roads to a great physique is pretty hard to do something that will seriously hurt your gains these results yet again remind us that we shouldn't forget about the basics training hard enough with enough volume and consistency are foundational as mentioned there are still some crucial things to keep in mind firstly science is an ongoing process as the spirit of scientific accuracy will tell you the results are specific to all the variables used such as the exercises and the techniques used one study isn't enough to definitively prove anything so this isn't the final word on long length partial secondly Remember That Elbow flexor and triceps thickness was measured at 45 and 55% regions but what about other muscles like the chest and lats we also know muscles do not necessarily grow identically across their regions and if you've seen our previous video you may be aware that partials at long lengths can be highly effective for growing the distal regions of a muscle that is the region of a muscle further away from its origin for example this paper in untrained individuals compared preacher Coes with a partial at Short to Long lengths growth at the 50% region was actually similar between both while growth at the 70% region was much better with the partials at long lengths similarly this paper on untrained individuals involves comparing leg extensions with a partial at long lengths to a full range of motion vastest lateralis growth tended to be similar at the 40 to 50% regions but fairly better for the partials at long lengths at the 70% region growth of the rectus sorus tended to be better for the partials at long lengths across all regions but the differences were large at the 70% region accordingly we can't be certain distal region growth of the elbow flexors and triceps was identical between both hopefully future studies Can Shed more light onto this thirdly the latest study used multiple exercises but we can't rule out the possibility that long length partials work better with some exercises and not others one possibility is that lengthened partials are most effective with exercises that are hardest at the shortest more contracted position for example both carf raisers and leg extensions tend to be hardest at the top shorten position two studies on these exercises although conducted on untrained individuals found that long length partials produced more overall growth than a full range of motion a few exercises in this latest study on trained individuals are hardest around the mid position which might mean long length partials aren't any better than a full range of motion hopefully future studies examine this idea [Music] more remember these results are specific to a range of motion with an exercise I don't believe we can extrapolate these results to comparing different exercises for example we've seen that changing joint positions to train certain muscles at longer lengths builds more muscle such as how in untrained individuals seated leg holes build more muscle than L leg holes overhead extensions built more muscle muscle than push Downs leaning back leg extensions buil more muscle than normal leg extensions and incline curls built more muscle than preos some might be tempted to take the results of this latest study and say that training at longer muscle lengths in all cases isn't going to build more muscle in experienced lifters however remember in this latest study both ranges of motions reach the same maximum muscle length the only difference was the long length partials didn't attain shorter lengths conversely with these exercise comparisons we're comparing reaching longer muscle lengths to Shorter lengths which is different and may still be better for building muscle in trained individuals indeed although this isn't direct muscle hypertrophy we've seen that in bodybuilders leaning back on the leg extension resulted in greater overall rexus Morse activity than normal leg extensions however there may be a threshold of the length needed to maximize hypertrophy that is even longer isn't always better I say this as lying down on the leg extension which stretches the rectus forus even more although still producing better activity than normal leg extensions wasn't any more effective than the leaning back leg extensions also there's a study coming soon that seems to have found when tension was highest at the start of the curl cable curls with the shoulder neutral were similarly effective to having the shoulder extended we'll be sure to update you at the house of hypertrophy with any new studies that may shape and refine our thoughts but here are our current recommendations don't forget the basics training hard with enough volume and consistency are

    "transcript": "We now have two meta-analyses indicating light\u00a0\nloads can produce similar muscle growth to heavier\u00a0\u00a0 loads, provided repetitions are performed to or\u00a0\nclose to failure. Meta-analyses combine the\u00a0\u00a0 results of numerous studies looking at the same\u00a0\ntopic. In the two meta-analyses, most studies had\u00a0\u00a0 subjects use loads between 30% and 85% of their one\u00a0\nrep max,roughly equating to repetitions between 35\u00a0\u00a0 and 5. But, what about repetitions below 5?\nLast video, we demonstrated the research suggests\u00a0\u00a0 one rep max training is not effective at building\u00a0\nmuscle. This video, we'll evaluate research exploring\u00a0\u00a0 repetitions between 2-4 for building\u00a0\nmuscle. On the bottom left and right we'll be\u00a0\u00a0 keeping a tally of the study supporting or\u00a0\nopposing the effectiveness of repetitions\u00a0\u00a0 below 5. Starting things off, Schoenfeld\u00a0\nand colleagues split 19 men with at least\u00a0\u00a0 one year of training experience into a heavy or\u00a0\nmoderate group. Both groups trained the bench press,\u00a0\u00a0 overhead press, lat pull down, cable row, back\u00a0\nsquat, leg press, and leg extension for 3 sets and 2minutes of rest between sets, 3\ntimes per week for 8 weeks. The heavy group\u00a0\u00a0 used a load that allowed them to perform\u00a0\n2 to 4 repetitions to failure each set.\u00a0\u00a0 The moderate group used a load allowing\u00a0\nthem to perform 8 to 12 repetitions\u00a0\u00a0 to failure each set. Both groups aimed to\u00a0\nprogressively overload throughout the study.\u00a0\u00a0 Increases in vastus lateralis thickness were\u00a0\nsignificantly greater for the moderate group.\u00a0\u00a0 Increases in elbow flexor thickness also favor the\u00a0\nmoderate group, while triceps thickness increases\u00a0\u00a0 were similar between both groups. So overall, this study indicates 2 to 4 reps is not as\u00a0\u00a0 effective as 8 to 12 reps. Weiss and colleagues\u00a0\nsplit 44 untrained men into a low rep, moderate\u00a0\u00a0 rep, or high rep group. All groups trained 4 sets\u00a0\nof the back squat with 6 minutes of rest between\u00a0\u00a0 sets, 3 times per week for seven weeks. The\u00a0\nlow rep group used a 3 to 5 rep max load\u00a0\u00a0 Each set, the moderate rep group used a 13 to 15\u00a0\nrep max load each set.. The high rep group used a\u00a0\u00a0 23 to 25 rep max load each set. All groups aimed\u00a0\nto progressively overload throughout the study.\u00a0\u00a0 Increases in quadriceps thickness were similar\u00a0\nbetween all three groups, suggesting reps below 5\u00a0\u00a0 are effective for maximizing muscle\u00a0\ngrowth. Managine and colleagues divided\u00a0\u00a0 33 men, with at least two years of training\u00a0\nexperience, into an intensity or volume group.\u00a0\u00a0 Both groups trained 4 times per week for\u00a0\n8 weeks. The program is listed on screen.\u00a0\u00a0 The intensity group performed each exercise for\u00a0\n4 sets of 3 to 5 reps with a 90 % one rep max load and 3 minutes of\u00a0\nrest between sets. The volume group performed each\u00a0\u00a0 exercise for 4 sets with 10 to 12 reps with\u00a0\na 70% one-rep max load and 1 minute of\u00a0\u00a0 rest between sets. Both groups aim to progressively\u00a0\noverload throughout the study.Increases in rectus\u00a0\u00a0 femoris, vastus lateralis, pectoralis major\u00a0, and triceps brachii cross-sectional area were\u00a0\u00a0 statistically similar between both groups. They\u00a0\nalso measured increases in lean leg and arm mass\u00a0\u00a0 via DEXA scans. Increases in lean leg mass were\u00a0\nsimilar between both groups. But, increases in\u00a0\u00a0 arm mass were significantly greater in the\u00a0\nintensity group. So, 3 to 5 reps were equally\u00a0\u00a0 as effective as 10 to 12 reps in most measures and\u00a0\nactually superior in a lean arm mass measurement.\u00a0\u00a0 One limitation of this study was the intensity\u00a0\ngroup used 3 minutes of rest between sets,\u00a0\u00a0 while the volume group used only 1 minute.\u00a0\nIn our rest interval video, we demonstrate the\u00a0\u00a0 research suggests with compound exercises, 2.5 or\u00a0\nmore minutes of rest between sets was superior for\u00a0\u00a0 building muscle compared to rest intervals of 1 \nminute or less. With this in mind, the volume group\u00a0\u00a0 would probably have been at a disadvantage. If they\u00a0\nused a 3-minute rest interval, they could have\u00a0\u00a0 experienced greater growth for all measures.\u00a0\nAnother study by Schoenfeld and colleagues\u00a0\u00a0 split 17 men with at least one year of training\u00a0\nexperience into a strength group or hypertrophy\u00a0\u00a0 group. Both groups trained the same exercises 3\ntimes per week for 8 weeks. The hypertrophy\u00a0\u00a0 group used a bodybuilding split schedule, while\u00a0\nthe strength group used a full body schedule.\u00a0\u00a0 The hypertrophy group trained each exercise with\u00a0\n3 sets of 10 reps to failure and 90 seconds of\u00a0\u00a0 rest between sets. The strength group trained\u00a0\neach exercise with 7 sets of 3 reps to failure\u00a0\u00a0 with 3 minutes of rest between sets. Both\u00a0\ngroups aimed to progressively overload.  Volume load, the product of sets X  reps X \nload, was equated between the two groups, explaining\u00a0\u00a0 why the strength group needed 7 sets per\u00a0\nexercise and the hypertrophy group only 3 sets. Increases in biceps thickness were similar\u00a0\nbetween both groups, supporting the effectiveness\u00a0\u00a0 of repetitions below 5 for building muscle.\u00a0\nHowever, similar to the previous study, the\u00a0\u00a0 strength group used a 3-minute rest interval, while\u00a0\nthe hypertrophy group used only a 90-second rest\u00a0\u00a0 interval.Also, the researchers justified equating\u00a0\nvolume load by suggesting volume load was strongly\u00a0\u00a0 correlated to muscle growth. Therefore, equating\u00a0\nit between groups would avoid this potential\u00a0\u00a0 confounding effect. However, strong evidence\u00a0\nindicates with all else equal, reps between 5 and\u00a0\u00a0 35 produce similar muscle growth. Within this range, with the same number of sets performed, volume load\u00a0\u00a0 would be dramatically different. Suggesting volume\u00a0\nload is not strongly correlated to hypertrophy.\u00a0\u00a0 If it was, higher repetition should cause more\u00a0\ngrowth. but this isn't the case. Furthermore, we have\u00a0\u00a0 research indicating more sets generally result in\u00a0\nmore hypertrophy (probably up to a certain point).\u00a0 Considering all this, the strength group was\u00a0\nprobably put at an advantage with the more sets.\u00a0\u00a0 Nevertheless, moving on, Campos and colleagues spit\u00a0\n27 untrained men into a low rep, intermediate rep,\u00a0\u00a0 or high rep group. All group trained the leg press\u00a0, squat, and leg extension for 8 weeks, 3 times per week for the first 4 weeks and 4\ntimes per week for the last 4 weeks. The low rep\u00a0\u00a0 group trained to each exercise for 4 sets with\u00a0\na 3 to 5 rep max load to failure and 3 minutes of rest between sets. The intermediate rep\u00a0\ngroup trained each exercise for 3 sets with\u00a0\u00a0 a 9 to 11 rep max load to failure and 2 minutes of\u00a0\nrest between sets. The high rep group trained each exercise for two sets with a 20 to 28 rep max\u00a0\nload to failure and 1 minute of rest between sets.\u00a0\u00a0 Volume load was equated between groups, explaining\u00a0\nwhy the groups used a different number of sets/\u00a0\u00a0 Increases in vastus lateralis type 1, type 2a,and\u00a0\ntype 2b fiber cross sectional area were similar\u00a0\u00a0 between the low rep and intermediate rep group, and\u00a0\nboth greater than the high rep group, supporting\u00a0\u00a0 the effectiveness of repetitions below 5 for\u00a0\nbuilding muscle. That said, equating volume load\u00a0\u00a0 and the use of different rest intervals between\u00a0\ngroups are again potential confounding factors.\u00a0\u00a0 Chestnut and Docherty split 19 untrained men\u00a0\ninto a 4RM group or a 10RM group. Both groups\u00a0\u00a0 trained the close grip bench press, triceps press\u00a0\ndown, barbell curl, and dumbbell curl. These were\u00a0\u00a0 the core exercises. They also trained the normal\u00a0\nbench press, bench pulls, and shoulder press. These\u00a0\u00a0 were the supplemental exercises. These exercises\u00a0\nwere trained 3 times per week for 10 weeks.\u00a0\u00a0 The 4RM group used 4 reps with an 85\u00a0\npercent one rep max load to failure and 3 minutes of rest between sets. Each session, 6\u00a0\nsets were used for each core exercise and 2 sets\u00a0\u00a0 for each supplemental exercise. The 10RM group\u00a0\nuse 10 reps with a 70 one rep max load to failure\u00a0\u00a0 and 2minutes of rest between sets. Each session, 3 sets were used for each core exercise and\u00a0\u00a0 1 set for each supplemental exercise. Increases\u00a0\nin cross-sectional area for the middle and lower\u00a0\u00a0 portion of the upper arm (which included\u00a0\nthe triceps biceps and brachialis muscles)\u00a0\u00a0 were similar between both groups, supporting the\u00a0\neffectiveness of reps below 5 for building muscle.\u00a0\u00a0 Again, equating volume load and the use of\u00a0\ndifferent rest intervals are potential confounding\u00a0\u00a0 factors in this study. To sum up, the majority\u00a0\nof the evidence supports the idea reps between\u00a0\u00a0 2 and 4 are effective for building muscle. Having said this, of the 5 studies finding this,\u00a0\u00a0 4 either had the low rep group perform\u00a0\nmore sets, in attempt to equate volume load,\u00a0\u00a0 and or the low rep groups used longer rest intervals.\nBased on the reasons provided in the video, these\u00a0\u00a0 are probably confounding factors. Interestingly,\u00a0\nthe only two studies that did not have these\u00a0\u00a0 confounding factors are in disagreement with\u00a0\neach other. Weiss and colleagues suggest 3 to\u00a0\u00a0 5 reps can maximize growth, whereas Schoenfeld\u00a0\nand colleagues indicates 2 to 4 reps do not.\u00a0\u00a0 Small differences, such as the use of 2 reps\u00a0\nin the Schoenfeld and colleague study and the\u00a0\u00a0 use of 3 reps in the Weiss and colleague study\u00a0\ncould be a reason for these different results.\u00a0\u00a0 Nevertheless, more research that avoids confounding\u00a0\nfactors is most definitely needed. What is clear\u00a0\u00a0 is that reps between 2 to 4 do have the\u00a0\ncapacity to build significant muscle. As most of\u00a0\u00a0 the studies in this video did, perhaps you may have\u00a0\nto perform more sets than usual and ensure longer\u00a0\u00a0 rest intervals to achieve this. Note, in most of the\u00a0\nstudies mentioned here strength gains, so one rep max gains, were greater for the low rep groups.\u00a0\nTherefore, if your priority is strength gains,\u00a0 but you would like some degree of hypertrophy,\u00a0\nusing reps between 2 to 4 is probably very\u00a0\u00a0 effective. If your goal is hypertrophy, to er on the\u00a0\nside of caution, it's probably sensible to ensure\u00a0\u00a0 most of your training is done in the 5 to 35 rep\u00a0\nzone. There does exist some interesting research\u00a0\u00a0 exploring reps higher than 35 for building muscle. I plan to cover this in the next video. After that,\u00a0\u00a0 we'll explore if using different rep ranges\u00a0\nin your program could improve muscle growth. :)"

    "transcript": "As mentioned before, two meta-analyses indicate\u00a0\nlight loads can produce similar muscle growth to\u00a0\u00a0 heavier loads, when reps are performed to or close\u00a0\nto failure. The point at which no more repetitions\u00a0\u00a0 can be performed. Meta-analyses are studies that\u00a0\ncombine the results of numerous individual studies\u00a0\u00a0 looking at the same topic. In the two meta-analyses, most studies use loads from 30% to\u00a0\u00a0 85% percent of a person's one rep max, equating to roughly reps between 35 and 5. I\u00a0\u00a0 should note that, for example, you could have two\u00a0\ndifferent individuals perform reps to failure with\u00a0\u00a0 an 85 percent one-rep max load on the back squat,\u00a0\nyet they could achieve a different number of reps.\u00a0\u00a0 Additionally, the exercise could play a role. For\u00a0\ninstance, Mitchell and colleagues found that with\u00a0\u00a0 a 30% one-rep max load on the leg\u00a0\nextension, subjects perform roughly between 30\u00a0\u00a0 and 40 reps to failure. But Okazi and colleagues\u00a0\nfound that with a 30% one0rep max load\u00a0\u00a0 on the dumbbell curl, subjects performed roughly\u00a0\n60 to 80 reps to failure. So, keep this in mind\u00a0\u00a0 when thinking about the relationship between\u00a0\nrelative loading and repetition number. Anyway, on\u00a0\u00a0 the bottom end of the spectrum, we have quite a few\u00a0\nstudies indicating a 30%  one-rep max load\u00a0\u00a0 can produce similar hypertrophy to heavier\u00a0\nloads. Returning to the Mitchell and colleagues study,\u00a0\u00a0 they had subjects perform 3 sets to failure on\u00a0\nthe leg extension with either a 30% one\u00a0\u00a0 rep max load or an 80% one-rep max load,\u00a0\n3 times per week for 10 weeks. Increases in\u00a0\u00a0 quadriceps volume were similar when using a 30% or 80% one-rep max load. One\u00a0\u00a0 strong reason behind why loads as light as this\u00a0\ncan produce similar muscle growth to heavier loads\u00a0\u00a0 relates to mechanical tension. This is probably\u00a0\nthe best understood mechanism of muscle growth\u00a0\u00a0 at this time A key component of mechanical tension\u00a0\nis active tension. This is equal to the force\u00a0\u00a0 produced by a muscle. High levels of muscle fiber\u00a0\nrecruitment and high levels of force generated by\u00a0\u00a0 the recruited muscle fibers means high levels of\u00a0\nactive tension, and by extension, mechanical tension.\u00a0 Heavier loads readily demand high levels of\u00a0\nmuscle fiber recruitment and high levels of force\u00a0\u00a0 produced by the individual muscle fibers. As you\u00a0\nnear failure, these things would likely increase\u00a0\u00a0 further to a degree. However evidence indicates\u00a0\nlight loads can achieve these conditions too.\u00a0\u00a0 Taking a light load too or very close to failure\u00a0\nwill require increased muscle fiber recruitment\u00a0\u00a0 and force produced by the individual muscle\u00a0\nfibers. Ultimately resulting in a similar stimulus\u00a0\u00a0 to heavier loads. If we were to take these ideas\u00a0\nalone, an interesting question arises. Why would\u00a0\u00a0 a load be too light for muscle growth? So long\u00a0\nas we take any load to or very close to failure,\u00a0\u00a0 surely high levels of muscle fiber recruitment\u00a0\nand high levels of force produced by those fibers\u00a0\u00a0 would be present?  1000 reps, so long as the\u00a0\nlast rep was failure, should be as good as\u00a0\u00a0 10 reps to failure. However, instinctively this\u00a0\ndoes not sound right. One potential hypothesis\u00a0\u00a0 that can help us here relates to central\u00a0\nfatigue. Remember, the reason muscles produce\u00a0\u00a0 force is because they receive electrical signals\u00a0\noriginating from the central nervous system, so the\u00a0\u00a0 brain and spinal cord. Simply, the more electrical\u00a0\nsignals a muscle receives, the more muscle fibers\u00a0\u00a0 are recruited and the more force produced by the\u00a0\nrecruited muscle fibers. Central fatigue refers to\u00a0\u00a0 a decrease in the electrical signal sent down to\u00a0\nthe muscle by the nervous system. This results in\u00a0\u00a0 a reduction in muscle fiber recruitment and less\u00a0\nforce produced by some recruited muscle fibers.\u00a0\u00a0 Opposite to what seems to be popular belief, low\u00a0\nload, longer duration sets, appear to produce more\u00a0\u00a0 central fatigue than higher load, shorter duration\u00a0\nsets. For instance, Yoon and colleagues had 9 men and 9 women, on separate days, perform\u00a0\na contraction of their biceps at either 20%\u00a0\u00a0 of their maximum voluntary contraction force or\u00a0\n80 % of their maximum voluntary contraction force.\u00a0\u00a0 They held each contraction until force declined by\u00a0\n10% of the target force. On average, subjects\u00a0\u00a0 held the 20% contraction for around 14 minutes before\u00a0\nthey could no longer produce the required force,\u00a0\u00a0 whereas the 80% contraction was only held for\u00a0\naround 25 seconds. But, the 20% contraction produced\u00a0\u00a0 greater central fatigue than the 80% contraction.\u00a0\nOther studies also support these findings.\u00a0\u00a0 During sets on typical exercises, some degree\u00a0\nof central fatigue will probably be present.\u00a0\u00a0 As just established, lighter loads, when taken to\u00a0\nor close to failure would produce more central\u00a0\u00a0 fatigue than heavier loads. Given evidence\u00a0\nindicates loads as light as 30% one-rep max\u00a0\u00a0 can produce similar hypertrophy to heavier loads,\u00a0\nwe can safely say any central fatigue produced\u00a0\u00a0 with this load is probably not an issue. But it is\u00a0\npossible that some load below 30% of your\u00a0\u00a0 one-rep max, whereby if taken to failure, may fail to\u00a0\nachieve sufficiently high levels of muscle fiber\u00a0\u00a0 recruitment and force produced by the recruited\u00a0\nmuscle fibers, due to the interference of central\u00a0\u00a0 fatigue. lLet us now move away from the theory and\u00a0\nlook at the actual research. There have been a few\u00a0\u00a0 papers assessing the impacts of using loads below\u00a0\n30 one-rep max for hypertrophy. Some of these failed\u00a0\u00a0 to have subjects train to failure, which isn't\u00a0\nreally helpful, so we won't bother evaluating them.\u00a0\u00a0 Jessee and colleagues had untrained men and\u00a0\nwomen perform 4 sets on the knee extension to\u00a0\u00a0 volitional failure either with a 15% one-rep max\u00a0\nload or a 70% one-rep max load. Subjects trained\u00a0\u00a0 twice per week for 8 weeks. I should note that\u00a0\nwith the 15% one-rep max condition,\u00a0\u00a0 if any subject got up to 90 reps\u00a0, the set was stopped even if they did\u00a0\u00a0 not reach volitional failure. Ultimately, only 2\nsubjects out of 40 achieve this for all 4 sets,\u00a0\u00a0 so it's probably not an issue. Increases\u00a0\nin lateral and anterior thigh thickness\u00a0\u00a0 were similar between the 15% and 70% one-rep max condition, indicating a 15%\u00a0\u00a0 one-rep max load may still be able to maximize\u00a0\nhypertrophy. An interesting thing about this study\u00a0\u00a0 was the 15% one-rep max condition had subjects\u00a0\nuse only a 30 second rest interval between sets,\u00a0\u00a0 while the 70% one-rep max condition\u00a0\nhad subjects use a 90-second rest interval.\u00a0\u00a0 This did not seem to impact the results. However,\u00a0\nthere is research that conflicts with this study.\u00a0\u00a0 Buckner and colleagues had untrained men and\u00a0\nwomen perform 4 sets to volitional failure\u00a0\u00a0 on the dumbbell biceps curl with either a\u00a0\n15% one-rep max load or a 70 % one-rep max load. Subjects trained twice\u00a0\nper week for 8 weeks. Like the last study, if\u00a0\u00a0 subjects were able to get up to 90 reps with\u00a0\nthe 15% one-rep max load, the set was\u00a0\u00a0 stopped even if they had not reached volitional\u00a0\nfailure. Based on the data provided, subjects in\u00a0\u00a0 the 15% one-rep max condition, on\u00a0\naverage, reached 90 reps on the first set but\u00a0\u00a0 from sets 2 to 4, their sets were terminated\u00a0\nbefore 90 reps, indicating they achieved volitional\u00a0\u00a0 failure. Increases in elbow flexor thickness were\u00a0\ngreater for the 70% one0rep max condition,\u00a0\u00a0 suggesting a 15% one-rep max load\u00a0\nmay be too light to maximize muscle growth.\u00a0\u00a0 This study was pretty much identical in design\u00a0\nto the previous study. They also had the 15% one-rep max condition use a 30\u00a0second rest interval between sets, while the\u00a0\u00a0 70% one-rep max condition used a\u00a0\n90 second rest interval. This could have\u00a0\u00a0 impacted the results, but given it did not impact\u00a0\nthe Jessee and colleagues results, it's difficult\u00a0\u00a0 to say. Interestingly, the only difference between\u00a0\nthese two studies was that Jessee and colleagues\u00a0\u00a0 study used leg extensions, while the Buckner and\u00a0\ncolleagues study used the dumbbell biceps curl.\u00a0 Maybe a 15% one-rep max load can maximize\u00a0\nmuscle growth with the lower body, but not with\u00a0\u00a0 the muscles of the upper body. However, a study\u00a0\nby Lasevicius and colleagues would question this.\u00a0\u00a0 They had untrained men perform the dumbbell\u00a0\nbiceps curl and leg press for an average of\u00a0\u00a0 3 to 5 sets to failure each, twice per\u00a0\nweek for 12 weeks. Subjects either used a 20,\u00a0\u00a0 40, 60, or 80% one-rep max load\u00a0\nwith each exercise. All conditions involved\u00a0\u00a0 120 seconds of rest between sets. Increases\u00a0\nin cross-sectional area of the elbow flexors\u00a0\u00a0 and vastus lateralis were similar between the\u00a0\n40, 60, and 80% one-rep max conditions,\u00a0\u00a0 and all greater than the 20% one-rep\nmax condition, indicating a 20% one\u00a0\u00a0 rep max load is not able to maximize muscle growth\u00a0\nfor the upper or lower body A study by Roie and\u00a0\u00a0 colleagues further confuses things. They had older\u00a0\nuntrained men and women train the leg press and\u00a0\u00a0 leg extension, twice per week for 12 weeks. Subjects\u00a0\neither trained  each exercise with 1 set to\u00a0\u00a0 failure with a 20% one-rep max load\u00a0\nor they trained to each exercise with 2 sets to\u00a0\u00a0 failure with an 80% one-rep max load.\u00a0\nSubjects use two minutes of rest between sets.\u00a0\u00a0 Increases in upper leg volume were similar between\u00a0\nboth groups, suggesting a 20% one-rep max load can maximize muscle growth. Interestingly,\u00a0\nthe 20% one-rep max condition\u00a0\u00a0 involved only 1 set for each exercise, while the\u00a0\n80% one-rep max condition involved 2 sets for each exercise. The extra set did not seem\u00a0\nto help the 80% one-rep max condition.\u00a0\u00a0 Now, the subjects were older men and women. So\u00a0\nit's not clear how this study design would impact\u00a0\u00a0 young men and women. To sum up, the current evidence, unfortunately, does not give us a straight answer.\u00a0\u00a0 2 studies indicate loads between 15% and 20% one-rep max can maximize hypertrophy, albeit 1 study was done\u00a0\non older subjects, while 2 other studies suggest\u00a0\u00a0 loads between 15% and 20% one-rep max do not maximize hypertrophy. Because\u00a0\u00a0 of the conflicting evidence, it's probably sensible\u00a0\nto ensure that if your goal is hypertrophy,\u00a0\u00a0 most of your training should be done within the\u00a0\n30% to 85% one-rep max\u00a0 zone. Generally speaking though, although loads as\u00a0\nlow as 30% one-rep max appear to be\u00a0\u00a0 able to maximize growth, I don't think many train\u00a0\nregularly with this type of loading. Most people\u00a0\u00a0 tend to find a light load training much more\u00a0\nmiserable and painful than heavier load training.\u00a0\u00a0 Although this video may not have much\u00a0\npractical takeaway, hopefully it was\u00a0\u00a0 helpful in some way. Our next video will have\u00a0\nsome potential practical takeaways, we'll be\u00a0\u00a0 evaluating if using different rep ranges in your\u00a0\ntraining program could improve muscle growth. "

    "title": "The Science of Sarcoplasmic Hypertrophy (What, How, and Why)",
    "published_at": "2021-08-22T15:25:31Z",
    "transcript": "In the fitness world, sarcoplasmic hypertrophy\nseems to be quite controversial. But, as we've seen in this ongoing series\non muscle growth, sarcoplasmic hypertrophy does indeed seem to be real, there are studies\nsupporting the existence of it. For those who haven't seen the previous videos,\nand as a review for those who have, let us briefly overview what sarcoplasmic hypertrophy\nis. Firstly, we need to understand muscles are\norganized in hierarchical layers. Within whole muscles are fascicles, within\nfascicles are muscle fibers, and within muscle fibers are myofibrils. Myofibrils are where the magic of muscle contraction\noccurs, they contain an array of sarcomeres. Sarcomeres are what generate muscle force. Specifically, when something called the myosin\nhead extends from the myosin filament and pulls on something called the actin filament\ntowards the M-line, force is generated. To understand sarcoplasmic hypertrophy, we\nneed to step back and take a closer look at the muscle fiber level. As we've mentioned, muscle fibers contain myofibrils, which are what generate force via their sarcomeres. Everything else within the muscle fiber can\nbe considered the sarcoplasm. The sarcoplasm largely consists of water but\nalso contains other components, such as glycogen, sarcoplasmic proteins, and non-contractile\norganelles. Sarcoplasmic hypertrophy is where the sarcoplasm\ngrows at a greater pace than the myofibrils, meaning that this sarcoplasm growth disproportionately\ndrives the increase in muscle fiber cross-sectional area. As an extra note, myofibrillar hypertrophy\nis where the myofibrils and sarcoplasm expand at the same rate, while myofibrillar packing\nis where the myofibrils expand at a greater rate than the sarcoplasm. In a previous video, we examined the training\nvariables used in studies that found evidence for myofibrillar hypertrophy, sarcoplasmic\nhypertrophy, and myofibrillar packing in hope of finding out if there are specific ways\nyou can train for either. As we saw, in nearly all of the studies that\nfound evidence for either of these types of muscle fiber growth, moderate loads and moderate\nfrequencies were used. On the other hand, volume may be the differentiating\nfactor. More precisely, low to moderate volumes were\nassociated with myofibrillar hypertrophy or myofibrillar packing, while high volumes were\nassociated with sarcoplasmic hypertrophy. On-screen depicts the long-term studies finding\nevidence for sarcoplasmic hypertrophy. As is evident, 3/5 of the studies can be classified\nas using high volumes. Now, as we alluded to in the original video,\nby no means is this overwhelming or definitive evidence. Future research will be of great value for\nproviding clarity of whether sarcoplasmic hypertrophy is truly best elicited through\nhigh volumes. Nonetheless, for the time being, I think the\ninterpretation that high volumes may make sarcoplasmic hypertrophy more likely is fair. Furthermore, as we'll establish in a moment,\nthere is a logical rationale behind why high volumes may preferentially stimulate sarcoplasmic\nhypertrophy. As for loading, the overwhelming majority\nof studies in this area have used moderate loads., and as we saw, this loading produced\nall three types of muscle fiber growth. Thus, the current evidence is insufficient\nto inform us if light loads or heavy loads can preferentially induce sarcoplasmic hypertrophy,\nmyofibrillar packing, or myofibrillar hypertrophy. Hopefully future research can clear this up. Let us now explore what, on the ultrastructural\nlevel, may drive sarcoplasmic hypertrophy. To phrase this another way, we know sarcoplasmic\nhypertrophy is where the sarcoplasm grows disproportionately more than the myofibrils. But, what may primarily drive this disproportionately\ngreater sarcoplasm growth? Some key contenders include: An increase in glycogen\nAn Increase in creatine phosphate An Increase in mitochondria\nAn Increase in volume of the sarcoplasmic reticulum\nAn Increase in volume of transverse tubules Or an increase in sarcoplasmic proteins Plausibly, any of these could independently\nor collectively drive disproportionate sarcoplasm growth. Let us evaluate them. Firstly, the sarcoplasmic reticulum and transverse\ntubules are organelles within muscle fibers that play a pivotal role in the events leading\nup to muscle force production. Unfortunately, I'm not aware of any research\nexploring if the volume of the sarcoplasmic reticulum or transverse tubules increases\nwith resistance training. Therefore, we simply do not know if these\ncontribute to sarcoplasmic hypertrophy. As for mitochondria, this is an organelle\nfound within muscle fibers (and other cells in the human body) that generate chemical\nenergy. However, we can probably rule out an increase\nin mitochondria contributing to sarcoplasmic hypertrophy. This is because the majority of the evidence\nsuggests the relative space taken up by mitochondria does not increase, or may even decrease, in\nresponse to resistance training. Glycogen, opposingly, may play a role in sarcoplasmic\nhypertrophy. Glycogen are particles that can be viewed\nas a source of energy for muscle fibers. Each gram of glycogen is stored with at least\n3 grams of water. Therefore, an increase in glycogen within\nmuscle fibers concurrently increases the amount of water within the sarcoplasm, causing sarcoplasm\ngrowth. A study by MacDougall et al. found that after\ntraining the triceps for 5 months with high volumes, the relative space taken up by glycogen\ndid increase within triceps muscle fibers. This data suggests that glycogen indeed may\nbe able to disproportionately drive sarcoplasm growth (that is, sarcoplasmic hypertrophy). However, there is also evidence against this. Haun et al. found that after 6 weeks of progressing\nup to high volumes, the relative space taken up by glycogen within vastus lateralis muscle\nfibers did not increase. Moreover, it's also important to note high\ncarbohydrate diets can meaningfully increase the relative space taken up by glycogen within\nmuscle fibers. Also, immediately after hard resistance training,\nthe relative space taken up by glycogen within muscle fibers is meaningfully decreased. Therefore, if glycogen was to drive sarcoplasmic\nhypertrophy, this type of growth may be considered somewhat transient and variable. In total, based on the information we've detailed,\nI think it's fair to say that it's not completely clear if glycogen is truly a driver of sarcoplasmic\nhypertrophy. Moving on to creatine phosphate, this is a\nmolecule that plays a role in recycling ATP, which is the primary energy carrier in the\nbody. It's believed creatine phosphate (particularly\nthe creatine component) causes an increase in the amount of water within muscle fibers\ntoo. Therefore, an increase in creatine phosphate\nwithin muscle fibers may create sarcoplasm growth via a concurrent increase in water. Returning to the study by MacDougall et al.\nwho had subjects train their triceps for 5 months with high volumes, they also observed\nan increase in the relative space taken up by creatine phosphate within the triceps muscle\nfibers. Therefore, perhaps creatine phosphate may\nindeed help explain sarcoplasmic hypertrophy. Now, some of you probably have questions about\ncreatine supplementation. Namely, can creatine supplementation make\nsarcoplasmic hypertrophy more likely? It's important to remember that just because\ncreatine supplementation may increase water within muscle fibers, this itself doesn't\nguarantee sarcoplasmic hypertrophy in the long run. The increase in water within the muscle fiber\nwould have to be relatively greater than any myofibril growth achieved with training to\ncreate sarcoplasmic hypertrophy. However, four studies in which subjects supplemented\nwith creatine monohydrate actually found evidence for myofibrillar packing after training with\nlow volumes for 4 to 10 weeks. Put differently, the myofibrils expanded at\na greater rate than the sarcoplasm, indicating any increase in water elicited by creatine\nsupplementation was insufficient to create sarcoplasmic hypertrophy. It's worth emphasizing again low volumes were\nused in these four studies. As we know, perhaps higher volumes are what\ncreates sarcoplasmic hypertrophy. Moreover, recall the study by MacDougall et\nal. found with higher volumes that elicited sarcoplasmic hypertrophy, there was a significant\nincrease in the relative space taken up by creatine phosphate. This brings up an interesting question: could\nsupplementing creatine with high volume training accentuate sarcoplasmic hypertrophy in comparison\nto only training with high volumes without creatine supplementation. Unfortunately, there's no research exploring\nthis, so we cannot make any conclusions. Anyway, progressing on to sarcoplasmic proteins,\ncould an increase in sarcoplasmic proteins also play a role in sarcoplasmic hypertrophy? Sarcoplasmic proteins are involved in various\nchemical reactions within muscle fibers. Assuming sarcoplasmic proteins are dissolved\nin the sarcoplasm, an increase in them could drive water within the muscle fiber, thereby\ngrowing the sarcoplasm. In a study by Haun et al., in which sarcoplasmic\nhypertrophy was observed after 6 weeks of progressing to high volumes, the relative\nspace taken up by sarcoplasmic proteins tended to increase. I should mention that many of the sarcoplasmic\nproteins that increased were involved in anaerobic glycolysis, a point that becomes noteworthy\nlater on. As a result, this study perhaps suggests an\nincrease in sarcoplasmic proteins was contributing to the disproportionate sarcoplasm growth. Now, I should mention that there was a study\nby Vann et al. who observed evidence for sarcoplasmic hypertrophy, but found the relative space\ntaken up by sarcoplasmic proteins did not increase. However, the thing is the Vann et al. study\ndid not use high volumes, subjects in their study only performed 12-16 weekly sets for\nthe quadriceps. Returning to the list of studies that found\nsarcoplasmic hypertrophy, we can see that it was one of two studies that did not use\nhigh volumes, yet found sarcoplasmic hypertrophy. In the video where we originally explored\nthis research, I described why the other study by Penman should be viewed with caution. No statistical analyses were performed, and\nno fiber or whole muscle growth measurement was given. Therefore, when ignoring the Penman study,\nthe study by Vann et al. may currently be considered somewhat an outlier. Furthermore, comparing this study to the Haun\net al. study, which progressively worked up to higher volumes and found an increase in\nsarcoplasmic proteins, the magnitude of sarcoplasmic hypertrophy was much greater in the Haun et\nal. study. So, to conclude this section on what may cause\nthe sarcoplasm to disproportionately grow, the current evidence seems promising that\nan increase in creatine phosphate and sarcoplasmic proteins may be involved. Let us move on to the interesting question\nof why sarcoplasmic hypertrophy may even occur in the first place. Put differently, what would be the body's\nreason for growing the sarcoplasm disproportionately more than the myofibrils? There are a few potential candidate scenarios,\na few of these were mentioned in a fascinating review study by Haun et al. The first one suggests that sarcoplasmic hypertrophy\nis a response to high-volume training (that is, a large number of weekly sets for your\nmuscle groups). As we know, there have been 5 long-term studies\nfinding sarcoplasmic hypertrophy, and 3 of these used high volumes. Combine these findings with the findings that\ndisproportionate sarcoplasm growth may be driven by an increase in creatine phosphate\nand sarcoplasmic proteins, we arrive at a very interesting potential mechanistic rationale. Specifically, it makes sense that high-volume\ntraining may cause sarcoplasmic hypertrophy through significant increases in creatine\nphosphate and sarcoplasmic proteins. Let me explain. Most people's sets with any given exercise\nlast far less than 2 minutes. During this time, 2 energy systems would primarily\nbe used. The first one is where creatine phosphate\ncreates energy for muscle contraction (which probably lasts 5-10 seconds), while the second\none is anaerobic glycolysis, where glucose is used to create energy for muscle contraction\n(which probably lasts up to 2 minutes). Now, regardless of whether you perform a high\nnumber or a low number of sets for a given exercise, you're using both these energy systems. However, with higher volumes (that is, a high\nnumber of sets), you're taxing these energy systems more. In other words, you are using these energy\nsystems and replenishing them (during the rest intervals) to a greater extent than using\nlower volumes. Therefore, it's logical that high volume training\nwould provoke a significant increase in creatine phosphate and sarcoplasmic proteins involved\nin anaerobic glycolysis. Now, it's important I mention that this is\ncurrently just my hypothesis, I believe the mentioned logic makes sense based on the current\ndata, but please remember it is far from a definitive conclusion. Future research could very well provide evidence\nthat renders this hypothesis obsolete. Moving on, the second scenario behind why\nsarcoplasmic hypertrophy may occur is something novel we haven't addressed at all in this\nvideo but is very reasonable. It suggests sarcoplasmic hypertrophy may be\nmerely swelling and nothing else. To expand on this, in response to exercise\nthat elicits high degrees of damage, muscle fibers can swell. This swelling is a build-up of water within\nmuscle fibers and thus technically fits the definition of sarcoplasmic hypertrophy. As an example of this, a study by Yu et al.\nhad sedentary men run down a staircase for 10 floors. They took an elevator back up and repeated\nthis 15 times. This protocol was likely highly damaging. Firstly, the workload used was quite substantial\nfor the untrained subjects. Secondly, running downstairs results in eccentric\ncontractions of many lower body muscles, including the soleus (one of the calf muscles). Eccentric contractions are where your muscles\nproduce force while lengthening. These types of contractions are highly damaging\nwhen you're unaccustomed to them. What the researchers found was that 7-8 days\nafter the session, the cross-sectional area of muscle fibers from the soleus was inflated\nby 30%. The authors suggested, and I would agree,\nthat this increase in muscle fiber size was due to the build-up of fluid from swelling. Now, swelling is only temporary, it eventually\nsubsides. Even so, if we return to the long-term studies\nthat find evidence for sarcoplasmic hypertrophy, we know the majority of these studies used\nhigh volumes. High volumes can be quite damaging, and thus\none could argue that maybe the results are simply a reflection of swelling. However, there are problems with this suggestion. Firstly, in the Haun et al. study, recall\ntheir data potentially implies that an increase in sarcoplasmic proteins was at least partially\ndriving sarcoplasmic hypertrophy. This is independent of swelling. Secondly, the MacDougall et al. study lasted\n5 months. It's generally thought that the amount of\nswelling induced by training gradually diminishes as you continue training with the same program. Additionally, they took their measurements\n4-6 days after the final training session, a time point at which swelling is made further\nunlikely. So in total, it's hard to believe swelling\nwas what explained this study's results. Thirdly, as we saw in video 2 of this muscle\ngrowth series, there are cross-sectional studies that find potential evidence for sarcoplasmic\nhypertrophy in bodybuilders with numerous years of previous training experience. Therefore, all in all, the notion that sarcoplasmic\nhypertrophy is merely swelling is very questionable and I'd argue unlikely. Moving on to the third potential scenario,\nthis one quite fascinatingly suggests that the sarcoplasm grows disproportionately more\nin order to be primed and prepared for subsequently growing myofibrils. In other words, sarcoplasmic hypertrophy is\njust a precursor to myofibrillar hypertrophy or even myofibrillar packing. The question here is why couldn't the myofibrils\njust significantly grow, why must the sarcoplasm grow disproportionately more first? The potential answer to this is that growing\nmyofibrils not only requires a lot of space but is also an energetically costly process By increasing the number of components within\na muscle fiber that are involved in generating energy, such as sarcoplasmic proteins (which\ngo on to cause sarcoplasm growth), not only is there more space for myofibrils to grow\ninto, but the whole process of growing myofibrils would become much energetically easier for\nthe muscle fiber. Overall, this is a very interesting and elegant\nhypothesis. However, at this time, I don't believe there's\nany strong evidence for or against it. Now, this whole scenario could be related\nto the previous scenario of sarcoplasmic hypertrophy being a response to high volume training. High-volume training may actually be effective\nfor growing myofibrils and ultimately causing myofibrillar hypertrophy or even myofibrillar\npacking. It's just that first the body produces sarcoplasmic\nhypertrophy (via an increase in energy generating components) to not only deal with the taxing\nhigh volume training but also prepare the fibers spatially and energetically for growing\nmyofibrils. Again, It's important I mention this is just\na hypothesis, I believe the current evidence is far from strong enough to verify or falsify\nit. Finally, the fourth potential scenario as\nto why the body produces sarcoplasmic hypertrophy relates to reaching a potential threshold\nin the size of myofibrils. It suggests that muscle fibers significantly\ngrow myofibrils up until a point, we'll call this point the myofibril size threshold. Consequently, sarcoplasmic hypertrophy occurs\nvia an increase in energy-producing components, like sarcoplasmic proteins, thereby making\nfuture growth of the myofibrils easier. Now, there is potentially some supporting\nevidence for this. Returning to the long-term studies that found\nevidence for sarcoplasmic hypertrophy, we can see that two of them (the studies by Haun\nand Vann) were conducted on trained individuals. Perhaps the subjects of these studies had\nreached their myofibril size thresholds, explaining why they experienced sarcoplasmic hypertrophy. However, the obvious problem here is that\nthe three other studies that found evidence for sarcoplasmic hypertrophy were conducted\non untrained men, who would presumably not be near their myofibril size threshold. Therefore, I'd say the current evidence is\nprobably leaning away from the idea that sarcoplasmic hypertrophy is a result of reaching a myofibril\nsize threshold. To summarize this section of the video, the\nidea that sarcoplasmic hypertrophy is merely swelling or that sarcoplasmic hypertrophy\nis a result of reaching a myofibril size threshold seems unlikely based on the current evidence. On the other hand, the evidence is promising\nthat sarcoplasmic hypertrophy may be a result of training with high volumes. Furthermore, although very speculative at\nthis time, perhaps this is also related to the notion that sarcoplasmic hypertrophy is\nessentially spatial and energetic priming for subsequent myofibril growth. To close out this video, I think a discussion\non the potential role of anabolic steroids on sarcoplasmic hypertrophy would be interesting. Specifically, could taking anabolic steroids\nincrease the likelihood you experience sarcoplasmic hypertrophy? There is indeed some evidence to support this. For those who've seen our previous video exploring\nthe research on the 3 types of muscle fiber growth, you'll know that there were two cross-sectional\nstudies finding potential evidence of sarcoplasmic hypertrophy. Specifically, a study by MacDougall et al.\nfound that compared to 5 untrained men, the muscle samples of 7 well-trained lifters had\nmore relative space taken up by the sarcoplasm, potentially implying the well-trained lifters\nexperienced sarcoplasmic hypertrophy. Similarly, a study by Meijer et al. found\nthat the muscle fibers of 12 bodybuilders had a lower specific tension value compared\nto 6 power athletes and 14 untrained men, also potentially implying the bodybuilders\nexperienced sarcoplasmic hypertrophy. In the MacDougall et al. study, 6 out of 7\nof the well-trained lifters were using or had previously used anabolic steroids. In the Meijer et al. study, 9 out of 12 of\nthe bodybuilders were reported to be using anabolic steroids. Therefore, perhaps this indicates anabolic\nsteroids may make sarcoplasmic hypertrophy likely. Having said this, there is also evidence against\nthis. In the Meijer et al. study itself, 3 out of\n12 bodybuilders were not on steroids, yet their specific tension was still lower than\nthe power athletes and untrained men, suggesting these natural bodybuilders equivalently experienced\nsarcoplasmic hypertrophy. Furthermore, a different study by D'Antionia\net al. found that compared to untrained men, 2 bodybuilders on anabolic steroids had higher\nspecific tension of their muscle fibers. This higher specific tension indicates the\nbodybuilders may have actually experienced myofibrillar packing. Therefore, based on the current evidence,\nit's hard to know what role, if any, anabolic steroids may play in sarcoplasmic hypertrophy. Let us aim to summarize the whole video into\na few takeaway points. Before mentioning them, it's again essential\nto recognize that all the following points are by no means definitive conclusions, rather\nthey are based on interpretations of the current evidence. Future research could most definitely change\nthem. You could potentially train for sarcoplasmic\nhypertrophy. More precisely, it seems using high volumes\n(defined as training a muscle with 21 or more weekly sets) may make sarcoplasmic hypertrophy\nmore likely. This may be related to the fact that high\nvolumes, due to being more taxing on creatine phosphate and anaerobic glycolysis energy\nsystems, elicit a significant increase in creatine phosphate and sarcoplasmic proteins\ninvolved in glycolysis. Both of these can contribute to disproportionate\nsarcoplasm growth. A very interesting yet very speculative hypothesis\nsuggests that not only is sarcoplasmic hypertrophy produced to deal with the high volume training,\nbut it also may prime the muscle fiber spatially and energetically for significantly growing\nmyofibrils. Essentially meaning that perhaps high-volume\ntraining ultimately causes myofibrillar hypertrophy or even myofibrillar packing."

    "title": "Trap Bar Deadlift vs Conventional Deadlift (In-Depth Comparison)",
    "published_at": "2020-08-12T11:36:07Z",
    "transcript": "the conventional deadlift is one of the more common exercises performed in any type of training program however in recent years the trap bar deadlift has gained popularity in this video we'll be comparing the two movements and overviewing the current research that exists a straight bar is used in the conventional deadlift and the load is placed in front of your body as you execute the movement a hexagonally shaped bar is used with the trap bar deadlift you step inside of this and with the handles either side of you you lift the load typically a trap bar has high handles and if you flip it around low handles we'll be discussing the use of both in this video another variance with the trap bar deadlift is in the execution most generally perform the movement with a somewhat squat style where their knees are flexed more and their upper body is more upright compared to a conventional deadlift however the trap bar deadlift can also be performed similarly to a conventional deadlift with less knee flexion more hip flexion and a more horizontal back in this video we'll be discussing the first type the squattier variation as this is the one used by most people and the one used in all the research we will look at moments are forces that turn something to understand what external moments are let's look at a biceps curl here we have someone holding a biceps curl at midpoint with their forearm parallel to the floor the dumbbell is applying a downward force that is trying to extend your elbow therefore we say the dumbbell is exerting an extensor moment to calculate this extensor moment we first calculate the force the dumbbell is applying downwards this is done by multiplying the weight of the dumbbell by gravitational strength as the dumbbell here weighs 15 kilograms we multiply this by 9.8 meters per second squared the gravitational strength to get 147 newtons of force applied downwards we then multiply this by something called the moment arm the moment arm is the perpendicular distance from the line of force to the center of the joint we're looking at so the elbow in this case let's say this is 0.3 meters so 147 newtons multiplied by 0.3 meters equals 44.1 newton meters therefore the extensor moment is 44.1 newton meters to maintain this isometric contraction your elbow flexors so your biceps brachii brachialis and brachioradialis are going to have to collectively produce a flexor moment equal to 44.1 newton meters if you wanted to curl the dumbbell upwards your elbow flexes would have to produce a flexor moment greater than 44.1 newton meters therefore the extensor moment which in this case was the external moment as it is the moment primarily applied by the dumbbell which of course is external to the body gives us an idea of how hard the muscles around a joint may work with both the trap bar deadlift and conventional deadlift the external moments are a hip flexion moment knee flexion moment and a spinal flexion moment a 2011 paper by swinton and colleagues compared the peak moments between a trap bar deadlift with low handles and a conventional deadlift subjects who were trained power lifters performed both lifts with loads from 10 to 80 percent of their conventional deadlift warner max let's take a look at the results when subjects use eighty percent of their conventional deadlift warning max on both the exercises peak spinal flexor moments were greater for the conventional deadlift peak hip flexion moments were also greater for the conventional deadlift but peak knee flexion moments were greater for the trap bar deadlift the greater peak knee flexion moment with the trap bar deadlift implies it involves the quadriceps more than the conventional deadlift the greater peak spinal flexion moment for the conventional deadlift implies that it involves the spinal erectors more than the trap bar deadlift similarly the greater peak hip flexion moment for the conventional deadlift implies that it involves the glutes and hamstrings more than the trap bar deadlift however subjects use the same load on both exercises which was 80 percent of the conventional deadlift for warner max the study also tested one rep max's on both lifts subjects could lift 8.4 percent more weight on the trackbar deadlift when comparing 80 of these values this would still be an 8.4 percent difference given this if we compared an 80 warner max trap bar deadlift to an 80 warner max conventional deadlift we would need to increase the moment shown earlier for the trap bar deadlift by 8.4 percent as remember weight plays a role in calculating moments doing this virtually removes the differences in peak spinal flexion moments and peak hip flexion moments this would suggest that the spinal erectors glutes and hamstrings are involved similarly in both the trap bar deadlift and conventional deadlift while the quadriceps would still be involved more in the trap bar deadlift that said moments although being one of the more important factors isn't the only factor that determines how involved a particular muscle is there are a few other factors including passive tension passive tension is particularly relevant to the hamstrings as due to the length tension relationships of each of the hamstring muscles passive tension is generated when the hamstrings are stretched in other words achieving a stretch of the hamstrings during an exercise is likely more favorable for hypertrophy and overall force production when comparing the typical more upright create a knee flexion trap bar deadlift to a conventional deadlift the conventional deadlift would achieve a greater stretch of the hamstrings overall meaning that the hamstrings are likely more involved with the conventional deadlift the vastus muscles of the quadriceps also produce passive tension when stretched so as well as the greater knee flexion moment with the trap bar deadlift it also achieves a greater stretch of the quadriceps compared to a conventional deadlift thus enhancing the quadriceps ability to produce force to conclude this section the trap bar deadlift would involve the quadriceps more while the conventional deadlift would likely involve the hamstrings more glute and spinal erector involvement are probably similar between the two now the data from swinton and colleagues and all the logic that followed was about the low handle trap bar deadlift would all of these conclusions here apply to the high hand or trap bar deadlift let's first take a look at the differences in range of motion lake and colleagues demonstrated that when using the low handles with the trap bar the distance the bar travels so the overall range of motion is now identical to the conventional deadlift but when using the high handles with the trap bar lockheed colleagues demonstrated that the distance the bar travels is around 22 less compared to the conventional deadlift from this we can deduce that the high handle trap bar deadlift involves roughly 22 less range of motion compared to the low handle trap bar deadlift would this change any muscle involvement the less knee flexion hip flexion and for some a slightly more vertical back for the high handle trap bar deadlift versus the low handle trap bar deadlift would decrease the moment arms for each joint however slightly heavier loads can also be used with a high handle trap bar deadlift this would probably result in similar external moments between them that said remember earlier we said that the quadriceps can produce passive tension when stretched with the lower handles the quads would typically be stretched slightly more due to the greater knee flexion whether this would be significant enough to induce greater core hypertrophy when compared to the high handles remains unknown overall i think both would be comparable in muscle involvement but hopefully future research can provide us with more details moving on to some practical considerations the decreased range of motion with the high handles could be advantageous for some some individuals due to their anatomy may find their thigh bone makes contact with their hips at the bottom position of a conventional deadlift which of course is uncomfortable others may also find that the only way they can get their hands on the barbell at the start of a conventional deadlift is to round their back also due to their anatomy therefore for these people the high handles with the trap bar deadlift will allow them to get in a more comfortable and advantageous position another thing i thought i'd mention here is that if you have some injury or pain with your lower back the trap bar deadlift low or high handles is likely more sensible with the conventional deadlift as the bar is in front of you there's more chance of you getting pulled forward and shifting the load to your lower back as you fatigue but with the trap bar given the load is either side of you your lower back is less likely to pick up the slack as you fatigue if anything the load may be shifted to the quadriceps a 2017 study by lake and colleagues compared the average force power velocity and time spent accelerating during a 90 percent warner max low handle track bar deadlift and a 90 warner max conventional deadlift in 11 trained men average force power velocity and time spent accelerating were all greater for the low handle trap bar deadlift although this is acute data these results do imply that for athletes the trap bar deadlift is probably superior to the conventional deadlift this would still be the case with the high handle trap bar deadlift lockheed and colleagues compared a one rep max high handle trap bar deadlift to a conventional deadlift warner max for average force power and velocity [Music] the high handle trap bar deadlift was superior in all areas [Music] the trap bar deadlift does typically involve greater knee flexion when compared to a conventional deadlift but compared to a squat there is still quite a bit of difference swinton and colleagues demonstrated that participants on average had around 78 degrees of knee flexion at the start of a high handle trap bar deadlift parallel or slightly below parallel squats are generally around 100 to 120 degrees of knee flexion while deep squats can be around 140 degrees of knee flexion moreover although the quadriceps are worked to a good degree in the trap bar deadlift the glutes and possibly hamstrings are worked quite a bit more returning to the data on moments by swinton and colleagues we can see that the hip flexion moment is meaningfully larger than the knee flexion moment this is contrasting to the squat another paper by swinton and colleagues found that in a roughly eighty percent of warner max back squat with 120 degrees of knee flexion peak hip moments and peak knee moments are more comparable a different paper by s camilla and colleagues found that during a medium stance back squat or at max highest knee flexion moments were also more comparable to the highest hip flexion moments therefore it's clear to see that the trap bar deadlift is still very much a deadlift [Music]"

    "transcript": "welcome to the house of hypertrophy how many exercises per muscle group are required for optimizing muscle hypertrophy might one exercise be sufficient let's analyze the scientific literature [Music] a 2016 study from Brazil recruited 26 previously untrained men one group trained the squat to only a second group the leg press only and a third group both the leg press and squats after training twice a week for 10 weeks fat-free Mass gains non-significantly differed between the three groups the raw percentages seemingly favor the squat group taking at face value this study May imply multiple exercises for a muscle fails to benefit muscle hypertrophy yet a crucial limitation of this study is fat-free mass is an indirect and imprecise muscle hypertrophy measurement it does not allow us to know if growth across muscle heads or even regions of each muscle differed between groups this matters as Regional hypertrophy exists growth across muscle heads and even within regions of a muscle head isn't always equal for example a 2013 Japanese study found in leg extensions didn't equally grow the quad heads or the upper and lower regions of each head another other 2021 Japanese study found preacher curls with a partial range of motion at long lengths did not equally grow three regions across the biceps different exercises for a muscle group May produce diverse regional growth meaning multiple exercises for a muscle are complementary to maximally develop it regionally yet I would say the Brazilian study shows how one exercise per muscle is far from useless for hypertrophy [Music] a 2021 Brazilian study elegantly shows how multiple exercises for a muscle benefit Regional development 22d trained men were assigned into a non-varied or varied group both groups train three times per week the non-varied group perform the same exercises in each session whereas the varied group perform three different exercises per muscle across the three weekly training sessions each exercise was trained with these variables before and after eight training weeks Rex's femoris vastus lateralis elbow flexor and triceps growth were measured at the upper middle and lower regions growth at some regions was similar between both groups but growth at other regions was Superior for the varied group this was despite the fact lean mass gains were similar between both groups demonstrating how lean mass and fat-free Mass measures fail to detect subtle hypertrophy differences another 2014 Brazilian study further indicates that The Beneficial impact of multiple exercises some subjects train the score only across 12 weeks other subjects showing a squat leg press lunge and deadlift across 12 weeks the squat was performed to 90 degrees of knee flexion on a Smith machine this might seem like a crime but we've examined previously how machines are not inherently inferior to free weights for hypertrophy and one Japanese study found similar quad hypertrophy between 90 and 140 degree knee flexion squats returning to the study both groups increase the size of their quadriceps muscles but those performing multiple exercises tended to see greater vastus medialis and lateralis growth so multiple exercises per muscle can benefit regional growth but I still want to again emphasize it's not like one exercise per muscle is useless in both studies one exercise for a muscle still induced very significant hypertrophy in the Costa study the variety group used three biomechanically different exercises in the same week interestingly the researchers speculated the significantly greater upper elbowflex hypertrophy seen by the varied group may be a result of them training incline curls the Fonseca study had subjects vary their exercises across different weeks suggesting this might also be a viable way to train a muscle with multiple different exercises also these exercises work biomechanically contrasting this is an important Point random exercise variation with little biomechanical rationale probably produces a redundant or sub-optimal stimulus a 2019 Spanish study demonstrates this 19 trained men were assigned to a fixed or variation group both groups trained two upper and lower training sessions per week for eight weeks the fixed group performed the same six upper and six lower body exercises in their sessions the variation group used a phone app can consisting of 80 different exercises to randomly generate what exercises they trained each session each exercise was trained with these variables before and after the study rexus femoris vastus intermedius and vassar's lateralis thickness were measured at around the 50 thigh bone length the data suggest the variation group experience the lower rectus femoris growth why the leg extension is an exercise that develops the rectus femoris highly and the fixed group regularly trained this exercise but the variation group due to the app randomly selecting exercises would have likely trained this exercise at a much lower frequency So Random rotation and fluctuation of exercises isn't necessarily beneficial for regional growth though I do want to emphasize how random exercise variation wasn't tragic for muscle hypertrophy it still built muscle well in these trained individuals some individuals may genuinely enjoy random exercise variation although a practical limitation of this is tracking Progressive overload cannot be easily done here I rarely accept sponsors at the house of hypertrophy as I don't know or trust many companies reaching out but I've been

thank you 2020 Brazilian study by Chavez might be considered an anomaly subjects either train the incline bench press only flat bench press only or a combination of both with these variables after training once a week for eight weeks PEX major growth across three regions tended to be superior for the incline bench press group only so performing biomechanically different chest exercises didn't enhance regional growth rather this data indicates an inclined bench press is solely Superior for overall chest development it's unclear if these results apply to free weights since a Smith machine was used but there are limitations and considerations of this study training frequency and volumes were low in this study the combination group only performed between two to three sets per exercise in a week and maybe higher training volumes change the outcome I'm also skeptical of the study's data the incline group saw a 0.8 to 1 centimeter increase in thickness equating to around a 54 to 62 percent increase which is abnormally massive especially when considering the fact lower frequencies and weekly volumes were used compare this to a 2013 Japanese study which had subjects trained the barbell bench press with these variables for six months using higher volumes and frequencies versus the Chavez study yet hypertrophy was merely comparable to that observed in the Chavez study thus I'm hesitant to put my faith in the findings of the Chavez study one exercise per muscle can certainly be excellent for muscle hypertrophy and I don't think it's necessarily a bad thing if you want to do this as further Evidence a Japanese study compared seated to Langley coals and observe greater hamstrings hypertrophy with seated Legos so simply training seat and leg curls should be awesome for hamstrings development the same research is compared overhead extensions to push downs and observe greater triceps hypertrophy with overhead extensions so simply training overhead extension should be awesome for triceps games but to truly optimize Regional Development Across a muscle a few biomechanically different exercises is likely needed we just saw overhead extensions produced overall more triceps growth than push downs but regional growth differences between different triceps exercises likely exist making them complementary some data indicates dumbbell skull crushes May tend to go the triceps at the middle regions whereas potentially dumbbell overhead extensions develop the upper region slightly more coming soon to the house of hypertrophy we'll be releasing free Ultimate Guide videos on developing each muscle we'll thoroughly explore which set of exercises for a muscle may be ideal for maxing games but we'll also answer the following interesting question if you can only select one exercise per muscle Group which might be the most productive and effective finally I have a free Ultimate Guide to bench pressing ebook that covers these areas feel free to get it in the

    "transcript": "a well-developed chest makes a powerful difference in the appearance of your physique but what range of exercises do you need to maximally develop the chest today we'll be cutting through the noise and confusion that's forever present on the web through dissecting the latest science behind chest hypertrophy regular viewers will know we've had a previous video on chest hypertrophy you don't need to watch that video as the key points will be mentioned here but crucially this video Builds on that and will dive deep into how you can develop all regions of the pecs we'll be mentioning virtually every chest exercise ever from pressing motions at different inclines with different modalities with different grip widths and hand positions and isolation PEC exercises welcome to the house of [Music] hypertrophy technically speaking a few muscles belong to the chest but we're focusing on the largest and most important one for Aesthetics the PS major anatomical analyses commonly consider the PS major to have a clavicular and sternal costal head although quite fascinatingly the sternal costal head has been divided up to as much as seven segments based on one analysis the clavicular head makes up 19% of the Pet's major volume with the remaining 81% attributable to the sternal costal head some Well Control told electromyographic research which actually considered six regions finds they can be functionally separable what this means is it's theoretically possible to preferentially Target different PEC regions this is not Bro Science for Simplicity we'll just consider there to be three regions and I'll refer to them as the upper middle and lower PEC let us now dive into our analysis starting with the middle pcks [Music] as shown in this classic 1997 paper the middle PCS have tremendous leverage for shoulder horizontal flexion with the front dealt behind in this case leverage specifically refers to the muscle's moment arm which is the perpendicular distance between the line of force of the muscle and the center of the joint it moves promising data suggests Leverage is perhaps the most important factor behind how the central nervous system chooses which muscles to activate in an exercise considering this it's unsurprising that well-controlled electromyographic research finds that a significant chunk of the pecs including the middle region is active in shoulder horizontal flexion now we will be mentioning electromyographic research throughout this video it's where researchers use electrodes to record the electrical activity of a muscle regular house of hypertrophy viewers will know it's not Flawless but I believe well-controlled and specific electromyographic studies possess the potential to give us valuable insights the pinned comment and description contains more details about this if you're interested anyhow we also know the middle PCS are stretched the well at the initial position of shoulder horizontal flexion thus shoulder horizontal flexion motions can attain a nice stretch plus High Contracting forces from the middle pecs two things that make exercise excellent for hypertrophy your first thought may be that all fly exercise variations do this indeed this is true however these are isolation exercises they will be dissected later in this video right now we'll focus on horizontal pressing exercises which involve all bench pressing variations including with the barbell dumbbell Smith machine and machine also pushup and seated machine chest presses fit into this category all of these are compound exercises when you're pressing with a moderate to wider grip they tend to involve shoulder horizontal flexion ignoring the lower arm reveals this therefore it's unsurprising that this paper found just flat barbell bench pressing three times a week across 6 months grew the middle PEC by an impressive 37% does this mean the flat barbell bench press is superior no because as detailed in our previous video we have a range of scientific papers that actually suggest all these variations can probably be quite similar to the barbell bench press machine variations have been documented to produce similar pet growth and activity to barbells dumbbells tend to evoke similar PEC activity to barbells and push-ups have even produced similar pet growth to barbell benching now some of you may be wondering about Di Lips This doesn't actually involve shoulder horizontal flexion at least not predominantly but we'll discuss this more in the lower pet section anyway the fact all these exercises are likely similar for pet growth may come as a surprise to some but remember that at the end of the day although subtle differences exist they all fundamentally involve shoulder horizontal flexion provided we're training them hard and getting two or n to failure we're going to be exposing the peex to high tension it is also fascinating to know that scientific literature implies there's a strong strength carryover between all these exercises training with a machine chest press has been shown to significantly increase barbell bench press strength the inverse of this is also true training the Smith machine bench press has also been shown to significantly increased barbell bench mesh strength the inverse of this is also true there's Fair fairly strong correlations between push-up performance and bench press performance as well as dumbbell and barbell benching so you're free to select whichever exercise you prefer although there are actually five considerations you may factor into helping you choose the first consideration relates to push-ups since push-ups replicate a plank position they likely Engage The rectus abdominis more than all the other variations since push-ups also enable scaper protraction they likely engage the seratus anterior better than all the other variations depending on your goals this may make the push-up a better or worse option although progressively overloading the push-up in the long term can be difficult yet despite the popular belief that 8 to 15 reps or some other narrow rep range is ideal for hypertrophy we've mentioned countless times at the house of hypertrophy that reps between 6 to 35 are similarly effective for building muscle provided these reps are performed too or close to failure thus progressing to higher rep push-ups is viable indeed we've had a great paper that found increasing the number of reps you perform with the same load across training sessions produced overall similar muscle hypertrophy to another group that increased load within the same rep range across sessions now there is only so much you can add reps going well beyond 3 five reps may be inferior yet provided you're not super Advanced weighted push-ups are a great option that enables load increases the second consideration relates to dumbbell bench pressing when analyzing them the triceps are likely trained slightly less compared to all other variations the likely reason for this is you can't apply much lateral forces during a dumbbell bench press doing so would just result in the dumbbells falling either side of you this matters as the triceps are in involved in generating lateral forces with all the other variations lateral forces naturally occur whether you know it or not indeed electromyographic data finds reduced triceps activity with a dumbbell compared to a barbell bench press depending on your goals this may make it a better or worse option the third consideration relates to failure and fatigue with the barbell with failure we've seen previously at the house of horty that getting to or close to failure is need to maximize muscle fiber Recruitment and tension two things crucial for maximal growth in fact we have research on the pecs illustrating this this paper had trained individuals trained the Smith machine barbell bench press with a maximal lifting velocity there were four groups one group literally performed one rep per set a second group performed their reps until their rep velocity slowed down by 15% another by 30% and a final Group by 50% petor major hypertrophy what's best with the group that trains closest to failure that is the group whose reps slow down by 50% extrapolating from other research a 50% velocity loss equates to performing 70 to 80% of the maximum number of reps possible on average this study didn't have a condition training to actual failure but as we've seen previously at the house of hypertrophy getting 3 to1 reps from failure seems to produce similar growth to failure so this is the general recommendation here's the thing with a freeweight barbell bench press you're putting yourself in the safest position by having a spotter and or a safety setup that saves you if you fail a repetition if you don't have these the other options may be a safer bet the second Point stems from this fascinating fatigue paper it had trains men either perform the Smith machine dumbbell or barbell bench press chest fatigue swelling and soreness were quite comparable between all these three exercises across 96 hours after training as a side note this is further indirect evidence all these variations impose a similar PE stimulus the triceps fatigue was not too different between groups except the dumbbell group saw lower fatigue and soreness which makes sense as we've just detailed how triceps activity is likely reduced with the dumbbells nonetheless the main point is despite the fact all these fatigue measures were largely similar between the three exercises subject subject recovery what's worse across the 96 hours after training with the barbell versus the Smith machine and dumbbell thus these findings might suggest your own perception of recovery may be a bit worse with the barbell yet I don't believe this is super crucial information fatigue isn't necessarily bad plus your body does produce adaptations across time that reduces the fatigue you experience so it's entirely likely that any fatigue from the barbell variation is in consequential in the majority of circumstances the fourth consideration surrounds machines we've briefly alluded to how there's data comparing machine to barbell pressing and similar PEC hypertrophy was found this might surprise some because there's been speculations that extra stability with machines better enables muscle fiber recruitment however I think stability is critical under extreme ends for example bench pressing on a Swiss ball is probably going to suck for build muscle but the extra stability with machines compared to barbells and dumbbells doesn't seem to transfer to Greater growth plus we have meta analyses which combine the results of numerous studies finding that overall machine exercises largely produce similar growth to barbells and dumbbells now not all machines in the world are identical but provided the machine provid solid resistance at the bottom where the pecs are stretched it should be good some machines can can converge to get a better shortened and contracted position and perhaps provide a solid challenge here dumbbells also involve convergence this is extra shoulder horizontal flexion near that shortened position and this convergence and squeeze can feel nice despite this it probably doesn't enhance growth since the available data suggests tension at that shortened position may not provide extra benefits specifically we have three studies remark ably finding that a partial range of motion at the lengthen position produces overall better hypertrophy than a full range of motion this seems to tell us that that shortened position which is reached with a full range of motion doesn't stimulate extra growth instead we're seeing better growth with more time spent at that lengthened position we also have researched finding isometric training at longer muscle positions produces more growth and shorter muscle positions now more data with other exercises and demographics are certainly needed to validate this General concept and the effectiveness of partials at long lengths but in the absence of other data it seems high tension around the lengthened position is what's more important linked to this is our fifth and final consideration of the section stretch let me first describe some fascinating research and then we fit this into how you might enhance your pet growth besides this data demonstrating that time accumul ated at the lengthened position seems to be more anabolic we have data demonstrating selecting exercises that reach a better stretch could build more muscle for example seated leg holes better stretch out the hamstrings than lying leg holes and have been documented to cause 1.5 times more hamstrings hypertrophy moreover it is seriously intriguing to know that a recent study established performing this intense Peet stretch produced notable pet growth in fact the growth was similar to that obtained to another group of subjects that train the machine chest fly with these variables of course achieving a stretch during weightlifting is far from identical to holding an intense stretch for a prolonged duration and I don't anticipate many people actually want to start holding intense prolonged stretches regardless I think this is further illustration of stretching stimi having positive influence on growth so what could this information mean for PEC training floor presses are variation I've yet to touch on this limits the extent to which you lower and thus lengthen the pecs so are likely sub optimal for growth this doesn't mean no one should ever do them they could have application if your goal is maximum strength or if you're dealing with some kind of injury or discomfort that means you can't train the pecs at a more stretched position anyhow the key point of this stretch talk is we have variations that can help us reach a deeper PEC stretch dumbbells technically permit you to reach a deeper stretch of the pecs thus although we've alluded to electromyographic data showing similar PEC activity between dumbbells and barbells one Pitfall of electromyography is it doesn't measure stretch based forces so it is actually possible out of all the variations we mentioned dumbbells truly could be slightly better although larger dumbbells can make this challenging to achieve and this brings us to two other variations the cambered bar bench press and deficit push-up both of these similarly enable a greater stretch of the PCS thus although we don't have direct research on them currently it's possible these variations could be slightly better for building the pcks to be as scientifically accurate as possible we must not neglect that virtually all the studies on the benefits of training muscles with more stretch has been conducted on previously untrained individuals and last no more than 12 weeks I mentioned this as there have been speculations that the extra growth from training muscles and more stretch positions is a special type of growth that plateaus quickly if true this suggests training at more stretched positions will just produce similar gains to training at more shortened positions after the extra growth plateaus however this is based on limited and indirect data moreover there is some data that suggests there still could be long-term growth benefits to training muscles at more stretched positions but this too is from limited and indirect data for those who are interested in the weeds of this I thoroughly dissect the current science and deliver my thoughts on this topic at this link regardless I still think training muscles at stretched positions in practice is worthwhile even if those extra gains Plateau we still want them moreover the best case scenario is there still long-term gains to be seen from them this doesn't mean no one should ever have training focused at shorter lengths we've seen that although the overall growth is less training at shorter muscle length still stimulates growth so know that you can still certainly grow from it additionally a technical consideration is that with all else equal training at shter muscle positions generates less fatigue than training at longer muscle lengths for example with all else equal floor presses likely generate less fatigue than regular bench pressing in theory this means you can probably train more with exercises at shorter muscle lengths and this extra volume although not time efficient might go some way to closing the muscle growth gap between shorter and longer length training summarizing this section we've seen that a range of horizontal presses are likely all similarly effective for growing the peegs in including the middle pegs thus you have the freedom to select whatever you prefer here are five considerations that may factor into your choice of course it is also not outside the realm of possibility to construct a sensibly varied program that involves more than one of these horizontal pressing variations remember that we'll be dissecting isolation exercises later on but let us now transition to the upper pck well-developed upper pecs can take your physique to the next level we've already described the plethora of horizontal pressing exercises at your disposal for developing the middle pecs but how effective are these for the upper pecs earlier we noted this paper that found flat barbell bench pressing grew the middle PC by 37% what I didn't mention was the researchers also found that upper PEX grew by a very similar 36% another Australian paper found flat bar bench pressing grew the middle PEC by 10% and the upper PEC by not too far off 7.4% Note the percentages are lower in this paper as the subjects were already trained the study was shorter in duration and a slightly different size measurement was taken nevertheless these papers clearly show horizontal pressing will contribute to Growing your upper PEC but does this mean we don't need any dedicated upper Peck work the answer is no let let me explain why in both these papers instead of looking at the growth in percentages if we look at actual centimeter increases the upper PEC actually grew fairly less than the middle PEC how on Earth could this be it's because the upper pecs were smaller in size to begin with a smaller number to begin with but sees the same or similar percentage increase to a larger number still means a smaller total increase in size resultantly it is technically accurate to say flat barbell bench pressing grows the upper PEC less than the middle PEC now this data is from the flat barbell bench press but we know there's reason to believe this applies to all the horizontal pressing exercises on the table indeed machine and even weighted push-up variations have been documented to elicit similar upper Peck activity to the flat barbell bench press consequently to maximize upper pet growth we likely need an exercise to preferentially train the upper pecs how can this be done well-controlled electromyographic research finds that the ratio of upper PEC to Middle Peck activity is better when the force is directed obliquely upward instead of purely horizontally incline bench pressing replicates this at least in so far as pushing in an upward Direction indeed out of the seven studies that have explored this incline bench pressing produced greater upper Peck activity compared to the flat barble bench bench press in five of them it is also notable that the majority finds middle and lower PEC activity is reduced with the incline and front Del activity is higher with the incline there's occasionally debates on the optimal incline angle for targeting the upper PEX what does the current literature say one paper found a 30\u00b0 incline was ideal another found it was a 44\u00b0 incline while we even have data finding similar upper PEC activity between a 30 and 45\u00b0 incline besides the possibility of the limitations with electromyography measures individual differences could be in play people don't have identical muscle architecture or leverages nor do people have an identical bench press setup so the ideal incline angle May differ between people so if you would like to incline bench press and your bench is adjustable feel free to experiment around it's worth noting incline bench pressing can also be done with a Smith machine dumbbells and a cambered bar and we've alluded to how the extra stretch with a lat to might confer some extra growth moreover feet elevated push-ups and certain machine chest presses where you push upwards likely effectively hit the upper PEC although one caveat with feet elevated push-ups is your head tends to limit how much you can lower yourself resulting in a reduced PEC stretch using some boxes or handles to increase depth can go some way to alleviate the shortcoming though so all of these options likely preferentially Target the upper pecs but there are actually some more perhaps under appreciated ways the upper pecs could be targeted out of all the PEC regions the upper pecs have the best leverage for performing shoulder flexion and well-controlled electromag graphic analyses find the upper pecs contribute more to shoulder flexion than the other regions during horizontal presses using a closer grip gets you closer to predominantly performing shoulder flexion this is best achieved when keeping the arms near to the side and not flared out also using a reverse grip on a barbell also forces you into performing shoulder flection regardless of the grip used we might speculate these preferentially Target the upper pecs yet the data is somewhat split since out of the eight papers comparing close to moderate and wider grip bench pressing four of them find upper peack activity is better with a closer grip out of the two papers comparing reverse grip bench pressing to normal grip bench pressing only one finds enhanced upper Peck activity as an additional note the majority of data finds closer grips better recruit the triceps When comparing these variations to an incline bench press with a wider grip we just have this paper that found upper PEC activity was not stat statistically different between a closer grip bench press and an incline with a wider grip although the raw numbers lean toward the closer grip regardless this might be tentative evidence closer grips could be as good for the upper PEX as a standard incline we shouldn't forget that closer grips and reverse grips can even be used with the Smith machine dumbbells and even push-ups so there is a fair number of potential upper Peck options we'll provide some recommendations in a second I say this because we're not quite done it's possible for us to use a closer or reverse grip on an inclined angle could this be the best the only analysis from the literature is this paper that found compared to an incline bench press with a wider grip an incline with a closer and reverse grip produce non-statistically different upper PEC activity although the raw numbers lean towards using closer and reverse grips on the incline however it's worth mentioning this paper was the same one that found flat closer grip bench pressing produced upper Peck activity levels that were not statistically different from the incline with a wider grip anyhow We'll add closer and reverse grips with an incline to our already extensive list the landmine press and L's fend press are two final exercises worth mentioning the landmine press involves pushing in an upward direction that we no likely preferentially targets the upper pecs however the very close hand spacing reduces the overall stretch of the pecs thus I suspect it's not going to be as good as all the other options mentioned but it's certainly not a bad exercise and it will still build muscle so if someone really likes it that can be enough of a reason to train with it as for the Li's fend press it's essentially a Clos grip press with an intense chest squeeze against the plat the size of the plate means the stretch is restricted and since that's only so heavy of a plate you can lift it's going to be difficult to progress this exercise in the long term dumbbells can be used but this still suffers from a restricted stretch the only scenario where I think someone may want to perform this is simply if they find it a fun and enjoyable addition to their training so we know there's a ton of upper Peck options what's the recommendation we've seen there is essentially evidence for all of these variations better targeting the upper PEC and in The Limited data that has compared some of these there are non-significant differences thus for now I'd simply recommend selecting whatever option you like although it is possible what works best could differ between people for example Greg Knuckles from Stronger by science not his upper pecs get outrageously sore from Flat reverse benching whereas this never happens from his incline experience thus you could experiment with any of the variations and evaluate how they subjectively score for you do you perceive more upper Peck with them is the pump and perhaps the next day soreness in the upper PEC greater than usual now it's critical to understand subjective Sensations are not yet validated proxies for actual muscle activation and we also know despite popular belief the intracellular events associated with a pump and soreness do not appear to be strong drivers of hyper y but having said this I believe it's still plausible when controlling as much factors subjective Sensations like the pump and soreness could be indirect insights to the actual tension seen by a muscle region so in the absence of anything else I think it's not the end of the world for you to try and use your subjective perception to help determine what you may train [Music] with earlier we Des described evidence that the different regions of the pecs can function somewhat independently and that includes the lower PEC regions for instance when the arms are nearly overhead performing a shoulder extension contraction preferentially recruits the lower pecs but is dedicated training for the lower pecs essential recall we've seen data demonstrating that flat barbell bench PR highly developed the middle peek region but the upper PEC region in absolute terms grows less as for the lower pecs both both these papers found it grew pretty similarly to the middle peek region both in percentages and centim therefore it appears flat barbell bench pressing is highly effective for the lower pcks I'm presuming this extends to all the other horizontal pressing exercises so dedicated lower PEC training may not be essential whatever horizontal presses you have could cover you of course this does not mean no one should ever perform specific movements for the lower pcks but perhaps you're constructing a program with sensible variation that means an exercise that biases the lower PEX can fit into your program or alternatively if you somehow find your lower PCS are underdeveloped despite training with your choice of horizontal presses then dedicated training for your lower PEX may be called for so how might the lower PEX be preferentially trained the lower PEC fibers run in this direction and it's possible movements that align with this and press downwards could preferentially train the lower PEC area above the other regions such as decline bench pressing machine decline pressing hands elevated push-ups dips and isolation exercises that will cover in the isolation section quite fascinatingly two electrom myographic studies that have compared a 15\u00b0 decline to a flat barbell bench press found lower PEC activity was similar between them in addition to these two papers there there have been a few other electrom myographic papers exploring activity of the other PEC regions between a decline and flat barbell bench press the findings are a little mixed but some of them suggest that upper and middle pecs as well as the front delts display lower activity with the decline therefore although actual lower Peck activity may not be that different between a decline and flat angle since middle and lower pecs display lower activity in some analyses a decline May fundamentally still be considered a valid way to selectively train the lower PEX over the other regions as for the dip it has the capacity to attain a great stretch unfortunately there's no officially published research comparing dips to other common chest exercises I know this paper compared PEC activity between different dips with the ring and normal dips producing decent upper PEC activity not much comparative conclusions can be made from this and they didn't assess the middle or lower pecks besides this all we have is this unofficial electromyographic analysis that found during a weit to dip raw lower activity what better than the upper and middle regions at the end of the day feel free to try out any of these movements your subjective perception May guide your [Music] choice we can say as an overall muscle shoulder horizontal flexion is the motion that best trains it isolate ated shoulder horizontal flexion occurs with flies including cable machine and dumbbell flies before comparing them could these PEC isolation exercises grow the pecs better than the compound exercises we've talked about when comparing isolation to the compound movements there's no movement at their elbow meaning we're taking the triceps out of the equation you might guess this means our central nervous system can better activate our PEX with the isolation exercises and there thereby produce greater PEC hypertrophy versus compound exercises despite being logical the available data does not support this we know that dumbbell flies are most challenging at the lower part and during this phase two papers find peeg activity was comparable to that of the flat barbell bench press although one of the analyses found if we look at average activity across the whole exercise the bench press actually evoked higher peeg activity this was largely because the activity at the top portions was better with the bench press I don't believe this means bench pressing is a superior PEC Builder because we've already detailed how it currently seems extra activity and more shortened and contracted positions doesn't cause extra growth another analysis found both front Del and pec activity was similar between a barbell bench press and machine chest fly as the authors concluded the results clash with the idea that isolation exercises promote greater activ ity of the Prime movers due to isolation due to this I'd say isolation exercises are likely not essential for substantially growing the pecs over the long term compound exercises such as your choice of horizontal pressing and an upper chest biased compound movement is likely going to be sufficient for seeing substantial PEC hypertrophy in the long term does this mean no one should ever perform isolated PEC training not at all it is absolutely possible to constru a sensibly varied program that includes compound and isolation exercises for the pecs as a simple illustration you may have a flat bench press incline bench press and cable fly not entirely disconnected from this perhaps you deem you have sufficient amounts of triceps training in your program but you want to train the PC more without additional triceps stimuli in this case isolated PEC training is the perfect solution finally I also don't want to rule out the possibility of individual differences averages have been detailed throughout this video including the finding that PEC activity is not so different between compound and isolation movements yet it's within the realm of possibility for some people much of the compound exercises detailed in this video regardless of how they perform it just predominantly taxes their triceps and much less dep picks in fact some research albeit having a few notable limitations point to this thus isolated PEC training might be needed for these people to truly stimulate their pecs better with these reasons out the way how can we most effectively isolate the pecs when looking at cable flies starting with the cables in line with the arms these will provide a greater challenge in their shorter muscle positions this isn't terrible muscle growth will still occur from shortened positions also remember with all else equal shorten training likely generates less fatigue accordingly if we want an isolation exercise that generates lower fatigue but will still provide a fair stimulus this variation is an ideal Contender but assuming your recovery is all good we know challenging muscles near a more lengthened position is likely a great idea having a setup with a cable somewhat behind your body better challenges that lengthened position they can also be performed laying down besides this dumbbell flies and machine fly successfully load the pets near that stretched position there are two variations of machine flies there are subtle differences between them but I don't anticipate they are meaningful enough to impact growth some people think this fly better stretches the pecs because the arms are straighter but remember since the pecs attached to the upper arms not the lower arm the degree of armb Bend doesn't really influence the PEC stretch and assuming we're roughly extending the upper arm compr between the two movements the stretch is not going to be too dissimilar so I believe we can be confident all of these variations can be highly effective you might contend since cables and machines additionally provide solid tension near the contracted position that makes them better than the dumbbell variation but as you know we've mentioned a few times here the present literature implies extra tension at the shortened position may not deliver extra growth others might T due to the inherent Freedom with cables and dumbbells an even greater stretch is available for those who can comfortably get there assuming this deeper stretch is beneficial for growth this could indeed give them an Ever slight Edge now there is widespread controversy around the Deep stretch in flies and with wider grip benching being injurious here's my two Sense on this much of these ideas stem from hypotheses and anecdotal observations which suffer from multiple potential Founders the scientific literature at present has low quality and minimal insight into injury risks from various chest movements of course absence of evidence is an Evidence of absence so it would be misleading for me to make any definitive conclusions until we have higher Quality Investigations for now I'd simply recommend performing your exercises in a manner your comfortable with a handy feature with cables is its height adjustability low cable flies involve flying in upwards Direction the direction we know likely preferentially targets the upper PEC resultantly this is yet another option available to better train this region if you're not feeling it with all the previously mentioned compound movements and or you just want to take the triceps out of the equation low cable flies are a solid solution there are also incline machine flies and I believe we can presume they should be highly effective incline dumbbell flies can also be done but an important point is since gravity pulls the dumbbells down and you're at an incline your shoulders are likely going to be working over time to keep the dumbbells out to the side for this reason I suspect these aren't going to be as potent for the upper pecks regarding the lower pecks High cable flies as well as decline dumbbell flies better align the flying Direction with that of the lower PEC fibers so both of these might potentially preferentially hit this region the final isolation exercise we'll discuss are the controversial freeway pullovers specifically there are Fierce debates about if this exercise is a better chest or lat Builder what does the current scientific literature suggest pullovers involve shoulder extension and freee pullovers are virtually exclusively challenging at the top position at this top position The Lads have much lower Leverage compared to lower elevation angles while the middle and lower pecs likely have some leverage for shoulder extension at these higher elevation angles indeed well-controlled electromyographic papers find during isometric shoulder extension contractions at different elevation angles the lats display their lowest activity at the highest elevation angle while the pecs display fairly good activity at this region moreover recordings directly from a barbell pullover find the particularly the middle and lower regions display higher activity than the lats however I'm not completely sold this means the lats are minimally stimulated I detailed why in our Ultimate Guide to lat hypertrophy but I'll mention the key points here although the pecs are stretched in the overhead position the lats are also stretched quite well we have research finding even if a muscle has lower leverage and displays reduced activity the muscle can still will grow well provided it's at a longer length for example the gluteus maximus is lengthened more with deeper squats but they have lower leverage and activity in this position yet we have research comparing 90\u00b0 to 140\u00b0 knee flexion squats and the 140\u00b0 deeper squats grew the gluteus maximus quite a bit more so in total I'd say there's evidence that both the lats and pecs may be trained fairly well with free pullovers now some people report feeling it more in their lats instead of the chest while others report the inverse ultimately what we need and what I'm looking forward to is research directly measuring lat and pet growth after free pullovers I guess it's not implausible that it could differ between people but for now since we have some data suggesting the pecs display Fair activity you could try this exercise out if it appeals to you and examine your perception so we detailed a ton of information and I understand it can be tricky and very challenging to construct your own muscle

it too to ensure this video details every single relevant study relating to PEC hypertrophy there is one final study that needs to be mentioned 47 previously untrained men trained either the incline bench press only flat bench press only or a combination of both with these variables after training once per week for 8 weeks the incline bench press group tended to see the best upper middle and lower PCT less major growth compared to the other groups in other words just training an incline bench press led to the best results with flat bench pressing or even a combination of both leading to inferior results you may be thinking what on Earth doesn't this go against much of what was described in the rest of this video this is indeed true you may also be thinking since this paper Direct measured pet growth we should consider it as high quality evidence this is typically true but upon scrutinizing this paper further there's reason to be skeptical the pet growth seen in this paper was simply outrageous the incline group increased their PEC thickness by 54 to 62% and the other group still saw more than 40% growth for some regions in fact if we scale to average gains per workout we find that PC side has increased by 4.6% each workout imagine that your pecs increasing nearly 5% after each training session and remember this is the average in the study we're not talking about an outlier subject if we compare the average growth in this study to the rest of the research that has measured PEC hypertrophy we can see just how striking the difference is also remember this study just involved eight training sessions while the rest of the research involved an average average of 33 training sessions this only further makes things more perplexing so what gives although this is speculative I believe the strongest explanation is the hypertrophy measurements might just have been faulty 47 subjects completed the study the text implies the researcher should have measured the gains of all 47 subjects but just 30 subjects actually made up the hyper measurements so 17 measurements were missing the researchers did not explain why but it's entirely possible errors were made with these 17 measurements perhaps suggesting the researchers poorly conducted the hyper measurements with the ultrasound Machinery if this is all true there could still be something dubious with a 30 measurements perhaps explaining these abnormally astonishing amounts of hypertrophy in addition to these confusing gains we can't ignore the fact these results conflict with multiple other papers the study did find upper pet growth was better with the incline which is what we'd expect but the fact that incline group grew the middle and lowc more conflicts with the findings of reduced middle and lower activity with an incline we know this is EMG data but there are multiple of them and well-controlled electromyographic data also finds the middle PEX display lower activity when force is directed obliquely upwards compared to horizontally finally we also have this paper that found that the incline bench press produced a lower midp pump to the flat bench press again the intracellular events associated with the pump do not seem to strongly promote hypertrophy but when potential confounders are controlled the pump may be an indirect insight into the tension seen by a muscle region although this paper also found the upper Peck pump was similar between the flat and incline bench press which I'd say is somewhat of an odd finding as well nevertheless for all these reasons I don't believe we can derive recommendations from this [Music] study before summarizing things what about targeting the inner and outer pecs at the time of constructing this video there's no research comparing inner and outer region growth between different PEC exercises so this is why we don't have a section on this however I don't anticipate this is a major problem based on the advice in this video the peex will probably grow well across its length in fact one study alludes to this trained individuals perform the flat and inclined barbell bench press and we've alluded to how this is a perfectly fine and simple combination for pet growth one group actually held a stretch between sets while another rested passively the stretch between sets didn't enhance gains as both groups saw similar growth but the key Point here is the magnitude of growth at the middle and outer portions was pretty much identical the researchers didn't measure the innermost region but I'd be surprised if it didn't grow at least fairly I will say if any future research does come along about the inner and outer regions I'll be sure to update you all until then it's not worth worrying about on to the summary there is no Musto or best PEC exercise rather there's evidence a ton of exercises can be highly effective there's also so no one programming style that's unanimously the best instead there are multiple paths you could take specifically we've seen it likely substantial PEC hypertrophy can be attained purely through training with compound exercises but we know there are reasons for adding isolation PEC exercises when exploring compound exercises horizontal presses are excellent for the pecs and we have research suggesting all these variations can probably be similarly effective although there are five reasons you might consider and one of them is that the deeper PEC stretch from dumbbells a cambered bar and deficit push-ups might make them slightly better the current literature seems to imply these horizontal presses likely grow the middle and lower pecs very well but the upper PEX somewhat less to train the upper PEX more all of these are potentially great options in the limited data comparing some of these there are nonsignificant differences in Upper Peck activity and as for the lower PCS although dedicated training for this region is probably not essential here are potential options available to you if you would like to train this region more finally here are isolation PEC options on the table and we described how all of these are potentially largely similarly effective if you're after isolation options to better Target the upper PEC these are some great potential options and if you're after isolation options to better Target the lower PEX these are some great potential options thank you for watching feel free to check out the alpha progression app or our recent deep dive into building the LS"

    "transcript": "Should you train a muscle with a\u00a0\nhigher frequency to consistently\u00a0\u00a0 spike muscle protein synthesis and\u00a0\nthereby keep yourself more anabolic. Using the current science, we'll assess this. First and foremost though, what\u00a0\nis muscle protein synthesis\u00a0\u00a0 and why is keeping it elevated\u00a0\nimportant for muscle hypertrophy? Within your muscles, muscle protein synthesis\u00a0\nand muscle protein breakdown are always ongoing. Muscle protein synthesis is the\u00a0\ncreation of new muscle proteins,\u00a0\u00a0 while muscle protein breakdown is\u00a0\nthe degrading of muscle proteins. Bob the builder and Thanos can\u00a0\nhelp us understand this further. Imagine we have a wall. Bob the builder\u00a0\nis laying new bricks to the wall. Thanos, on the other hand, is destroying bricks. In this analogy, the wall is the muscle,\u00a0\u00a0 and bob the builder is carrying out muscle\u00a0\nprotein synthesis (he is adding new bricks),\u00a0\u00a0 while Thanos is carrying our muscle\u00a0\nprotein breakdown (he's destroying bricks). When bob the builder and Thanos are adding and\u00a0\nremoving bricks respectively at the same rate,\u00a0\u00a0 the wall remains the same size. In correct terms, when muscle protein\u00a0\nsynthesis is equivalent to the amount\u00a0\u00a0 of muscle protein breakdown, the\u00a0\nmuscle remains the same size. When bob the builder adds bricks\u00a0\nfaster than Thanos can destroy them,\u00a0\u00a0 the wall increases in size. That is,\u00a0\u00a0 when muscle protein synthesis exceeds the rate of\u00a0\nmuscle protein breakdown, muscle size increases. Finally, when Thanos destroys bricks faster than\u00a0\nbob the builder can add bricks, the wall decreases\u00a0\u00a0 in size. That is, when muscle protein breakdown\u00a0\nexceeds the rate of muscle protein synthesis,\u00a0\u00a0 muscle size decreases. This unfortunately\u00a0\noccurs in aging inactive individuals. A resistance training session evokes\u00a0\nan increase in muscle protein synthesis\u00a0\u00a0 and shifts the balance to muscle protein\u00a0\nsynthesis exceeding muscle protein breakdown. But how much does muscle protein synthesis rise\u00a0\nand last after a resistance training session? A review study by Damas et al. combined\u00a0\nthe current data investigating this,\u00a0\u00a0 and established training\u00a0\nexperience seems to matter. For trained individuals, muscle protein\u00a0\nsynthesis peaks a few hours after a session,\u00a0\u00a0 and by 10 hours the levels have rapidly fallen. Untrained individuals peak in muscle protein\u00a0\nsynthesis elevations close to 20 hours after\u00a0\u00a0 a session, have a greater area under the\u00a0\ncurve compared to trained individuals\u00a0\u00a0 (meaning greater muscle protein\u00a0\nsynthesis elevations overall),\u00a0\u00a0 and they also still display fairly decent\u00a0\nelevations 40-50 hours after the session. All this makes sense, untrained\u00a0\nindividuals have greater muscle\u00a0\u00a0 growth capacity than trained individuals,\u00a0\u00a0 resistance training is more novel for untrained\u00a0\nfolks and is going to disrupt their systems more. Nevertheless, based on this data, trained\u00a0\nindividuals might want to train a muscle\u00a0\u00a0 every other day, while untrained individuals\u00a0\nmay want to train a muscle every 3rd day. Doing so would ensure muscle protein\u00a0\nsynthesis is consistently elevated. What we've just done, examining the timecourse\u00a0\nof muscle protein synthesis and deriving\u00a0\u00a0 training frequency recommendations, is\u00a0\ncommonly what others do to support the\u00a0\u00a0 idea of training a muscle more frequently\u00a0\n(that is, training a muscle every other\u00a0\u00a0 day for trained individuals or training\u00a0\nevery 3rd day for untrained individuals). But, there are a couple of\u00a0\nproblems with all of this. Firstly, the data formulating the timecourse of\u00a0\nmuscle protein synthesis elevations for trained\u00a0\u00a0 and untrained individuals comes from studies\u00a0\nlooking at mixed muscle protein synthesis. Mixed muscle protein synthesis includes\u00a0\nall the proteins within muscle fibers,\u00a0\u00a0 much of these proteins are not\u00a0\ninvolved in muscle hypertrophy. We care about myofibrillar proteins,\u00a0\u00a0 the contractile proteins within muscle fibers\u00a0\nthat produce muscle force. It's an increase in\u00a0\u00a0 the number of contractile proteins that\u00a0\nconventionally signifies hypertrophy. Returning to the Bob the\u00a0\nbuilder and Thanos analogy,\u00a0\u00a0 it's most accurate to say when\u00a0\nmyofibrillar protein synthesis\u00a0\u00a0 exceeds myofibrillar protein breakdown,\u00a0\nwe then get an increase in muscle size. Here's the thing, myofibrillar protein synthesis\u00a0\u00a0 and mixed muscle protein synthesis\u00a0\ndo not correlate with each other. Demonstrating this, Burd et al. had\u00a0\nsubjects perform the leg extension for\u00a0\u00a0 4 sets of repetitions to failure with\u00a0\neither a 90% or 30% one-rep max load.\u00a0\u00a0 24 hours after this, mixed muscle\u00a0\nprotein synthesis levels were unchanged,\u00a0\u00a0 but myofibrillar protein synthesis\u00a0\nlevels were significantly elevated. Therefore, it makes no sense to\u00a0\nuse mixed muscle protein synthesis\u00a0\u00a0 data to derive training frequency recommendations. This begs the question: what does the myofibrillar\u00a0\u00a0 protein synthesis response look like\u00a0\nafter a resistance training session? The Damas et al. review study combined two studies\u00a0\nand established this graph. The time course of\u00a0\u00a0 myofibrillar protein synthesis elevations were\u00a0\nsimilar between trained and untrained individuals\u00a0\u00a0 (it peaked 5hrs after training), but the magnitude\u00a0\nof elevation was lower in trained individuals. For both trained and untrained folks,\u00a0\u00a0 myofibrillar protein synthesis was\u00a0\nstill elevated 16 hours after training. Unfortunately, neither of\u00a0\nthe two studies involved in\u00a0\u00a0 this graph established when myofibrillar\u00a0\nprotein synthesis returned to baseline. Does any other data help us out? Before trying to answer this, there\u00a0\nis yet another problem on our hands. Myofibrillar protein synthesis elevations are also\u00a0\nimpacted by the amount of muscle damage present. A different study by Damas et al. found\u00a0\nacross 10 weeks of resistance training,\u00a0\u00a0 much of the myofibrillar protein synthesis\u00a0\nelevations in the initial training sessions\u00a0\u00a0 were likely directed mainly towards repairing\u00a0\nmuscle damage and not building muscle. However, as muscle damage levels gradually\u00a0\ndecrease as the training weeks go by\u00a0\u00a0 (this is thanks to the body producing adaptations\u00a0\nthat make you resilient to muscle damage), the\u00a0\u00a0 myofibrillar protein synthesis elevations after\u00a0\ntraining was correlated with muscle hypertrophy. To rephrase all of this, when\u00a0\nmuscle damage levels are very high\u00a0\u00a0 (as they would be when you first expose yourself\u00a0\nto a novel training stimulus), much of the\u00a0\u00a0 myofibrillar protein synthesis elevations are\u00a0\ndirected to repairing damage, not building muscle. But when muscle damage levels\u00a0\nare low or non-existent,\u00a0\u00a0 then myofibrillar protein synthesis\u00a0\nelevations correlate with muscle hypertrophy. What this means is if we want\u00a0\nto establish the time course of\u00a0\u00a0 myofibrillar protein synthesis elevations\u00a0\nthat are directed towards building muscle,\u00a0\u00a0 we're going to want to look at data that has\u00a0\nensured muscle damage is low or non-existent. Two papers have technically done this. The aforementioned Damas et al. study found after\u00a0\na training session in the 10th week of training\u00a0\u00a0 (a time point at which muscle damage was low),\u00a0\u00a0 myofibrillar protein synthesis was still\u00a0\nelevated 48 hours after the session.\u00a0\u00a0 The researchers unfortunately did not\u00a0\ntake any more measures after 48 hours. Another study by Miller et al. had subjects\u00a0\nperform one-legged kicking on specialized\u00a0\u00a0 equipment for one hour at 67%\u00a0\nof their maximum workload. This protocol caused no signs of muscle damage,\u00a0\u00a0 probably because I think it was\u00a0\npurely concentric resisted training. Myofibrillar protein synthesis was still\u00a0\nelevated 72 hours after the session.\u00a0\u00a0 Unfortunately, no further measures\u00a0\nwere taken after 72 hours. Therefore, from this limited data,\u00a0\nmyofibrillar protein synthesis (when\u00a0\u00a0 corrected for muscle damage) seems to last\u00a0\nat least up to 48-72 hours after training. On the whole though, it's clear to see it's more\u00a0\nor less impossible to derive training frequency\u00a0\u00a0 recommendations from the current research\u00a0\nexamining myofibrillar protein synthesis. We've been assuming you'd want to wait\u00a0\nuntil muscle protein synthesis has subsided\u00a0\u00a0 to low levels until we train a muscle again and\u00a0\nrestimulate muscle protein synthesis elevations. But it's entirely possible there's nothing wrong\u00a0\u00a0 with training a muscle again when its\u00a0\nprotein synthesis levels are elevated. There's no data (to my knowledge)\u00a0\ndemonstrating this is detrimental,\u00a0\u00a0 but I should also note there are no data\u00a0\nto my knowledge showing this is viable. Future research would need\u00a0\nto examine this further. Throughout this video, we've\u00a0\nalso been ignoring the impact\u00a0\u00a0 of the number of sets you perform for a muscle. The number of sets you perform for a muscle\u00a0\nin a session likely impacts the magnitude\u00a0\u00a0 of myofibrillar protein synthesis\u00a0\nelevation, and this could potentially\u00a0\u00a0 render the idea of frequently stimulating\u00a0\nmyofibrillar protein synthesis unimportant. For example, say you perform\u00a0\n9 weekly sets for your biceps. You could perform these sets across 3 days a week,\u00a0\u00a0 with each session involving 3 sets.\u00a0\nPresumably this creates a fairly\u00a0\u00a0 consistent elevation of biceps muscle\u00a0\nprotein synthesis throughout the week. However, you could perform all\u00a0\n9 sets in a single session,\u00a0\u00a0 creating one large biceps\u00a0\nmuscle protein synthesis spike. When comparing these two scenarios, perhaps\u00a0\nthe overall amount of muscle protein synthesis\u00a0\u00a0 (technically called the area\u00a0\nunder the curve) is the same,\u00a0\u00a0 meaning both methods produce similar hypertrophy. This is a possibility. But unfortunately there\u2019s\u00a0\nlimited data that can verify or falsify this. The idea training a muscle more frequently can\u00a0\nproduce more hypertrophy via more consistent\u00a0\u00a0 muscle protein synthesis elevations is\u00a0\nnot truly supported by current data. This doesn't mean training more frequently\u00a0\nprovides no muscle growth benefit.\u00a0\u00a0 It\u2019s possible future research indicates\u00a0\nmyofibrillar protein synthesis elevations\u00a0\u00a0 (once adjusted for muscle damage) are overall\u00a0\ngreater when training a muscle more frequently. Using our previous example comparing performing\u00a0\n9 sets in one session to performing 3 sets\u00a0\u00a0 across 3 days, maybe there could be a\u00a0\nlimit to the amount of muscle protein\u00a0\u00a0 synthesis that can be stimulated per session. For example, 9 sets might be too much\u00a0\nand past a certain threshold per session,\u00a0\u00a0 meaning some of the sets you\u00a0\nperform are essentially \u201cjunk\u201d Therefore, net weekly muscle\u00a0\nprotein synthesis will be greater\u00a0\u00a0 by distributing this volume across more\u00a0\ndays per week. You avoid \u201cwasted sets\u201d. Regardless, the main point of this\u00a0\nvideo is it's clear the current muscle\u00a0\u00a0 protein synthesis data is insufficient to\u00a0\nderive training frequency recommendations. Opposed to the muscle protein synthesis\u00a0\ndata, it\u2019s much better to explore the\u00a0\u00a0 actual research comparing muscle growth after\u00a0\nsubjects train with different frequencies. We\u2019ll be diving into this literature\u00a0\nnext video to figure out if there\u2019s an\u00a0\u00a0 optimal training frequency for muscle hypertrophy."

will be intertwined in our search for what stimulates hypertrophy searches to burn pump soreness Blood Flow Restriction Training eccentrics acute spikes in anabolic hormones the effects of antioxidants like vitamin c and e High ribs low ribs failure training and range of motion [Music] distance training throughout history from ancient India we have accounts of a piece of exercise equipment noted in writings thought to be compiled between the 3rd Century BC and 3rd Century CE ancient Chinese artwork from a time period I don't know shows weightlifting activities from ancient Egypt we have these tomb paintings from around 2000 to 3500 BC depicting individuals lifting weights moreover ancient Egyptians knew in 1700 BC from poliomyelitis that not moving at all produced a decrease in muscle size but it is only in the last 50 to 70 years that deeper insights into the stimuli behinds muscle hypertrophy have been discovered thanks to the rise of scientific research by the end of the video I'm confident you'll have a thorough understanding of what the current scientific research says on the stimuli behind muscle hypertrophy before diving in I want to mention that in the upcoming year I'll be releasing free Ultimate Guide videos on developing each major muscle group right here on YouTube my aim for them is to be comprehensive and in depth like no other before these videos its first extremely helpful for us to know what precisely stimulates hypertrophy as this will strongly relate to exercise selection recommendations in the description and pinned comment there will be in-depth timestamps to the parts and subparts of this video Let's Dive In we'll go into serious depth on what mechanical tension precisely is later but for now think of it as the tension generated by a muscle's fibers does this fiber tension stimulate an increase in fiber size and subsequently whole muscle size intuitively it would as if we substantially reduce the tension produced by muscle fibers like done during immobilization or when in Space the whole muscle decreases in size as early as the 1970s researchers hypothesize both active and passive tension are stimulators of hypertrophy active tension is the actual contractile Force produced by the muscle fibers while passive tension is the force produced when the fibers and whole muscle are stretched there were four types of studies linking active and passive tension to hypertrophy throughout the 1970s to 1990s all of these studies were conducted on animals and I want to preface this by saying I'm personally opposed to unnecessary animal studies but as much as it's unfortunate to see the following Studies have all been pivotal in understanding muscle hypertrophy the first type was studies that cut the tendon of usually the gastrocnemius meaning this muscle could no longer carry out plantar flexion this resulted in the supporting soleus muscle being overloaded and exposed to Greater active tension during normal movement in response to this the studies consistently find the Soleus experience substantial hypertrophy therefore linking increased active tension to hypertrophy the second type of study had a limb immobilized while the muscle was placed in a stretched or shortened position these experiments find muscle size decreases a lot less when the muscle is immobilized at a stretched versus shortened position therefore indirectly linking passive tension to being anabolic the third type of study involved attaching weights to a wing of chickens to produce continuous stretching of their muscles doing so results in hypertrophy of the stretched muscles finally the fourth type of study was virtually the same as the third except it used a spring-loaded aluminum bar to stretch the muscles of chickens doing so again results in hypertrophy of the muscle but if we carefully think about these four types of studies and this was discussed in future research none of them truly proved tension per se is stimulating hypertrophy could it not be the events before active tension like the electrical signals metabolite accumulation or even damage that is truly stimulating the hypertrophy in these studies we'll thoroughly explore metabolite accumulation and damage soon but the research in the last 20 years provides us with solid grounds to believe it is truly tension per se stimulating hypertrophy a 2019 Danish study found that when inhibiting the active Force generation from muscle fibers but still allowing electrical signal input to them activation of a key protein complex that signals muscle growth failed to occur it was only when active Force generation from muscle fibers was enabled did activation of the key protein complex happen this suggests it is the active force from fibers that stimulates hypertrophy Norther electrical signals the same researchers also established that when equating Peak tension between eccentric contractions which involved active and passive tension and pure passive stretching which would not involve active tension only passive tension activation of the key protein complex was the same so this is evidence that its total tension regardless of whether it's active or passive that stimulates hypertrophy another 2008 study out of the USA found that when keeping electrical input to a muscle constant positioning the muscle at a length that allowed it to generate higher active forces resulted in greater activation of a key protein involved in signaling hypertrophy so this study again demonstrates how it may indeed be tensioned per se that stimulates hypertrophy a 2001 Canadian study found a linear relationship between Peak tension and activation of a key protein involved in signaling hypertrophy finally in the last 20 years or so researchers gradually accumulating on how precisely these forces can activate key proteins involved in hypertrophy it turns out that within and around muscle fibers are mechanosensors that can detect active and or passive tension and then convert the tension into a signaling pathway that stimulates muscle hypertrophy all of the key proteins explored in the previously mentioned studies are involved in the signaling Pathways we'll explore what these potential mechanosensors could be soon but this overall evidence for further strengthens the idea that tension per se is what stimulates hypertrophy in humans papers suggest that protocols that presumably involve higher mechanical tension results in Greater muscle growth signaling and long-term muscle hypertrophy moreover in human studies that presumably equate mechanical tension between different protocols muscle growth signaling and long-term muscle hypertrophy tend to be the same so its clear solid research suggests mechanical tension is a powerful stimulator of muscle hypertrophy but are there any other stimuli I've previously had a shorter video on metabolic stress and hypertrophy although we'll mention things noted in that video we will go into greater depth here with extra topics metabolic stress refers to the buildup of molecules produced by reactions related to energy production within muscle fibers these molecules are called metabolites and famous examples include lactate and reactive oxygen species the accumulation of multiple metabolites is associated with pain and burning Sensations during training so it's certainly logical to feel these pain and burning Sensations must surely be related to hypertrophy moreover the accumulation of metabolites is closely tied to the pump which is a temporary increase in muscle size so it's certainly logical to think this plays a role in promoting long-term true hypertrophy the oldest research I could find exploring the role of metabolites in hypertrophy comes from 1995. one of the papers found that concentric only training produce similar quadriceps hypertrophy to Eccentric only training concentric only training is known to produce much higher metabolic stress than eccentric only training so the authors hypothesized metabolic stress was heavily involved in producing the muscle growth seen by concentric only training while perhaps mechanical tension or even damage caused the growth with eccentric only training the second study by the same research team found holding continuous isometric contractions produced greater quadriceps hypertrophy than holding intermittent isometric contractions The Continuous isometric contractions produce measurably more metabolic stress leading the researchers to hypothesize it was the metabolic stress causing the greater hypertrophy with continuous isometric contractions however both of these classic studies didn't truly isolate metabolic stress and prove it was stimulating hypertrophy concentric only training still involves High mechanical tension and the continuous isometric contractions due to the training variables used in the study would have likely generated more mechanical tension than the intermittent contractions the authors did allude to this limitation in the paper moving forward to the early 2000s emerging research demonstrated that Blood Flow Restriction Training with very light loads can be highly effective for producing muscle hypertrophy nowadays despite some believing Blood Flow Restriction Training is useless or others believing it is superior to normal training the research consistently finds Blood Flow Restriction Training with light lows is as effective as heavy load training for building muscle in case you're unaware Blood Flow Restriction Training is where a cough applies pressure to the upper part of a limb completely restricting blood flow from the muscle to the heart and partially restricting blood flow from the heart to the muscle as a fun fact Blood Flow Restriction Training originated in 1960s Japan by yoshiakisato yoshiaki SATA was at a Buddhist Memorial where during mass his leg became numb due to sitting straight back while kneeling on the floor he noticed his calves had pumped up and he said it was a similar sensation to what he felt during intense calf raise exercises this experience paved the way for Salto to experiment over the ensuing years and develop katsu training which is what he called The Blood Flow Restriction Training back to our discussion performing High rep's net failure with Blood Flow Restriction will result in significant metabolic stress and some speculate it this metabolic stress causing the hypertrophy produced by Blood Flow Restriction Training they believe mechanical tension must be low since Blood Flow Restriction Training involves using very light loads however as detailed in this great 2017 USA review study this is based on an incorrect view of mechanical tension getting their failure with light loads including Blood Flow Restriction Training will absolutely create high overall mechanical tension the metabolic stress with Blood Flow Restriction Training might just be a byproduct of the effort required to get Nair failure to create this tension not the cause of hypertrophy again we'll go into depth on what mechanical tension is a little later for the time being just know it seems incredibly likely Blood Flow Restriction Training would produce muscle growth through mechanical tension having said this there have been three studies finding Blood Flow Restriction Training produced preferential growth of slow twitch muscle fibers over fast switch muscle fibers fast twitch muscle fibers have greater growth potential and numerous studies indicate normal training results in more fast versus slow touch fiber growth and so some speculate the preferential slow twitch fiber growth by Blood Flow Restriction Training cannot be related to Mechanical tension and might be due to some metabolic stress mechanism but I'm very skeptical this is true two of the three studies involve blood flow shoots and training with a very high training frequency one involved Blood Flow Restriction Training for seven consecutive days while the other involved training for 5 days in a week the problem is Central fatigue can be present days after training especially when muscle damage is high despite previous speculations that Blood Flow Restriction Training produces minimal muscle damage we now know there's research indicating performing reps 2 or net failure with Blood Flow Restriction when you're unaccustomed to it which applies to both studies produce a substantial muscle damage the issue of training while Central fatigue is present is you have a lowered ability to recruit those fast twitch muscle fibers thus the preferential growth of the slow twitch fibers in those two studies may not be because slow twitch fiber growth was enhanced via some metabolic stress related mechanism rather it might be because fast twitch fiber growth was compromised due to training sessions being performed with Central fatigue what about that third study finding preferential slow twitch fiber growth with Blood Flow Restriction Training it had untrained subjects train Blood Flow Restriction with reps to failure three times per week for six weeks given the subjects were untrained Central fatigue may still have been present in a lot of their training sessions so again perhaps their findings reflect compromised fast twitch fiber growth furthermore another 2021 Australian paper found that in well-trained individuals training a range of lower body exercises with Blood Flow Restriction three times per week for nine weeks preferential slow twitch muscle fiber growth did not occur so does all of this really mean metabolic stress plays no role in hypertrophy in 2013 Brad schoenfels from New York published a comprehensive review of the potential paths by which metabolic stress could promote muscle growth five paths were noted the first is metabolic stress and fatigue directly necessitates more muscle fibers getting recruited and therefore exposed attention the second is training that produces High metabolic stress is associated with temporary elevations in anabolic hormones like growth hormone igf-1 and testosterone and this might promote hypertrophy the third is that high metabolic stress could increase myokines that promote hypertrophy like interleukin-6 and decrease myokines that limit muscle growth like myostatin the fourth is that reactive oxygen species in metabolite could play a role in promoting muscle growth the fifth and final one is that metabolic stress is closely associated with a pump as we already know the pump is swelling of muscle fibers and this swelling might actually activate certain osmoreceptors that go on to promote growth yet all of these five paths have notable problems with the first one about metabolic stress resulting in more muscle fibers getting exposed attention it still indicates its tension per se not metabolic stress directly that stimulates hypertrophy with the second one we nowadays have several studies consistently finding temporary elevations in anabolic hormones from training are not associated with long-term muscle hypertrophy the increase in these anabolic hormones may be simply a result of energy usage and be unrelated to signaling hypertrophy with myokines the evidence is simply inconsistent on whether metabolic stress truly increases growth promoting myokines like interleukin-6 and decreases myokines that limit muscle growth like myostatin with the fourth and fifth ones there exists alternative evidence suggesting reactive oxygen species and fiber swelling may not promote hypertrophy further areas of scientific research question the power of metabolic stress to produce hypertrophy 400 meter running and sprint cycling can produce comparable lactate in metabolite increases to weight training yet these things do not promote hypertrophy anywhere near as effectively as weight training long term a 2021 Brazil study had subject showing leg extensions with these variables one condition rested passively between sets while another condition restricted their leg with a cough during the rest intervals which led to Greater overall lactate elevations versus the first condition if lactate has additive effects on hypertrophy this second condition should seem more hypertrophy yet quadriceps growth ended up being similar between both conditions after eight weeks of training two other papers had two conditions one condition involves subjects training normally with sets of reps to failure the second condition also involves subjects training with sets of reps to failure but once completing this they had the train to limb blood flow restricted with a cuff for three to five minutes this Blood Flow Restriction wrap the metabolites in the muscle and if metabolites were additive for hypertrophy this condition should see more hypertrophy yet after eight weeks both studies found muscle growth was not enhanced when applying the Blood Flow Restriction after training one of the papers actually found it reduced muscle growth in the women's subjects so crystallizing this section there's no strong evidence metabolic stress is a potent driver of muscle growth and it doesn't appear to have additive effects on hypertrophy [Music] I've also previously had a shorter video on muscle damage and hypertrophy although we'll mention things noted in that video we will again go into greater depth here with extra topics substantial muscle damage occurs in the following days after performing intense exercise you're unaccustomed to delayed onset muscle soreness is considered to be a symptom of muscle damage in a scientific literature and it's common for individuals to believe soreness is a strong indicator you've stimulated a muscle well interestingly it isn't entirely clear if muscle damage is truly what independently causes delayed onset muscle soreness there are many candidates on what causes soreness and a lot more research is required before we can be certain of the relationship between damage and soreness besides soreness it's frequently believed in muscle growth directly occurs because exercising creates micro tears in the muscle your body responds by healing the micro tears and making the muscle bigger these two videos with a combined in their 40 million views both put forth this idea but what does the literature say on the role of damage in muscle hypertrophy it appears the hypothesis that damage could stimulate hypertrophy comes from research in the 1990s it was noted that eccentric only training produces significant muscle damage but also notable muscle hypertrophy so it was speculated damage could cause hypertrophy it was also widely believed during these years and in the subsequent years their eccentric only training is superior to concentric only training for overall muscle hypertrophy concentric only training produces much less damage nowadays the evidence is very much mixed there are actually more studies than not finding similar overall hypertrophy between eccentric and concentric only training furthermore it's essential to recognize eccentric training absolutely involves High mechanical tension as eccentric only training involves contraction and stretch at the same time both active and passive tension will occur to high amounts some research directly links to overall tension produced during eccentric contractions to muscle hypertrophy signaling thus its entirely plausible eccentric only training is stimulating hypertrophy via tension itself and damage is just a byproduct but does this really mean muscle damage plays no role in hypertrophy in 2012 Brad schoenfeld from New York the same researcher who performed a comprehensive review on metabolic stress a year later published a comprehensive review on muscle damage and hypertrophy four parts were noted between damage and gains the first is that damage results in an inflammation response and various inflammatory cells have been linked to muscle hypertrophy the second relates to satellite cells this one requires a little bit of explaining but it's highly interesting muscle fibers have nuclei called myonuclei and the myonuclei are crucial for directing the formation of the proteins that ultimately make muscle fibers bigger each myonuclei is believed to oversee a certain amount of space within muscle fibers term the myonuclei domain but there is a limit to the amount it can oversee call The myonuclei Domain ceiling as a muscle fiber increases in size the myonuclei domain increases until it hits its ceiling limiting further muscle fiber growth from here additional myonuclei would be needed to enable further fiber growth this is where satellite cells come in they are found surrounding muscle fibers and Confused to muscle fibers and donate nuclei resulting in an increase in my nuclei which increases the muscle fiber growth capacity this is where damage comes into play muscle damage appears to cause a significant increase in Satellite Cell Activation so perhaps damage can ultimately increase the number of myonuclei muscle fibers have thereby meaning greater muscle fiber growth potential the third path is that damage May potentiate igf-1 production and igf-1 is involved in signaling hypertrophy the fourth and final one is that damage causes muscle fiber swelling note this swelling isn't the pump that occurs during training rather it's swelling in the fiber days after training due to damage but the mechanisms by which the swelling could create hypertrophy are hypothesized to be the same that is the swelling activates osmo receptors that go on to promote hypertrophy yet all four of these paths have notable problems there is conflicting evidence on the role of inflammatory cells in hypertrophy the events by which inflammatory cells are thought to contribute to hypertrophy May indeed occur in the absence of damage with satellite cells training that does not produce muscle damage can still cause significant satellite Cell Activation in fact aerobic training can activate satellite cells in data indicating muscle damage May potentiate satellite Cell Activation this may potentially be related to repairing the muscle fiber and connective tissue damage nor increasing the number of myonuclei in fibers as for igf-1 production not all Studies have actually found damage is associated with greater igf-1 production and as discussed in the metabolic stress section several studies indicate temporary increases in anabolic hormones with training do not correlate with long-term hypertrophy finally with muscle fiber swelling also as discussed in the metabolic stress section alternative data exists implying swelling may not be causative of hypertrophy other lines of scientific research further question the importance of muscle damage for stimulating hypertrophy a 2011 USA study assigned 14 untrained men into a pre-trained or naive group The naive group performed eccentric exercise on a leg cycle ergometer for 20 straight minutes at a somewhat hard exertion level measured using a subjective scale three times per week for 8 weeks the pre-trained group did the same thing but they had a three-week ramp up phase before their eight weeks where they gradually acclimatize themselves to the training program should due to this acclimatization phase they ended up experiencing little amounts of damage and saunas across the training weeks whereas the naive group experienced much higher damage and soreness levels across the training weeks yet hypertrophy of the quadriceps ended up being comparable between both groups another 2016 study from Brazil found after untrained individuals performed a single training session myofibular protein synthesis expectedly increased fascinatingly however this increase in myofibular protein synthesis did not correlate with muscle hypertrophy rather it seems it was directed towards repairing the damage induced by that single training session as the same subjects continue training for some weeks which resulted in them experiencing less and less damage as your body produces adaptations that make you resilient to muscle damage it was only then the myofibular protein synthesis increase after training sessions correlated with muscle hypertrophy rephrasing all this this data suggests after an initial workout that produces High muscle damage the myofibular protein synthesis increase afterward is largely directed towards repairing the damage not increasing muscle size but after a few weeks of consistent training which allows the body to produce adaptations that reduce the damage experienced then the myofibular protein synthesis response is strongly directed towards increasing muscle size various lines of evidence suggest excessive muscle damage may also be counterproductive for hypertrophy for example a 1999 USA study had men trained eccentric bicep curls with these variables and found signs of damage and swelling persisted for seven days after the session but once it subsided muscle volume actually decreased to 10 percent of what it was before training and it remained at the smaller size for numerous further weeks this might be because excessive muscle damage causes partial or total Destruction of subpopulations of muscle fibers Marathon running has also been documented to cause significant muscle damage yet some data finds Marathon running decreases muscle fiber sizes furthermore if muscle damage had additive effects on hypertrophy we would expect using trading variables that enhance damage to produce more growth but this isn't the case higher repetitions likely cause more muscle damage but we know they are similarly effective to lower Reps for hypertrophy short rest between sets like likely cause more muscle damage but short rest between sets of exercises recruiting large amounts of muscle masses actually sub-optimal for hypertrophy finally some individuals have speculated damage and soreness may be involved in hypertrophy based on research and antioxidant supplementation that includes things like vitamin c and e some studies but not all find that antioxidant supplementation reduces damage and soreness after training and there are some studies but not all again finding antioxidant supplementation reduces muscle growth in the long term thus some presume this is fair evidence showing damage and soreness plays a role in hypertrophy yet this data simply isn't sufficient to prove it is directly lower damage and soreness causing the lower hypertrophy some other Factor could be involved in fact it's very possible antioxidant supplementation reduces the increase in capillaries that comes with lifting weights and this matters as these capillary increases with training seem to be important for sustaining muscle growth long term therefore the potential reduced muscle growth with antioxidant supplementation might not be due to reduction in damage or soreness but instead may be a reduction in capillary adaptations that usually come along with training but also remember that I noted not all Studies have actually found antioxidant supplementation reduces damage soreness or long-term muscle growth so crystallizing this section there's no strong evidence muscle damage is a potent driver of muscle growth and it doesn't appear to have additive effects on hypertrophy foreign [Music] outlined so far it appears mechanical tension is probably the primary hypertrophy stimulus there simply isn't compelling evidence that metabolic stress and muscle damage are powerful drivers of hypertrophy let us now dive deeper into what mechanical tension precisely is as this can likely help us understand why certain training produces the results it does I've come up with five depth levels to explain mechanical tension from the simplest to the most in-depth descriptions at the first level the most simplest description is that muscle tension stimulates hypertrophy going deeper into the second level we know muscles contain muscle fibers it's the tension generated by muscle fibers that can be detected by mechanosensors which are present in and around muscle fibers once these mechanosensors detect this tension they convert it into a signaling Cascade that results in the formation of the proteins that make muscle fibers larger going deeper into the third level how precisely do muscle fibers generate great force and what are the mechano sensors that detect this Force fibers can produce Force actively or passively through their Force generating units called sarcomas active forces occur when the myosin heads extend out from the myosin filament and attach and pull on actin filaments towards the M line passive forces occur when Titan which is actually the largest protein discovered in the human body stretches though it's worth noting that extracellular Matrix which surrounds the muscle fiber can also produce passive forces when stretched mechanosensing candidates that can detect these forces include Costa mere related complexes that actually link the sarcomere to The extracellular Matrix filament which is a protein located at the Z discs of sarcomas Titan itself as it potentially has parts that can sense tension the myonuclei of the fibers and stretch activated ion channels interestingly the mechanosensors that detect either active or passive forces could be different the cost of Mir related complexes and filament might only detect active forces while Titan the myonuclear of muscle fibers and stretch activated ion channels may only detect passive forces now these are just some of the candidates and more research is needed overall before we can make more definitive conclusions on mechanosensors in any case once these mechanosensors detect tension they go on to activate one of the many possible signaling Pathways involved in forming the proteins that make muscle fibers grow ing deeper to the fourth level is clear to see during an exercise we'd want to recruit as many muscle fibers as possible and have those individual fibers Produce High respective forces yet and this is the key point to the fourth level we also want that tension to be produced for a decent duration merely having high levels of muscle fiber Recruitment and force output from the fibers for a very brief duration isn't great for stimulating hypertrophy this is demonstrated by the fact that one rep max training that's lifting the heaviest loads you can for a single rep simply doesn't produce much if any hypertrophy despite it involving high muscle fiber Recruitment and fiber forces this is likely because the duration of tension is too short to meaningfully trigger the mechanosensors going to the deepest fifth level we so far know during an exercise we want to recruit as many fibers as possible and have those fibers Produce High forces for a sufficient duration yet and this is the key point to the fifth level this all needs to be done within a given time window let me explain this with another example compare performing one set of a 30 second maximal isometric bench press contraction to performing 30 one second maximal isometric bench press contractions evenly spread throughout the full day both are maximal isometric bench press contractions so involve high fiber Recruitment and forces from the Vipers and both involve a total of 30 seconds of very high tension at the end of the day but which do you think is more effective for stimulating hypertrophy probably the first one the one set of a 30 second maximal isometric bench press contraction as it involves all the tension within a given time window which is probably more favorable for triggering the meccano sensors having the duration of high Recruitment and fiber forces spread throughout the day and not in a given time window is presumably not as effective for triggering the mechano sensors optimally so we arrive at our final overview of mechanical tension during an exercise we'd want to recruit as many muscle fibers as possible and have the individual fibers Produce High respective forces for a decent duration and this needs to be done within a given time window the forces from the fiber can be active and or passive which get detected by mechanic sensors that convert the tension and activate one of the many possible signaling Pathways involved in forming the proteins that make muscle fibers grow so during an exercise how do we ensure High mechanical tension overall many assume training with heavier loads is the only way to achieve this indeed this is why some speculated that Blood Flow Restriction which involves using light loads isn't causing muscle growth through mechanical tension but as we alluded to this isn't a correct view of mechanical tension let's explore why the characteristics of muscle fibers generally lie across a spectrum on one end are fast twitch muscle fibers that are large High Force producing but very fatigable these fibers have the greatest growth potential as alluded to when discussing Blood Flow Restriction Training a while back on the other end are slow twitch fibers that are small low Force producing but highly fatigue resistant these fibers don't have the greatest growth potential muscle fibers are recruited sequentially when the muscle needs to generate low forces only slow twitch fibers need to be recruited but as a muscle needs to generate progressively larger forces or as it fatigues while trying to sustain a given Force output those faster twitch muscle fibers eventually get recruited this sequential recruitment of muscle fibers is known as henerman's size Principle as its eelwood Henneman who first discovered all this during his pioneering research in the 1960s from this its clear heavier loads as it instantly requires higher muscle forces to move the load Produce High muscle fiber Recruitment and it would only increase as you near failure also many of the individual fibers sustain relatively High forces throughout all of this lighter loads including Blood Flow Restriction Training as it initially only needs low muscle forces to move the load would only require slow twitch fiber recruitment but the key point is that as you continue performing reps and air failure with this light load you eventually recruit those faster twitch muscle fibers many of the individual fibers sustain relatively High forces throughout all this too therefore the last few reps just before failure a weather duration of exposure to overall High mechanical tension would be similar between light and heavier loading this is more than likely why both light and heavy loads have been shown to be able to produce similar muscle hypertrophy when reps are performed nail or two failure this is also more than likely why training nail or two failure with whatever load you're using is more favorable for hypertrophy than training further from failure now I should note very light loads even if you get nail or two failure probably won't be optimal for stimulating hypertrophy this is because two high rep numbers likely generate excessive within session Central fatigue that inhibits your ability to effectively recruit and expose those faster twitch muscle fibers to tension very heavy loads aren't the most optimal for stimulating hypertrophy per set either as the duration of overall High mechanical tension would be too brief we alluded to this point earlier when noting how one rep max training doesn't build much muscle at all mechanical tension being the primary hypertrophy stimulus might have another training implication there's an ever increasing number of studies finding that training muscles at stretched positions is powerful for building muscle we have a whole video detailing the research behind this exercises that train muscles in a stretched position likely involves significant contribution from both active and passive forces and this might potentially explain the greater hypertrophy myosin and actin interact to generate active forces while Titan and the surrounding extracellular Matrix 2 generate passive forces remember different mechanosensors might detect either active or passive forces so ensuring both of these are high in an exercise may have additive effects on signaling muscle growth passive forces from Titan while the muscle is producing active forces might also be greater versus passive forces from Titan while the muscle is not producing active forces emerging evidence alludes to this you see calcium influx into the muscle fiber is what fundamentally permits myosin and actin to interact to generate active forces but these calcium ions with active tension might also interact with Titan to make it stiffer too allowing it to generate greater passive forces these greater passive forces are probably more effective at triggering the mechanosensors this could explain why passive forces with no active tension as done when static stretching isn't very effective for stimulating hypertrophy in humans but passive forces combined with active forces as done in exercises training muscles at stretched positions are highly effective though extreme static stretching itself can probably build muscle for example this recent German study found that performing this cough stretch for one hour every day in humans did produce significant gastrocnemius growth I should mention although I believe the evidence suggests these things about active and passive tension being additive could very much be the case otherwise I would not have detailed it it's 100 not a confirmed definitive fact further research is required to validate it but for the time being I'm comfortable speculating that what I've described may be what's going on before closing out this video I think it's worth presenting some speculative hypertrophy models it's evident mechanical tension is the primary hypertrophy stimulus and I don't think it's completely crazy to speculate mechanical tension could literally be the sole stimulus behind hypertrophy other things like metabolic stress and muscle damage May simply be a byproduct of training opposed to this although we noted there aren't any strong categorized paths by which metabolic stress or damage promotes hypertrophy nor is there strong evidence that more of them is better or additive this cannot definitively prove they play a zero percent role in hypertrophy perhaps both metabolic stress and muscle damage at very low levels are involved in hypertrophy with no further benefit Beyond these very low levels thus virtually all types of training pass this threshold explaining why more of these things aren't associated with great hypertrophy furthermore we cannot rule out that future research will will find some categorized path by which low levels of metabolic stress and damage relate to hypertrophy finally it is also possible that exists other stimuli that play a small role in hypertrophy that have yet to be thoroughly examined in the literature for example some studies find training in hypoxic environments that's environments with lower levels of oxygen produces more hypertrophy than training a normoxic environments that's environments with normal oxygen levels now hypoxia and metabolic stress can be related but hypoxia itself could be a direct stimulus for gains dissociated from metabolite buildup yet it's essential to note a number of opposing studies find no difference in muscle growth between training in hypoxic and normoxic environments making the overall link between hypoxia and hypertrophy unclear mechanical tension seems to be the primary hypertrophy stimulus there simply isn't compelling evidence metabolic stress or damage are powerful drivers of hypertrophy it's possible small amounts of metabolic stress and damage play a role in hypertrophy and is also possible other stimuli yet to be properly assessed in the research could play a role in hypertrophy future research is needed to validate whether this is true or not recall our final overview of mechanical tension was as follows during an exercise we'd want to recruit as many muscle fibers as possible and have the individual fibers produce higher respective forces for a decent duration and this needs to be done within a given time window the forces from the fiber can be active and or passive which get detected by mechano sensors that convert the tension and activate one of the many possible signaling Pathways involved in forming the proteins that make muscle fibers grow ultimately getting to or close to failure with a wide range of loads achieves High mechanical tension moreover it's possible that exercises that train muscles at a fairly stretched length of superior for hypertrophy since it involves both High active and passive tension as always the references to the studies mentioned in this video can be found in the description

belief alone lead to better results what if we gave someone a placebo pill telling them it was an anabolic steroid or caffeine would they feel more energetic lift heavier and see better gains and what about other underappreciated questions relating to the power of the mind could positive selft talk or even just imagining your training lead to more progress in this video we'll explore the fascinating research Behind these questions some of the findings might surprise you let's dive in this study had 40 athletes trained for 10 weeks one group was told their training program was individualized for them based on their force velocity profile don't worry about what this means it's not essential but you can check out the pin comment if you're curious the other group was told they were doing a generic non-optimal training program in reality both groups followed the same training program the results showed that the group who believed the training was individualized experienced greater gains in back Squatch strength and muscle thickness of the rectus humorus so even though the training was identical the belief that it was personalized led to better results summoning the spirit of scientific accuracy this study is not flawless and is considered just a pilot study the training focused on strength and power and Sprint and jump performance did not differ between the two groups also the muscle thickness increases were fairly small with measurement error and other potential confounders possibly in play regardless this study relates to the placebo effect which is a beneficial outcome that happens because you believe you were given a beneficial treatment the mechanisms behind the placebo effect are unclear perhaps being told your training is individualized makes you put more effort and intensity into your training and Recovery other currently unknown factors could contribute too this isn't the only study on the power of the placebo effect with lifting weights there are even more surprising studies if you followed the house of horty for a while you might remember these two studies but let me briefly revisit them as they still blow my mind the first paper was published back in 197 three 15 trained Varsity athletes trained normally for 7 weeks then for the next 4 weeks six of them were chosen and given a daily 10 mg pill of Dianabol an anabolic steroid unknown to them it was just a placebo after the initial 7 weeks without the pill these were the average strength gains they saw on four exercises after the four weeks where they took the pill these were the strength gains they saw the subjects experienced two to 10 times more strength gains in just over half the time simply by being tricked into thinking they were taking anabolic steroids the second paper was published in 2000 and the author was actually a powerlifting coach who noted that some of his athletes who were 11 nationally ranked powerlifters asked about the effectiveness of steroids which inspired the author to run this study here were the subjects Baseline one red max strength on the bench press back squat and deadlift they were pretty damn strong in the first test before testing strength on these three exercises again the subjects were given two tablets and told they were immediate acting anabolic steroids but they were just Placebo pills this resulted in all the subjects hitting personal bests lifting an average 9.5 kg more on the bench press 12.2 Kg on the squat and 10.9 Kg on the deadlift the authors noted that these Gams were significant enough to elevate the athletes from National to International rankings subjects were given two more tablets to take for the upcoming week of training and all reported increased Vigor lifting heavier or performing more reps than ever before in the next testing session some of the subjects were told the pills were just placebos these subject strength dropped down to their Baseline levels while those who weren't told this roughly maintained their impressive gains tricking people into thinking they've consumed caffeine or even an amino acid supplement has also been shown to improve training performance the effects aren't as large as being deceived into thinking you've taken anabolic steroids but the effects tend to result in squeezing out a couple more reps there's actually a pretty respectable effect from preconditioning which makes sense once you understand it imagine someone does as many reps as they can with 100 kg on the bench press after a few days of rest we give them a pill telling them it's a special caffeine supplement and then test their Max reps again this time without them knowing we reduce the weight down to 90 kg while making it look like 100 kg perhaps we use fake weights because the weight is lighter they'll do more reps than expected thereby preconditioning and convincing them that the supplement is highly effective a few days later we give them the same pill and test their Max reps with a real 100 kg their performance will typically be much better than it would have been with without the preconditioning for a detailed description of a preconditioning study and how it controls for confounders check out the pinned comment summoning the spirit of scientific accuracy once again not every study has found the placebo effect in the weightlifting world but most have and again the effects appear to be larger when people believe they're taking something with a bigger impact the opposite of the placebo effect also exists the nobo effect where a negative outcome happens because you believe you received a negative treatment for example this paper found that electrical stimulation of the quads which the subjects were told would increase their fatigue but was just a sham led to reduced performance on the leg extension so what could we do with this Placebo and nobo literature while it's tough to trick yourself into believing you're taking the ultimate muscle building pill this highlights the potential benefits of being optimistic and confident as well as the potential dangers of negative thinking if you constantly tell yourself you have terrible genetics or you can't surpass a certain limit these thoughts might be holding you back more than you realize while making this video I was reminded of a section in Arnold's book titled the mind the most powerful tool he shares a pretty cool story involving Franco Columbo that I'd thought I'd share here Franco and I were squatting in the Old Gold Gym Franco got under \u00a3500 squatted down and couldn't get back up \u00a3500 for even one rep was apparently just too heavy for him that day just then four or five Italian American kids from New York came in there's Franco hey Franco they were great fans and were looking forward to watching him work out I took Franco aside and told him Franco these guys think you're the king you can't get under \u00a3500 again and fail all of a sudden his face changed he went out onto the street and spent a while psyching himself up he stalked back into the gym grabbed the bar and instead of the six reps he was supposed to do with \u00a3500 he did eight obviously Franco's muscles didn't get any stronger in that few minutes between sets what did change was his mind his drive and motivation his desire for the goal this is a perfect segue into our next topic Franco went out to the street to psych himself up there are different ways you could psych yourself up such as talking to yourself with motivating words and even imagining your self-lifting what does the scientific literature say about the effectiveness of psyching up before moving on to this I actually have a potential way to create the placebo effect for

are three main types of psyching up I'll mention here prepatory arousal is something you do to pump yourself up it could be screaming or pacing back and forth quickly motivational selft talk is talking to yourself with motivating words such as I can lift this weight and you may consider what Ronnie used to do as motivational selft talk wa wait imagery involves you imagining yourself performing an exercise with as much detail as you can must up visualizing yourself performing an exercise from your own eyes in first person is likely more effective than a third person Vision the review found that most studies on these techniques found they successfully increased maximal Force production there currently isn't enough evidence to say if one is better than another and it could vary based on people's preference anyhow let me briefly overview two studies from the review so you have a better idea of all this this 1993 paper had trained varsity football players used prepatory arousal through watching aggressive football videos before bench pressing this resulted in greater bench press one R max strength so watching motivational videos before lifting could be beneficial now this study examined the instant effect they psych up and then we test their strength nearly all of the studies in the review just explored the instant effect but how are gains impacted by using psyching up techniques week after week that is in the long term fortunately we have the second study that recruited 44 trained combat practitioners they trained physically three times per week with these exercises and variables the imagery Group after this session spent around 30 minutes imagining themselves performing the same exercises and variables from A firstperson View these were the instructions given a combined imagery and selft talk group also spent 30 minutes Imagining the exercises but added positive and motivational selft talk during both physical and imagery sessions the researchers recommended identifying and rewriting negative selft talk into positive statements for example changing I can't lift this to I can lift this a control group just performed the physical training sessions with no imagery or selft talk but they did a 30-minute neutral cognitive task after so time was equated between all groups it was found that bench press and half squat strength tended to be best for the combined imagery and selft talk group followed by the imagery group and then the control group selfefficacy and motivation scores followed the same pattern this is just one study so it's certainly not definitive proof pying up enhances long-term gains yet and there's no research yet on its effects on muscle hypertrophy 30 minutes of mental imagery is also a big time investment but positive selft talk is something more practical however shorter mental imagery sessions could still provide some benefits there's a lot of research on mental imagery and this is a whole other video itself let me know if you'd like to see that for now at least we have solid evidence these psyching up strategies can instantly benefit your strength so feel free to try any of them individually or in combination even if it's just a placebo effect well we know that's not a bad thing thank you for making it to the end of the video here's the Key summary points feel free to check

    "title": "Blow up Your Upper Chest With These Exercises (Science Based)",
    "published_at": "2024-10-07T14:25:20Z",
    "transcript": "[Music] welcome to the house of hypertrophy well-developed upper pecs can take your physique to the next level we likely need an exercise to preferentially train the upper PEC how can this be done there are actually a number of options on the table including some options you rarely hear about let's start with what the data suggests about the most popular exercise well-controlled electromyographic research finds that the ratio of upper p to Middle peek activity is better when the force is directed obliquely upward instead of purely horizontally incline bench pressing replicates this at least in so far as pushing in an upward Direction indeed out of the seven studies that have explored this incline bench pressing produced greater upper Peck activity compared to the flat barble bench press in five of them it is also notable that the majority finds middle and lower PEC activity is reduced with the incline and front Del activity is higher with the incline there's occasionally debates on the optimal incline angle for targeting the upper peeg what does the current literature say one paper found a 30\u00b0 incline was ideal another found it was a 44\u00b0 incline while we even have data finding similar upper PEC activity between a 30 and 45\u00b0 incline besides the possibility of the limitations with electromyography measures individual differences could be in play people don't have identical muscle architecture or leverages nor do people have an identical bench press setup so the ideal incline angle May differ between people so if you would like to incline bench press and your bench is adjustable feel free to experiment around it's worth noting inclin bench pressing can also be done with a Smith machine dumbbells and a cambered bar moreover feet elevated push-ups and certain machine chest presses where you push upwards likely effectively hit the upper Peck although one caveat with feet elevated push-ups is your head tends to limit how much you can lower yourself resulting in a reduced PEC stretch using some boxes or handles to increase depth can go some way to alleviate the shortcoming though so all of these options likely preferentially Target the upper pecs but there are actually some more perhaps under appreciated ways the upper PEX could be targeted out out of all the PEC regions the upper pecs have the best leverage for performing shoulder flexion and well-controlled electromag graphic analyses find the upper pecs contribute more to shoulder flexion than the other regions during horizontal presses using a closer grip gets you closer to predominantly performing shoulder flexion this is best achieved when keeping the armor near to the side and not fled out also using a reverse grip on a barbell or also forces you into performing shoulder flexion regardless of the grip used we might speculate these preferentially Target the upper PEX yet the data is somewhat split since out of the eight papers comparing close to moderate and wider grip bench pressing four of them find upper Peck activity is better with a closer grip out of the two papers comparing reverse grip bench pressing to normal grip bench pressing only one finds enhanced upper Peck activity as an additional note the majority of data finds closer grips better recruit the triceps When comparing these variations to an incline bench press with a wider grip we just have this paper that found upper PEC activity was not statistically different between a closer grip bench press and an incline with a wider grip although the raw numbers lean toward the closer grip regardless this might be tentative evidence closer grips could be as good for the upper peex as a standard incline we shouldn't forget that closer grips and reverse grips can even be used with the Smith machine dumbbells and even pushups so there is a fair number of potential upper Peck options we'll provide some recommendations in a second I say this because we're not quite done it's possible for us to use a closer or reverse grip on an inclined ankle could this be the best the only analysis from the literature is this paper that found compared to an incline bench press with a wider grip an incline with a closer and reverse grip produce non-statistically different upper PEC activity although the raw numbers lean towards using closer and reverse grips on the incline however it's worth mentioning this paper was the same one that found flat closer grip bench pressing produced upper Peck activity levels that were not statistically different from the incline with a wider grip anyhow We'll add closer and reverse grips with an incline to our already extensive list the landmine press and Li's fend press are two final exercises worth mentioning the landmine press involves pushing in an upward direction that we know likely preferentially targets the upper PEC however the very close hand spacing reduces the overall stretch of the pecs thus I suspect it's not going to be as good as all the other options mentioned but it's certainly not a bad exercise and it will still build muscle so if someone really likes it that can be enough of a reason to train with it as for the Li's fend press it's essentially a close grip press with an intense chest squeeze against a plate the size of the plate means the stretch is restricted and since there's only so heavy of a plate you can lift it's going to be difficult to progress this exercise in the long term dumbbells can be used but this still suffers from a restricted stretch the only scenario where I think someone may want to perform this is simp simply if they find it a fun and enjoyable addition to their training so we know there's a ton of upper Peck options what's the recommendation we've seen there is essentially evidence for all of these variations better targeting the upper peex and in the limited data that has compared some of these there are non-significant differences thus for now I'd simply recommend selecting whatever option you like although it is possible what works best could differ between people for example Greg Knuckles from Stronger by science noticed upper pecs get outrageously sore from Flat reverse benching whereas this never happens from his incline experience thus you could experiment with any of the variations and evaluate how they subjectively score for you do you perceive more upper Peck with them is the pump and perhaps the next day sess in the upper PEC greater than usual now it's critical to understand objective Sensations are not yet validated proxies for actual muscle activation and we also know despite popular belief the intracellular events associated with a pump and saus do not appear to be strong drivers of hypertrophy but having said this I believe it's still plausible when controlling as much factors subjective Sensations like the pump and soreness could be indirect insights to the actual tension seen by a muscle region so in the absence of anything else I think it's not the end of the world for you to try and use your subjective perception to help determine what you may train with some of you may

    "title": "Is Maxing Out Effective for Building Muscle? (One-Rep Max Training)",
    "published_at": "2021-02-15T12:44:29Z",
    "transcript": "Maxing out regularly, so performing a one\u00a0\nrep max lift, isn't completely uncommon,\u00a0\u00a0 especially in the strength world. For instance\u00a0, the bulgarian method, based on my limited reading, appears to have involved maxing out daily on the\u00a0\nsnatch, clean and jerk, as well as squat variations.\u00a0 In the powerlifting world, it seems modifications\u00a0\nof the bulgarian method exist. In this scenario, maxing out is done with the back squat, deadlift, and bench press. Some reasons as to why regular one\u00a0\u00a0 rep max training may be great for strength gains\u00a0, involve improved motor learning with heavier loads\u00a0\u00a0 and greater neural adaptations. But, what about\u00a0\nmuscle hypertrophy? We often associate numerous\u00a0\u00a0 repetitions being effective for building muscle.\u00a0\nBut could one rep max training still be effective? Two research papers can help us here. Let us begin\u00a0\nwith a study by Danekel and colleagues. 5 men,\u00a0\u00a0 with at least one year of training experience,had\u00a0\none arm assigned to a one rep max arm and their\u00a0\u00a0 other arm assigned to a volume arm. They trained\u00a0\nboth of their arms for 21 days straight. With the\u00a0\u00a0 one rep max arm, they worked up to a one rep max\u00a0\non the unilateral dumbbell biceps curl each day.\u00a0 To prevent momentum, their backs and shoulders were\u00a0\nkept against a wall. They also performed a maximum\u00a0\u00a0 isometric contraction of the biceps at 60 degrees\u00a0\nof elbow flexion, using a dynamometer. This was done\u00a0\u00a0 for two contractions each lasting three seconds.\u00a0\nWith the volume arm, they did exactly what was\u00a0\u00a0 done with the one rep max arm,so working up to a\u00a0\none rep max on the unilateral dumbbell biceps curl\u00a0\u00a0 and performing the maximum isometric contraction.\u00a0\nHowever, in addition to this, the arm performed\u00a0\u00a0 three sets of 10 reps on the unilateral dumbbell\u00a0\nbiceps curl with a 70% one rep max load. Before\u00a0\u00a0 , on day 8, day 15, day 21, and three days after\u00a0\nthe 21st session, thickness of the elbow flexors\u00a0\u00a0 , which would have included the biceps brachii and\u00a0\nbrachialis, was measured at 50% 60% and 70% of the upper arm length. Additionally, through the\u00a0\ntraining protocol itself, one rep max on the dumbbell\u00a0\u00a0 unilateral curl and maximal isometric contraction\u00a0\nstrength on the dynamometer was noted. Increases\u00a0\u00a0 in one rep max strength and maximal isometric\u00a0\ncontraction strength were similar between both\u00a0\u00a0 arms. However increases in elbow flexor thickness\u00a0\nat all measured regions throughout the 21 days\u00a0\u00a0 favored the volume arm versus the one rep max\u00a0\narm. Looking more carefully at the data, it's quite\u00a0\u00a0 evident the one rep max arm experienced virtually\u00a0\nno growth. Therefore, one rep max training for 21\u00a0\u00a0 days straight on the dumbbell biceps curl does\u00a0\nnot appear to be effective for building muscle.\u00a0\u00a0 Adding some volume, in this case three sets of 10\nreps on the dumbbell biceps curl, appeared to be\u00a0\u00a0 necessary for inducing muscle growth. Now, this\u00a0\nstudy had subjects trained daily and the study\u00a0\u00a0 was only 21 days in duration. What about rest days\u00a0\nin between and a longer duration study? Mattocks\u00a0\u00a0 and colleagues can help us. 17 men and 21 women, all\u00a0\nuntrained, were assigned to either a testing group\u00a0\u00a0 or a hypertrophy group. Both groups trained\u00a0\nthe unilateral knee extension (they did train\u00a0\u00a0 both legs) and chest press, twice per week for eight\u00a0\nweeks. The hypertrophy group each session performed\u00a0\u00a0 4 sets to failure with an 8-12 rep max load and\u00a0\n90 seconds of rest between sets for each exercise,\u00a0\u00a0 the testing group, each session, warmed up and\u00a0\nworked up to a one-rep max for each exercise. 90\u00a0\u00a0 seconds of rest was given between attempts. One rep\u00a0\nmax on the unilateral knee extension for both legs\u00a0\u00a0 and chest press was measured before and after for\u00a0\nboth groups. Also, thickness of the anterior thigh\u00a0\u00a0 and lateral thigh was measured at 50%, 60%, and 70% of the thigh\u00a0\u00a0 length before and after for both groups. Note, the\u00a0\nanterior thigh would have included the rectus\u00a0\u00a0 femoris and vastus medialis, while the lateral\u00a0\nthigh would have included the vastus lateralis.\u00a0 Increases in unilateral knee extension one rep max\u00a0\nfor both legs and chest press one rep max were\u00a0\u00a0 statistically similar between both groups. For all\u00a0\nmeasures of anterior and lateral thigh thickness,  the results favor the hypertrophy group.\u00a0\nHowever, for all measures done on the legs\u00a0\u00a0 for the lateral thigh, the differences were\u00a0\nnot classified as statistically significant.\u00a0 Similarly, at 60% and 70% of the anterior thigh\u00a0\nfor the dominant leg, differences were also not\u00a0\u00a0 classified as statistically different. Even so, it's evident that overall, the hypertrophy group\u00a0\u00a0 experienced much greater growth than the\u00a0\ntesting group. The before and after changes\u00a0\u00a0 for each group further demonstrate this. Looking at the testing group results, we\u00a0\u00a0 can see that for nearly all measures, there were\u00a0\nvirtually no increases, rather slight decreases.\u00a0\u00a0 Conversely, the hypertrophy group experienced\u00a0\nincreases across virtually all measures.\u00a0 To sum up, the study by Dankel and colleagues\u00a0\nand Mattocks and colleagues appear to suggest\u00a0\u00a0 that one rep max training, although effective for\u00a0\nstrength gain, isn't effective for building muscle.\u00a0\u00a0 These findings would support the idea that one\u00a0\nrep max training likely produces significant\u00a0\u00a0 strength gains through neural adaptations and/or\u00a0\nimproved motor skills, rather than muscle growth.\u00a0 For building muscle, the current evidence indicates\u00a0\nthat reps between 5 and 35, roughly equating to\u00a0\u00a0 loads between 85% one rep max and 30% one\u00a0\nrep max produce similar muscle growth, provided\u00a0\u00a0 repetitions are performed to failure. Which is\u00a0\nthe point at which no more repetitions can be\u00a0\u00a0 performed. Interestingly, there does exist some\u00a0\nresearch exploring the use of heavy sets of 2 to 4\u00a0\u00a0 for hypertrophy. I plan to cover this\u00a0\nin another video, so stay tuned for that :)"

    "title": "Does the Mind-Muscle Connection Help Build More Muscle?",
    "published_at": "2020-09-14T11:45:54Z",
    "transcript": "many bodybuilders have advocated using the mind muscle connection for maximizing muscle growth the mind muscle connection for those who don't know is aiming to consciously squeeze and maximally activate a particular muscle during an exercise can using this technique help you build more muscle there are two direct papers we can use to help us answer this question this first study by counts and colleagues technically did not aim to determine if the mind muscle connection helped build more muscle rather it gives us an insight into whether squeezing and maximally contracting a muscle produces hypertrophy which is the basis of the mind muscle connection 13 untrained individuals had one arm assigned to a no-load condition and their other arm assigned to a high load condition participants trained both arms three times per week for six weeks with the arm that was assigned to the no-load condition they performed a biceps curl with no actual weight they aim to squeeze and maximally contract the biceps throughout the curling movement they did this for 4 sets of 20 reps with 30 seconds of rest between sets with the opposite arm assigned to the high load condition they performed a dumbbell biceps curl with seventy percent of their one rep max they did this for four sets of eight to twelve reps with 90 seconds of rest between sets thickness of the biceps was measured at three regions roughly fifty percent sixty percent and seventy percent of the upper arm length at all three regions of the biceps increases in thickness were similar between the two conditions in other words bicep curls with no load but trying to squeeze and maximally activate the biceps throughout the curling motion resulted in similar gains to regular dumbbell curls which is extremely interesting again this study didn't explicitly test the mind muscle connection but what this study does suggest is that squeezing and aiming to maximally activate a muscle which is the basis of the mind muscle connection can result in significant growth the question now becomes whether aiming to do this during a loaded exercise can help build more muscle this is where the second paper by schoenfeld and colleagues comes in 27 untrained men were split into an internal focus group or an external focus group both groups train the standing biceps curl and leg extension for four sets of eight to twelve reps with each set taken to failure three times per week for 10 weeks the internal focus group on each rep was told to focus on squeezing the targeted muscle this was the biceps for the standing biceps curl and the quadriceps for the leg extension the external focus group was told to focus on getting the way up on each rep for both exercises thickness of the elbow flexors which would have included the biceps bracha and brachialis rectus femoris and vastus lateralis were measured before and after the 10 weeks of both groups the internal focus group experienced significantly greater increases in elbow flexor thickness compared to the external focus group but increases in thickness for the rectus femoris and vastus lateralis was similar between both groups so the mind muscle connection did seem to help build more muscle for the elbow flexors but not for the quadriceps this is intriguing why might the mind muscle connection not benefit the quads the researchers noted that several participants found it easier to focus on the biceps compared to the quadriceps in normal life the upper body is typically involved in finer motor tasks like writing whereas the lower body is primarily involved in larger tasks like walking this could explain why individuals are better able to control and activate their biceps but not their quadriceps remember the participants in this study were untrained with training experience developing a mind muscle connection with the quadriceps may be possible this in turn may be able to result in greater growth of course i am just guessing and future research would be required to validate this idea so from the count study but mainly the schoenfeld study there is evidence that the mind muscle connection can help build more muscle but it's also important to consider the context of these studies both studies use single joint exercises single joint exercises may be the most practical and easiest type of movement to apply the mind muscle connection to the mind muscle connection could still work with multi-joint exercises but probably with the use of lighter loads a paper by kala tuya and colleagues demonstrates this they found that focusing on the chest during bench pressures with 20 percent 40 percent and 60 percent warning max did increase chest electrical activity measured by electromyography compared to not using the mind muscle connection this same logic also applied to focusing on the triceps but when subjects used eighty percent one rep max on the bench press the mind muscle connection did not increase electrical activity for either the chest or triceps electromyography does come with its limitations and inferring long-term adaptations from emg data can be problematic but regardless i feel this study is useful as the results are logical and probably quite intuitive when using heavy loads it would simply be more difficult to focus on a particular muscle as much of your attention would be directed towards just moving the load [Music] but with lighter loads it would be much easier to direct your attention to a particular muscle another important thing worth mentioning here is that given lighter loads are likely better for using the mind muscle connection strength development will likely be less although many people of course want to build substantial muscle many people do as well want to get strong on some exercises mainly multi-joint exercises for example having a strong bench press squat or deadlift is a goal for many people if this applies to you for the most part it's probably best to avoid using the mind muscle connection on any movements you want to maximize strength with and rather just focus on using relatively heavy loads to conclude with single joint upper body exercises such as bicep curls there is direct evidence that using the mind muscle connection can help build more muscle with single joint lower body exercises you may wish to try and develop a mind muscle connection with your lower body this may help build more muscle with the upper and lower body multi-joint exercises the mind muscle connection could work with lighter loads so you may wish to experiment with this [Music] [Music] you"

    "transcript": "when it comes to developing the arms we all know about the biceps and triceps but I'd say there's an underrated muscle hiding beneath the biceps that is the brachialis located at the lower upper arm region a well-developed brachialis creates a distinct separation between the biceps and triceps and in theory groan the brachioli should push out the biceps thereby enhancing the arm size the brachiolis is part of the elbow flexors alongside the biceps and brachioradialis fascinatingly though the biceps is the largest elbow flexor the brachialis isn't far off the brachioradialis makes up a smaller part if the goal is to optimize arm hypertrophy suffice to say the brachialis cannot be forgotten about in this video we're going to be uncovering some training tips related to developing the brachialis welcome to the house of hypertrophy [Music] foreign the brachiolis is a pure Alpha flexor so it's certainly going to be activated in all types of curling exercises but what sort of brachialis development might we experience from various curling exercises this classic Canadian analysis found after subjects trained machine preacher curls with an underhand grip the biceps increase in cross-sectional area by 8.3 percent while the brachialis increased in cross-sectional area by an impressive 37.6 percent so these findings May imply the brachialis experiences relatively greater hypertrophy than the biceps from underhand preacher curls interestingly this was the only paper I could find measuring brachiolis hypertrophy directly during my deep search so we can't confidently say the brachialis grows more than the biceps from curling exercises in all circumstances fortunately though other indirect research still delivers valuable insights this analysis found after subjects trained dumbbell underhand preacher curls the brachialis experienced a similar pump to the biceps the pump is a temporary increase in muscle size due to fluid accumulation as we've dissected in depth previously at the house of hypertrophy the pump does not appear to be a strong cause of muscle growth however with a given exercise the muscle regions that experience the greatest pump might end up seeing the greatest hypertrophy if so somewhat contrary to the other paper this data may suggest the brachiality sees a comparable stimulus to the biceps from underhand preacher curls finally we have this recent Spanish paper that compared underhand Dumbo prejecosa underhand incline curls the researchers looked at elbow flexor growth across three regions the measurements comprise both the biceps and brachiolis so no distinction between them was made nevertheless growth across the three regions tended to be better with a preacher curls in a prior video I described how this data might indicate preacher codes to be a better biceps Builder compared to incline curls I believe this speculation still holds in the absence of other data but as the measurement included the brachiolis I think this muscle may have contributed to some of the greater gains seen from the preacher curls notice how the difference in gains between preacher and incline curse was particularly notable at a 70 region the authors noted that in this area the thickness of the brachialis was around twice the thickness at the 50 region thus though we can't be certain perhaps a decent chunk of the growth experienced at the 70 region by the preacher curls is attributable to the brachi Alice some may be thinking if true why did preacher course do a better job than incline curls we'll address this very soon but taking all these anodized papers together although it's not crystal clear as to what precise magnitude of stimulus the breakouts experiences from curling exercises I would descriptively say the brachialis is going to grow at least well these findings make sense throughout elbow flexion The brachialis's Leverage is not far off the biceps leverage whatsoever in case you're unaware leverage refers to the muscle's moment arm which is the perpendicular distance between the muscles line of force and the center of the joint it moves a longer moment our means a muscle has greater leverage and ability to move the joint and a few papers indicate that Leverage is one important factor in how the central nervous system decides what muscles to activate in an exercise thus this data tells us we should expect the brachialis like the biceps to be trained quite effectively with all curling exercises [Music] we just saw this Spanish paper potentially indicating the brachialis may have grown more with preacher compared to incline curls moreover recall the Canadian paper finding substantial brachios approach for used machine preacher curls and their analysis finding a similar pump between the brachialis and biceps use dumbbell preacher curls preacher curls are most challenging near the start of the curl where the biceps and brachialis are at a longer muscle length conversely other curling exercises like incline curls and standard curls are more challenging when the biceps and brachialis are at a neutral to shorten the length if you've been following the house of hypertrophy for a while you will know emerging Research indicates challenging muscles at a more length and position produces more muscle growth preacher curls aren't the only way to challenge the muscles at longer lengths face away cable curls and other specialized machines can accomplish this based on what we've detailed I would rank these curling exercises that challenge the muscles at longer lengths as more effective for growing the brachialis than curling exercises that don't this is not to be mistaken for believing that standard curls incline curls or other curls that aren't most challenging at longer lengths are useless although the current scientific evidence consistently observes more hypertrophy for more length and training training at neutral to shorten length still elicits measurable growth so know that if you do not wish to perform curls most challenging the lens it's not the end of the world [Music] there is one factor that may equalize the effects of all types of curling exercises for developing the brachialis that affects it is range of motion so far there have been three studies finding a partial range of motion at long muscle lengths produce the overall more hypertrophy than a full range of motion we have additional data demonstrating that when comparing partial range of motion at long muscle links to short muscle lengths the former better builds muscle for example this Japanese paper compared partial preacher codes at the long to short length an elbow Flex a growth across three regions was Superior for the long lengths this elbow Flex a measurement comprised both the biceps and brachiolis although we can't be certain I think it's quite likely the brachiolis was involved in that great hypertrophy what all this information May imply is that regardless of the curling exercise you've selected performing a partial range of motion at long lengths since it will effectively challenge the brachialis at longer lengths renders all types of curls as highly and similarly effect before brachialis hypertrophy if you're feeling experimental You may wish to try these out in your training another option is integrated partials where you alternate between a full range of motion repetition and a partial rep at longer lengths a final option is with exercises most challenging at the mid to shortened position like standard and incline curls you could perform reps two or very close to failure with a full range of motion and then squeeze out extra partial reps at longer lengths if you're not feeling experimental and wish to stick with a full range of motion then you may wish to use the previous rankings as guidance if you're curious about deeper guidance on the process of training our high

apps reviews Echo this [Music] the grip you use on curves likely has an effect on which alperflex and muscle is slightly biased we know the biceps has great leverage for help reflection but it's leverage for health reflection is greatest when using an underhand grip compared to using a neutral or overhand grip indeed the best Control Data indicates the bicep sees higher activity with an underhand compared to an overhand grip on the other hand the breaker list is leveraged for helper flexion is unimpacted by grip and since the biceps activity is likely lower with a neutral and overhand grip this likely increases the involvement of the brachialis indeed the brachialis has been documented to be better activated with an overhand grip unfortunately there isn't any research directly comparing foreign activity between a neutral and overhand grip so we don't know if any meaningful differences exist between them regardless based on the info we've dissected if the aim is to maximize brachialis development from Kohl's then a neutral or overhand grip should be used it's important to emphasize this doesn't mean underhand grip curves are useless for the brachialis many of the studies evaluated in this video such as the classic Canadian paper finding substantial brachialis hypertrophy used in underhand grip so if you're not overly concerned about maximizing and getting every ounce of lost muscle mass from the brachialis I don't believe neutral or overhand grip curls are essential some may be wondering about the brachial radiolis we will dissect the scientific literature surrounding this muscle in a future video please before summarizing things it's interesting to know that although the brachialis is traditionally considered to be one head some papers have found some individuals possess more than a single head there are individuals out there with two three four or even five or more brachialis heads I don't anticipate any of this changes the recommendations presented in the video the limited data available suggests in individuals with two heads the Deep head initiates elbow flexion while The Superficial head provides power once the elbow is flexed so in other words both heads are going to be involved in the overall process of ELP reflection nonetheless here are the summary points feel free to check out our detailed video on what actually stimulates hypertrophy"

    "transcript": "welcome to the house of hypertrophy as described by Mike Mensa the arms of all body parts seem to be the most universally admired whenever a bodybuilder is asked by the public to show them his muscle it is usually the biceps they're referring to even if I type in muscle icon into Google virtually all images show the biceps in fact the house of hypertri icon itself depicts the biceps in this video we're diving deep into the scientific literature behind building the biceps covering virtually everything you need to know about biceps are perch for you all for free from underappreciated facts about the biceps Anatomy its fiber type composition and function what exercises May best develop this muscle whether the biceps experiences Regional hypertrophy if you can truly bias the long or short head of the biceps with certain exercises and the effectiveness of only compound exercises for biceps hypertrophy in recent times some people across the internet have you surface electrodes strapped up to the biceps to compare different exercises with the belief this may tell us about what the best biceps exercises could be so we'll examine whether this surface electrode data is actually useful too the timestamps to the parts of the video can be found in the comments and description let's first explore the biceps Anatomy since as mentioned there are some underappreciated facts [Music] anatomical textbooks tell us the biceps consist of a long and short head the biceps like every single muscle in the body create movement thanks to it being attached to bones when a muscle produces movement the attachments on the bone that do not move are termed origin whereas the attachments that move are called the insertion the shorts head originates from an area called the coracoid process whereas the long head originates from an area called the supraglinoid tubercle the long and short head merge together to form a single muscle mass and inserts on the radius having said this a truly underappreciated fact is biceps Anatomy can substantially differ between people as described in this paper the biceps appears to be one of the most morphologically variable muscles in the Upper Limb not everyone has the exact same Origins and insertions of the biceps heads for example this paper established some people aligned with what we just described having a single tendon insertion on the radius yet some had two tendon insertions on the radius and others had three tendon insertions on the radius even more interestingly some people have more than just a long and short biceps head there are people with a third fourth and even fifth biceps head text dating back as early as the 1800s seems have noted the existence of these supernumerary heads however one of the best analyzes of the supernumerally biceps heads come from a 2022 study from Poland 101 upper limbs were analyzed and the researchers figured they could classify the morphology of the biceps into four different types 64 of the upper limbs fell into type 1 which was the traditional view of the biceps consisting of a long and short head however there were two subtypes differing in how the long and short biceps heads fuse together 26 of the upper limbs fell into type 2 which was categorized by having three biceps heads there were four subtypes differing in the origin of that third head fascinatingly one of the subtypes was categorized by having the third head originate from the pectoralis major six percent of the upper limbs fell into type 3 which was categorized by having four biceps heads there were two subtypes differing in the origin of the third and fourth heads four percent of the upper limbs fell into Type 4 which was categorized by having five biceps heads no subtypes for this were established but the fifth head in these four percent of upper limbs originated from the pectoralis major based on this analysis we can speculate that quite a few watching this will have more than two biceps heads the type you fall under seems to influence the length width and thickness of your biceps heads in various ways we'll detail the function of the biceps shortly but most of you know one main function is elbow flexion but the biceps are just one of three muscles contributing to Elbow flexion the two others being the brachialis which is found beneath the biceps and the brachioradialis found mainly across the forearm we won't be properly exploring the research and training the brachialis and break your radialis in this video this will be done thoroughly in a video soon to be released but an interesting question is how do the sizes of these elbow flexor muscles compare to one another most people just look at the sizes of a muscle from the outside but remember muscles are three-dimensional and take up space within the body therefore exploring research that has measured the volume of these muscles with special equipment such as MRI provides a more accurate insight into the sizes of these muscles I came across Six studies that have done this and the results from each are shown on screen if we average out all Six studies we find the biceps makes up 46 of the elbow flexors the brachialis 37 and the brachial radial is 17 percent focusing on the biceps there have been two studies comparing how much the lung and short head contribute to its size these two studies did not measure volume rather they compared the physiological cross-sectional area and both studies found the Longhead had a greater physiological cross-sectional area of course we mentioned moments ago there are people with more than two biceps heads but unfortunately no research to my knowledge provides an insight into how the volumes of these supernumerary heads may compare as a fun fact before progressing onto the next section we know that muscles contain muscle fibers and there is likely wide variation between people in the number of muscle fibers they have this study estimates for the biceps the number of muscle fibers within it may vary between 172 000 to 419 000. now not all muscle fibers are the same and we can very generally categorize muscle fibers as either slow twitch or fast twitch slow twitch fibers are generally low Force producing highly fatigue resistant and smaller in size fast fibers are generally High Force producing very fatigable and larger in size when averaging out of the research it appears the biceps contain slightly more fast switch muscle fibers than slow switch muscle fibers bear in mind this is the average the percentage of fast switch fibers and slow twitch fibers and muscle contains can vary between people we know that elbow flexion is carried out by the biceps but the other predominant function is supination of the forearm expectedly supinating the forearm while simultaneously performing elbow flexion powerfully activates the biceps a 1998 paper from Japan nicely illustrates this these researchers had subjects hold a contraction at 30 60 and 90 degrees of elbow flexion in each position they had subjects transition their grip from a pronator to a supinated one all while fine wire electrodes recorded activity of the biceps lung and short heads as well as the brachialis and brachioradiolis we can see that all three elbow flexion angles biceps long and short head activity were greatest when in supination and lowest in pronation while the opposite was true for the brachiolis and brachial radiolis they had the highest activity in pronation compared to supination these findings are supported by other analyzes an interesting fact is the brachioradialis appears to have nerve cells that essentially link it to the biceps and a few papers found that during elbow flexion with a pronated grip the brachioradiolis sends signals to the biceps to reduce its activity from this we can infer that to optimize the development of the biceps we're going to want to train an exercise that involves elbow flexion with supination of the forearm [Music] there are an endless number of curling exercises that involve both elbow flexion and supination and the scientific literature tends to show that numerous curling exercises are great for building the biceps a 2020 study out of Canada recruited 36 trained individuals and assigned them into a free weight or machine group focusing on the exercises used to train the biceps directly the machine group trained machine curls and machine preacher curls while the free weight group trained easy barcodes and preacher curls after eight weeks of training growth of the elbow flexors measured at around 65 of the upper arm length increased comparably between both groups now I say elbow flexor here and not biceps since this measurement actually includes both the biceps and brachiolis as we progress through this video you'll see many studies measured elbow flexor growth at regions of the upper arm so just be mindful although it certainly includes the biceps some of it also reflects the brachiolis another 2020 study from Brazil compared cable to barbell preacher curls and found after 10 weeks of training growth of the elbow flexors at around 50 of the upper arm length increased comparably between both exercises some of you might be tempted to compare the percentage increases between the studies but bear in mind the subjects regions measured and training variables used were different also in some of the upcoming studies slightly different hypertrophy measurements were taken further meaning we can't really compare the precise percentage increases between different studies nevertheless a few other studies which haven't directly compared different biceps exercises still demonstrate a range of curling exercises are great for building the biceps this 2013 study from Japan had subjects trained only the dumbbell curl with these variables and found a 13.3 increase in elbow Flex or cross-sectional area this 2016 stereato Brazil had subjects shown only a cable preacher curl and found a 16 to 20 percent increase in elbow Flex or cross-sectional area across an upper middle and lower region finally a 2011 study from Brazil had subjects trained with a whole program but the barbell biceps core was the only only direct biceps exercise and the elbow flexes at three regions grew well it's very logical that all these curling exercises are going to be powerful for biceps hypertrophy because at the end of the day they all load elbow flexion with supination so for those who prefer a really simplified recommendation you can absolutely develop your biceps well with whichever curling exercises you like the house of hypertrophy is partnered up with an alpha progression app this app has a database of over 550 exercises and if we filter it to

link in the comments and description gives you two weeks free of the app's premium features we don't just partner up with anybody at the house of hypertrophy so you can rest assured the app is sincerely high quality let's get back to the video so numerous curling exercises can be great for building the biceps for the simple fact they can all involve elbow flexion and supination but let's say you wanted to push me could a certain type of coal be slightly more effective than the wrist maybe I'm wondering if a curling exercise while the shoulders are extended such as drawing an incline curl or face away cable curl might be the single most favorable biceps exercise why am I wondering this due to the origins of the biceps placing the shoulder into extension stretches the biceps particularly the long head since this passes directly over the shoulder joints in recent years the power of achieving a stretch of a muscle during an exercise is becoming apparent though it's worth knowing that the scientific origins of stretch playing a role in hypertrophy stretches back to the 1970s a range of studies conducted on animals found that when having them stretch various muscles with extreme intensity for a long duration muscle hypertrophy occurred even Elite bodybuilders seemingly recognized the importance of stretch Arnold mentions in his book that Inca and Dumbo curse are a great exercise alluding to the stretch of being an important factor today we have three areas of the scientific literature in humans showing the power of achieving a stretch during an exercise the isometric training research is the first for those unaware isometric training is where you hold a muscle in a static position and we have three studies that demonstrate isometric training as a stretch to muscle position produces more hypertrophy than isometric training at a shortened muscle position an important consideration with the state is all three of the studies looked at the quadriceps muscle so we can't be certain the same applies to the biceps however the second area of the scientific research comparing different range of motions potentially indicates the biceps do respond to stretch two studies one by Sato and the other by Pedrosa have compared performing a preacher code with a partial range of motion at the initial position to a partial range of motion at the final position you can lift heavier loads with a partial range of motion in the final position and this was adjusted for in both studies now preacher curls don't optimally stretch the biceps since this exercise is performed in shoulder flexion even so the subjects in both studies that trained with a partial range of motion at the initial position would have been stretching the biceps more than the subjects training with a partial range of motion at the final position if the biceps do not benefit from being exposed to a stretch we'd expect similar hypertrophy between both groups but the Salto study found elbow flexor growth across three regions tended to be superior for the partial range of motion at the initial position when we average growth across the three regions it's evident elbow flexor growth was Superior with the partial at the initial position as for the Pedrosa study elbow flexor growth was measured at the 50 and 70 upper arm regions and at the 50 region thickness gains were actually similar between both groups but at the 70 region gains were Superior for the partial at the initial position if we add both regions we can see growth favored the partial at the initial position an interesting consideration is that both studies found considerably more gains at the 70 region for the partial at the initial position this phenomenon of stretched exercises growing this region of a muscle substantially have also been found with the quadriceps muscle group we do actually have another study comparing different range of motions with a biceps exercise that further suggests that biceps May grow more when exposed to stretch this is a 2011 study by Pinto which also had subjects train a preacher coal one group of subjects trained with a full range of motion while another group of subjects trained with a partial range of motion in the middle position increases in elbow flexor growth at around the 60 upper arm length favored the full range of motion group considering the findings of the Sato and Pedrosa studies I think these results are probably in large part since the full range of motion group achieved greatest stretch of the biceps an important consideration with all this range of motion data is although it indicates the stretch the part of a preacher curl is great for building muscle it of course cannot prove an even greater stretch achieved for the curls and shoulder extension would be even better for biceps hypertrophy nonetheless the third area of scientific literature comes from data on the triceps the triceps generally consist of the long medial and lateral heads all three heads pass over their elbow joints but the long head specifically passes over the shoulder joint as well and when you place the shoulder into flexion the long head of the triceps is going to be stretched this is quite similar to the biceps Long Head we know this passes over the shoulder joint too and will be stretched during shoulder extension an overhead extension is a triceps exercise that will train the long head of the triceps in a stretched position since this exercise is performed with the shoulders flexed and here's the key point a great Study last year by Mao compared overhead extensions to push downs and found that overhead extensions produced greater long triceps head volume increases fascinatingly the overhead extensions also produced greater combined medial and lateral head volume increases as well a finding that was unexpected but nicely demonstrates a point many people tend to forget that there are likely still things we do not fully know about muscle hypertrophy of course will dissect this study by Mal plus other relevant research in our Ultimate Guide to developing the triceps that should be released in the upcoming weeks in total these three areas of the scientific literature collectively aren't Crystal Clear proofs curls would show the extension are the single most hypertrophic exercise but I think they're sufficient for us to hypothesize it could be despite these three areas of the scientific literature there's a chance you may have come across people suggesting the biceps should not grow more when exposed to stretch their belief seems to stem from research looking at the length tension relationship of the biceps sarcomas I don't believe this research is strong enough to Warrant a full explanation of it in this video so for those interested in the full dissection of it my views can be found at the link on screen essentially I simply do not believe we can look at one area of the scientific literature that has an array of potential limitations and make definitive conclusions about whether the biceps grow more in response to stretch or not especially considering when other areas of the scientific literature as we analyzed provide solid grounds to speculate the biceps May indeed grow more in response to stretch I will point out for the same reasons people speculated the triceps should not grow more in response to stretch that is they believe the length tension relationship studies on the triceps sarcomas meant the triceps shouldn't grow more when exposed to stretch but as we saw with a mouse study released last year the triceps Longhead grew more in response to stretch nevertheless you can be sure that if any future research emerges about how the biceps May respond to stretching based exercises we'll have a video on the house of hypertrophy to update you all as an additional part to this section we know incline curls and cable face away curves are two ways you could train the biceps in a great stretched position but are there any differences between either of them that makes one better than the other some suggest cable faceware costs are better as they provide more consistent biceps Force production throughout the range of motion versus incline curls however I'm skeptical this matters that much for hypertrophy if training a muscle with consistent Force production throughout a range of motion was crucial for muscle hypertrophy variable resistance should build more muscle for those unaware variable resistance is typically achieved with machines that vary the resistance throughout the range of motion resulting in the muscle being challenged in there equally throughout it four Studies have examined the effectiveness of training with variable resistance compared to using normal resistance and all of them find similar muscle hypertrophy between the two two of these involved biceps training one of them was this 2018 paper which compared variable to normal resistance Gene preacher curse and found similar arm circumference gains between the two the second one was this 1995 study which again compared variable to normal resistance Preacher machine curls and observe similar biceps cross-sectional area gains between the two since these two studies only use the preacher curl it's not a guarantee that these findings apply to curling with a shoulder extended but I do think it could be the case that regardless of the resistance profile of an exercise taking your repetitions to or at least near failure sufficiently stimulates the biceps therefore I'm currently not sold on the idea that cable face away curls would truly be superior to inclined dumbbell curls so for now I'd say an individual should select whichever they prefer now I just mentioned about taking your repetitions to or narrative failure to sufficiently stimulate the biceps and I believe this is a point worth expanding on to understand what I consider to be one of the most important biceps training tips we first need a brief understanding of how muscle hypertrophy occurs that is when you lift weights what happens inside of the muscle that ultimately causes it to get bigger one of the most frequent explanations is that the muscle experiences microtest when lifting and the body repairs these while growing the muscle others might suggest that the Burning Sensations and the pump are what Drive the muscle to grow however most people are unfortunately unaware that the overall scientific literature fails to support these as strong drivers of muscle hypertrophy we've thoroughly dissected this scientific literature in a previous video so feel free to check out that video afterwards if you're interested as we detailed in that video the scientific literature in instead indicates that mechanical tension is likely the primary stimulus behind muscle hypertrophy what on Earth is mechanical tension your muscles produce tension in other words Force there are two kinds of tension your muscles can produce passive tension and active tension it turns out that throughout your muscles our mechanosensors that can detect these two kinds of tension and convert this tension into a signal that produces hypertrophy but what precisely are passive and active tension passive tension is produced when the muscle is stretched a rubber band may help you understand passive tension when you stretch a rubber band it produces passive tension to try and resist the stretch when you let go of the rubber band that passive tension will snap it back into its original position various structures throughout the muscle such as a particular protein within muscle fibers as well as the connective tissue surrounding muscle fibers a what generate passive tension as for active tension this is the contractile Force generated by the muscles fibers interestingly your muscles can generate greater passive tension while the muscle is also generating active tension perhaps this is why passive tension alone such as done during static stretching isn't the most effective for building muscle but passive tension with active tension such as during an exercise that achieves a stretch is powerful for building muscle so this might be one of the reasons is behind why achieving a stretch during an exercise is great for building muscle but there certainly could be other reasons stretched during an exercise is beneficial remember we still don't know everything about muscle hypertrophy nevertheless focusing on active tension it is clear to see that during an exercise we're going to want to ensure we recruit as many muscle fibers as possible and have those fibers Produce High respective active tension this should enable the mechanosensors within and around the muscle fibers to detect the active tension leading to a hypertrophy signal that makes many of these various fibers increase in size leading to a more developed muscle overall taking your repositions to or at least near failure is one of the most critical things for ensuring you achieve High muscle fiber Recruitment and respective tension from the fibers this is simply because as you net failure your central nervous system tends to recruit additional muscle fibers in attempt to sustain your repetition performance various fibers may also technically increase their tension production throughout this as well therefore regardless of whatever biceps curling exercise you're performing taking your repetitions to or at least near failure should not be underestimated for creating a powerful biceps hypertrophy stimulus a 2017 paper by martorelli nicely demonstrates this point 89 previously untrained women were recruited and assigned into one or three groups a failure non-failure equal sets and non-failure plus one group all three group trained the barbell biceps curl twice a week for 10 weeks the failure group e-session performed three sets of repetitions to failure with a 70 One Rate Max load the non-failure equal set group each session performed three sets of seven reps with a 70 One Rate Max low now with a 70 One Rate Max load on the barbell biceps curl the data in this study suggests subjects could perform a maximum of 12 to 13 repetitions therefore this non-failure group will stop five to six reps from failure on the first set and in their second and third set due to cumulative fatigue they probably got slightly closer to failure the non-failure plus one group performed four sets of seven reps with a 70 One Rate Max load so they would have had a similar proximity to failure to the other non-failure group the only difference being this group performs an extra set all groups rested two minutes between their sets in a session and one rep max was retested on the fifth week to readjust the seventy percent of one right Max training loads by the end of the study elbow flexor growth measured at around 60 of the upper arm length was Superior for the failure group we can see that the average differences between the non-failure and failure group was large the non-failure plus one group saw slightly better games than a non-failure equal set group but even still average gains for this group were fairly far off the failure group this study perfectly demonstrates with the exact same exercise biceps hypertrophy is seriously impacted by how close you get to failure granted this study was conducted on previously untrained women but you'd presume these findings should extend to other demographics for the simple reasons we previously outlined that is getting to or at the very least near failure optimizes mechanical tension do you have to train to complete failure on every sets you'd have noticed I've been saying to or at the very least near failure the reason for this is we do have other research looking at different exercises and muscle groups finding that stopping shy or failure perhaps around three to one reps from failure can produce similar hypertrophy to training to failure therefore I do think stopping just shy of failure is largely perfectly fine too although one potential problem with this is some people might underestimate their proximity to failure you may think you stopped two reps from failure but in reality you were five reps from failure because of this I think it's worthwhile for an individual so long as they are healthy and able to do so to gain some good experience with training to failure in order to best help the accuracy when or if they do go about stopping a certain number of reps from failure [Music] here's a graph demonstrating the cross-sectional area of the biceps across its regions we can see its largest in the middle to lower regions with decreasing size as you get near the upper and very lowest portions of the muscle bear in mind this is just the average of the subject's assist so this precise shape won't identically apply to all nevertheless when training the biceps it may be common for people to assume it grows equally in all its regions but this largely doesn't happen many of you might have recognized this since quite a few studies already outlined in this video demonstrated this recall the Sato and pedrosis studies finding partial range of motion preacher codes in the initial position considerably develop the 70 region of the muscle moreover we mentioned this 2011 study from Brazil which involves subjects training the biceps directly with a barbell biceps curl an elbow flexor thickness gains occurred in three regions but the gains were largest at the 50 region with slightly less growth at the 60 and 70 regions why do the biceps not grow evenly across its regions there are a few possibilities we have some interesting analyzes showing during elbow flexion not all regions of the bicep shorten equally this might play a role in why some regions of the biceps grow more than others we also mentioned that on average the biceps tends to contain more fast twitch than slow twitch muscle fibers however different regions of the biceps can contain different proportions of slow and fast twitch muscle fibers this matters because fast twitch muscle fibers actually possess greater hypertrophy potential versus slow twitch fibers therefore the regions that grow more may just be areas that have a higher proportion of fast twitch muscle fibers it is also possible that within the biceps there are subgroups of muscle fibers that have slightly different functions to one another therefore a certain biceps exercise May more so Target particular subgroups of muscle fibers and less so other subgroups will return to this point more soon [Music] so the biceps do not grow equally across its regions but another fascinating point is different people even if they're training the same biceps exercise do not see the same growth across the biceps regions demonstrating this a 2017 study by dank Hill and colleagues had five trained men perform dumbbell biceps curls for 21 days and evaluated elbow flexor growth at the 50 60 and 70 upper arm regions here are the results showing how each subject grew the three regions and individual differences are clear subject 1 tended to grow the 50 region the most subject two grew the 60 and 70 regions equally with less growth at the 50 region subject 3 only really experienced growth at the 60 region subject force or the best growth at the 70 region but still saw great growth at the 50 and 60 regions while subjects 5 saw increasingly more growth up to the 70 region why does this happen remember we've detailed how not everyone has the same biceps morphology people can have different Origins and insertions of their biceps heads and there are individuals out there with more than two biceps Heads This is potentially a strong basis as to why people do not grow the same regions of the biceps equally the regions of the biceps that may contain a higher proportion of fast which muscle fibers probably drastically differ between people and if the biceps do contain subgroups of muscle fibers with different functions the location of these subgroups might also differ between people I think it's important to mention that this Regional hypertrophy isn't super crazy we're only talking about a slight difference in growth at certain regions most people are still growing all regions well so it's not like this data means your biceps are going to end up looking weird or oddly shaped like a bimodal distribution nevertheless we've so far seen the biceps do not grow equally across its regions and different people even if they're training the same biceps exercise do not even see the same growth across the regions of the biceps but an interesting question is for a single person do different biceps exercises produce different growth across their regions of the biceps potentially various lines of the scientific literature indicate that different biceps exercises potentially Target different regions meaning that training with a few different biceps exercises could be favorable for development of the biceps across its regions firstly we've touched on the idea that a few papers suggest within the biceps there are subgroups of muscle fibers that have slightly different functions to one another more precisely some papers indicate various subgroups of muscle fibers are only involved in elbow flexion while other subgroups are involved in a combination of elbow flexion and supination of the forearm another study suggests that when applying isometric elbow flexion forces in different directions not all the muscle fibers within the biceps operate identically thus though these papers can't prove this since they didn't strictly look at different biceps exercises it's possible the subgroups of muscle fibers within the biceps are targeted differently with different biceps exercises secondly we have this 2021 study by Costa and colleagues the researchers recruited men and assigned them into a varied group or non-varied group the non-varied group performed this program and we can see they performed the same workouts on Monday Wednesday and Friday for the biceps they only trained the barbell biceps curl though technically lap pull Downs can also be considered to train the biceps the varied group performed this program and we can see they perform different workouts on Monday Wednesday and Friday for the biceps we can see they trained the barber biceps color Monday like the non-varied group did but on Wednesday they trained cable preacher course and on Friday they trained incline dumbbell curves it's worth just noticing the lap pull-down variations also differed across these three days after eight weeks of training the varied group tended to experience better growth across the three elbow flexor regions particularly at the 50 and 60 regions and total growth of the elbow flexors were slightly more with a varied group a potential explanation for these results is what we mentioned that different biceps exercises May preferentially Target different regions meaning training with a few different biceps exercises more favorably develop the biceps across its regions though there certainly are caveats to this conclusion it's difficult to know how the inclusion of lap pools and variations impacted outcomes we also established that different people do not always grow the same regions identically and given the two groups involved to different people it's possible this may have influenced the outcomes lastly I think the fact that varied group performed the incline curl which we established to potentially be one of the best biceps exercises due to its great stretch of the muscle could be the primary reason for the greater overall elbow flexor growth with a varied group nonetheless moving forward the third area of scientific research that potentially suggests different biceps exercises could Target different regions is a 2019 study from the USA in one session trained men perform the nine sets of cable curves with the shoulders neutrally positioned we can call this the non-varied training session in a different session the trained men perform three sets of cable cars for the shoulders neutrally positioned three sets of cable curls with the shoulders extended and three sets of cable curls with the shoulders flexed we can call this the varied training session it was found immediately after the training sessions Echo intensity of the middle biceps region increased similarly between the non-varied and varied training sessions however Echo intensity at the lower portion of the biceps increase more with the very training session Echo intensity may be considered an indicator of the strain experienced by a muscle region therefore these results May imply the varied session cause more strain at the lower region versus the non-varied session supporting the idea that different biceps exercises May Target different regions now this is not an actual measure of muscle hypertrophy after training period and there is some ambiguity about what Echo intensity truly measures so this isn't high quality evidence lastly as we'll see in The Ultimate Guide to developing the triceps to be released over the coming weeks we have evidence that if you get a person to train one arm with a certain triceps exercise and their other arm with a different triceps exercise the two arms see different growth across the regions of the long head of the triceps perhaps this logic similarly extends the biceps all in all if we combine these four areas of the scientific evidence outlined although each of them have their limitations they all potentially Point towards the idea of different biceps exercises targeting different regions it's interesting to know that Arnold himself seems to allude to the idea that different biceps exercises grow different regions in his book at the end of the day there's not really a catastrophic downside to performing a few different biceps exercises in your program some people may enjoy the variation and of course if what's being speculated here is correct you may end up better developing the biceps across its regions to clarify and make sure no one is confused I still believe that curls with the shoulders extended may be the single most hypertrophic biceps exercise that is this exercise might generate the greatest net to magnitude of biceps hypertrophy however it's just that it might not optimally grow every single region of the biceps meaning that other different exercises may be helpful like the costs and the paper of the USA study did in addition to the curl with the shoulders extended you may perform a curl with the shoulders neutrally positioned and occur with the shoulders flexed before moving on to the next section it's worthwhile to shout out the alpha progression app here again for the reason it includes a custom workout generator and this gives you the option to focus on the biceps muscle and you'll see selecting this will generate a program in line with the recommendations presented here a few biomechanically different biceps exercises are programmed so for those who want guidance or ideas about programming for hypertrophy I'm hoping this can be really useful the training variables deployed are grounded in various areas of the scientific literature plus the generator has great flexibility you can factor in what equipment you have available so if you only have a pair of dumbbells this is not a problem how long do you want your workouts to be and how often you want to train furthermore the workouts generated are still editable to your liking allowing you to individualize things as you see fit again the link in the comments and description gives you two weeks free of the app's premium features including the workout generator if you do like it and end up subscribing to the app This truly helps supports the house of hypertrophes to continue making videos like this remember not everyone just has a long and short head there are people out there with more heads and at this time it's not clear if certain exercises could preferentially Target the supernumerary heads nevertheless with the long and short heads since both of them are highly involved in elbow flexion and supination we know it's going to be impossible to completely isolate either head but do certain biceps exercises preferentially Target either let's imagine for a second they did some believe that targeting the long head specifically can change the shape of the biceps to look something like what Arnold had but this is most likely not true through comparing Arnold to Sergio Oliver it becomes apparent although they both unquestionably have impressive biceps the shape is vastly different indicating that the appearance of your biceps Peak is genetically determined in Arnold's book he notes himself his outstanding biceps development is largely hereditary like Tom Platt's dies going on to further mention how people have biceps that aren't shaped identically so even though the particular shape of your biceps is largely determined by genetics is it possible for us to preferentially train either the long or short heads I think you might be able to but at the same time I do have some skepticism let me first detail the most widely suggested way to preferentially Target the long and short heads and then I'll provide some thoughts earlier we mentioned that a curl with the shoulder extended might be the best single biceps exercise due to its great stretch but it is widely speculated these types of curls preferentially develop the long head over the short head why is this both the lung and short head originate from the scapular but only the long head directly travels through the shoulder joints meaning the long head would presumably be stretched to a greater degree during curls with the shoulder extended therefore the logic is that this means the long head will experience a greater stimulus above that of the short head as for preferentially targeting the short head it is believed curls with the shoulder flexed achieve this again if the long hair travels directly through the shoulder joints but when it's placed in flexion it will be shortened somewhat therefore the logic is that this means the long head cannot contribute as much force to curls during shoulder flexion leaving the short head to be biased I think these ideas sound convincing and they certainly could be true but the reason I remain skeptical is simply because we don't have research actually measuring short and long head hypertrophy that can confirm this now let's say what's being speculated is correct that curls with a shoulder extended May bias the long head and curls with the shoulders flexed May bias to short head I think it's worth mentioning I don't believe this means the non-biased heads experience little hypertrophy in the exercises other areas of the literature lead me to speculate this let me explain let's take the curls with the shoulders extended first many might have the Assumption since the long head is nicely stretched and should receive a great stimulus this automatically means the short head should see a diminished stimulus perhaps they may think of it like a seesaw as a particular muscle is stimulated more the other muscle or muscles in the exercise see a much lower stimulus I do think this logic can be true under some circumstances but I'm unsure if it applies to this particular circumstance take the example of the hamstrings the hamstrings in addition to the semitendinosis and semimembranosis include the biceps femoral short head and Long Head I'll refer to these two as the BF Longhead and bf short head the BF Longhead crosses both the hip and knee joints while the BF short head crosses only the knee joint due to this the BF long head will be stretched in hip flexion this means that seated Legos due to it involving hip flexion will stretch out of the BF long head more compared to an exercise like the lylico which involves loves no hip flexion on the other hand the BF short head would be trained at a similar length during both the seated and Langley curls I.E it isn't stretched anymore during seated versus lying Legos we have this study by Mao finding the BF Longhead grew more with seated Legos versus langleykos which is what we'd expect since the BF Longhead is stretched more with seated Legos but how did BF short head growth compare between the two exercises if you're thinking of the Seesaw analogy since the BF Longhead grew more with seated Lego's you may be tempted to think the BF shorthead would have received the less of a stimulus and therefore should have grown more with langler curls but this did not happen BF short head growth was similar between both the seated and lying Legos applying this back to curls with the shoulders extended just because the long head May indeed see great hypertrophy due to the stretch I don't believe this means the short head will experience any compromised gains it could grow very well additionally it's one worth pointing out with a short head still originates from the coracoid process so it is likely still somewhat stretched during curls with the shoulder extended turning our attention to curls with the shoulders flexed although it's possible the short head will be biased here as the long head is somewhat shortened I think it's plausible the long head still grows very well take the example of the rexins femoris which is one of the muscle heads of the quadriceps this muscle crosses both the hip and knee joints and it will actually be partly shortened during hip flexion much in the same way the biceps long head will be partly shortened during shoulder flexion however leg extensions which are commonly performed with around 90 degrees of hip flexion produce substantial rectus femoris hypertrophy in the same way the long head may still experience significant hypertrophy with curls in shoulder flexion despite it being partly shortened in my attempt to make this video as detailed as possible it's worth noting there exist other suggestions as how someone may preferentially Target either the long or short biceps heads some suggest performing curls with the shoulders rotated outwards external rotation better align the fibers of the long head to carry out elbow flexion over the short head's fibers conversely performing curls with the shoulders rotated inwards internal rotation better align the fibers of the short head to carry out elbow flexion over the long head this is a possibility however I again have some skepticism as to whether this slight better alignment of fibers in either case is enough to measurably make a difference in actual mechanical tension experienced by the heads and subsequent hypertrophy others have suggested the grip width used on a bar during a curl impacts whether the long or short biceps head are biased there are actually conflicting views with some suggesting narrower grips bias the long head While others suggest wider grips bias the long head unfortunately I'm unaware of any high quality evidence that can verify either of these claims [Music] there are various surface electromyography abbreviated to semg analyzes comparing different biceps exercises for those unaware semg involves strapping electrodes to a muscle and recording the signals you receive with the belief this provides an insight into the muscles activation in fact you may be aware that various content creators online may have used their own personal semg equipment to compare different biceps exercises but how useful is this firstly here's a table summarizing the results of all the published official and unofficial semg studies comparing different biceps exercises you can see the analyzes were quite different and there are some conflicting findings for example this study found slightly higher semg recordings during a straight barbell curl versus a easy bar curl yet another study observes similar semg recordings between the easy bar curl and straight bar curl if you've followed this channel for a while you likely know that I'm highly critical of using semg to specifically compare different exercises for the reasons nicely presented by two papers by vygotsky and colleagues semg is simply not a validated way to predict muscle hypertrophy and it has numerous potential pitfalls semg doesn't truly measure muscle activation it's an estimate of the electrical signal sent to the muscle and there exists multiple pitfalls that mean semg can inaccurately record the electrical signal sent to a muscle we have instances where semg data conflicts with a research that actually measures muscle hypertrophy for example we have some semg data finding during a squat there's High semg recordings from directors for more as part of the quadriceps yes research measuring rectus femoris hypertrophy after training with a back squat fail to observe any significant rectus femoris hypertrophy as another example this semg analysis observed higher semg recordings from the quadriceps during leg extension isometric contractions at a short versus long length yet research finds greater quadriceps hypertrophy after training with leg extension isometric contractions at a long versus short length due to these reasons I simply don't believe it's Justified to use semg data to recommend what may be the most favorable biceps exercises it's worth noting there are certainly other valid uses of semg that aren't directly related to muscle hypertrophy so I'm not saying surface electromyography is a useless piece of equipment rather it just doesn't appear to be useful for comparing different exercises for muscle hypertrophy interestingly some of the early uses of semg were seemingly for various disorders [Music] throughout this video we've only been talking about isolation exercises which involve movement at only one joint but compound exercises which involve movement at two or more joints are highly used in most training programs vertical pulling compound exercises such as lap pull Downs or pull-ups as well as horizontal pulling exercises such as cable rows or barbell rows are commonly performed in a program mainly to Target the back muscles however since these two types of compound exercises involve elbow flexion the biceps will be recruited how effective are these types of compound exercises for producing biceps hypertrophy firstly we do have studies that involve only training the biceps with vertical and horizontal pulling exercises and measurable biceps hypertrophy certainly occurs for example this 2016 study out of the USA recruited trained men and had them trained these exercises each session for three sets of 8-12 reps to failure with 2 minutes of rest between sets Through Time a week for eight weeks we can see the lap pull down and cable rows were the only exercises that technically trained the biceps elbow flexor growth measured at around 60 of the upper arm length increased by five percent but does this mean you can maximize biceps hypertrophy with purely compound exercises probably not we have this 2018 study by manorino that directly compared dumbbell rows to dumbbell curls with these training variables used and found elbow flexor growth averaged out from a 25 50 and 75 region were Superior with the dumbbell curls in fact dumbbell rows produce just under 50 percent less growth versus the dumbbell curls a worthwhile point about this study is both the dumbbell rows and dumbbell curls were performed with a supinated grip Rose specifically are not commonly performed with a supinated grip rather a pronated or neutral grip is commonly used we know that the biceps are highly involved in supination and so if this study had subjects trained dumbbell rules with pronated or neutral grip it's likely growth would have been even lower than 50 of the dumbbell cocaines this study did only examine a dumbbell row and some people may be wondering if using a different horizontal pulling exercise such as a barbell row or seated row changes the amount of biceps hypertrophy there are differences between these different horizontal pulling exercises that could technically change the amount of biceps hypertrophy for example horizontal pulling exercises with narrower grips likely involve higher biceps activation but still given the back is frequently going to be the limiting factor in horizontal pulling exercises and the fact that frequently performed with a pronated or neutral grip I think it's Justified to speculate none of them will be on the same level as isolation biceps exercises for biceps hypertrophy on top of this I think there's solid reason to believe that horizontal pulls involve motion that is sub-optimal for building the long head of the biceps particularly let me explain horizontal pulling exercises of course involve motion at both the shoulder and elbow joints during the lowering phase of the exercise the shoulders Flex while the elbow extends during the lifting phase of the exercise the shoulders extend while the elbows flicks this particular lowering and lifting movement might actually be unfavorable for the long head of the biceps specifically remember the long biceps head passes directly over the shoulder joints as the lowering phase of a horizontal pull involves shoulder flexion with elbow extension this means the long biceps head will be shortening at the area of the shoulder joint but be lengthening as the elbow joint during the lifting phase of a horizontal pull the reverse of this happens the long biceps head will be lengthening at the shoulder joint and shortening at the elbow joints this particular motion going from shortened at the first joint lengthen at the second joint to lengthened at the first joint shortened at the second joint seems to be bad for muscle hypertrophy research on the rectus femoris and triceps long had further demonstrate this we know the rectus femoris crosses both the hip and knee joints a squat during the lowering phase involves hip flexion and knee flexion and during this lowering phase the rectus femoris will be shortening at the hip joint and lengthening and the knee joints during the lifting phase of the squat the the reverse happens we have data demonstrating the rectus femoris experiences minimal hypertrophy from squat training with the triceps Long Head we know this crosses the shoulder and elbow joints a bench press during the lowering phase involves shoulder extension and elbow flexion the triceps long head will be shortening at the shoulder joint and lengthening at the elbow joint during the lifting phase of the bench press the reverse happens we have data demonstrating the triceps long head experiences minimal hypertrophy from bench press training all these data may suggest that horizontal pools minimally grow the biceps long head what about vertical pulling compound exercises are these any better for biceps hypertrophy two studies suggest lat pulldowns are highly effective for biceps hypertrophy one of them compared let pull Downs to barbell curls and found similar elpoflexor thickness gains between the two exercises the second one found performing the lap pull down alone was as good for helper flexor thickness gains compared to performing lap pull Downs plus barbell curls in other words the addition of biceps curl select pull down training did not enhance elbow flexor thickness gains however there are some very important limitations with these two studies firstly the author of the two papers was Paulo gentle unfortunately this researcher has previously been involved with sports science studies that are most likely fraudulent as far as I know there aren't any signs these two particular studies are fraudulent by personally remain cautious secondly both studies were conducted on untrained individuals it's very possible that entrained individuals we get different results thirdly elbow flexor thickness was only measured at a single region in both studies we know that biceps do not grow evenly across its regions recall the manorino study compound rose the curls averages out the 25 50 and 75 regions and I think it's possible if these two gentle papers included other regions perhaps there could be a difference on top of these limitations I think the other indirect scientific research would question the ability of vertical pools to produce similar biceps hypertrophy to isolation biceps Curves in both the gentle papers the lap pulldowns were performed with a pronated grip we know supination is one of the predominant functions of the biceps recall much earlier in this video we analyzed the 1998 study from Japan demonstrating how when the elbows are flexed the biceps long and short had have greater activity with a supinated grip as opposed to a pronated grip while the opposite was true for the brachialis and brachioradialis you could actually use this information to speculate that in the one gentle study which directly compared let pull Downs to curls and found similar elbow flexor thickness gains since the elbow flexor measurement included both the biceps and brachialis perhaps more of the elbow flexor thickness gains for their lap pull Downs reflects brachialis growth whereas more of the elbow flexor thickness gains for the curls reflect biceps growth also remember that an interesting fact is to break your radiolis appears to have nerve cells that essentially link it to the biceps and a few papers found that during elbow flexion with a pronated grip the brachioradialis sends signals to the biceps to reduce its activity all this information would imply that any exercise with a pronated grip which is commonly used with vertical pulling exercises wooden optimize biceps tension of course it's actually possible to perform vertical pulling exercises with a supinated grip and chin-ups are one of the most famous examples of this unfortunately there isn't any research directly measuring biceps hypertrophy after training with chin ups but I do think it's reasonable to speculate simply because it involves elbow flexion with supination that it will be a tremendous exercise for developing the biceps although a potential Pitfall with chin UPS is the back muscles can still be the limiting factor and this may slightly compromise the stimulus to the biceps compared to isolation biceps exercises [Music] this is actually just part one of The Ultimate Guide to biceps hypertrophy in part 2 which will be released in the next two weeks we'll dissect what rep ranges volume and training frequency may be ideal for biceps hypertrophy in addition to dissecting some other fascinating science surrounding biceps hypertrophy the reason I'll do this is there have been multiple speculations about what the best training variables might be to develop the biceps more precisely some individuals believe since the biceps tend to contain more fast twitch than slow twitch muscle fibers they should be trained with heavier loads some people also believe the biceps experiences a lot of muscle damage from training and therefore should be trained less frequently we'll examine if the scientific literature supports these ideas nonetheless let us now summarize everything in this video and then provide some exercise selection recommendations the standard textbook details are the biceps contain a long and short head with these Origins and insertions indeed this absolutely applies to many people but as detailed in this paper the biceps are one of the most morphologically variable muscles in the Upper Limb different people can have different Origins and insertions of the heads and there are even people with a third fourth or even Fifth bicep's Head the biceps are highly involved in both elbow flexion and supination of the forearm vertical and horizontal pulling exercises alone are certainly able to produce measurable biceps hypertrophy but for a variety of reasons these exercises are likely not sufficient to optimize biceps development although vertical pulls with a supinated grip like chin UPS likely are very good for biceps development the data shows numerous types of isolation biceps exercises are capable of powerfully increasing bicep size this is very logical at the end of the day numerous biceps isolation exercises involve outperfection with supination with no real motion at other joints but if you pushed me to speculate on what the single most effective biceps exercise could be I would speculate that a curl with a shoulder extended such as done during an incline curl or cable face away curl would be it this is because with the shoulder extended the biceps are placed in a position of stretch and we have research suggesting achieving a stretch during an exercise is great for building muscle having said all this there could potentially be a benefit to training with a few different biceps isolation exercises the biceps do not grow evenly at its regions and different people even if they train the same exercise can experience different growth across their biceps regions but it is probable for a given person different biceps exercises Target different regions of the muscle meaning training with a few different biceps exercises produces better growth across the regions of the muscle to make sure this doesn't confuse anyone I still believe a curl with the shoulder extended is the single biceps exercise that generates the largest bicep volume increases but it just might not optimally develop all the biceps regions making it beneficial to train with additional biceps movements regardless of what exercises you use to train the biceps with making sure you perform your repetitions too or at least very near to failure is crucial for optimizing mechanical tension which has been identified to likely be the primary hypertrophy stimulus indeed we have research shown with the same biceps exercise there's a large difference in biceps hypertrophy between training to failure and stopping multiple reps from failure for those wondering if certain biceps exercises can bias either the long or short head I think it certainly could be possible and there have been numerous speculations on how you may go about doing this however the problem is we just don't currently have sufficient research to prove you can meaningfully bias either head so what's the recommendations it's going to depend on your goals for those who aren't trying to optimize biceps hypertrophy and are trying to train with the least amount of work training with just compound exercises can be great since multiple muscle groups are trained at the same time although vertical and horizontal pulling exercises may not be optimal for biceps hypertrophy for various reasons they certainly can produce measurable biceps hypertrophy recall we previously noted a study at the USA and trained to men that found training the seated row and lap pulled and produced a five percent increase in elbow flexor thickness after eight weeks of training for those who want to go a little further simply training with one isolation biceps exercise in your program can likely deliver great gains we detailed an array of studies demonstrating that numerous isolation biceps exercises are capable of powerfully increasing bicep size so feel free to select whatever you like if you want to go along with my hypothesis feel free to train with a curl and shoulder extension since this might be the single most hypertrophic biceps movement thanks to the stretch for those wanting to take things even further it's possible different biceps exercises Target different regions so you may want to perform a few biomechanically different biceps exercises in your overall program for example you may choose to perform three biceps exercises that differ in the shoulder angle being used of course these aren't the only options you could be somewhere in between these areas just described for example you may choose to perform two isolation biceps exercises in your program and you may base the selection on the simple fact you really like these two biceps isolation exercises as mentioned the second part will be released in the next two weeks which will analyze the data on what rep ranges volume and frequency might be ideal for biceps hypertrophy in addition to other interesting scientific research on the biceps finally you might be interested in a free eBook The Ultimate bench press strength and hypertrophy guide with

    "transcript": "welcome to the house of hypertrophy this fairly recent study has exciting findings about the optimal rep range to build muscle and provides deeper Insight compared to all the other previous research on the topic to get everyone up to speed it's long been believed that the 8 to 12 rep ranges are optimal for building our soul but in the last decade or so a substantial number of studies established this isn't quite true rather reps approximately between 6 and 35 provided they are performed two or very close to failure produce similar muscle growth but these are the average findings from the studies could some people grow more with either higher or lower reps and if so how significant could these differences be this fairly recent study is the first that provides an answer it also aimed to answer the fascinating question of whether changing rep ranges could delay a plateau in growth let's Dive In [Music] the researchers recruited 24 previously untrained women to train the leg press leg extension leg curl and calf raise each for three sets a session training once performed three times a week for 24 weeks one group spent the first 12 weeks training with loads resulting in them achieving voluntary failure in their 8 to 12 rep range while in the following 12 weeks they trained with loads resulting in them achieving voluntary failure in the 27 to 31 rep range the second group did the opposite they spent the first 12 weeks training to voluntary failure in the 27-31 rep range while in the next 12 weeks they trained to voluntary failure in the 8 to 12 rep range since each subject trained both with 8-12 and 27 to 31 reps were able to identify if anyone grew significantly more with either just in case anyone's wondering I did say 27 to 31 reps I have no idea why the researchers use this unorthodox rep range instead of something a little more standard but of course it's not a big deal nonetheless Progressive overload was applied throughout the study by having subjects increase the load they trained with to ensure they reach voluntary failure within the rep range they were training at the time we can't see the subject's progress the loads well within the rep ranges across the study Psy leaves of tissue Mass was measured throughout the study on average phthalene soft tissue Mass increased similarly between both rep ranges thereby aligning with the rest of the scientific literature in their average growth is comparable across different rep ranges but when we look at the individual responses we see something seriously interesting although there certainly were individuals aligning with the average and seeing comparable gains between the 8 to 12 and 27 to 31 rep range other individuals grew more with one or the other with some of the differences being quite significant for example one individual actually decreased their thylene soft tissue mass by approximately five percent when training with 8 to 12 reps but saw just over a 10 increase when training with 27 to 31 reps another individual saw approximately a 13 increase when training with 8-12 reps but only approximately a three percent increase when training with 27 to 31 reps I believe these results are quite exciting imagine you've been training hard with 8-12 reps for numerous months or even years but your dissatisfied with your hypertrophy you may look at the scientific research and figure since hypertrophy is similar across a wide range of reps there's no reason to try something different but these findings are an important addition to the rep range literature since they fundamentally tell us how well you grow with 8 to 12 reps isn't strongly correlated with how well you may grow with higher reps the findings also have implication for the concept of high and low responders it's all too easy to have people perform the same training program and then categorize them as either high or low responders overall however these results tell us that being a high and low responder is specific to the training variables used in this case the rep range before going any further we must address some potential limitations foreign performs 8 to 12 reps in the first 12 weeks and then 27 to 31 reps in the next 12 weeks whereas group 2 did the reverse of this the rate of muscle growth decreases across time so it's possible that any slightly lower gains with one of the rep ranges were due to the subject training it in the final 12 weeks however this absolutely does not explain all the individual differences why because 50 of all subjects saw their greatest increase in thigh soft tissue lean mess with the rep range they trained in the final 12 weeks a second consideration is subjects were instructed to perform repetitions to voluntary failure which isn't necessarily true momentary muscular failure the current literature fails to convincingly support the notion that you must train to failure to maximize the growth from higher or lower reps but you likely need to get fairly close to failure and doing this is harder with 27 to 31 reps so perhaps some subjects fail to get sufficiently close to failure with this rep range thereby explaining why some grew less from it but but I'm unsure of the validity of the speculation and of course it can't explain why some grew more with the 27 to 31 reps finally the subjects were previously untrained women with an average age of 58 and a BMI of 27. I know that some people's instinctual reaction to this will be what on Earth how could you waste my time on this paper house if hypertrophy if you had this reaction I'm assuming you're not a previously untrained woman 58 years of age with a BMI of 27 nevertheless let me describe why this likely isn't a massive limitation firstly we need to ask ourselves if strong data indicates that muscle growth from different rep ranges differs between demographics such that we can be confident the results on untrained women above 50 failed to generalize to others the answer is no remember average muscle growth was similar between the rep ranges in line with the rest of the research that's been conducted on a wide range of other demographics individual differences aren't unique to untrained women above 50 either we've had studies finding in younger trained men the existence of individual differences as we'll see in a second secondly the subjects were healthy enough to tolerate the training they were performing multiple sets of lower body movements to voluntary failure and we saw these graphs demonstrating how they overloaded well across the study we also know meaningful gains occurred in fact the gains are in the ballpark of what we'd expect [Music] these findings may come as a shock to some as perhaps you've had thoughts similar to Mike Minster it is this fact the fact that the principles of human physiology are Universal that makes it possible for me to state with absolute certainty there is only one valid theory of training I.E one best way to train but this isn't the first time we've seen individual differences and I don't anticipate it being the last we've previously dissected this study by Neves finding when trained subjects train their chords with 9 sets a week some subjects grew their courts more when dividing these sets across three days a week While others saw similar gains between training once or three times a week this shouldn't be mistaken for assuming a study's average results are useless a study's average results can be used to push back against myths there are still going to be people who align with averages averages can be a solid starting place and finally not all training variables May display as robust to individual differences why might some people grow more with higher or low reps no definitive answer exists currently some may be tempted to speculate fiber type explains the results that is perhaps people with more slow twitch fibers since these fibers are low Force producing but highly fatigue resistant grow better with higher reps while people with more fast twitch fibers since these fibers are high Force producing but highly fatigable grow better from Low Reps this would appear logical but indirect data would question him the soleus muscle is one of those muscles that's predominantly slow twitch dominant in an abundance of individuals yet previous research found Soleus hypertrophy was comparable between higher and Low Reps so if we don't know why some people may grow more with either higher or lower reps what should we make of this information for now consider different rep ranges as a tool in your toolbox if you're seeing minimal results from training with 8-12 reps assuming all other factors are dialed in then you may wish to give higher reps a try or vice versa another interpretation is since it may be tricky to establish if you respond better to a certain rep range in reality it may be simpler but just to train with different rep ranges in your program that way if you do respond better to

also examined if changing rep ranges could delay a plateau the authors of the study suggested their results indicate it does but I actually disagree with their interpretation the author's position was as follows previous Research indicates the rate of muscle growth slows down a fair bit after 12 weeks but given both groups in the study actually experienced a similar rate of muscle growth in the final 12 weeks to the first 12 weeks and since both groups changed what rep range they were performing halfway through the study the authors interpreted this as successfully delaying a plateau but remember this is the average we can't ignore the individual responses to simplify this let's say we have subjects A and B they trained with 8 to 12 reps in the first 12 weeks and then with 27 to 31 reps in the final 12 weeks subjects a grew well with the 8-12 Reps seeing a 0.8 kilogram increase in thigh soft tissue lean mess but when they switched to the 27-31 rep in the final 12 weeks they grew less seeing only a further 0.1 kilogram increase subject B experienced the reverse they only gained 0.1 kg when training with 8 to 12 reps but they saw a better 0.8 kilogram gain when training with 27 to 31 reps in the final 12 weeks if we average their hyperchief together we see similar growth between the first 12 weeks and the final 12 weeks but this isn't because changing rep ranges delayed a plateau rather it's because different people were growing well at different time points this is what was going on with the majority of the whole data sets if anything this data indicates changing rep ranges may be inferior for certain people so if you're growing well with whatever rep range you're training with it may be ideal to stick to this no no traditionally 8 to 12 reps was considered to be the optimal rep range for building muscle yet a substantial number of studies in the last decade or so demonstrate that reps approximately between 6 and 35 can produce similar muscle growth provided reps are performed two or very close to failure but this is on average this fairly new paper established though people did align with the average others grew meaningfully more with either 8 to 12 or 27 to 31 reps the mechanisms behind this are currently unclear but there might be two implications if you're seeing minimal hypertrophy with a certain rep range trying another may work alternatively just training with different rep ranges in your program could be a decent idea that way if you do respond better to a certain rep range at least part of your training includes that remember to feel

    "transcript": "[Music] welcome to the house of hypertrophy four reps verse 8 reps verse 12 Reps for strength and hypertrophy we're going to examine a recent study from Japan exploring this we'll then detail how this study relates to the rest of the scientific research from which we'll derive highly useful rep range conclusions for those after strength hypertrophy or a combination of the two let's dive in the researchers recruited 42 Physically Active but not resistance trained men later we'll discuss whether the untrained status changes our interpretations subjects were assigned to one or four groups a four 8 12 or control group we won't mention the control group any further they did not train and expectedly made no gains once ever the three groups all train the bench press twice per week for 10 weeks in the first two weeks all groups train the same and pretty easy the first week involved three sets of 10 reps with a 60% one rep max load per session while the second week involved three sets of eight reps with a 70% one rep max load per session I actually think this was a great thing to do it likely helped accustom the untrained subjects to bench press form in the third week the three groups diverged in their training and this week prepared the respective groups for their actual regimen that started from the fourth week onwards specifically the third week involved the four group training with five sets of three repetitions with a 90% one rep max load per session the a group with three sets of six reps with an 80% one rep max load per session and the 12 group with two sets of 10 reps with a 70% one rep max load per session from the fourth week until the end of the study the four group trained with seven sets or four reps with a 90% one rep max load per session the eight group with four sets of eight repetitions with an 80% of one rep max load per session and the 12 group with three sets of 12 reps with a 70% one rep max load per session all subjects rested 3 minutes between sets which is a good strength of this study most studies tend to use short rests one minute or shorter between sets but we know with compound exercises resting longer between sets tends to be advantageous for hypertrophy and strength although 3 minutes of rest between sets were used subjects weren't always able to sustain their target rep numbers across sets due to the relative loads used for example someone in the 12 group may have hit 12 reps on the first set but only 10 or nine in the second and third sets nevertheless as subjects improved and managed to sustain their rep numbers across sets so someone in the 12 group managed to perform 12 reps in all three sets loads were increased by 2.5 kg for the next session this ensured subjects kept training with the relative loads they were supposed to now the reason the set numbers differed between groups is as the researchers wanted to equate volume load the product of sets time reps time load between all three groups before and after the 12 weeks of training strength was assessed via bench press War at Max whereas hypertrophy was evaluated by pella's Major volume this is another strength of the study volume is a 3D measure and takes into consideration the whole of a muscle many studies tend to only look at the cross-sectional area or thickness of a muscle and this is typically done in only a single muscle region it was found P's major volume increased similarly in all three training groups while bench press strength was similar between the four and eight group and both greater than the 12 group so this study suggests four eight and 12 reps are comparable for hypertrophy while 12 reps are notably less effective for strength than four and eight [Music] reps this study adds to the literature indicating a wide range of rep ranges are similarly effective for building muscle the literature indicates this applies to both trained and untrained individuals rep ranges simply aren't overly important for hypertrophy the key is for you to get two or close to failure with your repetitions which was done in the study just overviewed you probably want to get three or fewer reps from failure this runs counter to the popular traditional rep range Contin um which states 6 to 12 reps are superior for building muscle and is commonly seen in classic personal training textbooks and social media posts now we know set numbers were not the same between the three groups as the researchers wanted to equate volume load between them some may be thinking this proves volume load specifically is crucial and correlated with muscle hypertrophy yet I'm very skeptical of this simply because as we explor in another video numerous lines of evidence suggest volume load precisely is not related to gains instead more accurate interpretation may be that lower reps five or fewer are less efficient for stimulating growth per set so require more sets to compensate for this and ultimately achieve similar growth to more reps with fewer sets I say this for two reasons firstly the literature tends to suggest when rep ranges are kept constant more sets produce more hypertrophy up to a point so with a rep range less effective per set its logical performing additional sets can be effective compensation secondly other research supports this a 2016 study from New York had trained men perform three sets per exercise a session and found muscle growth outcomes were largely better when performing 8 to 12 reps the failure per set as opposed to 2 to four reps the failure per set another 2014 study from New York found performing seven sets of three reps to failure were similarly effective for hypertrophy outcomes versus three sets of 10 reps to failure so five or fewer reps are likely less effective per set for hypertrophy but performing extra sets can adequately compensate for this I should also note that one or two reps per set might not be effective for hypertrophy at all we've examined this evidence in another video overall reps between 6 and 35 are likely similarly effective for hypertrophy per set for example yet another 2015 study from New York found in trained men performing three sets per exercise a session hypertrophy outcomes were similar between training with 8 to 12 repetitions to failure and 25 to 35 repetitions to failure some may be thinking h hang on a minute in the initial study we looked at didn't the eight group perform more sets than the 12 group so if per set 6 to 35 reps are similar and more sets tend to be better why didn't the eight group see more gains my speculation is the set number differences were not big enough remember the eight group just performed one more set per session than the 12 group summarizing this section a wide range of rep ranges are similarly effective for hypertrophy in untrained and trained folks per set reps between 6 and 35 are likely similarly effective 3 to five reps may be less efficient for hypertrophy as it may require you to perform extra sets for those who care about time efficiency this can be notable here are the session durations from the initial Japanese study we assist the four groups spent nearly double the time training the bench press per session versus their eight and 12 groups recall bench press strength gains were lowest for the 12 group in the study this agrees with the rest of the literature in that heavier loads and thus lower repetitions are superior for increasing one rep max strength interestingly the four and eight groups saw similar strength gains the fact subjects were untrained may be relevant here as there's potential evidence to believe in more trained individuals for rep would be superior to eight reps for strength for example we noted one study out of New York comparing entrained individuals three sets of two to four reps to failure per exercise to three sets of 8 to 12 reps to failure per exercise though we noted hypertrophy outcomes were largely greater for the 8 to 12 reps strength gains on the bench press and squat were actually greater for the two to four rep group so in total heavier load and lower rep training five or few rips should probably make up a large part of a strength oriented program another point I'd like to touch on is the fact that initial Japanese study very interestingly looked at correlations between bench press strength gains and pector major growth for both the four and eight groups there was no correlation between them yet for the 12 group there was indeed a correlation between strength gains and size gains these findings are probably quite logical m size likely contributes to strength as muscle growth achieved via an increase in contractile components increases your strength capacity yet we also know adaptations in the nervous system that result in your brain and or spinal cord sending stronger electrical signals to the muscle also play a role in strength heavier low training tends to stimulate these nervous system adaptations more thus the lack of correlation between strength and muscle in the four and eight groups is probably because nervous system adaptations clouded the effects of hypertrophy on strength whereas the 12 group probably experienced fewer nervous system adaptations perhaps explaining why we were able to see a strength and size correlation with them I think this finding has a potentially interesting implication as an individual becomes more and more trained and essentially maxes out nervous system adaptations and other non- hypertrophy related factors like movement efficiency muscle growth is one Avenue by which you can further increase strength we know heavier or low training five or few reps can stimulate both nervous system and hypertrophy adaptations but given you've maxed the nervous system adaptations you should be more concerned about the hypertrophy aspect however we know that five or fewer reps may not be efficient for hypertrophy you need extra sets and because you've maxed out nervous system adaptations and now only care about hypertrophy using higher reps can be viable in this context for increasing your strength efficiently having said all of this a limitation is I have no idea when nervous system adaptations could max out it's commonly believed the bulk of nervous system adaptations occurs within the first few months of heavy enough training and this may indeed be true yet there's still evidence of further nervous system adaptations in well-trained individuals another problem is it's theoretically possible someone maximizes or at least practically maximizes their hypertrophy before they even maximize nervous system adaptations overall more research is needed in this area at the very least the logic we've overviewed probably demonstrates that higher rep training in strength oriented athletes can very well be [Music] justifiable based on the initial study overviewed plus some other evidence we overviewed I think it's reasonable to say approximately that eight rep range is highly efficient for concurrently developing strength and muscle it's not too heavy such that you have to perform extra sets for hypertrophy but it's still heavy enough to be great at stimulating nervous system adaptations for untrained individuals it might be similarly effective to heavy loads for stimulating these nervous system adaptations while in more trained individuals it may not be quite as good but it's still likely is respectably effective on top of this there's some evidence that heavy or low training below five rips may not be the most favorable for joint health in select individuals for example one of the affir studies out of New York reported that in two of 10 individuals training with seven sets of three reps to failure per exercise joint related injuries occurred training around the eight rep range May limit this problem [Music] crystallizing everything 6 to 35 reps are likely similarly effective per set for stimulating hypertrophy training with three to five reps may require you to perform extra sets to see similar hypertrophy for strength heavier loads and lower reps five or fewer reps tend to be better particularly in trained individuals finally the eight rep range zone is likely highly efficient for concurrently developing strength and muscle if

    "title": "Leaving More Than 3 Reps in Reserve vs Training to Failure (Research Overview)",
    "published_at": "2021-12-06T11:41:39Z",
    "transcript": "In a recent video, we detailed how there's\ngood evidence leaving 3 to 0 repetitions in reserve produces similar muscle hypertrophy\nto training to failure. Leaving 0 repetitions in reserve indicates\nyou could not have done another full repetition while leaving 3 repetitions in reserve indicates\nyou could have performed another 3 full repetitions. Also, we're defining failure as technical\nfailure, the point at which you fail at performing another full repetition with correct execution. This was essentially the definition used in\nthe studies we examined, and for muscle hypertrophy, it makes little to deviate from using the\ncorrect execution, as doing so would typically not benefit the tension experienced by the\nmuscles you're trying to train. For instance, in a biceps curl, deviating\nfrom correct execution via excessively swinging your back will recruit the spinal erector\nmuscles. But this won't enhance elbow flexor recruitment. It might decrease elbow flexor recruitment\nin certain circumstances. With those clarifications out the way, as\nnoted, leaving 3 to 0 repetitions in reserve likely produces similar hypertrophy to training\nto failure. But what about leaving more than 3 repetitions\nin reserve? Could leaving 4, 5, 6, or even more repetitions\nin reserve still optimize muscle hypertrophy? By my count, 4 regular longitudinal studies\nhave technically examined how leaving more than 3 repetitions in reserve compares to\ntraining to failure for hypertrophy. Let's analyze them. Martorelli et al. allocated 89 previously\nuntrained women into one of three groups: a failure, non-failure equal set, or non-failure\n+1 set group. All three groups trained the barbell biceps\ncurl twice per week for 10 weeks. The failure group performed the exercise with\n3 sets of repetitions to failure with a 70% one-rep max load each session. The non-failure equal set group performed\n3 sets of 7 repetitions with a 70% one-rep max load each session. With a 70% one-rep max load on the barbell\nbiceps curl, the data provided in the study suggests subjects could perform a maximum\nof 12-13 repetitions. Meaning this non-failure equal set group would\nhave been leaving rouglhy 5 to 6 repetitions in reserve on their first set. However, their 2nd and 3rd sets, due to cumulative\nfatigue, would have probably had them leave roughly 4-2 repetitions in reserve. The non-failure +1 set group performed 4 sets\nof 7 repetitions with a 70% one-rep max load each session. This group would have also been training with\nroughly between 6 to 2 repetitions in reserve, the only difference being they performed an\nextra set per session. All groups rested 2 minutes between their\nsets in a session. Moreover, one-rep max was retested on the\n5th week to readjust the 70% one-rep max training loads used for all groups. By the end of the study, increases in elbow\nflexor thickness seemed to be greatest for the failure group. Therefore, this study suggests regardless\nof whether an individual performs the same number of sets, or performs one extra set,\nleaving more than 3 repetitions in reserve for the majority of your sets may be inferior\nfor hypertrophy. Do the other studies support this conclusion? Let's find out. The second study by Lasevicius et al. assigned\n25 previously untrained men into either a high load or low load group. All subjects performed the unilateral leg\nextension twice per week for 8 weeks. The high load group used an 80% one-rep max\nload. With one leg, which we'll call the high load\nfailure leg, they performed 3 sets of repetitions to failure every session. Ultimately, this leg performed 12 repetitions\non average in each set. With their other leg, which we'll call the\nhigh load non-failure leg, they performed 60% of the average repetitions achieved each\nset with the high load failure leg. Moreover, they performed additional sets to\nequalize the overall volume load (the product of sets x reps x load) to the high load failure\nleg. Ultimately, this leg performed an average\nof 5-6 sets of 7 repetitions, meaning they would have been leaving an average of 5 repetitions\nin reserve while performing 2-3 extra sets versus the high load failure leg. The low load group used a 30% one-rep max\nload. With one leg, which we'll call the low load\nfailure leg, they performed 3 sets of repetitions to failure every session. Ultimately, this leg performed 34 repetitions\non average in each set. With their other leg, which we'll call the\nlow load non-failure leg, they performed 60% of the average repetitions achieved each set\nwith the low load failure leg, and they performed additional sets to equalize the overall volume\nload to the low load failure leg. Ultimately, this leg performed an average\nof 5-6 sets of 20 repetitions, meaning they would have been leaving an average of 14 repetitions\nin reserve while performing 2-3 extra sets versus the low load failure leg. All subjects rested 2 minutes between their\nsets in a session. Moreover, one-rep max was retested during\nthe 4th week to readjust the 30% and 80% one-rep max training loads used for the respective\ngroups. By the end of the study, except for the low\nload non-failure leg, all the other legs experienced similar increases in quadriceps cross-sectional\narea. As a result, given the low load-non failure\nleg experienced the least growth, this suggests leaving an average of 14 repetitions in reserve\nmay be unable to optimize muscle hypertrophy, despite them performing 2-3 extra sets compared\nto the failure legs. However, given the high load non-failure leg\nexperienced similar growth to the high load and low load failure legs, this suggests leaving\nan average of 5 repetitions in reserve might actually be fine for muscle hypertrophy, so\nlong as 2-3 extra sets are performed. Stated another way, performing 5-6 sets while\nleaving roughly 5 repetitions in reserve may be as effective as performing 3 sets of repetitions\nto failure. This is interesting, perhaps on a set equated\nbasis, performing 3 sets of repetitions to failure would be superior to performing 3\nsets of leaving 5 repetitions in reserve (as somewhat supported by the Martorelli study). However, performing extra sets while leaving\n5 repetitions in reserve compensates for this. Having said this, the third study by Karsten\net al. questions this. 18 men with 2-5 years of training experience\nwere assigned into a failure or non-failure group. Both groups trained a range of exercises twice\nper week for 6 weeks. The failure group aimed to perform every exercise\neach session with 4 sets of 10 repetitions to failure while using 2 minutes of rest between\nsets. When needed, the load was increased if they\ncould do more than 10 repetitions on a set, or if they could not complete the 10 repetitions,\n30 seconds of rest was given to enable them to complete this number. The non-failure group aimed to perform every\nexercise each session with 8 sets of 5 repetitions that left roughly 5 repetitions in reserve,\nwith 1 minute of rest between sets. When needed, this group adjusted the load\neach set to maintain roughly 5 repetitions in reserve. By the end of the study, increases in thickness\nof the vastus medialis and elbow flexors tended to be greater for the failure group, whereas\nanterior deltoid thickness increases were similar between both groups. As a result, this study conflicts with the\nLasevicuis study, as it largely suggests despite performing extra sets (4 in this case), leaving\nroughly 5 repetitions in reserve was unable to optimize muscle hypertrophy. Why the conflicting findings between these\ntwo studies? For one, the Laseviciuis study used previously\nuntrained men, while the Karsten study used men with 2-5 years of training experience. Maybe this implies leaving 5 repetitions in\nreserve, and performing extra sets, only works in untrained individuals and not those with\ngreater training experience. Secondly, as we noted, if the failure group\nin the Karsten study could not complete 10 repetitions on a set, they were given a 30-second\nbreak to enable them to then achieve this number. This is somewhat like rest-pause training. Frustratingly, the researchers did not state\nhow frequently subjects did this, but if it was frequent, perhaps this could somehow explain\nthe conflicting results between the two studies, as the Lasevicuis study merely had the failure\ngroups perform their repetitions to failure (nothing more, nothing less). Thirdly, in the Lasevicuis study, all subjects\nrested 2 minutes between their sets in a session. Opposingly, the Karsten study had the failure\ngroup rest 2 minutes between sets and the non-failure group rest only 1 minute between\nsets. This potentially confounds the Karsten study,\nas it's likely resting for 2 minutes between sets is better than resting for 1 minute between\nsets for hypertrophy, at least with compound exercises. Therefore, the largely inferior results for\nthe non-failure group might not necessarily be because they left 5 repetitions in reserve,\nrather because they only rested 1 minute between sets. Unfortunately, it's difficult to say which\nof these three explanations, was it down to the differences in training experience, the\npotential rest-pause style in the Karsten study, or rest intervals that explains the\nconflicting findings of the Lasevicius and Karsten studies, more research is undoubtedly\nrequired. *PAUSE* The last regular longitudinal study I'm aware\nof that has examined how leaving more than 3 repetitions in reserve compares to training\nto failure comes from Carroll et al. 15 men with an average of 7.7 years of training\nexperience were allocated into a relative intensity or rep max group. Both groups trained three times per week for\n10 weeks. Quite an intricate periodized training plan\nwas used for both groups. The link to the full study can be found in\nthe description for those after more details, but I'll simplify the main points. Both groups performed the same exercises (mainly\ncompound exercises, with some isolation work) for the same number of sets and roughly the\nsame number of repetitions. The rep max group used rep max loads for their\nsets. For example, they may have performed an exercise\nfor 3 sets of 8-12 repetitions with a 10 repetition maximum load. The researchers stated this group reached\nfailure on the last set of each exercise. Moreover, I think it's probably likely their\nother sets would have left 3 or fewer repetitions in reserve, which we know is fine for muscle\nhypertrophy. The relative intensity group used around 70-90%\nof the rep max loads for an exercise. For instance, if someone in the relative intensity\ngroup could perform 3 sets of 8-12 repetitions with a 100kg load on an exercise, and this\n100kg load was their 10 rep-max load, using an 85% relative intensity resulted in them\nperforming 3 sets of 8-12 repetitions with an 85kg load. Based on some calculations, this relative\nintensity group would have been leaving around 2 to 6 repetitions in reserve on two of the\ntraining days per week, and between 4-14 repetitions in reserve on the 3rd day of each week. By the end of the study, increases in vastus\nlateralis anatomical cross-sectional area favored the relative intensity group. In other words, with all other training variables\nequal, largely leaving more than 3 repetitions in reserve (which is what the relative intensity\ngroup did) was more favorable for growth compared to training to or closer to failure (which\nis what the rep max group did). Having said this, there is a potential confounding\nfactor in this study. Both groups performed additional sprint training\ntwice per week. Training to failure is more fatiguing than\nleaving repetitions in reserve, and thus added sprint training may have impaired the rep\nmax group's recovery capacity, thereby possibly explaining why they experienced suboptimal\ngrowth versus the relative intensity group. If true, perhaps this study indicates if an\nindividual performs additional high-intensity training (like sprint training) or frequent\ncardiovascular training sessions of any type, leaving more than 3 repetitions in reserve\nmight be better for managing fatigue and thus promoting muscle growth. Although, I still feel more research is needed\nto verify this. I think it'd be useful to see simpler and\ncleaner designed studies comparing muscle growth between training with various proximities\nto failure (such as 3 repetitions in reserve, 5 repetitions in reserve, or failure training)\nwhile all subjects perform additional cardio or high-intensity training. In summary, Martorelli et al. indicate with\nall other training variables equal, largely leaving more than 3 repetitions in reserve\ndoes not optimally build muscle in previously untrained women. Lasevicius et al. indicate that provided an\nindividual performs 2-3 more sets for an exercise than usual, leaving an average of 5 repetitions\nin reserve can build muscle optimally in previously untrained men. However, a study by Karsten et al. suggests\nin men with 2-5 years of training experience, despite performing 4 extra sets, leaving 5\nrepetitions in reserve largely failed to optimize muscle growth. Although there were some confounders in this\nstudy. Finally, Carroll et al. indicate when an individual\nperforms additional sprint training sessions, training with more than 3 repetitions in reserve\nmay be superior for promoting muscle growth compared to training to or closer to failure\nwith all other training variables equal. Overall, it's clear to see this current evidence\nis limited, somewhat conflicting, and overall far from clear. As a result, we unfortunately cannot conclude\nif leaving more than 3 repetitions in reserve can optimize muscle hypertrophy. Now, for those who have seen our previous\nvideo in which we detailed how the current research indicates leaving 3 to 0 repetitions\nin reserve is similarly effective to training to failure for muscle hypertrophy, you may\nrecall at the end of this video, I stated there's some velocity based research that\nindicates leaving more than 3 repetitions in reserve may be able to optimize muscle\ngrowth. However, after recently digging a lot more\ninto this research and even planning a whole 6,000-word video on it, I eventually realized\nthat this research has far too many considerations and practical limitations. More specifically, due to the design of the\nstudies, a lot of math and extrapolation was required to figure out the repetition in reserve\nnumbers, which ultimately made it very inaccurate, such that it's just not entirely clear what\nrepetition in reserve numbers was used in those studies. As I result, I came to the conclusion it was\nnot worth detailing this research. On the basis of this, as well as the research\ndetailed in this video, because it's simply unclear if leaving more than 3 repetitions\nin reserve can still optimize muscle hypertrophy, I think it's probably best to err on the side\nof caution and aim to leave 3 or fewer repetitions in reserve if your aim is to build muscle\nas best as you can."

    "transcript": "welcome to the house of hypertrophy how often you should train a muscle and for how many sets is forever debated in the industry this highly fascinating recent study compared training your muscle two times to three times a week for muscle hypoy with different set numbers in this video we're going to dissect this study and then fit it into the rest of the overall scientific research on training frequency and sets for building muscle so that by the end you'll have a clearer understanding of what you need to know now a cool thing about this recent study is they divided subjects into those with more slow twit or fast twitch fibers why was this cool slow twitch fibers are low Force producing but highly fatigue resistant while fast twitch fibers are high Force producing but very fatigable previous Research indicates people with more fast twitch muscle fibers tend to experience greater fatigue and may be more susceptible to overreaching thus perhaps they benefit from training less while those more slow twitch benefit from training more let's dive into the [Music] study 21 pre previously untrained individuals were divided into those with more slow twitch or fast twitch fibers the fiber type measurements were just done on the lower body muscles but the authors note lower body fiber type can correlate with upper body fiber type all subjects train the unilateral leg extension leg Hur dumbbell coal and skull crusher for three to four sets of reps the failure with one side of their body they perform this two times a week with at least 72 hours of rest between sessions thereby totaling six to eight sets per muscle in a week with the other side of their body they perform this three times a week with at least 48 Hours of rest between sessions thereby totaling 9 to 12 sets per muscle in a week therefore both training frequency and set numbers were different between the conditions interestingly the slow twitch group ended up performing more repetitions compared to the fast switch Group which might be logical as we know slow switch fibers are more fatigue resistant versus Fast switch fibers however not all previous research has established strong correlations between fiber type and the number of reps performed with a given loading nonetheless quadriceps hamstrings biceps and triceps H perv was measured and all four of these muscles tended to grow more with a three times per week training this held true for both the slow twitch and fast twitch fiber groups therefore opposing the notion individuals with more fast twitch fibers benefit from Trading less there are some additional crucial points from these results but before revealing these it is interesting to see that the slow twitch fiber group grew just as well as the fast twitch fiber group on average in other words having proport tionately more fast twitch fibers did not lead to Greater gains versus having proportionately more slow twitch fibers how could this be after all in isolation fast switch fibers appear to grow more than slow switch fibers but fiber type is just one of the many factors that may determine how much muscle growth you experience this may indicate that when we compare a fast twitch fiber group to a slow twitch fiber group these other factors in the mix essentially mean people with more fast touch fibers do not always grow more than those with more slow touch fibers returning to to the findings as each subject trained both two times and three times a week we can see the individual responses and it indicates the large majority of individuals from both the slow and fasted fiber groups grew better training three times per week there were only a few cases of gains being better with a two times per week training for a person however and this is a key Point despite the average and the majority of the individual's responses indicating better gains with the three times per week training the benefit was certainly not large we're only talking about an extra 1 to 3% growth with the quads hamstrings and biceps the triceps did see a greater 4 to 5% extra average growth from the three times per week training which may Point towards the fascinating idea of some muscles selectively responding better to more training regardless this data still suggests a large bulk of gains can be attained with lower amounts of training now the subjects were previously untrained so the benefit of training more may increase with training experience but as we'll dissect in some upcoming videos various well well trained individuals can still see reasonable hypertrophy from lower amounts of training switching up the discussion remember that both training frequency and set numbers differed between conditions but which was it that led to the more hypertrophy with a three times per week condition to answer this we need to briefly decipher the current research on training frequency and sets for muscle hypertrophy before this however we need to touch on some important considerations with this study in this study the slow twitch group of course had proportionately more slow twitch fibers versus the fast twitch group however not every subject in the slow twitch group could be described as slow twitch dominant as the numbers in the study indicates some of the subjects likely had a near 50/50 split of slow and fastwitch fibers conversely the fast twitch group had an average 61 39 split of faster slow twitch fibers therefore the results of this study could be different if we compared more slow twitch dominant to more fastwitch dominant individuals another consideration is that as already mentioned there's evidence people with more f switch fibers experience greater fatigue and are more susceptible to overreaching since the fast switch group grew well training three times per week with 9 to 12 weekly sets per muscle this magnitude of training wasn't excessive for them in fact feelings of soreness and fatigue were actually similar between the slow and fast switch groups in this study but it remains possible if reasonably higher set numbers or frequencies were used the fast switch group would struggle to [Music] recover so was it the training frequency set numbers are both that contributed to the greater gains with the three times per week condition as established in this 2019 meta analysis when the total number of sets performed per week was kept the same there was no difference in muscle growth between dividing these sets into higher or lower frequencies however when we go ahead and graph the muscle growth of the various frequencies we can see that the three times per week frequency led to slightly better gains this was not statistically significant statistical significance isn't everything but in this specific context there are quite notable differences behind the studies comprising this data nonetheless it's still evident substantial average hypertrophy is achieved across a wide range of frequencies fortunately an important study by Nez released last October revealed something highly interesting they had trained men perform nine sets for the quadriceps in a week one leg performed all nine sets in one session while the other leg distributed the nine sets across three non-consecutive days per week some subjects saw similar quad growth between the one times and three times frequency While others saw greater growth with the three times frequency accordingly the greater growth for some subjects in the previous study could possibly be due to the three times per week frequency itself however it is likely that for many if not all of them the higher sets were contributing to as identified in this meta analysis performing nine or more weekly sets for a muscle group produced more muscle horty than fewer than nine weekly sets I do want to point out that the this data still reinforces the notion that a large bulk of gains can still be achieved with lower set numbers some of you may be wondering about how even higher set numbers per week compared to moderate values as well as the role of training status stay tuned as in the next few weeks we'll

summary this paper found training three times per week with more sets led to Greater muscle ey purch Fe compared to training two times per week with fewer sets in both a slow twitch and fast twitch fiber group we've previously seen that when total set numbers per week are equated some individuals do grow more with a three times per week frequency so it's possible the three times per week frequency may have contributed to the greater growth for some subjects however the highest set numbers were likely contributing to the greater gains for many too as meta analytic data finds performing nine or more sets for a muscle group in a week produced more growth and Performing fewer than nine sets having said all this it's it is still worth emphasizing appreciable musai perch fee is still attained with lower amounts of training so is an option on the table depending on your personal goals thank you for watching feel free to check out the alpha progression app or our recent deep dive

    "transcript": "foreign welcome to the house of hypertrophy there are many ways to perform a set when lifting weights a normal set is simply a belt of repetitions performed and people commonly perform multiple normal sets with rest intervals between them a rest poor set for this video will be defined as performing repetitions 2 or at least close to failure resting for a short duration and then performing further reps to or at least close to failure multiple of these types of sets can be performed in a session if you like a drop set for this video will be defined as performing repetitions 2 or at least close to failure and then immediately reducing the load to perform additional repetitions to or at least close to failure multiple of these types of sets can be performed in a session if you like this well-designed study compared to these set systems for hypertrophy and strength we'll also analyze cluster sets a little later let's Dive In [Music] the study recruited 28 trained men with an average back squat one at a Max of 139 kilograms and subjects were assigned into either a normal rest pause or drop set group all subjects trained twice a week for eight weeks training for back squat leg press and leg extension each session the normal set group for each exercise performed four sets of 12 repetitions with a 70 one rep max load using two minutes of rest between sets the rest pause group for each exercise performed 10 repetitions with a 75 One Rate Max load rested for 20 seconds and performed a further six repetitions they performed three of these rest poor sets per session with two minutes of rest between them the drop set group for each exercise performed 10 repetitions with a 75 One Rate Max load and then immediately reduce the load to 55 100 Max to perform a further six repetitions they performed three of these drop sets per session with two minutes of of rest between them during the fifth week of training all groups increased the loads they trained with by five percent total repetitions were equated between the three groups so this is technically why the normal set group performed one extra set versus the rest pause and drop set groups if any group failed to hit the rep numbers prescribed assistance was provided to get there unfortunately the researchers didn't mention how often assistance was provided with the Response Group many of you would have noticed that performing six extra reps with a 75 One Rate Max load 20 seconds after performing 10 reps with that same load seems extremely hard I agree I think this group would have had assistance quite a bit so technically this study may have included a few Force repetitions so bear this in mind that's not to say the normal or drop set group's training was easy I think there probably would have been occasions where subjects in these groups required assistance on the latest sets before and after the study strength was measured by back squat Warner at Max and muscle hypertrophy by thickness of the lateral thigh across three regions a proximal middle and distal region all three groups increased back squat strength but the gains tended to be best for the response group for muscle hypertrophy all three groups experience similar gains in the middle and proximal lateral thigh regions at the distal region only the Response Group appeared to see gains however I am skeptical that rest pause training truly produced great distal lateral thigh gains let me explain why here are the individual data for the gains in the distal lateral thigh region notice how in both the drop set and normal set groups a few individuals actually saw a notable loss in size from training this wasn't really the case with the Response Group only one individual saw a loss in size in this region with her other middle and proximal regions none of the subjects in any of the groups experienced a decrease in size now some people may be wondering how on Earth did some subjects see a decrease in distal lateral thigh size with training I'll address this shortly but for the drop set and normal set groups the few individuals experiencing a loss in size likely dragged the average gains down for both groups causing the appearance of these groups to see lower gains than the rest pause group some might be thinking sure but doesn't this data prove that at the distal region normal and drop set training made it more likely to see a decrease in size still meaning rest pause is superior I can't rule this out but I think there's a better explanation remember the groups involve different people and it seems different people don't see identical Regional hypertrophy with the same training this is evidenced by the fact within each group some individuals lost size While others gain size I believe this is an underrated Point many are unaware of a lot of people assume in response to the same exercise every single person grows the same muscle regions identically but this data shows this isn't necessarily the case therefore I think it's more likely just by Chance the drop set a normal set of groups had some individuals with a greater tendency to lose size in their distal lateral thigh region regardless of what training they perform my speculation is this might be a more accurate explanation of the results rather than resport's training being Superior with that out of the way how is it possible for subjects to lose eyes I'm unaware of any validated explanation but this isn't the first study to find this for example this study involves subjects training partial back squats and observed decreases in the size of lower thigh regions maybe this is some sort of compensatory mechanism where the body to support the growth of certain regions decreases the size of other muscle regions that aren't stimulated much via training but this is very much speculative nonetheless my summary of this paper is that for hypertrophy the set systems were pretty much comparable for strength resport's training was superior but I think there's a solid explanation for this particular finding foreign [Music] strength but rest Sports training was superior but I think this is simply because the Response Group accumulated more repetitions at heavier loads versus the two other groups why does this matter because the literature finds virtually a direct relationship between heavier loads and strength gains for example this study found training with a bench press and back squat with two to four reps with 90 1 MX loads produce the greater one rate max strength gains on the two exercises versus training with 8 to 12 reps using a seventy percent One Rate Max load therefore I don't think there's anything inherently Superior to Esports training for strength gains accumulating repetitions with heavier load seems to be the key for increasing 100 max strength and this can be done with both normal set and rest pause although response tends to be more practical with moderate to lighter loads so normal sets may be practically better for training with heavier loads drop sets are probably unideal since they involve reducing loads [Music] as we know the initial study analyzed largely indicates similar muscle hypertrophy between normal rest pause and drop sets this style of respport and drop sets used in this particular study isn't necessarily identical to how people use these set systems this particular study only involved one load reduction per drop set and many people tend to use multiple load reductions and only a single overall drop set likewise the rest pause in this study involved only six further reps per set while many people may perform even more mini sets of reps net or two failure per resp poor set but I don't think any of this changes things a recent meta-analysis combined the results of the overall literature comparing drop sets to normal sets and this includes some studies which involved multiple load reductions with a single drop set muscle hypertrophy was still similar between both normal and drop sets with rest pause there's only one other study exploring it to my knowledge 18 trained individuals perform at a range of exercises four days a week for six weeks a normal set group for each exercise train three sets of six reps with an eighty percent of one rate Max load using two to three minutes of rest between sets a rest pause group for each exercise perform to reps the failure with an 80 100 Max load and then rested for 20 seconds before performing further reps to failure they continued this until they achieved a total of 18 reps after six weeks muscle I poetry measures tended to be superior for the rest pause group however there is a vital potential limitation with this study it appears as though the normal set group did not apply Progressive overload this means particularly in the later portion of the study they would have been trading far from failure since the Response Group performed all their reps to failure Progressive overload would have naturally taken place for them through rep increases given this vital potential limitation I'm unsure if this study qualifies as evidence or S post training is superior mechanistically a don't think there's any valid way through which rest pause or drop sets would be superior for hypertrophy mechanical tension appears to be the primary hypertrophy stimulus as examined in the previous video to optimize mechanical tension we want to achieve High motor unit Recruitment and respective forces from the individual motor units this is because achieving this ensures we expose all the muscle fibers belonging to those motor units to Mechanical tension some people think that going Beyond failure as done with response and drop sets is what achieves full motor unit Recruitment and high respective motor unit forces however this doesn't seem to be correct this study seems to be the strongest motor unit modeling study to date the data implies with a normal set full mosina Recruitment and high motunate forces are achieved before failure even before failure you see the higher threshold motor units which contain faster twitch muscle fibers are slightly fatiguing I think this is a strong reason why the literature mainly indicates training to failure is similar to stopping shy of failure since at the point of failure no added motor unit recruitment or increases in motor unit forces occur I plan to explore the topic of training to failure more in future videos now some might accept this but then say by going Beyond failure with response and drop sets we're able to perform a greater number of reps with filmotuna Recruitment and high forces they may call these effective reps I think there are two problems with this firstly those quote unquote effective reps are going to be carried out under increasingly more fatigue and this fatigue can impair multini Recruitment and forces and I expect like this goes somewhere to balancing things out in fact even very long duration normal sets may involve some higher threshold motor units dropping out of recruitment altogether before failure due to Central fatigue secondly many seem to assume a greater number of effective reps always means more hypertrophy but this assumption may not be correct there could be a threshold to the number of effective reps are required to optimally build muscle and all set systems may pass this threshold meaning any extra effective reps do not stimulate more gains indeed I think these reasons might be why the initial study ultimately observes similar hypertrophy between the different set systems despite the fact the drop set and response method technically involved more quote-unquote effective reps some may be wondering about other stimuli behind muscle hypertrophy such as metabolic stress and muscle damage drop sets and response generally tend to involve higher metabolic stress and muscle damage but as examined in the previous video there isn't any compelling evidence metabolic stress and muscle damage are powerful drivers of hypertrophy what is a powerful driver of hypertrophy though is consistent training tracking workouts and understanding your progress is important an alpha progression is a high quality app that can help neat graphs can track virtually any measure long term such as your strength progress number of workouts body weight and even set numbers per muscle group and circumference measures you can add your own program or use their flexible custom workout generator you can select what equipment you have available and specify whether you want to focus or even neglect certain muscle groups the reviews speak to the app's quality 4.9 stars in Google Play and 4.8 stars on Apple Store the link in the comments and description gives you two weeks free of all its features plus twenty percent off a subscription if you do purchase the app the house of hypertri will get 50 so this sincerely helps support these three videos [Music] some individuals may be wondering about cluster sets cluster sets are similar to rest pause the main difference being reps are commonly not performed intentionally to or near failure with cluster sets and very low rep numbers may be used with cluster sets there are technically numerous ways you can perform cluster sets but as an example imagine you select a load you can perform a maximum of six repetitions with you may perform three mini sets of two reps with 30 seconds of rest between mini sets thereby totaling 6 reps you may then repeat this however many times you like since cluster sets enable you to accumulate reps with heavier loads it's logical it should be fine for strength gains indeed a 2021 meta-analysis combine the results of all the studies comparing cluster sets to normal sets for strength and found both produced comparable strength gains as for hypertrophy the same 2021 meta-analysis combined the data from a few studies and established similar approach feed between cluster sets and normal sets however a limitation is only five studies were included and and two of them involved the normal sets training with very low rep numbers and one of them did not have the normal set group Train there to failure plus two of the studies were only five weeks moreover since this meta-analysis in 2021 another study has come out indicating cluster sets may not be ideal for hypertrophy specifically 22 trained individuals trained twice a week for eight weeks on the barbell bench press a normal set group trained their exercise each session with four sets of five reps with an 85 percent One Rate Max load using five minutes of rest between sets a cluster set group performed four sets of five repetitions with an 85 100 Max load but use 30 seconds of rest between each repetition per set and three minutes of rest between sets both groups experience similar bench press strength gains supporting the idea cluster sets are viable for strength for hypertrophy although gains in the lower region of the pectoralis major were similar between both groups growth of the middle and upper regions was Superior for the normal group suggesting cluster sets may not overall be as good for building muscle therefore I'd say the overall evidence isn't super clear on whether cluster sets can truly optimize hypertrophy again there are many different ways to perform cluster sets and it's probable in cluster set designs that minimize proximity to failure hypertrophy is probably compromised while in cluster set designs that involve some reps close to failure hypertrophy may be fine [Music] with strength accumulating reps with heavier loads is crucial and this can be achieved with normal sets cluster sets and perhaps response though resports tends to be more practical with moderate to lighter loads drop sets may be unideal since they involve load reductions for hypertrophy based on the current literature we don't have any strong evidence to suggest a particular set system is superior although cluster sets particularly ones involving reps very far from failure might be sub-optimal for hypertrophy I think the notion many set systems are similar for hypertrophy is great news as you have all these options at your disposal you can train with whichever you like and of course you can incorporate different set systems within an overall training program technically performing a single drop set or rest poor set can be a time efficient Training Method with a single drop set you perform multiple load reductions and with a single rest poor set you perform multiple mini sets since these can be quite fatiguing it may be best to use these types of response and drop sets with isolation exercises demonstrating the time efficiency of this this Japanese study which was included in the previously mentioned meta-analysis on drop sets compared biceps curls with this single drop set to three normal sets of reps to failure bicep skeins were ultimately similar between both but the drop set only took around two minutes to complete compared to the normal sets which took around 7 minutes two final things I'd like to shout out coaching cues an underrated channel that puts out great evidence-based info surrounding resistance training I'm not getting paid to promote nor do I know the creators of coaching cues personally I'm purely sharing their work as I feel they're putting out great stuff and many people sub to this channel May appreciate their content links to their pages are in the description and

    "transcript": "there are many different ideas put forth when it comes to maximizing muscle hypertrophy one idea is that muscle should be trained according to fiber type this idea suggests that predominately slow-twitch muscles should be trained with lighter loads for higher reps given slow-twitch muscles are highly fatigue resistant and produce no amount of power whereas predominately fast-twitch muscles should be trained with heavier loads for lower reps given fast which muscles fatigue quickly but produce greater power but do these ideas work should you be training muscles based on their fiber type a recent paper by showing feeling colleagues aim to determine just this the muscles investigated by the soleus medial gastrocnemius and lateral gastrocnemius these muscles were picked as it's believed the soleus it's put romney slow-twitch while the two heads of the gastrocnemius are a mix of both fiber types 26 untrained males had a one leg assigned to use a heavy load which was a six to ten rep max weight while the other leg was assigned to use a light load which was a twenty to thirty rep much weight each leg with their assigned loads performed the standing calf raise and seated conferees four sets to failure twice per week for eight weeks to remove any potential confounding effects of exercise order different combinations of exercise orders were performed throughout the protocol the first four sessions look like this this structural was repeated four times totaling the sixteen sessions the participant performed ultrasonic imaging was used to obtain thickness of the soleus medial gastrocnemius and lateral gastrocnemius before and after the training period measurements for all muscles were taken 25 percent of the lower leg length what the researchers found was that neither muscle substantially favored the use of heavy loads or light loads in other words the slow-twitch dominant soleus and mixed fiber type gastrocnemius both responded similarly theories of heavy and light moves therefore this study does not support the idea of trading muscles according to fiber type however as with all studies we should consider its limitations this study was conducted on untrain young men and so these results could not necessarily be applied to other individuals only the soleus and gastrocnemius were investigated and so these results could not necessarily be applied to other muscles thickness of the soleus and gastrocnemius were investigated at a single site which was 25% of the lower leg length differential growth could have occurred at other sites of these muscles muscle biopsies were not taken in the study as possible fiber time may vary dramatically between individuals but as we'll see in a second the likelihood of this seems low lastly the study lost at eight weeks perhaps five type specific hypertrophy may manifest in the long run but of course future research would be needed to address this and some of the other limitations with this study nevertheless on a practical level there doesn't seem to be much of an appeal to training muscles based on fiber type based on numerous studies the vast majority of the lower body appears to display a fairly even split of slow-twitch and faster muscle fibers however as alluded to a few moments ago the non use of muscle biopsies in the previous detailed study is likely not a massive deal as we have good evidence to believe the soleus is predominance loads or the gastrocnemius is or mixed fiber types but the rest of the lower body on average appears to be fairly split between slow twitch and faster to fibers the same applies to the upper body numerous studies again demonstrate that the upper body muscles are also quite evenly split between slow twitch and fast twitch fibers even if you as an individual do have muscles that predominately slow twitch or fast which apart from the fact that studied detail in this video does not support the need to train muscles according to file type there isn't a practical and reliable way to know there have been previous suggestions that one can determine whether they're more fast which will slow twitch depending on the number of reps they can achieve with a submaximal load one example suggests that if you can perform more than nine reps with 80% of your wanna it Maps the muscles involved in that exercise are more slow twitch dominant whereas if you perform less those muscles were more fast twitch dominant the 2006 study by doris and colleagues did find a statistically significant relationship between the number of reps before with a 70% one Ram Road in the leg press and quadriceps fiber type of composition in untrained woman however the relationship wasn't particularly strong his Pearson correlation coefficient was - 0.48 additionally an indirect method was used to determine fiber type in this study by terra's and colleagues whom did their atlases fiber type through biopsies the pearson correlation coefficient between vastus lateralis fiber type composition and reps a super 70 percent and 85 percent of water on the leg press where young men was less than 0.2 in other words fiber type had little role to play with the amount of reps one could perform with the submaximal load [Music] taking this together with the rest of the video a current evidence suggests that for the time being at least training muscles according to fiber type is not a consideration that needs to go into constructing a training program you"

    "title": "Build Your Forearms FASTER: The Most Detailed Guide on the Web",
    "published_at": "2024-07-01T13:00:01Z",
    "transcript": "welcome to the house of hypertrophy how can we train to most effectively and efficiently maximize forearm hypertrophy with the help of the scientific literature we'll be going into great detail on this we'll mention virtually every exercise wrist curs wrist extensions isometric grip training pronation superation training radial nner deviation training and last but not least curling training let's Dive In the forearms consist of muscles on the anterior compartment and posterior compartment here's a list of all 20 muscles the brachio radialis is one many of you may instantly recognize it extends from part of the upper arm across the forearm we'll discuss how you may maximize its growth later the anconeus is a muscle you may have never heard of It's a small muscle that is actually involved in elbow extension so will actually be trained in any triceps exercise both the pronator terries and pronator cordatus are involved in pronating the forearm while the superator is involved in suating the forearm with the anterior compartment muscles that have flexer in their name tell us they are involved in flexing the joints they cross with all the flex and muscles here they all cross the wrist joints so Flex the wrist which is where where the angle between the palm and forearm decreases it is worth noting the palmaris longus also flexes the wrist as a fun fact not everyone has the palmaris longest muscle according to this text it can be absent in up to 26% of people various tests involving flexing the fingers and or wrist aim to see if you have a visible palmaris longest tendon or not for example this test involve you bunching your fingers and then flexing at the wrist to see if the palmaris longest tendon becomes visible it is also interesting to know some people may have the muscle in one of their forearms but not their opposite forearm anyhow the names of many of these forearm muscles may sound complex and intimidating but let us quickly break down the meaning of the terms so we can enhance our understanding of the forearms it's not essential for you to memorize the names since I'll remind you of the functions of the various muscles as we detail what exercises May optimize their hypertrophy when a muscle has pocis in its name it tells us it can move the thumb so the flex of pocis longus in addition to flexing the wrist can Flex the thumb when a muscle has digitorum in its name it tells us it can move the fingers or toes if we're talking about the foot so both the muscles with flexor digitorum in their name tell us besides flexing the wrist they can Flex the fingers superficialis is Latin for near the surface while profundus is Latin for deep so the flexa digitorum superficialis is on top of the flexa digitorum profundus finally for the anterior compartment what about radialis and naris the lower arm has two bones the radius and olna radialis refers to the radius the flexor Cary radialis besides wrist flection can perform radial deviation which is movement of the hand towards the radial side when you're standing like this radial deviation looks like this naris refers to the Nar the flexor carpy naris besides wrist flexion can perform nner deviation which is movement of the hand towards the Ula side when you're standing like this ol deviation will look like this note carpy just refers to the wrist with the posterior compartment muscles that have extend in the name can extend the wrist which is where the angle between the palm and the forearm increases and you can probably guess the functions of many of these muscles based on what we've already described remember we're talking about extension with a posterior compartments so for example the extensor digitorum can also extend the four fingers there are only four things that will very quickly expand on digy minimi translates to little finger so the extend sensor digity minime besides extending the wrist also specifically extends the little finger indices translates to index finger so the extender indices besides extending the wrist also specifically extends the index finger longus is Latin for long and brevis is Latin for short so the muscles with longus are longer than their counterparts with brevis in the name such as the extensor pocis longus being longer than the extents of pocis brevis now some of you may be thinking I see the abductor pocis longus but where's the abductor pocis brevis the abductor policis brevis belongs to the hand so it's not a for a muscle and thus isn't on the list anyhow speaking of the abductor policis longus this is our fourth and final Point as it's a little confusing and worth clarifying abductor policis tells us it can ab D duct the thumb but it actually can also extend the thumb and contribute to radial deviation here's a table that some may find useful that details the functions of all the for our muscles once again you don't need to memorize this but feel free to replay this section if you do wish to memorize any of these [Music] details nearly all of the exercises most people perform in their training program since they involve gripping onto the load already involves some forearm stimulation vertical pulls horizontal pulls and deadlift variations involve a fair degree of static finger flexion strength to not lose grip and remember of all the fora muscles it's the flexor digitorum superficialis and profundus that Flex the fingers so these two muscles are stimulated with the static finger flexion involved in these exercises in fact it's not super uncommon for people to get sufficiently strong on these movements to the point where these forearm muscles become the limiting factor in this scenario assuming your goal is to most effectively stimulate the muscles these movements typically intend to using something like straps can eliminate grip as the limiting factor during many curling exercises with our base Knuckles face down if you were to shut down the forarm muscles the weight would pull us into wrist extension so your forearm muscles specifically the muscles that perform wrist flexion are work to combat this from happening during lateral raises our base Knuckles are faced upwards if you shut down the forarm muscles the weight pulls us into wrist flexion so your forarm muscles the ones that perform wrist extension are working to combat this from happening depending on your goals training experience and genetics you might actually be happy with the forearm gains you see from your regular training however we can be pretty certain if your goal is to accelerate and maximize forearm development direct forearm training is required the reason for this is pretty straightforward based on the current scientific literature we know to maximize growth of a muscle we want to attain High muscle fiber recruitment levels and tension this is simply achieved by training two or close to failure during most exercises your forarms are typically not the limiting factor so are far from theoretical failure but during direct Forum work they are always the limiting factor the anterior compartment of the forearms is generally larger than the posterior compartment when dissecting the anterior compartment except for the pronator terries and quadratus which are not super large we know the rest of the muscles all contribute to wrist flexion some of them have additional functions but the fact is all of them have been established have great leverage for Pure wrist flexion for those unaware leverage in this case refers to a muscle's moment arm the biceps can simply illustrate this to know a muscle's moment arm we need to know its line of force and the center of the joint it moves then we simply draw a perpendicular line between these two things to get the muscle moment arm here we see the biceps has a fairly long moment arm which tells us it has great leverage and potential to perform its function of elbow flexion and generally the longer the moment arm the better leverage and potential a muscle has to perform movement since all these muscles have great leverage for wrist flexion wrist curling exercises which involves wrist flexion will be very effective for training all these muscles if you could only perform one forarm exercise some wrist Cur would be it simply because this trains the greatest amount of forarm muscle tissue currently there's no research directly comparing different rist Co variations for muscle hypertrophy despite this we can hypothesize what the best risk of variation might be based on the available literature on other muscle groups growing evidence suggests training muscles at relatively longer lengths produces greater hypertrophy than shorter lengths what on Earth does this mean when we move our muscles change lengths for example the biceps is at a longer length when the elbow is straight but at a shorter length when the elbow is bent two areas of the scientific literature demonstrate the benefits of training muscles at longer lengths the exercise comparison research and the range of motion research with the first one example is this 2021 paper from Japan comparing seated to Lang Leos for hamstrings hypertrophy the hamstrings consist of four muscle heads all of them cross the knee joint so are involved in bending the knee called knee flexion however three of them also cross the hip joint this design means these three hamstring muscles are going to be stretched more and thus at a longer length when we bend them the hip which is done on seated leg hes lying leg H Coes involve no Bend at the hip it was found seated leg hes grew these three hamstring muscles more than lying leg holes while growth of the biceps for more a short head which is the one that just crosses the knee and thus is trained at the same muscle length between both exercises was similar between the two exercises in past House of I perch for videos we've seen selecting exercises that train the quads and triceps and long lengths can build more muscle as for the range of motion research this refers to the Joint ankles you move through so with a normal biceps curl moving the elbow from zero to around 130\u00b0 is a full range of motion but we can divide this into two parts moving from around 0 to 65\u00b0 is what we may call a partial at long muscle lengths while moving from 65 to 130\u00b0 is what we may call a partial at Short muscle lengths this 2022 study compared car phrases with a partial at longer muscle lengths partial at shorter muscle lengths and a full range of motion that moved across all angles gastr nmia hypertrophy was greatest with the partial at long lengths being even better than the full range of motion in the spirit of scientific accuracy we need to recognize this literature on Long muscle length training is emerging and developing and more studies are needed to answer specific questions for example is a partial at long length always better than a full range of motion is there a threshold of the long length needed to maximize muscle growth Beyond which further lengthening provides no further benefit finally all of the research on Long muscle lengths for hypertrophy has been done on untrained individuals across the web some suggest there are mechanisms that mean trained individuals would not see greater benefits from training at long muscle lengths but as I've thoroughly described in this article I think there are problems with this argument and we simply need studies on trained individuals luckily there's at least two studies in the works exploring if trained individuals benefit from longer muscle lengths when they're published I intend to update you with the results at the house of hypertrophy nevertheless allow us to use this available data to at least speculate on what may be the best forearm exercises focusing on the forearm flexing muscles we know they Flex the wrist so are going to be shortened when the wrist is flexed but at a more lengthened position when the wrist is extended withstanding wrist curve variations we don't get into an extended wrist position rather we're largely moving the wrist from neutral to a flexed position conversely with wrist hes that have our forearm resting across a surface with a base Knuckles down our wrist successfully reaches an extended position therefore we may hypothesize this variation may be better for hypertrophy thanks to it attaining longer lengths this movement can also be performed with your lower arm across a bench or on your thigh but that's not all we might be able to make this exercise even better recall that the flexor digitorum superficialis and profundus besides flexing the wrist also Flex the fingers as a result these two muscles are going to be at a relatively shorter length when the fingers are flexed but at a longer length when the fingers are extended consequently if we allow the fingers to extend during the wrist curl we will be able to lengthen the flexor digitorum super falis and profundus even more here we're predominantly extending our fingers at something called the metto caroal joint while the load rolls down our fingers we still have some Bend in the distal and proximal interanal joint so the load does not fall out then we Flex the fingers while simultaneously flexing the wrist to lift the load we'll call this a finger flexion wrist curl here's an example of what this exercise looks like in real life some of you might be thinking what if I just performed wrist Co with fat grips for those unaware fat grips are attachments that increase the diameter of the bar you need to grip thus compared to using a normal grip using fat grips automatically places your fingers into a more extended position therefore when compared to normal rist Holes without fat grips using fat grips will train the flexa digitorum superficialis and profundus at comparatively longer lengths but when comparing them to finger flexion risk holes they generally don't attain as much finger extension so finger flexion wrist holes generally still achieves longer lengths for the flexor digitorum superficialis and profundus making the speculative assumption this extra lengthening is beneficial for growing them more this could be quite an important thing because the flexor digitorum superficialis and profundus are actually the two largest forearm muscles so play a large role in your overall forearm size you may be wondering by introducing this finger flexion into our wrist curl although this may enhance the stimulus to the flexor digitorum superficialis and profundus through placing them at longer muscle lengths does this not compromise the stimulus to the other forearm flexor muscles my best guess is probably not although this is not an identical comparison recall we saw of this study comparing cated to lying leg holes seated leg Coes lengthen three hamstring muscles more and grew them more but it was no less effective for growing the biceps for more a short head which is trained at the same length between the two exercises in the same way perhaps finger flexion wrist CES effectively grow the flexor digitorum superficialis and profundus more while not being any less effective for growing the other Forum flexor muscles now you're not going to be lifting as heavy as you can compared to other rist Co exercises but this likely does not matter we don't want to make the mistake of thinking that heavier weights means a greater stimulus a great example of this comes from this 2022 paper from Japan that compared overhead extensions to push Downs due to the precise anatomy of the long triceps head it is actually trained at a longer length with overhead extensions and it indeed grew better with this movement even though subjects lifted heavier loads on the push Downs throughout the study so this is how I'd rank the different rist Co variations remember this ranking is based on inferences from the scientific literature on other muscles so it would be wrong for me to to say this is 100% correct also if you dislike or cannot train with any of the best ranked movements throughout this video and you find it more enjoyable or practical to train with lower ranked movements that is absolutely okay provided you train these movements to or close to faila you are absolutely still going to experience hypertrophy the data still shows meaningful hypertrophy in exercises training muscles at shorter positions I'll also note with standing wrist hes you can also introduce finger flexion which play reles the flexor digitorum superficialis and profundus at relatively longer lengths of course since the wrist remains neutral during this it doesn't reach as long of a length as this variation a time efficient way to implement any form of risk hes into your training is to superset them supersets involve you performing two exercises back to back and then rest before performing this for however many more sets you desire based on the current literature we at least have evidence implying suers setting exercises that that train different muscles is perfectly fine for muscle growth generally Su setting rist holes with an exercise that doesn't involve a grip component is probably a sound idea such as super setting leg extensions with them or any of these other [Music] options recoil the anterior compartment is larger in size so training them is the main priority but the posterior compartment isn't terribly small and likely still worth training to truly maximize forearm size much of the extensive muscles of the forearm have great leverage for wrist extension so it's no surprise wrist extension training is an excellent way to train them the extensive muscles of the forearm are at a shorter length when the wrist is extended and at a longer length when the wrist is flexed standing wrist extensions don't attain a flexed position rather we're moving the wrist from neutral too extended conversely wrist curs with a forearm across a surface and the knuckles facing up successfully reaches the flex position so we may hypothesize this variation may be better for hypertrophy the fingers are already flexed thanks to gripping the load and in this scenario this is perfectly fine some of the extensive muscles have attachments on various fingers and are at a longer length when the fingers are flexed a convenient way to add wrist extensions into your program is simply to supet them with another exercise or even a wrist curl variation [Music] another popular way to train the forearms is through isometric grip training isometric refers to our muscles working but not moving I'll straight away mention that grip training is probably not essential for forearm hypertrophy simply because grip training trains finger flexion and thus just trains the flexor digitorum superficialis and profundus various intrinsic hand muscles are involved too but they are not our Focus today if your thumb is in contact holding the mod then we will also additionally recruit the flexa pocis longus but all these forign muscles are already going to be trained extremely well with the risk hold variations we've dissected but since grip training is popular and since some of you may enjoy training variety let us dissect it in general there are two common categories of grip training the first is normal grip training which involves you holding on to a standard dumbbell barbell or pull-up bar to or near failure far walks involve simultaneously walking all normal grip training trains the muscles at moderately short lengths why remember the flexor digitorum superficialis and profundus are placed at the longest length when both the wrist and fingers are extended the flex of pois longus will also be at its longest length when the wrist and thumb are extended but during normal grip training our wrist is virtually neutral and our fingers and thumb are flexed this isn't a disaster research conducted on other muscle groups demonstrates that isometric training at Short muscle length still evokes hypertrophy but unsurprisingly growth is better with isometric training at relatively longer muscle lengths the second category of grip training grip training with the fingers extended gets us to comparatively longer lengths these involve grip training with fat grips added to dumbbells barbells or a pull-up bar and pinch training with plates or a dumbbell there are subtle differences between these but the main thing is all of them place our fingers and thumb into a more extended position thereby training the muscles at a longer length relative to normal grip training so this is the speculative ranking for isometric grip training some of you may be wondering how does isometric training compare to normal Dynamic training for hypertrophy there only seems to be two studies comparing them the first one was published all the way back in 1957 including the comparison of this biceps is symmetric exercise to dumbbell curling upper arm circumference gains ended up being better with the dumbbell curling yet upper arm circumference is far from a precise measure of muscle growth and we don't know if the results would have been different if isometric training at longer lengths would have been used the second study comes from 1986 and this paper compared isometric to concentric only and eccentric only leg extensions from the references my best guess is the isometric training was performed roughly around the long muscle length positions achievable with a leg extension quad hypoy was not significantly different between all three suggesting isometric training may be able to produce similar gains although I would have liked to have seen a normal Group performing both a concentric and eccentric motions also this is just one study so future studies are necessary to truly determine how effective isometric training is right now my best guess is isometric training particularly at longer lengths might be able to produce similar Hy pery to normal Dynamic training although if future research finds isometric training isn't quite as good as Dynamic training for hypertrophy I don't anticipate the differences would be that large anyhow as we at least know you can grow muscle from isometric training it's absolutely fine to include isometric grip training in your training program if you desire but let's say you wanted a dynamic alternative to isometric grip training in this scenario as isometric grip training involves static finger flexion we would be looking for a dynamic finger flexion exercise when dissecting wrist Coes we introduced finger flection risk holes which already involve finger flexion combined with risk hurling in fact one option on the table is to perform finger flexion wrist curs until you get to the point where you're struggling to curl the wrist up and then you squeeze out a couple of pure finger flexion repetitions with a wrist maintained in an extended position but if you're not a fan of this you can just perform pure finger flexion repetitions as a standalone exercise this is likely an excellent exercise since our wrist and fingers attain extended positions we're training the flexor digitorum superficialis and profundus at long lengths besides this hand grippers and standing finger curls also train finger flexion I anticipate these C be quite effective for growth but since the wrist is in neutral it's possible they are not quite as great as finger flexion with the wrist extended note these Dynamic finger flexion exercises tend to involve the thumb not in contact with the weight so the flexor pois longus isn't going to be trained so this is how we may rank Dynamic finger flexion training again it's not Crystal Clear how isometric compares to Dynamic training but I will say as finger flexion with the wrist extended reaches the longest length of all these it's possible this could be the best having said this if you prefer to train with any of the lower ranked exercises rest assured they're not going to decrease your muscle size as alluded to at the start of this section dedicated finger flexion training is likely not essential since the muscles involved are already going to be trained effectively in wrist Cur variations but since some of you may enjoy training variety this certainly can be part of an overall highly effective muscle building program if you wish moreover the flexed digitorum superficialis and profundus are after all two of the largest for our muscles so extra finger flexion training is not what I'd call a waste of time finally there are some convenient ways finger flexion training could fit into a training program besides just performing pure finger flexion reps after failing to perform wrist flexion let's say you're training pull-ups on your final set you could just hang on the bar for a while if you're training dumbbell or barbell standing curls on the final set assuming the load isn't too heavy you could perform a couple of pure finger curl repetitions with hand grippers these can be performed at any place and time so it can be a highly convenient and simple way to train your forearms [Music] more performing exercises that involve radial or inner deviation will effectively train these forearm muscles that have leverage for this movement but five of these seven muscles are already highly trained with risk holes and extensions the two exceptions are the abductor pocis longus and extensor polius brevis which are probably better trained with radial deviation these two muscles are pretty small so maximizing their growth is probably not high on anyone's priority list and growing them will probably have a trivial impact on your physique so I don't consider radial or in deviation essential but I understand that not everyone thinks the same or has identical goals so if you do wish to train radial or ol deviation here's some solid [Music] options direct pronation and superation training isn't involved in most programs some of your exercises may be performed with a supered or pronated grip but these are not resisted pronation or superation training direct pronation training will effectively train the pronator terries and quadratus while direct superation training will effectively train the superator and even biceps since they function as a superator too these three forign muscles aren't going to be trained with wrist Coes or extensions the pronator terries has some leverage to perform elbow flexion so will somewhat be involved in exercises that involve elbow flexion yet it likely experiences a better stimulus with direct pronation training so if we wanted to maximize the growth of these muscles direct pronation and superation training would be required but considering that these muscles are a small fraction of the forearm muscle mass they are far from the most important thing for overall forarm size and for the vast majority of people that simply care about building an overall developed physique direct pronation or superation training is not what I deem essential but again not everyone thinks the same or has identical goals so perhaps you do want to train them some of you might know that pronation training is common in the arm wrestling world and it's quite interesting to see that Devon larett one of the best armed wrestlers in the world has a highly developed pronator terries anyhow with your forearm across a bench or on your thigh and using an uneven dumbbell moving the hand in this way trains pronation while moving your hand in this way trained super Nation you can also perform both in one smooth [Music] motion as mentioned near the introduction many of you are probably familiar with the bracho radialis some data indicates when the forearm is pronated the bracho radialis helps return to neutral while when the forearm is supinated the bracho radialis again helps return to neutral yet as implied by this paper the primary function of the muscle may be elbow flexion as a result the Brau radialis is going to be trained well in any exercise that involves elbow flexion including horizontal pulling exercises vertical pulling exercises and of course curling exercises it is widely thought using a neutral or pronated hand grip during any elbow flexion is superior for growing the Brau radialis this belief partly stems from the idea that the biceps seem to have their best leverage to perform elbow flexion when the forearm is supernate and indeed a fair few electromyographic studies find the biceps display higher activity when elbow flexion is performed with the forearm in superation surely this then means the braal radialis has a smaller contribution to Elbow flexion with a supinated grip but a larger contribution with a neutral or pronated grip quite fascinatingly the overall electromyographic literature fails to support this although I did come across two studies finding the brao radialis displayed higher activity when elbow flexing with the forearm pronated three found no difference between different forearm positions and four actually found better Brach your radialis activity with the forearm in a supern position for example the most recent paper had 10 competitive bodybuilders perform cable curls with a supern pronated or neutral grip and both biceps and bracho radialis activity tended to be higher with the supered grip as discussed many times at the house of hypy before electromyographic data has limitations so it's possible this explains the surprising results however my current belief is that electromyographic data May potentially be more accurate when we're comparing exercises that only have slight variations such as curling with different grips my reasoning for this comes from research on other muscles some electromyographic research on the coughs finds that cough raises with slight variations between them successfully predicted muscle growth outcomes while other electromyographic research that compares very different exercises doesn't always translate into muscle growth outcomes thus I think it is worth considering the surprising idea that a supered grip trains both the biceps and break your radialis extremely well in fact we at least have one study demonstrating that supernate curl training can be superb for braak your radialis hypertrophy the study recruited previously untrained individuals to train dumbbell and machine preacher cods with these variables both of these exercises are typically performed with a supinated grip this training was not compared to anything else as the aim of the study was simply to explore the relationship between muscle hypertrophy and strength gains it was ultimately found that the B BPS brachialis and bracho radialis all significantly and similarly grew as this study didn't directly compare supern to neutral or pronated grip training it doesn't prove a supernat grip is sufficient for maximizing brachy radialis hypertrophy but it at least demonstrates how significant growth of all these muscles can occur with a supern grip for those interested the study did find somewhat of a relationship between muscle hypertrophy and strength gains but the relationship ship was far from super strong we might have future videos at the house of hyper view that explore the overall literature on the relationship between hyper Fe and strength anyhow if we assume for a second that supinated grip is sufficient for the braak your radialis I think it's possible that some people who report feeling their break your radialis more with pronated curs are getting confused with the wrist extensor muscles during pronated curs the weight is trying to flex your wrist so your wrist extensors are working to prevent this from happening some of the muscles involved in this are around the bracho radialis so you may be deceived into thinking it's working more than usual when you're actually feeling these extensive muscles now this is a controversial take I'm completely open to being utterly wrong here if future research finds Brach your radialis hypertrophy is better after training with pronated or neutral grips but right now my current interpretation of the available evidence is that neutral or pronated grips may not be essential to Max break your radialis hypertrophy thus if your current program includes some form of vertical and or horizontal PS Plus at least one curling exercise I expect this will absolutely contribute to substantial braak your radialis development and might indeed be enough but let's say you have been doing this but you are not happy with its development well assuming other aspects of your training and lifestyle cannot explain your lack of break your radialis growth then you could try to increase the volume of your curve or even though the present evidence doesn't support it you could experiment with neutral or pronated coals as you don't have much to lose before we wrap up some have suggested regardless of forearm position certain curling exercises could be better for the Brau radialis there are two different lines of thoughts the first one is that some analyses find the difference in elbow flexion leverage between the Brau radialis and the other elbow flexors tends to be largest as the elbow becomes increasing L flexed which is at the top portions of a curl due to this some say curling exercises that are harder at higher elbow flexion angles May elicit Superior Breaky radialis growth many regular free curls are already quite challenging at the middle to top parts of the curl and adding a resistance band on top will make the top part of the curl even harder thus perhaps this effectively increases the stimulus to the break your radialis the second line of thought opposes this it suggests since the breaku radialis leverage isn't that bad in lower elbow flexion angles and since we've seen that training muscles at longer length seems to be better for building muscle exercises that are harder in the bottom part of the curl when the muscles are at longer lengths could be best cable curl variations and free weight preacher curls do this that is they are relatively more challenging in the bottom part of the curl compared to regular free weighs and resistance banded curls I will note from the biceps perspective since it has attachments on the shoulder and can be lengthened during shoulder extension it will be at relatively longer lengths with the cable curl compared to preacher Coes whereas since the Breaky radialis doesn't have attachments at the shoulder its length is similar between both exercises so which of these two lines of thoughts is correct there is currently no published research that can help answer this but fortunately I'm aware of at least one study that's in the works that may help answer this once it's published we will update you at the house of hypotrophy until then I wouldn't overthink this too much and I would just select the curling exercise or exercises you

might be true in light of new and stronger evidence as mentioned in this video there are some studies currently being conducted that may help us better understand how we may more effectively build muscle and if further new evidence emerges that may support or challenge anything detailed in this video or anything else at the house of hypertrophy I plan to update you all to conclude we've covered a lot of information feel free to replay the video or use the timestamps in the description and pined comment to jump to specific sections but based on everything detailed we can see there are probably a quadrillion ways you could go about training your forearms as some examples if you only wanted to train with one forearm exercise some form of risk hold variation will help you train the most amount of forearm Mass we specifically saw how finger flexion wrisk curls due to them training all the flexor for our muscles at longer lengths might be best for hypertrophy if you're happy to perform more than one exercise adding in a wrist extension exercise likely helps you enhance growth of many muscles belonging to the posterior compartment of the forearm if you're someone who prefers even more variation besides these two exercises you could add in some form of grip training Dynamic finger flexion training or other specific exercises that generally Target the smaller muscles of the forearm finally we know the break your radial is part of the forearm to and this muscle is highly involved in elbow flexion a motion that occurs in exercises that are already present in many training programs such as vertical pools horizontal pools and any curling exercises thank you for making it to the end of the video feel free to check out the alpha progression app or our recent dive into

    "title": "Decrease Rest Between Sets (Overtime) For More Hypertrophy and Strength?",
    "published_at": "2022-01-27T12:00:02Z",
    "transcript": "In a session, most people perform\u00a0\nmultiple sets on a given exercise,\u00a0\u00a0 interspersed by a rest interval, typically\u00a0\nlasting anywhere from 1 to 5 minutes.\u00a0\u00a0 Most people also tend to hold their rest interval\u00a0\ndurations fairly constant from workout to workout. Opposed to this, from workout to workout,\u00a0\u00a0 an individual could gradually decrease\u00a0\ntheir rest interval durations between sets. How does this compare to using a constant\u00a0\nrest interval duration every session for\u00a0\u00a0 hypertrophy and strength? Is it\u00a0\nbetter, worse, or no different? Let us explore 2 studies by Souza\u00a0\nJunior et al. addressing this.\u00a0\u00a0 Then, we'll examine the limitations and\u00a0\nour conclusions with the current data. The first study recruited 21 men\u00a0\nwith at least 1 year of training\u00a0\u00a0 experience and assigned them into a\u00a0\nconstant or decreasing rest group. For the first 2 weeks, both\u00a0\ngroups trained identically.\u00a0\u00a0 They trained 6 times each week (the program\u00a0\nis on-screen) with each exercise performed\u00a0\u00a0 for 3 sets with a 10-12 rep max load,\u00a0\nusing 2 minutes of rest between sets. Thereafter, for the remaining 6 weeks,\u00a0\u00a0 both groups continued to train 6 times\u00a0\nper week but using a different program\u00a0\u00a0 (shown on-screen), with each exercise\u00a0\nperformed for 4 sets with an 8-10 rep-max load. The constant rest group continued resting\u00a0\n2 minutes between their sets in a session,\u00a0\u00a0 whereas the decreasing rest\u00a0\ngroup, throughout the 6 weeks,\u00a0\u00a0 gradually decreased their rest interval\u00a0\nduration from 2 minutes to 30 seconds. I should note that both groups adjusted\u00a0\ntheir loads when necessary to ensure they\u00a0\u00a0 kept performing 8-10 repetitions\u00a0\nacross their sets every session. After the 8 weeks of training, there was\u00a0\nno statistically significant difference in\u00a0\u00a0 increases in squat and bench press\u00a0\none-rep max between the two groups. Nor was there any statistically\u00a0\nsignificant difference in thigh\u00a0\u00a0 and arm cross-sectional area\u00a0\ngains between the two groups. Therefore, these results indicate gradually\u00a0\ndecreasing your rest interval duration across\u00a0\u00a0 6 weeks (from 2 minutes to 30 seconds) does\u00a0\nnot compromise hypertrophy or strength versus\u00a0\u00a0 resting for 2 minutes between sets,\u00a0\nbut it was not any better either. I want to bring your attention to another\u00a0\nway we could think of these results. On-screen are the volume loads (defined\u00a0\nas the number of sets multiped by load)\u00a0\u00a0 achieved on the bench press and squat\u00a0\nexercise across the final 6 weeks of training. The constant rest group continuously\u00a0\nincreased volume load on both these\u00a0\u00a0 exercises over the 6 weeks. Now, given both\u00a0\ngroups performed 4 sets on each exercise,\u00a0\u00a0 this data simply indicates this constant rest\u00a0\ngroup managed to progressive overload via\u00a0\u00a0 increasing the load they used within\u00a0\nthe 8-10 reps over the 6 weeks. Conversely, the decreasing rest group saw minimal\u00a0\nchanges in volume load on both exercises over the\u00a0\u00a0 6 weeks. Again, given they performed 4 sets per\u00a0\nexercise, this simply means they largely did not\u00a0\u00a0 increase the load used on their sets as they\u00a0\ndecreased their rest intervals over the 6 weeks. Another way to say all of this\u00a0\nis that the constant rest group\u00a0\u00a0 progressively overloaded via increasing\u00a0\nthe load they used, while the decreasing\u00a0\u00a0 rest group progressively overloaded by\u00a0\ndecreasing their rest interval durations. As both groups did not experience\u00a0\ndifferent strength or hypertrophy gains,\u00a0\u00a0 this study possibly indicates progressively\u00a0\noverloading via decreasing your rest interval\u00a0\u00a0 durations is no less effective than progressively\u00a0\noverloading via increasing the load you use. Let us move on to the second,\u00a0\nsimilarly designed, study. 22 men with at least 1 year\u00a0\nof training experience were\u00a0\u00a0 assigned into a constant or decreasing rest group. Both groups trained 6 times per week\u00a0\n(the program is on-screen) for 8 weeks,\u00a0\u00a0 with each exercise performed for\u00a0\n4 sets with an 8-10 rep-max load. The constant rest group used 2 minutes of\u00a0\nrest between sets throughout the full 8 weeks. The decreasing rest group rested for 2\u00a0\nminutes between sets for the first 2 weeks,\u00a0\u00a0 and thereafter gradually decreased\u00a0\ntheir rest interval duration each\u00a0\u00a0 week until they rested 30 seconds between sets. Like the last study, both groups adjusted\u00a0\ntheir loads when necessary to ensure they\u00a0\u00a0 kept performing 8-10 repetitions\u00a0\nacross their sets every session. Unlike the last study, the researchers\u00a0\nhad both groups supplement creatine.\u00a0\u00a0 All subjects in both groups loaded up\u00a0\nduring the first 7 days (consuming 20g of\u00a0\u00a0 creatine ) and thereafter maintained a dosage\u00a0\nof 5g of creatine until the end of the study. After the 8 training weeks, there was no\u00a0\nstatistically significant difference in\u00a0\u00a0 increases in squat and bench press\u00a0\none-rep max between the two groups. Nor was there any statistically\u00a0\nsignificant difference in thigh\u00a0\u00a0 and arm cross-sectional area\u00a0\ngains between the two groups.\u00a0\u00a0 Having said this, the percentages do actually\u00a0\nappear to favor the decreasing rest group. However, given it was not\u00a0\nstatistically significant,\u00a0\u00a0 we cannot be sure this percentage difference\u00a0\nbetween groups truly reflects a difference.\u00a0\u00a0 There were only 11 subjects per group, small\u00a0\nsample sizes like this can compromise your ability\u00a0\u00a0 to detect statistically significant changes, but\u00a0\nthey also introduce large variation in each group,\u00a0\u00a0 such that these differences might\u00a0\njust be a result of random chance. On the account of this, I think the most\u00a0\naccurate conclusion from this data is that\u00a0\u00a0 gradually decreasing your rest interval duration\u00a0\n(from 2 minutes to 30 seconds) across 8 weeks\u00a0\u00a0 was no less effective than constantly resting 2\u00a0\nminutes between sets for strength and hypertrophy. Now, in this study, volume load was defined\u00a0\nas load multiplied by repetition number.\u00a0\u00a0 However, given both groups\u00a0\nperformed 8-10 repetitions,\u00a0\u00a0 any change in volume load should\u00a0\nlargely reflect changes in loads. The constant rest group increased their\u00a0\u00a0 volume load on the bench press and\u00a0\nsquat across the 8 training weeks,\u00a0\u00a0 implying they progressively overloaded via\u00a0\nincreasing the loads used on their sets. However, interestingly, the decreasing\u00a0\nrest group actually saw a sharp decrease\u00a0\u00a0 in bench press volume load during weeks 3 and\u00a0\n4, indicating a reduction in load was needed to\u00a0\u00a0 maintain 8-10 reps per set as they gradually\u00a0\ndecreased their rest interval durations.\u00a0\u00a0 Thereafter, they more stably maintained volume\u00a0\nload, indicating they probably maintained\u00a0\u00a0 similar set loads while continuing\u00a0\nto decrease rest interval durations. Volume load on the squat for the decreasing\u00a0\nrest group was fairly stable across the 8 weeks,\u00a0\u00a0 with slight reductions in the\u00a0\nfinal weeks, largely indicating\u00a0\u00a0 they maintained their set loads while\u00a0\ndecreasing their rest interval durations. As a result, this study (like the last one)\u00a0\u00a0 indicates progressively overloading via\u00a0\ndecreasing your rest interval durations\u00a0\u00a0 (even if this somewhat necessitates a load\u00a0\nreduction in some circumstances) is no less\u00a0\u00a0 effective than progressively overloading via\u00a0\nincreasing set loads for hypertrophy and strength. Integrating these two studies, it\u00a0\nseems decreasing your rest interval\u00a0\u00a0 durations is not inferior to using\u00a0\na constant rest interval duration. Although, limitations and considerations exist. The decreasing rest group was\u00a0\ncompared to a constant rest\u00a0\u00a0 group resting 2 minutes between sets.\u00a0\nHowever, is 2 minutes of rest between\u00a0\u00a0 sets even optimal for hypertrophy and\u00a0\nstrength gains in the first place? As thoroughly examined in our rest interval\u00a0\nultimate guide video, with compound exercises,\u00a0\u00a0 resting for 2 minutes or more seems better\u00a0\nfor hypertrophy than shorter durations.\u00a0\u00a0 With isolation exercises, the current data is\u00a0\nconflicting in the optimal rest interval duration. For strength, the current data indicates 2 minutes\u00a0\nor more may be superior to shorter durations,\u00a0\u00a0 at least for trained individuals. However, is there actually\u00a0\na difference between resting\u00a0\u00a0 for exactly 2 minutes or resting beyond this? Ahtianen et al. found resting 2 minutes\u00a0\nbetween sets produced similar quadriceps\u00a0\u00a0 cross-sectional area increases compared\u00a0\nto resting 5 minutes between sets.\u00a0\u00a0 However, it's worth noting subjects\u00a0\nperformed 1 extra set per exercise on\u00a0\u00a0 average when resting 2 minutes between\u00a0\nsets, potentially confounding things. Willardson et al. found with all other training\u00a0\nvariables equal, resting 2 minutes between sets\u00a0\u00a0 produced similar squat one-rep max gains\u00a0\ncompared to resting 4 minutes between sets. Resultantly, the current limited existing\u00a0\nevidence suggests the use of 2-minute rest\u00a0\u00a0 intervals by the constant rep group in the\u00a0\nstudies might not actually be a limitation.\u00a0\u00a0 But again, this is limited evidence, no other\u00a0\nexisting data (to my knowledge) helps us. Another consideration is both studies lasted 8\u00a0\nweeks, what would happen over longer durations? At least two possible questions stem from this. First, what if after the 8 weeks, the decreasing\u00a0\nrest group simply continued to rest 30 seconds\u00a0\u00a0 between sets (as this itself is quite a short rest\u00a0\nduration, shortening it further may not be that\u00a0\u00a0 practical), over many months, would they still\u00a0\nexperience similar strength and hypertrophy gains? Secondly, what if someone, over many months, kept\u00a0\nswitching back and forth between periods of only\u00a0\u00a0 progressively overloading via decreasing rest\u00a0\ninterval durations and periods of maintaining\u00a0\u00a0 a constant rest interval but overloading\u00a0\nvia increasing set loads? would this method\u00a0\u00a0 still be as effective as exclusively using a\u00a0\nconstant rest interval duration between sets? Finally, it's worth remembering both the studies\u00a0\u00a0 were conducted on trained men with\u00a0\nan average age of roughly 20-22. What about other individuals\u00a0\nnot in this demographic? Overall, it would be awesome to see if\u00a0\nfuture studies could replicate these studies,\u00a0\u00a0 as well as perhaps address some of the\u00a0\nlimitations and considerations we noted.\u00a0\u00a0 But for the time being, it seems that\u00a0\ndecreasing rest interval durations,\u00a0\u00a0 at least in the short term, may be perfectly\u00a0\nfine for hypertrophy and strength gains."

    "title": "Are Isolation Exercises USELESS for Muscle Hypertrophy? (19 STUDIES)",
    "published_at": "2022-05-30T11:00:00Z",
    "transcript": "Bro, don't you know isolation\u00a0\nexercises do nothing? What are you on about? Science has shown adding isolation exercises to a\u00a0\u00a0 compound exercise program does\u00a0\nnot produce more muscle growth. Wait, what? You sure this is the correct\u00a0\ninterpretation of the research? Let me check what House of Hypertrophy has to say. Are compound exercises (exercises that train two\u00a0\u00a0 or more muscle groups) enough\u00a0\nfor maxing muscle hypertrophy? And are isolation exercises (exercises that\u00a0\ntrain one muscle group) just a waste of time? A couple of scientific papers have\u00a0\nsuggested this. Let us examine them. A 2015 Brazillian study by Gentil et al. compared\u00a0\nlat pulldowns to barbell biceps curls for elbow\u00a0\u00a0 flexor growth. The elbow flexors consisted of\u00a0\nthe biceps and brachialis muscles in this case. After 10 weeks of training, increases\u00a0\nin elbow flexor thickness were similar\u00a0\u00a0 between the lat pulldown and biceps curl training. Suggesting an isolation exercise (the biceps curl)\u00a0\u00a0 does not produce any more growth to\u00a0\na compound exercise (the latpulldown) However, this study does not tell us if\u00a0\ncompared to only performing lat pulldowns,\u00a0\u00a0 the combination of lat pulldowns and\u00a0\ncurls could enhance elbow flexor growth. Fortunately, another 2013 Brazillian\u00a0\nstudy by Gentil et al. evaluated this. Group one only trained the\u00a0\nbench press and lat pulldown. Group two performed the bench press\u00a0\nand lat pulldown with the addition of\u00a0\u00a0 a biceps curl and triceps extension. Both groups performed 3 sets of\u00a0\n8-12 repetitions to failure on each\u00a0\u00a0 exercise per session. This meant training volume\u00a0\nwas not equated between both groups. As group two\u00a0\u00a0 performed two additional isolation exercises, they\u00a0\nwould have accumulated higher training volumes. Despite this, after 10 weeks of training,\u00a0\u00a0 increases in elbow flexor thickness\u00a0\nwere similar between both groups. Indicating adding biceps curls\u00a0\nto lat pulldown training does not\u00a0\u00a0 enhance elbow flexor growth versus\u00a0\nonly training lat pulldowns. Unfortunately, the researchers did not\u00a0\nassess triceps growth in this study. In 2015, another Brazillian study by Franca et\u00a0\nal. further supported these previous findings. Group one trained with the following training\u00a0\nprogram, consisting of only compound exericses. Group two trained with all\u00a0\nthe same compound exercises,\u00a0\u00a0 but performed two added\u00a0\nisolation exercises per session. Both groups performed 3 sets of 10-15\u00a0\nreps for each exercise per session,\u00a0\u00a0 again meaning group two would have\u00a0\naccumulated higher training volumes. After 8 weeks of training,\u00a0\nincreases in arm circumference\u00a0\u00a0 were statistically similar between both groups. Suggesting yet again that additional\u00a0\u00a0 isolation exercises provide no\u00a0\nfurther muscle growth benefit. These three research papers (the ones\u00a0\njust overviewed) were later included\u00a0\u00a0 in a 2017 review study by Gentil et al.,\u00a0\nin which it was stated \"the addition of SJ\u00a0\u00a0 exercises to an MJ exercise program does not seem\u00a0\nto increase gains in muscle size and strength\". SJ stands for single-joint,\u00a0\u00a0 which are isolation exercises, while MJ stands\u00a0\nfor multi-joint, which are compound exercises. Before moving on, it's worth\u00a0\nnoting that since 2017,\u00a0\u00a0 4 additional studies all published by\u00a0\nBarbalho et al. further indicate that\u00a0\u00a0 additional isolation exercises to a compound\u00a0\nexercise program do not enhance muscle growth. However, it's recently been established\u00a0\nmuch research by Barbalho et al. contains\u00a0\u00a0 improbable and atypical data. The data\u00a0\nin these studies cannot be trusted,\u00a0\u00a0 perhaps because the data is illegitimate. Thus, I believe we cannot use these\u00a0\nstudies as additional evidence. Hello There. You're killing your gains. So it's clear some researchers speculate\u00a0\ncompound exercises may indeed max hypertrophy. But as many of you are probably thinking,\u00a0\nsurely there exist limitations and shortcomings. Indeed, I believe there are, and many of\u00a0\nthese limitations were nicely discussed in\u00a0\u00a0 a paper by Ribeiro et al. that was directly\u00a0\nresponding to the Gentil et al. review paper Firstly, only growth of the elbow\u00a0\nflexors and arms were measured,\u00a0\u00a0 and only at a single region of these muscles\u00a0\n(roughly the midpoints of the muscles). This begs the question,\u00a0\u00a0 what about other regions of these muscles,\u00a0\nand what about other muscle groups? Examining the question about other\u00a0\nregions of the same muscle first,\u00a0\u00a0 I believe there's sufficient evidence\u00a0\nto believe regional hypertrophy exists. That is, an exercise for a muscle does not\u00a0\ngrow all regions of that muscle equally,\u00a0\u00a0 rather it grows some regions more than others. For example, Kawakami et al. found after subjects\u00a0\ntrained overhead extensions for 16 weeks,\u00a0\u00a0 the triceps mainly increased in cross-sectional\u00a0\narea in the middle to slightly lower regions.\u00a0\u00a0 But in the most upper and lower regions of\u00a0\nthe muscle, little growth was experienced. Likewise, Ema et al. found after\u00a0\nleg extension training for 12 weeks,\u00a0\u00a0 growth not only differed between\u00a0\nthe quadriceps heads but within\u00a0\u00a0 each of these muscle heads, growth differed\u00a0\nbetween the upper and lower regions of them. This data might suggest that if we wanted to\u00a0\nmaximize growth across as many regions of a\u00a0\u00a0 muscle as possible, using a range of exercises\u00a0\nthat biomechanically differ could work. The biomechanically different exercises,\u00a0\u00a0 when compared to each other, may target different\u00a0\nregions of the muscle more so than others,\u00a0\u00a0 so collectively they maximize growth\u00a0\nacross the regions of a muscle. Isolation exercises would be\u00a0\nnecessary and pivotal in this. A 2021 Brazillian study by\u00a0\nCosta et al. supports this. 22 men were allocated into a\u00a0\nnon-varied or varied group. Both groups trained 3 days per week for 8 weeks The non-varied group did train with\u00a0\nboth compound and isolation exercises,\u00a0\u00a0 but they performed the exact same\u00a0\nexercises on the 3 training days per week. The varied group, on each\u00a0\nof the three days per week,\u00a0\u00a0 performed different compound and isolation\u00a0\nexercises for their muscle groups. Before and after the study, the researchers\u00a0\nmeasured the thickness of the upper, middle,\u00a0\u00a0 and lower regions of the rectus femoris,\u00a0\nvastus lateralis, elbow flexors, and triceps. In a couple of measured regions, increases\u00a0\nwere similar between both groups.\u00a0\u00a0 However, in other measured regions,\u00a0\ngains favored the varied group.\u00a0\u00a0 Thus, the varied group experienced\u00a0\nthe most regional hypertrophy overall. As a result, this study suggests performing a\u00a0\ncouple of different exercises for a muscle group\u00a0\u00a0 (specifically 3 different isolation\u00a0\nand compound movements per week)\u00a0\u00a0 promotes growth across regions of a muscle. Moving forward, other muscle\u00a0\ngroups not examined in the three\u00a0\u00a0 previously mentioned studies are likely\u00a0\nminimally trained with compound exercises. The lateral deltoid abducts the shoulder joint.\u00a0\u00a0 No compound exercise significantly involves\u00a0\nthis motion, so isolation exercises that do this\u00a0\u00a0 (like lateral raises) are likely required\u00a0\nto maximally grow the lateral deltoid. The calf muscles plantarflex the ankle, a motion\u00a0\nthat no compound exercise significantly involves.\u00a0\u00a0 So plantarflexion exercises\u00a0\nlike seated and standing calf\u00a0\u00a0 raises are likely needed to max calf hypertrophy. Compound exercises training the hamstrings\u00a0\nprimarily do so via hip extension movement. However, the hamstrings also flex the knee,\u00a0\nand there's evidence different parts of the\u00a0\u00a0 hamstrings may be recruited during either hip\u00a0\nextension and knee flexion motion. Thus, knee\u00a0\u00a0 flexion exercises (like leg curls) are probably\u00a0\nneeded to max regional hamstring hypertrophy. Compound exercises that train the quadriceps\u00a0\nseem to grow the vasti muscle heads very well,\u00a0\u00a0 but not the rectus femoris. Leg\u00a0\nextensions and reverse nordic\u00a0\u00a0 curls significantly develop the rectus femoris,\u00a0\u00a0 so one of these isolation exercises are likely\u00a0\nnecessary to optimally grow all quadricep heads. As for the triceps, two studies\u00a0\nindicate the bench press fairly\u00a0\u00a0 develops the lateral and medial triceps\u00a0\nheads, but minimally the long head. You see, the long head crosses\u00a0\nboth the shoulder and elbow joints\u00a0\u00a0 (the lateral and medial heads\u00a0\nonly cross the elbow joint). And many compound exercises that train the triceps\u00a0\n(like the bench press, push-up, and even dips)\u00a0\u00a0 involve shoulder extension during the lowering\u00a0\nphase of the exercise, a motion that shortens the\u00a0\u00a0 long head and inhibits it from significantly\u00a0\nproducing force during the lifting phase. Isolation exercises such as skull\u00a0\ncrushers, overhead extensions,\u00a0\u00a0 and rope pushdowns have all been shown\u00a0\nto significantly develop the long head. Moreover, recall the Costa et al. study\u00a0\nfound training with a variety of triceps\u00a0\u00a0 isolation exercises in a week resulted in\u00a0\ngrowth across more regions of the triceps. It\u2019s clear substantial hypertrophy can\u00a0\nbe achieved with compound exercises only. Yet the conclusion compound\u00a0\nexercises are sufficient for\u00a0\u00a0 muscle hypertrophy is likely incorrect. Many muscle groups and regions of a muscle\u00a0\ngroup are likely not optimally trained with\u00a0\u00a0 compound exercises, hence additional\u00a0\nisolation exercises are necessary."

    "published_at": "2023-11-20T11:59:59Z",
    "transcript": "[Music] welcome to the house of hypertrophy when it comes to developing your goal physique or strength levels can a key component accelerate your gains while minimizing training plateaus some of you may be thinking wait a second are you talking about special vitamins not quite actually not at all rather I'm talking about periodization huh what on Earth is this in very simple terms periodization refers to manipulating your trading variables across time linear periodization and daily undulating periodization are the most studied linear periodization mainly involves decreasing the number of reps you perform across weeks while using heavier loads if we consider intensity as the load you're using and volume as the product of sets multiplied by reps we can say linear periodization involves decreasing volume and increasing intensity across time daily undulating periodization mainly involves varying the number of reps every session of the week so if for example example you're trading the bench press three times a week you may use these variables across those days you could perform this every week and progressively overload to keep trading two or close to failure within those rep ranges using the same definitions as before undulating periodization involves volume and intensity going up and down across weeks all of this contrasts with non-p Paradise training which is just training with the same rep range and progressively overloading within that across time so does Paradise ation lead to more hypertrophy and strength versus nonp Paradise training let's dive [Music] in regular house of hypy viewers will know that on average reps between six and 35 produce similar hypertophy provided reps are perform two or close to failure given this information you may think varying rep Ranger shouldn't provide extra gains well we can't rule out their potentially being a synergistic effect of training with different rep ranges but let's take a look at what the evidence says a 2022 meta analysis from Denmark helps us out for those unaware a metaanalysis statistically combines the results of numerous studies looking at the same topic and is generally considered the best form of scientific evidence the researchers found no significant difference in muscle growth between non-p periodized and periodized training this held true for both trained and untrained subjects the researchers additionally performed a comparison between linear periodization to undulating periodization we already detailed what linear periodization may look like as well as daily undulating periodization but weekly undulating periodization is another form of undulating periodization which involves cycling through different rep ranges across the weeks the researchers established muscle growth did not significantly differ between linear and undulating models this held true for both trained and untrained subjects so at face value these findings tell us that period of ation may not matter for building muscle and if you do decide to periodize training there may be no real difference between linear and undulating models so is that all we need to know not quite metaanalyses are only as good as the studies contributing to them and there are two potentially important limitations with the studies furthermore there are some other studies that are worth knowing about before unraveling these points Let's us first analyze the effects of periodization on strength gains the 2022 meta analysis from Denmark also evaluated the effects of periodization on one R max strength gains it was found periodization did lead to Greater strength gains Than nonp Paradise training holding true for both untrained and trained subjects however there is a potential limitation we know that training with lower reps and heavier loads better increases one R max strength for example this study had subject train a program including the bench West and squats with either either three sets of two to four reps with a heavy load or three sets of 8 to 12 reps with a moderate load bench press and squat strength gains were Superior with a two to four reps I bring this up because in the studies Behind The Meta analysis the peradise trading tended to involve more training with lower reps and heavier loads for example here's how one of the studies looked a non-p periodized group only trained with sets of 8 to 10 reps while a periodized group involves some training with four to five rips therefore periodization itself may not have caused the greater strength gains rather it might be because the periodization groups involve training more with lower reps and heavier loads we need better design studies to investigate this further for instance how would this periodization program compare to a non-p periodized group that just trained with lower reps and heavier loads yet other areas of the literature may still suggest periodization has strength benefits returning to the 2022 Denmark meta analysis the researchers performed an additional comparison between linear and undulating periodization for one R max strength gains and these gains work greater with undulating periodization interestingly this only held true for trained subjects and not untrained individuals therefore undulating periodization may be better for increasing one R max strength versus linear periodization in trained individuals and since most studies involved both periodization models training with lower reps and heavier loads the same number of times across the study this wouldn't explain the finding moreover there's other evidence periodization could benefit strength moments ago we mentioned how training with lower reps and heavier loads best increases strength this is likely because they more closely replicate a 1mx strength test and more effectively develops your skill and neural adaptations towards this but I'm skeptical that training only with lower reps and heavier loads in the longterm maximizes strength the reason for this is lower reps with heavier loads aren't the most effective for building muscle for example we know this study found that three sets of 2 to four reps are better increased strength than three sets of 8 to 12 reps but muscle growth was overall better with the 8 to 12 reps in the very long term muscle growth might contribute to your strength levels this is because a large part of muscle growth is the addition of force generating units that should enhance your muscle strength we'll have some videos on this in the future at the house of hypertrophy therefore having a combination of lower reps to develop neural and skill comp opponents and higher reps to more efficiently build muscle may be ideal for improving strength in the long term so overall my current conclusion is that periodization particularly some form of undulating periodization is beneficial for improving your One max [Music] strength returning to discussing muscle hypertrophy we mentioned although the meta analysis found no significant difference in hypertrophy between periodization and non periodization training there are some limitations it could be argued the periodization training in the studies was suboptimal for building muscle what I mean is in a fair few studies we know the periodization group spent some time training with four or fewer reps which we also know it isn't the most effective for building muscle rather reps between 6 to 35 provided they perform two or very close to failure are better for building muscle therefore it would be interesting to see the results of studies that do not have the periodization groups go as low as four or fewer reps on their sets another limitation of the studies is they largely lasted 12 weeks or less what about in the longer term we have this study by Kramer which was involved in the meta analysis this study was actually 9 months and it's the longest study to date that's been conducted on the topic it compared a non-p periodized group to a daily undulating group that varied their rep range between 4 and 15 increases in fat-free Mass were greater for the Daily undul in group but fat free mess is an indirect measure of muscle growth the subjects were also previously untrained women so you may question its generalizability but this isn't always a problem as detailed in a previous video even so we might just consider this early evidence of the long-term effects furthermore some other studies Point towards varying your rep ranges benefiting muscle growth such as this paper subjects performed a range of exercises for three sets each in a training session a narrow rep range group performed 12 reps on the first set 10 reps on the second set and eight reps on the final set a wider rep range group performed 15 reps on the first set 10 reps on the second set and five reps on the third set in other words both groups did what is known as ascending pyramid training the only difference being The Wider rep range group trained across a wider range of repetitions after 12 weeks of training muscle mass gains were Superior for The Wider rep range group the subjects were previously untrained older women finally let me describe what may be the strongest reason for varying rep ranges as alluded to earlier reps between 6 and 35 appear to be similarly effective for building muscle however this is based on the average results of the studies and we have some data indicating individuals may differ from this this is a concept explored very recently at the house of hypertrophy with this paper establishing some people experienced better thigh growth from either training with 8 to 12 reps or 27 to 31 reps since then I've also discovered another paper detailing individual differences seated and standing C raisers were trained for four sets each session by previously untrained men they performed 6 to 10 reps to failure per set with one leg and 20 to 30 reps to failure per set with the other leg average growth of the Cal muscles was similar between both rep ranges but although some aligned with the average others saw better growth with a 6 to 10 or 20 to 30 reps in reality it can be difficult to figure out if you grow better with a certain rep range and it could even differ between your muscles accordingly the simplest solution might be to vary your rep ranges that way if some of your muscles respond better to higher or lower reps varying rep ranges ensures at least part of your program is optimized for this reason and some of the other reasons covered it may be a good idea to train with different rep ranges remember no study to date has found it to be inferior but I will say if you're coming from the position where you don't want to vary your rep ranges I'd say simply continue training as you prefer the evidence outlined in this video is not strong enough to say you're absolutely going to be missing out on a ton of gains when not varing rep ranges if you do want to vary your rep ranges you have a ton of flexibility on how you may do this a linear undulating pyramid approach or even something else like training different exercises for the same muscle with varying rep ranges remember for strength gains undulating seems to be better so could be ideal to develop strength and size simultaneously if you're searching for

to clarify some things some viewers might have been wondering isn't varying rep ranges ideal because lower reps better grow fast twitch fibers while higher reps better grow slow twitch fibers despite being logical we've previously seen at the house of hyry that the research doesn't support this we've also just talked about linear and undulating periodization as we know they're the most studied but theoretically there are a trillion other ways you could periodize for strength or size and in the pinned comment I've speculated on other methods finally we've heavily used the term periodization throughout this video since it was used in the literature but I don't think this was necessarily appropriate in all cases the pinned comment also contains my expanded thoughts on this nonetheless summarizing the video periodized programs seem to Just Produce similar muscle growth to non-p periodized programs similar hypertrophy between linear and undulating periodization models is also found however there are some limitations to these studies as well as extra research that might suggest training with different rep ranges could be beneficial for hypertrophy you might wish to do this in some form but if this doesn't appeal to you know it's still possible to grow very well without training with different rep ranges as for strength periodization programs seem to result in Greater improvements than non-p periodized programs and in trained individuals undulating periodization seems to produce better gains than linear periodization thank you for watching feel free to check out

    "title": "Should You Train to Failure for Muscle Growth? (New Study)",
    "published_at": "2020-06-17T11:41:57Z",
    "transcript": "the pointer would you stop asset during training as a topic commonly debated in the fitness world usually revolving around whether set should be taken to failure what does the research say a recent 20/20 study by Australian colleagues aimed to determine whether taking sets to failure was essential for maximizing hypertrophy 10 untrained men had one leg assigned to a failure condition while their other leg was assigned to a non failure condition the unilateral leg extension was used to train each leg each participant trained five times per week for 14 weeks however only one leg was trained each workout meaning that on one week they were trained the failure leg three times while the non failure leg was trained twice but the following week the non failure leg was trained three times whereas the failure neck was trained twice over the 14 weeks this meant that both legs were trained the same amount of times during weeks one and two three sets with 50% 1rm was performed for both groups during weeks three to eight three sets with 60% owner and was performed for both groups during weeks nine to fourteen four sets with 60% ranarium was performed in both groups also after the third week one rep max was retested every two weeks to ensure the accuracy of load for the leg that trained to failure as you'd expect each set was taken to failure for the leg assigns at a non failure condition the total number of reps completed in the last failure leg session was added up and divided by the number of sets performed this number was then used as the number of reps performed in each set for the non failure condition if this confuses you let me use a hypothetical example let's say a participant during one of the workouts with a failure leg completed nine reps on the first set seven reps on the second set and five reps on the last set if we add these numbers up which is 21 and divided by the number of sets performed which is three we get seven so in the next session for their non failure leg three sets of seven reps were completed with that load this design essentially meant that for all participants the non failure leg would have been roughly leaving around two to three reps and result on the first set one to two reps in reserve in the second set while the third or fourth set would have been one to zero reps in reserve ultrasound imaging was used to measure cross-sectional area changes in the rectus femoris and vastus lateralis or both legs what the researchers found was that increases in cross sectional area for the rectus femoris vastus lateralis was statistically similar between conditions although the percentages do overall slightly favor the non failure condition something pretty cool about the study was they presented their individual data responses for increases in rectus femoris cross sectional area for individuals responded better to non failure training three individuals responded better to failure training while the remaining three responded similarly to both conditions for increases in vastus lateralis cross-sectional area for individuals responded better to non Paleo training while the remaining six responded similarly to both conditions this data highlights the importance of individualization some individuals may respond better to failure training while others may respond better to maintaining a few reps in reserve also some intra individual variations may exist that is to say for a certain individual some muscles may be more responsive to failure training while others may be more responsive to keeping a few reps in reserve needless to say knowing this can be quite difficult but in the long run through maintaining a training log experimenting and analyzing it will definitely gain a greater understanding of what works best for you when looking at the rest of the research on training to failure the study detailed at his video seems to summarize it quite well overall training with a few reps in reserve so around 3 or less appears to produce similar results the training to failure as we can see studies that have the non failure training groups using a higher number of reps or reserve so around 5 class ultimately find training to failure to be better although the study by Karin and colleagues does disagree with this their findings were likely because what all subjects perform sprint training twice per week at the top of lifting weights training to failure is more fatigued than maintaining reps in reserve but sprint training and training to failure results in even more fatigue therefore there's a case to be made that the failure group was under recovery and it's possible that if neither group was print training the failure group would have superior results however a major problem with the current research is there isn't enough research looking at trained individuals we already know that training responses differ between trained and untrained individuals it's possible trained individuals may on average response similarly to maintaining a few reps in reserve and training to failure but it's also possible they respond better to training to failure or even maintaining a few reps in reserve we unfortunately just don't know at this moment moving on a lot of people actually underestimate the number of reps they can perform a 20-17 study by Hackett and colleagues demonstrated this very idea eighty-one adults with a varying training experience performed five sets on the chest but with 70% warner ham and five sets on the leg press with 80% order ham with these loads on these exercises you can typically perform 20 reps or less during each set participants will stop at a tenth rep and asked how many further reps they think they could achieve then the participant immediately went back to performing reps the failure looking at the results for the chest press it's clear to see that participants underestimated the number of reps they could perform for example it appears that was common for individuals to feel they could only perform five or six more reps when in actual fact they could perform ten this was the same story for the leg press surprisingly training experience didn't actually have much of an effect this is important as if you were to train with a few reps to reserve you might underestimate the actual number of reps we left and reserve given this it might be a good idea to occasionally train to failure so you consistently remind yourself for how it feels to go to failure thereby helping to keep you more accountable when you do leave reps and reserve the context of the particular exercise you're performing may also play a role in determining how close you train to failure with multitronic exercises such as squats and bench presses maintaining correct form is integral to not only minimize the risk of an injury but to also efficiently train the intended muscles for some especially beginners taking multi-joint movements the failure can result in the breakdown of form mainly due to fatigue causing a lack of concentration and awareness therefore it may be a good idea to maintain a few reps in reserve with such movements with single joint exercises such as bicep curls and tricep skull crushers it isn't as much of a skill component with it therefore fatigue is likely to have minimal effects on form and so training to failure is viable with such movements thanks for watching if you enjoyed the video the right could be awesome also let me know how you train do you like to keep a few reps in reserve or train to failure or do you even do a bit of both I have lots more videos planned if you think you'd enjoy my content subscribing would be appreciated [Music]"

    "title": "Partial Squats Are Superior to Deep Squats for Size, Strength, and Speed (True or False?)",
    "published_at": "2022-01-24T12:00:01Z",
    "transcript": "The high bar back squat (from\u00a0\nhereafter simply called the squat)\u00a0\u00a0 is one of the most popular lower body exercises. This exercise can be executed\u00a0\nin a variety of ways.\u00a0\u00a0 Stance width, foot orientation,\u00a0\nand depth can all be altered. Out of these, depth is probably\u00a0\nthe most commonly debated variable. It's easy to come across opinions supporting\u00a0\neither side. One side suggests partial range\u00a0\u00a0 of motion squats maximize the adaptations\u00a0\nyou experience, while the other side may\u00a0\u00a0 suggest you're leaving gains on the table by\u00a0\nnot performing full range of motion squats. In this article, I'll do my best\u00a0\nto detail the current literature\u00a0\u00a0 comparing partial range of motion squats\u00a0\n(in this article defined as squats above\u00a0\u00a0 parallel) to deeper range of motion squats for\u00a0\nhypertrophy, strength, and athletic outcomes. Let's dive in. Starting off with hypertrophy comparisons,\u00a0\nthere are currently two relevant papers. Bloomquist et al. recruited 17 men untrained at\u00a0\nleast in the 6 months leading up to the study\u00a0\u00a0 and assigned them into a\u00a0\npartial or deep squat group. The partial squat group performed squats\u00a0\nfrom 0 to 60 degrees of knee flexion,\u00a0\u00a0 while the deep squat group performed squats\u00a0\nfrom 0 to 120 degrees of knee flexion. Both groups trained their respective\u00a0\nexercise three times per week\u00a0\u00a0 (the program is on-screen) for 12 weeks. Front thigh cross-sectional area\u00a0\n(consisting of the quadriceps,\u00a0\u00a0 sartorius, and adductors), measured across\u00a0\n6 regions, was all greater for the deep\u00a0\u00a0 squat group. The partial squat group only\u00a0\nexperienced growth at the two proximal regions. Therefore, this study indicates squatting to 120\u00a0\u00a0 degrees of knee flexion evokes greater\u00a0\noverall growth of the front thigh. Kubo et al. had 17 men untrained at\u00a0\nleast in the year leading up to the\u00a0\u00a0 study assigned into a partial or deep squat group. The partial squat group performed squats\u00a0\nfrom 0 to 90 degrees of knee flexion,\u00a0\u00a0 while the deep squat group performed squats\u00a0\nfrom 0 to 140 degrees of knee flexion. Both groups trained their exercise for\u00a0\n3 sets with roughly an 8 rep-max load,\u00a0\u00a0 twice per week for 10 weeks. After the study, quadriceps volume\u00a0\nincreased similarly in both groups,\u00a0\u00a0 suggesting 90-degree squats may be a\u00a0\nsufficient depth to optimize quadriceps growth. However, increases in adductor and gluteus\u00a0\nmaximus volume were significantly greater\u00a0\u00a0 for the deep squat group, suggesting achieving\u00a0\u00a0 deep squat depths is necessary to\u00a0\nmaximize growth of these two muscles. So, these two studies collectively\u00a0\nindicate deeper squat depths are\u00a0\u00a0 associated with more hypertrophy overall.\u00a0\n60-degree squats in the Bloomquist study\u00a0\u00a0 failed to optimize growth across\u00a0\nmany regions of the front thigh,\u00a0\u00a0 while although 90-degree squats in the Kubo\u00a0\nstudy seemed to be fine for quad growth, they\u00a0\u00a0 failed to maximize gluteus maximus and adductor\u00a0\ngrowth when compared to 140-degree deep squats. Moving on to strength, how do partial squats\u00a0\ncompare to deep squats for this component? In total, the literature indicates this\u00a0\nfollows the principle of specificity. More precisely, the already mentioned two\u00a0\nstudies by Bloomquist and Kubo, as well as a\u00a0\u00a0 study by Rhea et al. and Hartmann et al. indicate\u00a0\none-rep max gains on some form of a partial range\u00a0\u00a0 of motion squat are greater for the group that\u00a0\ntrains with that partial range of motion squat\u00a0\u00a0 versus a group that squats deeper. However,\u00a0\none-rep max gains on a deep squat is greater\u00a0\u00a0 for the group that trains that deep squat versus\u00a0\na group that trains some form of a partial squat. Now, in all of these studies, they only\u00a0\nassessed how exclusive partial range of\u00a0\u00a0 motion squat training compares to\u00a0\nexclusive deeper squat training? However, could there be any potential benefit to\u00a0\u00a0 combining both partial and\u00a0\ndeeper squats for strength? A study by Bazyler et al. suggests there might be. 17 men with an average full squat one-rep max of\u00a0\u00a0 146.9kg were assigned to a deep\u00a0\nsquat or combination squat group. The deep squat group performed full squats (the\u00a0\nresearchers did not provide further detail),\u00a0\u00a0 while the combination group performed\u00a0\nboth full and partial squats\u00a0\u00a0 (the partial squats were performed\u00a0\nto 100 degrees knee flexion). A block periodized design with heavy and light\u00a0\ndays was used. Both groups performed similar\u00a0\u00a0 total volume (in this case, the product of load\u00a0\nx range of motion x repetition number) on the\u00a0\u00a0 squat each week, the only difference being the\u00a0\ndeep squat group performed only full squats,\u00a0\u00a0 while the combination group's volume was\u00a0\ndivided between full and partial squats. After 12 training weeks, increases in full\u00a0\nsquat one-rep max, and partial squat one-rep max\u00a0\u00a0 (performed to 100 degrees of knee flexion)\u00a0\nwere greater for the combination group. Therefore, perhaps full and partial squats\u00a0\nsynergistically promote one-rep max strength. However, there are some things worth\u00a0\nkeeping in mind with this study. Firstly, the partial squat was\u00a0\nperformed to 100 degrees of knee\u00a0\u00a0 flexion, could the same results be obtained with\u00a0\u00a0 other partial range of motion squats (such as\u00a0\na 60-degree knee flexion squat, for example)? Secondly, the subjects were trained (recall\u00a0\ntheir average full squat one-rep max before the\u00a0\u00a0 study was 146.9kg), would the same results\u00a0\nhold true for less trained individuals? Thirdly, this is only a single study.\u00a0\u00a0 There are no other studies (to my\u00a0\nknowledge) with a similar design. Nonetheless, I think this study's\u00a0\nfinding is quite intriguing,\u00a0\u00a0 and it would be great to see if\u00a0\nfuture studies could replicate it. Progressing on, how do partial\u00a0\nsquats compare to deep squats for\u00a0\u00a0 athletic outcomes such as jumping or sprinting? Interestingly, your training and\u00a0\nathletic experience may be a factor here. The already mentioned study by Bloomquist et al.\u00a0\nfound in men who'd not been training in the 6\u00a0\u00a0 months leading up to the study, training\u00a0\nwith 120-degree squats produced greater\u00a0\u00a0 increases in squat jump and countermovement jump\u00a0\nheight versus training with 60-degree squats. Comparably, Hartmann et al. established in\u00a0\nmen and women with low training experience,\u00a0\u00a0 full squats produced greater increases\u00a0\nin squat jump and countermovement jump\u00a0\u00a0 height compared to 60 degrees knee flexion\u00a0\npartial squats performed in a smith machine. However, Rhea et al. recruited college athletes\u00a0\nwho squatted an average of 120-130kg and had an\u00a0\u00a0 average vertical jump of 73-75cm, as well as an\u00a0\naverage 40-yard dash between 4.76-4.68 seconds.\u00a0\u00a0 This group of researchers\u00a0\ncompared 3 different squat depths:\u00a0\u00a0 55-65 degree squats, 85-95 degree squats,\u00a0\nand greater than 110-degree squats. Overall, the partial 55-65 degree squats\u00a0\nevoked the greatest increases in vertical jump\u00a0\u00a0 height and 40-yard sprint speed.\u00a0\nMoreover, the 85-95 degree squats\u00a0\u00a0 also evoked greater increases versus\u00a0\nthe greater than 110-degree squats. Integrating these three studies, it seems in\u00a0\nindividuals with minimal training experience,\u00a0\u00a0 full squats may be superior for athletic\u00a0\ndevelopment versus partial squats.\u00a0\u00a0 But for trained individuals, partial\u00a0\nsquats may be more favorable. Having said this, it's worth noting\u00a0\nthere are only three studies,\u00a0\u00a0 and there is only one study\u00a0\nconducted on trained individuals,\u00a0\u00a0 so future research could definitely\u00a0\nchange these conclusions. In summary, deep squats seem to provide a more\u00a0\npowerful stimulus for overall muscle hypertrophy. As for strength, if you want to\u00a0\nmaximize your deep squat one-rep max,\u00a0\u00a0 training the deep squat likely achieves this\u00a0\nbetter than training only partial squats.\u00a0\u00a0 Inversely, if you want to maximize\u00a0\nyour partial squat one-rep max,\u00a0\u00a0 training that partial squat likely achieves\u00a0\nthis better than training only deep squats.\u00a0\u00a0 As we know, one interesting study suggests\u00a0\ncombining both deep and partial squats may\u00a0\u00a0 produce greater deep and partial squat one-rep\u00a0\nmax gains compared to only training deep squats. For developing athletic attributes\u00a0\nsuch as jump height and sprint speed,\u00a0\u00a0 those with minimal training experience seem to\u00a0\nexperience the best adaptations with deep squats,\u00a0\u00a0 as opposed to partial squats. But for those\u00a0\nwith more extensive training experience,\u00a0\u00a0 partial squats may confer\u00a0\ngreater gains in these areas. Before closing out the article, I thought it would\u00a0\nbe worth touching on injury risks with squats. It's far from common to hear that deep squats\u00a0\nare unhealthy for spine and knee health. Now, I should mention I'm by no stretch\u00a0\nof the imagination an expert on injuries,\u00a0\u00a0 but I think it's worth sharing this\u00a0\nextensive review study by Hartmann et al. The researchers performed a\u00a0\ncomprehensive analysis on whether\u00a0\u00a0 deep squats truly possess greater injury risk.\u00a0\nFundamentally, they concluded they did not. The full text to the study can be found here,\u00a0\u00a0 but one of the things demonstrated\u00a0\nis how adaptable the body is. For example, there's data showing professional\u00a0\nweightlifters (who spend a significant time in\u00a0\u00a0 deep squatting positions) possess significantly\u00a0\nhigher knee joint cartilage thickness versus\u00a0\u00a0 untrained individuals. Moreover, other data\u00a0\nindicates elite weightlifters possessed 133%\u00a0\u00a0 higher bone mineral density in the lower back\u00a0\nregion compared to untrained individuals. Finally, and quite interestingly, the\u00a0\nresearchers also suggest that partial squats\u00a0\u00a0 (due to requiring heavier loads\u00a0\nfor an effective stimulus(\u00a0\u00a0 might actually involve a greater\u00a0\ninjury risk versus full squats."

    "transcript": "14 billion years ago the universe began a few minor events have happened along the way but the most important thing is you are here lifting weights you're consciously just aware of lifting the weights but your body is doing something remarkable countless electrical signals are rapidly sent to your muscle tissue enabling the recruitment of hundreds of thousands of muscle fibers in which a Cascade of events including calcium release ATP breakdown the power stroke and thus Force generation occur energy systems are getting depleted metabolites and fluid have accumulated but then you stop and rest before performing another set time may be an illusion but we're stuck with it so how long should you rest until your next set I'm glad to say we finally have our first ever meta analysis on the impact of different rest time between sets on muscle hypertrophy for those who don't know metaanalyses combine the results of numerous studies on the same topic and are generally considered some of the best evidence this doesn't mean they are always Flawless but they can be highly insightful for us to fully comprehend the scope of the first rest interval metaanalysis in human history such that by the end you'll have a clearer understanding of how long you may choose to rest between sets we need to go back to the 1990s on the 1st of October 1990 a month before Home Alone was released and a time period in which supermarkets look like this this research paper was published lifting weights can temporarily increase anabolic hormone levels and the paper found in a group of men training with shorter rest between sets resulted in greater temporary increases in growth hormone other studies similarly find this and since these hormones are related to muscle growth surely this is proof short rest between sets maximize muscle hypertrophy well multiple researchers thought it could be the training practices of actual bodybuilders probably intensified this since as detailed in this classic 1987 paper the majority of bodybuilders recruited rested 10 to 90 seconds between sets imagine that just 10 seconds between sets the legendary Arnold in his book recommended a minute or less of rest between sets but moving forwards to 2009 to 2011 some studies Mark the beginning of a paradigm shift shift instead of merely observing the hormonal responses two different rest time between sets researchers actually decided to measure muscle growth a 2009 paper found in a group of previously untrained men training this program resting 2.5 minutes between sets tended to produce greater arm and thigh growth than one minute of rest between sets this was despite the fact that temporary increases in testosterone and growth hormone at least in the initial weeks were larger with a 1 minute condition ition a 2010 paper had a slightly unconventional approach they had trained subjects perform this program one group rested 2 minutes between sets but another group over the weeks gradually decreased their rest time between sets down to 30 seconds if short rest were definitely better for growth we'd guess this group would grow more but arm and thigh growth was similar between both the 2011 paper had virtually an identical design and found the same thing so one of the papers found longer rest were better while two find similar gains between decreasing rest time and resting for 2 minutes we'll mention these two papers again a little later but as remarked in this 2014 review no study had demonstrated greater hypy with shorter rests except a study published in the very same year it found in older men resting for 1 minute between sets led to Greater hypo Fe than resting for 4 minutes between sets now before you go and crash your head against the wall in confusion and curse science the devil is in the details both groups perform the same number of reps with the same load this is a problem because doing this with shorter rest between sets means you get closer to failure than if you use longer rests which is potentially a sound explanation as to why they saw better gains the fact is regardless of the rest time between sets we use we want to train two or close to failure and this is what the other papers did you know what what else did this probably the most popular research paper ever on rest time between sets published in 2016 trained subjects performed these exercises with these variables after training three times per week for 8 weeks muscle growth was overall better when resting for 3 minutes between sets compared to 1 minute fast forwarding yet another year forward a 2017 systematic review summarized the landscape well novel findings in trained subjects suggest a possible Advantage for longer rests they even mentioned a study that found after trained individuals performed a leg extension and leg press with reps to failure muscle protein synthesis was overall better when resting for 5 minutes between sets compared to 1 minute this was despite the fact temporary increases in testosterone were larger with a 1 minute condition at this present moment we now have evidence to believe temporary increases in anabolic hormones likely play virtually no role in muscle hypertrophy the scientific literature essentially remains here no longer did it seem justified to say short rests are undeniably superior for muscle growth rather if anything we're seeing better gains with longer rests I guess you could say the supremacy of short rest was shortlived and it didn't take long for long rest to be speculated as better anyhow you would have noticed in all the studies mentioned so far we just compare two different rest times but one what about comparing multiple different rest times of course a single study could do this but we don't have that at least not yet regardless this is where the new meta analysis comes into play the researchers used an approach that enabled the comparison between multiple different rest [Music] times the researchers combin the results of multiple studies including much of the papers we mentioned Plus some others we've not yet fully touched on firstly when simply comparing shorter rest defined a 60 seconds or less between sets to longer rest defined as more than 60 seconds between sets muscle hypertrophy tended to be better with a longer rest for both the arms and thighs when the researchers divided rest time into four categories we can actually see the intermediate rest time tended to see the greatest effect so does that mean intermediate rest times are unquestionably long enough it does not the 95 % credible interval what's widest for this rest time 95% credible intervals tell us there's a 95% probability that the true effect lies within the interval given the observed data also the credible intervals of all rest time show substantial overlap and importantly the results of a network meta analysis conducted by the researcher simply revealed uncertainty about the benefits of resting more than intermediate durations so what can we even infer from this data viewing these results from a different angle we can visually see all rest times led to pretty great hypertrophy this underscores how rest time is definitely not the most important factor for building muscle something we shouldn't forget yet we still see better gains with longer versus shorter rests but as for how long is long enough the analysis emphasizes the possibility somewhere around 90 seconds could be enough but don't make the error thinking this is a strong conclusion further pointing to this the studies behind this meta analysis were quite different they included the 2009 paper and the 2016 one but they also included the 2010 and 2011 papers that compare 2 minutes of rest to another group that reduced their rest time down to 30 seconds in the analysis this latter group was considered to rest 80 Seconds between sets the average time they rested but you could say resting 80 Seconds between sets every session is very different to decreasing rest times across the weeks the 2014 one conducted an older men that was confounded by the group's likely training at different proximities from failure was involved and finally this 2007 study conducted on untrained women comparing 20 to 80 Seconds of rest was also included considering all this although the nature of the analysis enabled us to make comparisons between different rest times it's still true we want more quality studies that compare all the combination you may still want to consider that the most relevant and well-designed paper found in trained people resting 3 minutes produced larger gains than 1 minute so what should you do when we consider more pieces of the puzzle I feel there are some solid suggestions we can [Music] make based on all the evidence currently available on Earth we can generally say that longer rests tend to be better than shorter rests but it's difficult to truly say how long is enough but knowing full well that rest time isn't the most critical Factor you could just rest however long you feel you need and many people do this with great success this may lead you to resting longer with compound exercises but shorter with isolation exercises the research isn't developed enough for us to know if the ideal rest time truly differs between compound and isolation exercises we know the 2009 paper finding 2.5 minutes was better than 1 minute used a solid combination of both compound and isolation exercises whereas the 2016 one finding 3 minutes was better than a minute predominantly used compound exercises but a 2017 paper we've not mentioned yet and also wasn't involved in the newest meta analysis had subjects predominantly trained with arm isolation exercises and fascinatingly found 30 seconds of rest between sets tended to produce greater arm growth than 3 minutes of rest between sets although though the group resting 30 seconds did use a lighter load while the group resting 3 minutes used a heavier load this is actually why this study wasn't included in the new meta analysis but we've seen many times at the house of hypertrophy that provided your training too or close to failure reps between 6 and 35 can produce similar hypertrophy so perhaps it's not truly a confounder either way I would still like to see this study replicated before we confidently assert anything r regardless this is the recommendation that may be most practical for most if longer rest between sets are a problem as you can't work out for that long using something called antagonistic super sets can help you save time while still technically resting longer between sets we've dissected this in an older video at the house of hypertrophy considering the conflicting information across the web things can get pretty confusing about how you may want to train I hope the videos at the house of H pery go some way to clearing up this confusion but our

gives you 20% off a [Music] subscription let's say you wanted to train with shorter rests but still want to get as much growth as humanly possible I think there are two things you may find interesting firstly performing more sets with shorter rest could be highly effective this 2020 paper demonstrates this they found in untrained subjects performing the leg press for three sets per session resting for 3 minutes between sets produced greater quad gains than resting for 1 minute but performing four to five sets per session with one minute of rest managed to produce similar gains to the three sets with 3 minutes of rest secondly remember that pretty much every study we've seen lasted 8 to 12 weeks but maybe you just adapt to short rest over the long term so perhaps extra sets aren't necessarily even needed let me briefly detail three areas that potentially indirectly allude to this in the AFF mentioned 1987 paper bodybuilders commonly rested 10 to 90 seconds between sets while powerlifters rested longer when the researchers got all the subjects to train with a workout just involving 10 seconds of rest between sets the bodybuilders were better able to maintain intensity across the sets than the powerlifters potentially due to various endurance adaptations that made them more fatigue resistant recall the 2010 and 2011 papers found that gradually decreasing rest time across weeks was able to produce similar hypertrophy to resting 2 minutes between sets so perhaps this also points to how gradually decreasing rest time enables your body to accustom itself to short arrests finally this 2021 study caught my eye trained subjects trained their lower body three times per week a normal group trains with sets of eight reps with 2 minutes of rest between sets but a Blood Flow Restriction group used Blood Flow Restriction bands and trained with lighter loads higher reps and just rested 45 seconds between sets after 9 weeks of training quad growth as well as slow and fast switch fiber growth was simp simar between both groups in other words this study technically found that a program involving 45 seconds of rest between sets was able to produce similar gains to another involving 2 minutes of rest between sets in trained subjects although very much speculative and possibly wrong perhaps The Blood Flow Restriction further promoted various endurance likee adaptations that contributed to the body becoming accustomed to Shorter rests if you're someone who's currently using longer rest but wants the experiment with transitioning to shter rest and you're not a fan of Performing extra sets the pins comment details how I recommend you do this if none of this interests you rest assured that taking longer rest between sets is perfectly fine after all we've seen multiple studies demonstrating this and this notion of you adapting to Shorter rest is currently very much hypothetical thank you for making it to the end end of the video here's the summary points

But, just how well does the flat barbell bench\u00a0\npress do at developing the overall chest? Now, any muscle connecting the thorax to the\u00a0\nshoulder and upper arm is considered a chest\u00a0\u00a0 muscle, including the pectoralis major, pectoralis\u00a0\nminor, subclavius, and serratus anterior. Hereafter, we'll only be discussing the pectoralis\u00a0\nmajor, mainly because the research we'll evaluate\u00a0\u00a0 has assessed only this muscle. Besides, the\u00a0\npectoralis major constitutes the large bulk of the\u00a0\u00a0 chest, and most tend to consider the pectoralis\u00a0\nmajor synonymous with the chest musculature. Focusing more on the pectoralis major, like any\u00a0\nmuscle, its attachments to bones enable body\u00a0\u00a0 movement. When a muscle dynamically contracts, the\u00a0\nattachments remaining stationary are the origin,\u00a0\u00a0 while the attachments that move are the insertion. The pectoralis major has a large number\u00a0\nof origins, including the medial clavicle,\u00a0\u00a0 sternum, ribs, the cartilage of those ribs,\u00a0\nand the aponeurosis of the external oblique. However, the insertion for all of the fibers\u00a0\nstemming from the various origins generally\u00a0\u00a0 inserts into the same location,\u00a0\nthe lateral side of the upper arm. Interestingly, there is currently no universally\u00a0\nagreed way to divide the pectoralis major. Some consider the muscle to have\u00a0\nthree heads: the clavicular head\u00a0\u00a0 (consisting of fibers originating from the medial\u00a0\nclavicle), sternal head (consisting of fibers\u00a0\u00a0 originating from the sternum), and a costal head\u00a0\n(consisting of fibers originating from the ribs,\u00a0\u00a0 their costal cartilages, and the\u00a0\naponeurosis of the external oblique). Others consider the pectoralis\u00a0\nmajor to have only two heads,\u00a0\u00a0 a clavicular head (consisting of fibers\u00a0\noriginating from the medial clavicle)\u00a0\u00a0 and a sternocostal head (consisting of\u00a0\nfibers originating from the sternum,\u00a0\u00a0 ribs, costal cartilages, and the\u00a0\naponeurosis of the external oblique). For simplicity, I'll simply refer to the upper,\u00a0\nmiddle, and lower regions of the pectoralis\u00a0\u00a0 major from hereafter. If you like, you can simply\u00a0\nthink of the upper region as the clavicular head,\u00a0\u00a0 the sternal head as the middle region,\u00a0\nand the lower region as the costal head. With all those clarifications out\u00a0\nthe way, how well does the overall\u00a0\u00a0 pectoralis major develop in response\u00a0\nto flat barbell bench press training? Let us examine two studies exploring this. Ogasawara et al. had previously untrained\u00a0\nmen perform the flat barbell bench press\u00a0\u00a0 (with a 2x shoulder-width grip) for 3 sets of\u00a0\n10 repetitions with a 75% one-rep max load,\u00a0\u00a0 using 2-3 minutes of rest between sets, 3\u00a0\ntimes each week for a total of 24 weeks. Flat barbell bench press one-rep\u00a0\nmax was re-measured every 3 weeks\u00a0\u00a0 to enable to readjust of the\u00a0\n75% one-rep max training loads. Across the pectoralis major, the researchers\u00a0\nmeasured cross-sectional area at 25%\u00a0\u00a0 (the upper region), 50% (the middle region),\u00a0\nand 75% (the lower region) of its length. On average, the upper region saw a 36.3% increase\u00a0\nin cross-sectional area, the middle region a 37.3%\u00a0\u00a0 increase in cross-sectional area, and the lower\u00a0\nregion a 40% increase in cross-sectional area. Therefore, this study indicates the flat\u00a0\nbarbell bench press produces notable and\u00a0\u00a0 near-equal growth across the upper, middle,\u00a0\nand lower regions of the pectoralis major. Progressing on the second study, Davies\u00a0\net al. recruited 5 men and 5 women\u00a0\u00a0 with training experience. Approximately\u00a0\n68% of the subjects had a flat barbell\u00a0\u00a0 bench press one-rep max between 35kg and 93kg. The flat barbell bench press was trained\u00a0\nwith 4 sets of 5 repetitions with an 85%\u00a0\u00a0 one-rep max load, using 5 minutes of rest\u00a0\nbetween sets, twice per week for 8 weeks. Grip width was unfortunately not specified. Flat\u00a0\nbarbell bench press one-rep max was re-measured\u00a0\u00a0 every 2 weeks, enabling the readjustment\u00a0\nof the 85% one-rep max training loads. The researchers measured pectoralis\u00a0\nmajor thickness at three regions:\u00a0\u00a0 the spaces between ribs 2 and 3 (the\u00a0\nupper region), the spaces between ribs\u00a0\u00a0 3 and 4 (the middle region), and the spaces\u00a0\nbetween ribs 4 and 5 (the lower region). On average, the upper region saw a 7.44%\u00a0\nincrease in thickness, the middle region\u00a0\u00a0 a 10.06% increase in thickness, and the\u00a0\nlower region a 7.45% increase in thickness. Now, some of you may be wondering why\u00a0\nthese numbers are significantly lower\u00a0\u00a0 than the percentages observed in the Ogasawara\u00a0\nstudy. Many potential reasons explain this. The Ogasawara study used previously untrained men,\u00a0\nlasted 24 weeks, used these training variables,\u00a0\u00a0 and measured cross-sectional area (which\u00a0\nmeasures 2 dimensions of a muscle). Whereas the Davies study used trained men\u00a0\nand women, lasted only 8 weeks, used these\u00a0\u00a0 training variables, and measured thickness\u00a0\n(which measures only 1 muscle dimension). Nevertheless, I still think it's fair\u00a0\nto say the results of the Davies study\u00a0\u00a0 (similar to the Ogasawara study) indicate\u00a0\nthe flat barbell bench press notably\u00a0\u00a0 and near equivalently develops the upper,\u00a0\nmiddle, and lower pectoralis major regions. Combining the results of the two studies,\u00a0\u00a0 the flat barbell bench press seems to be a great\u00a0\nexercise for overall pectoralis major development. These findings raise a\u00a0\npotentially interesting question. It's far from uncommon for individuals\u00a0\nto feel their upper pectoralis major\u00a0\u00a0 is underdeveloped despite flat\u00a0\nbarbell bench press training.\u00a0\u00a0 Given the data we've overviewed,\u00a0\nwhy would this be the case? I think there could be a potential explanation. In the two studies, we detailed\u00a0\nthe relative upper, middle,\u00a0\u00a0 and lower pectoralis major gains experienced as\u00a0\na result of flat barbell bench press training,\u00a0\u00a0 and concluded the movement seems to evoke\u00a0\nnear equal growth of these three regions.\u00a0\u00a0 You can think of relative gains\u00a0\nin terms of percentage changes. However, in absolute gains, it actually\u00a0\nseems the flat barbell bench press\u00a0\u00a0 grows the upper pectoralis major region\u00a0\nless than the middle and lower regions.\u00a0\u00a0 You can think of absolute gains in\u00a0\nterms of measurement unit changes. To properly understand this,\u00a0\u00a0 let us first more thoroughly explore\u00a0\nthe data from the Ogasawara study. On-screen is the before and\u00a0\nafter training pectoralis major\u00a0\u00a0 cross-sectional area measurements for\u00a0\nthe upper, middle, and lower regions. As we know, in terms of percentage\u00a0\nchanges (that is, relative gains) all\u00a0\u00a0 three regions experienced near equal\u00a0\nchanges (in the ranges from 36-40%). However, in terms of centimeters\u00a0\nsquared gains (that is, absolute gains),\u00a0\u00a0 the upper region only experienced\u00a0\na gain of 5.5 centimeters squared,\u00a0\u00a0 whereas both the middle and lower region\u00a0\napproximately saw a 10 centimeters squared gain. This is interesting, why are the percentage\u00a0\ngains similar between all three regions,\u00a0\u00a0 yet the absolute gains show the\u00a0\nmiddle and lower regions grew\u00a0\u00a0 nearly double the amount versus the upper region? The baseline absolute measurements explain this.\u00a0\u00a0 Notice how before the study, the middle and lower\u00a0\nregions are similarly sized (25-27 centimeters\u00a0\u00a0 squared) but the upper region is quite a bit\u00a0\nsmaller (at around 15 centimeters squared). With the same relative gains (again, percentage\u00a0\nchanges), the smaller the number you begin with,\u00a0\u00a0 the lower absolute gains\u00a0\n(again, measurement units,\u00a0\u00a0 which is centimeters squared\u00a0\nin this case) it experiences. Therefore, the reason the upper pectoralis\u00a0\nmajor region sees less absolute growth but\u00a0\u00a0 similar relative growth is simply\u00a0\nbecause it is smaller to begin with\u00a0\u00a0 compared to the middle and\u00a0\nlower pectoralis major regions. The same case can be found with the Davies study. All three regions experienced fairly comparable\u00a0\npercentage increases. Yet, increases in absolute\u00a0\u00a0 gains (which in this case is only centimeters,\u00a0\nas thickness, a one-dimension measure,\u00a0\u00a0 was explored in this study) were lower for the\u00a0\nupper region versus the middle and lower regions. These two studies collectively demonstrate that\u00a0\nmost individuals tend to have an upper pectoralis\u00a0\u00a0 major smaller in size compared to the sizes\u00a0\nof the middle and lower regions to begin with,\u00a0\u00a0 probably creating the appearance the\u00a0\nupper pectoralis major is underdeveloped. Even though the flat barbell bench press provides\u00a0\na near equal relative stimulus to all three\u00a0\u00a0 regions of the pectoralis major, because the\u00a0\nupper region is smaller in size, it experiences\u00a0\u00a0 less absolute growth and still remains smaller\u00a0\nversus the middle-lower pectoralis major regions. If this is a problem for an individual, that is,\u00a0\nthey wish for their upper pectoralis major region\u00a0\u00a0 to be the same or greater size (in absolute\u00a0\nmeasurements) to the middle and lower regions,\u00a0\u00a0 they would want to train additional exercises that\u00a0\u00a0 preferentially stimulate the upper pectoralis\u00a0\nmajor region to help accentuate its growth. Possible exercises that accomplish this include\u00a0\n(but are not limited to) the incline barbell\u00a0\u00a0 bench press, incline dumbbell bench press,\u00a0\nelevated feet push-ups, and low cable chest fly. All these exercises involve horizontal flexion\u00a0\n(the flat barbell bench press also involves this),\u00a0\u00a0 which is generally the function of\u00a0\nall regions of the pectoralis major. More critically though, they also involve a\u00a0\nhigher degree of shoulder flexion versus the\u00a0\u00a0 flat barbell bench press, and the upper region of\u00a0\nthe pectoralis major specifically likely assists\u00a0\u00a0 the anterior deltoid in this shoulder flexion,\u00a0\nthereby likely meaning these four exercises\u00a0\u00a0 preferentially recruit the upper pectoralis major\u00a0\nregion more than the middle and lower regions."

    "transcript": "It's 3am, what are you doing 3am, exactly. The best time to workout.\n \nThe time your muscles don't expect it.\u00a0\u00a0 Muscle confusion baby. The only thing confused here is you. Is training in the evening hours superior\u00a0\nto morning hours for muscle hypertrophy? Some have suggested this\u00a0\nbased on various evidence. Three long-term studies are commonly\u00a0\nreferenced. Kussman et al. found 50% more\u00a0\u00a0 muscle growth with evening (4:30-8pm)\u00a0\nversus morning training (6:30-10am). Another Saliek et al. study found\u00a0\nhigher percentages of muscle growth\u00a0\u00a0 in an evening (5-7pm) versus\u00a0\nmorning training group (7-9am). Finally, Schett found greater fat-free mass\u00a0\ngains in bodybuilders who trained in the evening\u00a0\u00a0 (after 6pm) versus morning hours (before 10am). Besides these three long-term studies,\u00a0\nmechanistic hypotheses are also put forth. The testosterone to cortisol\u00a0\nratio is higher in the evening,\u00a0\u00a0 perhaps suggesting a more favorable\u00a0\nhormonal environment for building muscle. Untrained individuals also tend to\u00a0\nbe stronger in the evening hours.\u00a0\u00a0 This study found peak strength levels at 6pm. Factors like as greater\u00a0\nhydration, glycogen stores,\u00a0\u00a0 and higher core body temperature likely\u00a0\nexplain this greater evening strength. Collectively, all this mentioned\u00a0\ndata may have you believe evening\u00a0\u00a0 training is definitively superior\u00a0\nto morning training for hypertrophy. But, I'm not truly convinced\u00a0\nthis conclusion can be made. Let's dive into why. Addressing the mechanistic data first,\u00a0\nan elevated testosterone to cortisol\u00a0\u00a0 ratio means little to nothing for\u00a0\nhypertrophy in all likelihood. Alterations in various hormones within a\u00a0\u00a0 normal healthy range likely do\u00a0\nnot mean much for hypertrophy. As for greater strength levels in the evening,\u00a0\u00a0 notice how I said this was the\u00a0\ncase for untrained individuals. I made this distinction because you train\u00a0\nyourself consistently in the morning,\u00a0\u00a0 guess what ends up happening? Your body adapts and you end up being comparably\u00a0\nstrong in the morning and evening hours. This is what a 2019 meta-analysis by Grgic et\u00a0\nal., based on 7 studies (verify this) established. At this point, you may be thinking\u00a0\n\"okay, but what about the 3 long-term\u00a0\u00a0 studies finding superior muscle growth\u00a0\nwith evening versus morning training?\" Starting with the Schett study that found greater\u00a0\nfat-free mass gains in bodybuilders with evening\u00a0\u00a0 (after 6pm) versus morning workouts (before 10am),\u00a0\u00a0 this study was never actually\u00a0\npeer-reviewed or published. This study can only be found detailed in a blog. As detailed in this blog,\u00a0\u00a0 Schett presented the findings at a\u00a0\nconference in Las Vagas, Nevada in 2005. This begs the question, why was the study\u00a0\nnever peer-reviewed and officially published? I have no idea, but because it wasn't\u00a0\u00a0 we simply cannot take this study\u00a0\nas legitimate and real evidence. Progressing on, we noted a study by\u00a0\nSaliek et al. finding higher muscle\u00a0\u00a0 growth percentage gains with evening\u00a0\n(5-7pm) versus morning training (7-9am). Specifically, quadriceps volume\u00a0\nincreased by 3.5% for the evening group\u00a0\u00a0 and 2.7% for the morning group. The issue is this 0.8% difference between\u00a0\ngroups was not statistically significant. What this means is we cannot this 0.8% difference\u00a0\nis a result of evening training being superior,\u00a0\u00a0 rather it could just be random chance. For example, the evening group could\u00a0\njust have had subjects with slighly\u00a0\u00a0 better muscle building genetics. After\u00a0\nall, there were only 9 subjects in the\u00a0\u00a0 morning training group and 7\u00a0\nin the evening training group. As for the Kuusman study, which found more 50%\u00a0\nmore muscle growth with evening versus morning\u00a0\u00a0 training, it's worth briefly overviewing\u00a0\nit to get a scope of its limitations. 42 previously untrained men were recruited\u00a0\nand assigned into one of four groups: Group one trained in the\u00a0\nmorning hours (6:30-10am),\u00a0\u00a0 and lifting weights before performing cardio. Group two also trained in the morning hours, but\u00a0\nthey performed cardio before lifting weights. Group three trained in the\u00a0\nevening hours (4:30-8pm),\u00a0\u00a0 lifting weights before performing cardio. Group four also trained in the evening hours,\u00a0\nbut performed cardio before lifting weights. The weight training consisted of a range of\u00a0\nfree weight and machine exercises, while the\u00a0\u00a0 cardio was performed on a cycling machine.\u00a0\nTraining was performed 2-3 times per week. Before the study, at the 12th week (mid-point\u00a0\nof the study), and after the 24 weeks,\u00a0\u00a0 vastus lateralis cross-sectional area\u00a0\nat 50% of the thigh bone was measured.\u00a0\u00a0 This was an indicator of muscle growth. By the 12th week (mid-point of the study),\u00a0\ngrowth was similar between all four groups. However, by the 24th week, increases were greater\u00a0\u00a0 for the two groups training in the evening\u00a0\nthan the two groups training in the morning. Perhaps this study indicates\u00a0\nthat in the longer term\u00a0\u00a0 (beyond 12 weeks) training in the evening\u00a0\nbecomes more favorable for muscle hypertrophy. Yet, it's important to remember this is\u00a0\nthe only official published study to date\u00a0\u00a0 finding a statistically significant\u00a0\neffect of morning versus evening training. One study can never be definitive\u00a0\nevidence. Let me use an example. This Kuusman study also found\u00a0\nthat after the 24 training weeks,\u00a0\u00a0 increases in leg press one-rep max were similar\u00a0\nbetween all four of the training groups. As the groups differed in the order they performed\u00a0\nweight training and cardio in a session, and all\u00a0\u00a0 groups ultimately experienced similar one-rep max\u00a0\ngains, this study would have you believe that it\u00a0\u00a0 does not matter if you perform weight training\u00a0\nor cardio first in a session for strength. However, a meta-analysis by Eddens et al. combined\u00a0\u00a0 9 other studies and found\u00a0\nfor increasing one-rep max,\u00a0\u00a0 lifting weights first and then performing cardio\u00a0\nin a session is better than the reverse of this. The point I'm making is future\u00a0\nresearch could contradict the\u00a0\u00a0 hypertrophy findings of this Kuusman study. Aside from the Saliek and Kuusman studies,\u00a0\n3 other studies have compared morning versus\u00a0\u00a0 evening training for measures of\nuscle growth. These 3 studies lasted 12 weeks\u00a0\nor less and found no statistical\u00a0\u00a0 difference in muscle growth measurements\u00a0\nbetween morning and evening training. When combining these three studies with\u00a0\nthe Saliek and Kuusman into a meta-analysis\u00a0\u00a0 (which increases statistical power), as\u00a0\ndone by Grgic et al. in 2019, there was\u00a0\u00a0 no significant difference in muscle growth\u00a0\nbetween training in the morning and evening. Now, again, the Kuusman et al. study was\u00a0\nthe only study lasting longer than 12 weeks,\u00a0\u00a0 potentially indicating a benefit of\u00a0\nevening training for hypertrophy long-term.\u00a0\u00a0 But we've already established why we should be\u00a0\ncautious of findings from a mere single study. By no means am I definitively\u00a0\nsaying evening training is not\u00a0\u00a0 superior to morning training for muscle growth. What I'm saying is the current data\u00a0\nisn't convincing enough to say this. Future research is needed. For the time being, the majority of\u00a0\nevidence indicates during 12 weeks or less,\u00a0\u00a0 training in the morning is similar\u00a0\nto the evening for hypertrophy. Moreover, as for strength gains, Grgic et\u00a0\nal. found when averaging out strength tests\u00a0\u00a0 performed in the morning and evening\u00a0\nhours, there was no difference in\u00a0\u00a0 gains between subjects that trained in the\u00a0\nmorning or evening hours. In other words,\u00a0\u00a0 training in the morning or evening hours seems\u00a0\nto produce a similar magnitude of strength gains. Ultimately, consistent training and adherence are\u00a0\nparamount for making gains, so I think it's best\u00a0\u00a0 to conclude individuals should train at a time\u00a0\nthat suits their schedule and life circumstances."

    "title": "Are Rows and Lat Pulldowns Are Enough For Biceps Growth?",
    "published_at": "2021-06-28T13:57:12Z",
    "transcript": "Rows and lat-pulldowns are probably two of\u00a0\u00a0 the most popular back and biceps\u00a0\nexercises performed in a program. As far as back development goes, the\u00a0\ninclusion of these two exercises in a program\u00a0\u00a0 can be a good idea, as they may be complementary. The back consists of numerous muscles. Logically,\u00a0\u00a0 as these two exercises require\u00a0\npulling motions at different angles,\u00a0\u00a0 it would make sense that they should target\u00a0\ndifferent muscles of the back more so than others. However, what about biceps development? How do rows compare to\u00a0\nlat-pulldowns for biceps growth? Moreover, could the combination\u00a0\nof rows and lat-pulldowns\u00a0\u00a0 be enough for maximizing biceps hypertrophy? Let us evaluate the evidence. One potential way to assess the effectiveness\u00a0\nof rows and lat pulldowns for biceps growth\u00a0\u00a0 is to compare them to isolation\u00a0\nbiceps exercises, like biceps curls. Isolation biceps exercises, like biceps curls,\u00a0\nshould logically be near ideal for biceps growth,\u00a0\u00a0 as they confine tension to the biceps\u00a0\nand ensure it is the limiting factor. If lat pulldowns and rows can produce similar\u00a0\noverall biceps hypertrophy to isolation biceps\u00a0\u00a0 exercises, we have some evidence to suggest that\u00a0\nthey could be sufficient for biceps development. Assessing the lat pulldown first, Gentil et\u00a0\nal. compared them to the barbell biceps curl. 29 untrained men were assigned\u00a0\nto train either the lat pulldown\u00a0\u00a0 or barbell biceps curl 2 times\u00a0\nper week for a total of 10 weeks. Each session, subjects trained their respective\u00a0\nexercise for 3 sets of 8-12 repetitions to failure\u00a0\u00a0 (the point at which no more\u00a0\nrepetitions can be performed). Thickness of the right elbow flexors\u00a0\n(including the biceps and brachialis muscles)\u00a0\u00a0 was measured 10 centimeters\u00a0\nfrom the cubital fossa. Increases in elbow flexor thickness were similar\u00a0\nbetween the lat pulldown and barbell curl groups. Therefore, this study suggests that lat pulldowns\u00a0\nmay be similarly effective to barbell bicep curls\u00a0\u00a0 for biceps development. However, elbow flexor growth was only\u00a0\nmeasured at one region (10 centimeters\u00a0\u00a0 from the cubital fossa). As we'll establish\u00a0\nsoon, this is may be an important limitation. As for rows, Mannarino et al. compared\u00a0\ndumbbell rows to dumbbell curls. 10 untrained men had one arm assigned to\u00a0\ntrain dumbbell rows, while their other\u00a0\u00a0 arm trained dumbbell curls. Training was\u00a0\ncarried out two times per week for 8 weeks. They trained each arm with 4-6 sets\u00a0\nof 8-12 repetitions to failure. Thickness of the elbow flexors (including\u00a0\nthe biceps and brachialis muscles)\u00a0\u00a0 was measured at 25%, 50%,\u00a0\nand 75% of the biceps length.\u00a0\u00a0 The following results average out these\u00a0\nthree regions to obtain a single value. Increases in elbow flexor\u00a0\nthickness were significantly\u00a0\u00a0 greater for the arm trained with dumbbell curls. Therefore, this study indicates rows are inferior\u00a0\nfor biceps growth compared to bicep curls. I should mention that in this study,\u00a0\nsubjects performed both the curl\u00a0\u00a0 and row with a supinated grip. But, for the purposes of this study\u00a0\n(assessing biceps growth), supination\u00a0\u00a0 would unlikely put rows at a disadvantage. In\u00a0\nfact, supination would likely help biceps growth,\u00a0\u00a0 given supination is one of the biceps functions. Despite this, rows still\u00a0\nwere inferior to bicep curls. Now, I want to mention a potential\u00a0\nproblem some may have noticed. Looking carefully back at the data of the studies,\u00a0\nthe Gentil et al. study found that lat pulldowns\u00a0\u00a0 and barbell bicep curls resulted in a roughly\u00a0\n6% increase in elbow flexor thickness,\u00a0\u00a0 while the Mannarino et al. study found that\u00a0\nrows similarly increased elbow flexor thickness\u00a0\u00a0 by roughly 5%. Conversely, the dumbbell curls\u00a0\nincreased elbow flexor thickness by 11.06%. Based on these numbers, you could\u00a0\nargue that dumbbell bicep curls seem\u00a0\u00a0 to be superior for biceps growth, while\u00a0\nlat pulldowns, rows, and barbell curls\u00a0\u00a0 (although producing similar biceps\u00a0\ngrowth between them) are inferior. However, this argument has its problems. In all likelihood, dumbbell\u00a0\ncurls and barbell curls\u00a0\u00a0 are probably similarly\u00a0\neffective for biceps growth. Different exercise modalities do not\u00a0\nseem to have an impact on muscle growth. In a previous video,\u00a0\u00a0 we demonstrated that machines seem to produce\u00a0\nsimilar muscle growth to free weights. Moreover, we've also shown\u00a0\nhow bodyweight exercises,\u00a0\u00a0 like the push-up, can produce similar hypertrophy\u00a0\nto free weights, like the bench press. The reason for this is probably because all\u00a0\nmodalities can elicit sufficiently high levels\u00a0\u00a0 of mechanical tension, as I detailed\u00a0\nin the free weight vs machine video. These lines of evidence and\u00a0\nreasoning would go against\u00a0\u00a0 the idea that there's something\u00a0\nspecial about dumbbell curls. As an extra side note, these lines of\u00a0\nevidence also explain why I think that\u00a0\u00a0 despite the Mannarino et al. finding\u00a0\ndumbbell rows to be inferior to curls,\u00a0\u00a0 the results are also probably\u00a0\nrelevant to barbell rowing variations. Anyway, logically, dumbbell and barbell curls\u00a0\ninvolve more or less identical motions at the\u00a0\u00a0 elbow. Moreover, in the studies, subjects\u00a0\nperformed 8-12 repetitions to failure.\u00a0\u00a0 Combining these ideas, both\u00a0\nthe dumbbell and barbell curls\u00a0\u00a0 would likely have induced\u00a0\nsimilar tension on the biceps. So, why did the dumbbell curl still\u00a0\nproduce the greatest percentage gains? All in all, it's most likely\u00a0\nnot sensible to combine\u00a0\u00a0 and analyze the two studies by\u00a0\nGentil and Mannarino together. Firstly, the Mannario et al. study used slightly\u00a0\nhigher volumes. Subjects performed 4-6 sets per\u00a0\u00a0 session for their exercises compared\u00a0\nto 3 sets in the Gentil et al. study. More sets seem to cause more muscle\u00a0\ngrowth (likely up to a certain point,\u00a0\u00a0 probably when recovery abilities are diminished).\u00a0\nTherefore, more sets in the Mannario et al. study\u00a0\u00a0 could partly explain the higher percentage\u00a0\ngains observed with the dumbbell curls. Secondly, the two studies did not measure the\u00a0\nbiceps identically. The Gentil et al. study only\u00a0\u00a0 took measurements at one region (10 centimeters\u00a0\nfrom the cubital fossa), whereas the Mannario\u00a0\u00a0 et al. took measurements (and then averaged)\u00a0\nfrom 25%, 50%, and 75% of the muscles length. Lastly, and probably quite importantly, the\u00a0\nstudies were comprised of different subjects.\u00a0\u00a0 Individual differences in\u00a0\nresponses to training are notable. For instance, a study by Hubal\u00a0\net al. had 243 men and 342 women\u00a0\u00a0 train their biceps with preacher and\u00a0\nconcentration curls for 12 weeks. The graph depicts how varied the subject's\u00a0\nincreases in biceps cross-sectional area was. Most resistance training studies, like the\u00a0\nGentil and Mannario studies, have a fairly\u00a0\u00a0 small sample size (10-30 subjects). \n \nThe probability of these two studies\u00a0\u00a0 recruiting subjects with a comparable\u00a0\nability to gain muscle is unlikely. As a result, the simple fact these two\u00a0\nstudies used different subjects may further\u00a0\u00a0 partly explain why the dumbbell curls produced\u00a0\ngreater growth in the Mannario et al. study. So, returning to the core of the\u00a0\nvideo, when assessing the two studies,\u00a0\u00a0 although it seems that rows are far less\u00a0\neffective than biceps curls for biceps growth,\u00a0\u00a0 lat pulldowns may be similarly\u00a0\neffective to bicep curls. From this, you may be tempted to think that\u00a0\nrows and lat pulldowns could be sufficient\u00a0\u00a0 for biceps development, given lat pulldowns\u00a0\nmay be itself enough for growing the biceps. However, as alluded to earlier,\u00a0\nthe study by Gentil et al.\u00a0\u00a0 finding lat pulldowns produced similar biceps\u00a0\ngrowth to bicep curls is limited as it only\u00a0\u00a0 measured elbow flexor growth at one region\u00a0\n(10 centimeters from the cubital fossa). Conversely, the study by Mannario et al.\u00a0\u00a0 measured (and then averaged)\u00a0\nthree regions across the biceps\u00a0\u00a0 (25%, 50%, and 75% of the muscle's length), making\u00a0\nit more insightful for overall biceps development. The reason why it is useful to measure\u00a0\ngrowth at many regions of a muscle\u00a0\u00a0 is that muscles do not appear to grow uniformly. Although Gentil et al. found similar\u00a0\ngrowth between the lat pulldown\u00a0\u00a0 and barbell biceps curl at one region\u00a0\nof the muscle, it's quite possible at\u00a0\u00a0 other regions, growth responses would\u00a0\nbe different between the two exercises. And this brings us on to probably the\u00a0\nmost important point of the video. The research would appear to suggest that to\u00a0\nmaximize growth across regions of a muscle,\u00a0\u00a0 a fair degree of exercise variation is important. This would indicate that rows and lat pulldowns\u00a0\nare not sufficient for optimal biceps development. A study by Costa et al. demonstrates this nicely. They had 22 detrained men train\u00a0\n3 times per week for 9 weeks. One group of subjects trained\u00a0\ntheir biceps with lat pulldowns\u00a0\u00a0 and barbell bicep curls each session. Another group of subjects varied\u00a0\ntheir exercises each week. On day 1 of each week, their biceps\u00a0\nwere also trained with lat pulldowns\u00a0\u00a0 and barbell bicep curls. But on day 2 of each week, they trained with lat\u00a0\npulldowns behind the neck and preacher curls,\u00a0\u00a0 and on day 3 of each week, lat pulldowns with\u00a0\na narrow grip and incline dumbbell curls. As a note, both groups trained each\u00a0\nexercise with 3 sets of 8-12 repetitions. Before and after the study,\u00a0\nthickness of the elbow flexors\u00a0\u00a0 was measured at 50%, 60%, and 70% of\u00a0\nthe upper arm length for both groups. Overall, increases in thickness were\u00a0\ngreater for the group that varied their\u00a0\u00a0 exercises, particularly at 50%\u00a0\nand 60% of the upper arm length. Therefore, front lat pulldowns\u00a0\nand barbell biceps curl\u00a0\u00a0 were inferior to a variety of lat\u00a0\npulldowns and curl variations. It's not clear whether it was the variation\u00a0\nof lat pulldowns, variation of curls,\u00a0\u00a0 or even the combination of both that produced\u00a0\nthe superior results for the varied group,\u00a0\u00a0 but this study nonetheless demonstrates\u00a0\nthat a fair amount of exercise variety\u00a0\u00a0 is beneficial for regional muscle\u00a0\ngrowth, likely indirectly indicating\u00a0\u00a0 rows and lat pulldowns are not sufficient\u00a0\nfor overall biceps development."

    "transcript": "welcome to the house of hypertrophy are you missing out on maximum muscle growth if three specific exercises are not in your training program what three exercises the squat bench press and deadlift often called The Big Three they are some of the most popular exercises ever these movements play an integral part in numerous training programs such as the famous starting strength program some state to these exercises are irreplaceable for building muscle but is this true do the squat bench press and deadlift possess unique traits that make them Superior for evoking muscle hypertrophy fortunately a range of scientific studies provide answers let us dive in starting with an excellent brand new study from Spain [Music] 36 trained men were assigned into either a free weight or machine group the freeway group trained the barbell back Squad bench press prone row and seated overhead press the machine group performs corresponding machine exercises a hex squat chest press seated row and machine shoulder press the deadlift wasn't involved in this study we'll Circle back to this later each exercise was performed for three sets a session three times a week with these loads across eight weeks each lifting repetition was performed with a maximal intended speed and the researchers tracked the velocity of the Reps subjects performed their reps each set up until their velocity had slowed down by 20 based on prior research this likely resulted in subjects performing 50 of the maximum repetitions per set it was ultimately found growth of the quadriceps measured at the 30 and 60 region was similar between both the free weight and machine groups growth of the pectoralis major and rectus abdominus was also similar between both groups thus this study indicates free weights and that includes barbell squats and bench presses were not Superior to machine alternative for growing the muscles measured this is just one study but we have additional studies comparing squats and bench press's two Alternatives what are their findings let us speed through them and find out [Music] this paper from Belgium had previously untrained men perform either a freeway only machine only or combined program the freeway group trained the barbell back squat dumbbell bench press and deadlift the researchers looked at how the training impacted circumference gains for the chest thigh and upper arm technically none of these measurements are really relevant to the deadlift in any case circumference increases for all regions were similar between all three groups now circumference isn't a precise measure of muscle growth but we do have this other study out of Canada 36 trained individuals trained either a free weight or machine only program we can see the freeway group trained the barbell back squat bench press and stiff leg a deadlift the machine grouped involved some Smith machine Alternatives like a Smith machine squads the researchers looked at how training impacted quadriceps and biceps growth so again none of these measurements are really relevant to the deadlift or even bench press nonetheless quadriceps and biceps gains were ultimately Sim similar between both groups overall these two studies further support the idea free weights aren't Superior to machine alternatives for growth of the measured muscles even bodyweight movements like push-ups can be highly effective for muscle hypertrophy this paper from Japan demonstrates this 18 trained men either performed High Reps to failure on the barbell bench press or a bodyweight push-up variation some may be questioning the use of High Reps in this study but we've previously seen at the house of hypertrophy that reps approximately between 6 and 35 can be similarly effective for building muscle provided the reps are performed two or very close to failure which was accomplished in this paper it was found chest and triceps growth was comparable between both exercises another interesting study from the USA recruited 23 men with some training experience a bench press group performed the exercise for three sets in the six to eight rep range and aimed to increase the load they trained within this rep range across the weeks a push-up group performed three sets and progressed through performing harder push-up variations both groups experienced average chest growth and the percentages actually favor the push-up group it's difficult to say if this is a real effect none of the gains in this study were statistically significant likely because the study only lasted four weeks it's his possible the push-up group just had subjects with slightly average better muscle building genetics nonetheless I would say this study demonstrates the barbell bench evidently isn't Superior so it seems free weights including barbell squats and bench presses are not better muscle Builders compared to Alternatives in other words many roads may lead you to the same destination

nothing short of exceptional the apps reviews Echo this [Music] none of the studies truly compared to muscle building effects of the deadlift to other exercises but based on the research behind what stimulates muscle hypertrophy I would argue there's no reason to believe the deadlift is essential as thoroughly dissected previously at the house of hypertrophy contrary to unfortunate widespread belief that evidence demonstrates muscle damage and the buildup of metabolites are clearly not strong or primary drivers of muscle growth rather mechanical tension seems to be the primary hypertrophy stimulus what is this within the Deep depths of your muscle tissue a contractile Machinery that generate force that is tension throughout the muscle tissue our mechanosensors that can detect the tension and convert the tension into a signal that produces muscle hypertrophy tension is tension it can be achieved with barbells dumbbells machines and even body weights provided you're performing a body movement that will recruit the desired muscle and you perform repetitions too or very close to failure high tension overall will be achieved lighter weights can also achieve high tension simply by ensuring you're performing reps with a lighter weight two or very close to failure after this video feel free to check out our in-depth video where we describe mechanical tension in Greater detail [Music] in summary the scientific literature indicates the barbell squat bench press and conventional deadlift aren't essential for maximizing hypertrophy alternative exercises can produce comparable muscle growth it's imperative to recognize I'm not saying you shouldn't train barbell squats bench presses or conventional deadlifts if you want to train any of these that's absolutely fine the research reviewed in this video demonstrates these movements are highly effective for building muscle it's just that the key point is you can experience similar gains from alternative exercises now I will say with the conventional deadlift they're frequently reported as being very fatiguing and requiring longer recovery periods as we've seen previously at the house of hypertrophy the overall current evidence actually fails to support the notion that deadlift is more fatiguing versus other exercises yet as I mentioned in that video this is only based on two studies so more data is needed but if the deadlift is truly more taxing then I think you could make the case there's better options if your goal is to build muscle perhaps a trap bar deadlift variation or perhaps you want to avoid loading the spinal altogether and focus on performing movements like Legos and hip thrusts nonetheless constructing a program where you train with some exercise variation can of course be done it's entirely plausible for you to construct a program where you train both barbell squats and machine squat variations remember to feel free to check out the alpha progression app and or check out our

    "title": "Incline vs Preacher Curls for Biceps Growth (NEW Research)",
    "published_at": "2023-07-17T10:59:58Z",
    "transcript": "welcome to the house of hypertrophy how can we effectively train the biceps I've previously hypothesized incline codes may be one of the best biceps exercises why incline codes place the shoulder into extension and due to the biceps attachments this stretches the biceps I viewed this as a significant Point since emerging research suggests exercises attaining a stretch of a muscle tend to build muscle faster however when I made this hypothesis there had not been a single study comparing incline curls to other biceps exercises this has now changed a recent study has put incline curls up against preacher curls for building the biceps in this video we're going to be dissecting this study and along the way we'll also detail other biceps training literature to provide some general recommendations let's Dive In the researchers recruited 31 women with some training experience and assigned them to either an incline or preacher co-group the incline group performed the exercise from zero degrees to no higher than 110 degrees the preacher group performed their exercise from around 0 degrees to around 90 degrees of elbow flexion some of you may be thinking wait a second range of motion wasn't equated between both groups isn't this a red flag I believe it would have been ideal for the researchers to equate range of motion but I don't think this was a major limitation of the study why as we will see a little later on in this video emerging research potentially suggests larger ranges of motions may not be necessary for optimizing muscle hypertrophy nevertheless both groups train their exercise for 4 sets of 6 to 18 repetitions to failure three times a week before and after the study elbow flexor thickness was measured at 50 60 and 70 percent of approximately the upper arm length the reason I say elbow flexor is because the measurements at these regions would have included both the biceps and brachiolis it was ultimately found growth across the three regions tended to be better for the preacher Co group so does this study prove incline curls are sub-optimal it unquestionably puts a wrench into my original hypothesis incline codes were one of the better biceps Builders and this study raises the possibility I was wrong but this new study does have caveats to it the differences between the preacher and incline groups didn't actually reach statistical significance in any region now statistical significance is often misinterpreted and a lack of statistical significance doesn't prove there's no real difference between groups but this still raises a potential alternative explanation for the results 31 trained women were involved in the study and maybe it's possible through chance the subjects in the preacher Co group had better average muscle building genetics thereby explaining why this group saw better average growth another consideration is I noted subjects perform their reps to failure but a clear definition of failure wasn't provided so it's not truly clear for all subjects literally took their reps to True failure or if they just stopped their reps when they felt like it also no researchers actually supervised the training sessions finally recall I noted muscle thickness measurements included both the biceps and brachialis due to this we strictly don't know if the greater average growth for the pre-traco group comes from the biceps brachialis or both by no means does this mean this study is worthless and that limited study should be binned science is a process as time goes by and we accumulate more research as well as higher quality research we get closer to what the truth might genuinely be as I've hopefully demonstrated in previous videos and as I aim to continuously depict in future videos there are already areas of the hypertrophy and strengths training research that are strong enough to where we can draw training recommendations pretty confidently and some of of these areas even provide insight into individual differences I do have good news another research group seems to be working on a study comparing dumbbell preacher to Incline curves until this study is released I think it might be most sensible to reserve confidence statements on whether preacher codes are superior to Incline codes my main purpose with this video was to update you all and ensure you're mindful of this new data and the possibility I was wrong nevertheless let us describe some other noteworthy studies surrounding biceps training and then we'll provide some general training recommendations [Music] this study by Pinto compared partial range of motion preacher codes in the middle position to full range motion preacher curse and found elbow flexor growth at around the 60 region tended to be greater for the full range of motion group two Studies by Sato and Pedrosa compared partial range of motion preacher codes in the initial position to the final position the Sato study found that initial position tended to produce greater growth across 50 60 and 70 elbowflex regions while the Pedrosa study found similar thickness gains at a 50 region between both but greater thickness gains for the initial position at the 70 region combining these three studies it seems the initial part of a preacher curl is particularly important for biceps growth in fact if preacher curls are superior to Incline cove's four biceps hypertrophy could this be related what I mean is although preacher curls are performed with the shoulders flicks which somewhat shortens the biceps it is most challenging at the initial position in the exercise where the biceps are at a more stretched length conversely although income curls are performed with the shoulders extended which better stretches the biceps they are most challenging when the biceps are progressively getting shortened therefore if preacher coasts truly do build the biceps better perhaps this means that placing a muscle into a position of stretch isn't all that's important rather ensuring the exercise is challenging at their length and position might be a more critical Factor once again remember this is a hypothesis future research will provide insight into whether preacher coach genuinely build the biceps better than incline girls moreover a study by Nunes might actually oppose this hypothesis these researchers compared barbell to Cable preacher course barbell preacher curls are more challenging when the biceps are at a longer length while cable preacher curves are more challenging when the biceps are at a shorter length it was found to Elbow flexor growth was similar between both this study connected to why I thought incline codes could still be great for the biceps since if it did not matter whether the biceps are maximally challenged that are longer or shorter length the stretch attained with incline curls may be powerful enough but a caveat with this newness study is elbow flexor growth was just measured at one region whereas we know this new study and other research looked at growth across multiple Alpha flexor regions nevertheless let's transition to General biceps training recommendations [Music] experimental you could certainly try out preacher curls if you've not tried them already as time goes by I'm sure we'll just accumulate further research comparing other biceps movements but for now if you want to keep things simple just select whatever biceps curling exercise you like be it a standard curl face away cable curl or even incline curl considering the bigger picture the biceps are highly involved in elbow flexion and supination we know the brachialis and brachioradialis are also highly involved in helper flexion but this study using fine wire electrodes demonstrates how the biceps display the highest activity when elbow flexion is performed with supination whereas when elbow flexion is performed with pronation the brachialis and brachioradialis display higher activity other fine wire electrode analyzes support these findings accordingly any exercise involving elbow flexion with supination will do well to provide a biceps growth stimulus although we know this new present study finds preacher curls evoked more growth across three regions versus incline curls it's not like the incline group lost bicep size they still grew with regards to face away cable curves one could speculate this is the single best biceps exercise not only does this movement place the shoulder into extension like incline curls thereby effectively stretching the biceps bitter also provides more consistent tension throughout the range of motion thereby loading the biceps at a more lengthened position as is done with preacher course I'm hoping future research explores this it's imperative to mention you can certainly train the biceps with multiple exercises in an overall program a study by Costa demonstrates this one group purely trained their biceps directly with barbell curls across Monday Wednesday and Friday while another group performed the barbell curls on Monday preacher curls on Wednesday and incline curls on Friday ultimately growth across three regions of the elbow flexors tended to be better for the group varying their exercises now let pull then variations were also trained by both groups but I'm unsure if this really confounded the results if you're curious about further ideas for creating an effective muscle building program our high quality partner Alpha progression can help it contains an extremely flexible custom workout generator that can tailor a program to your needs you determine how often and how long you want to train for and whether you want to focus on certain muscles you can also specify what equipment is available to you there are well over a quadrillion input combinations on which custom workouts are generated a great thing is the training philosophy in the app is based on meta-analyzes

circumference of body regions the link in the comments and description gives you a free two-week trial of all the app's features and if you like the app and go beyond the link gives you 20 off a subscription rest assured the app is of the highest standard we don't just partner with anyone at the house of hypertrophy let us enter the land of speculation for a moment as alluded to earlier there is research suggesting longer ranges of motions may not be necessary for optimizing hypertrophy this study involved putting partial leg extensions at the initial position up against full range of motion leg extensions and found the partials at the initial position produced overall better rectus femoris and vastus lateralis hypertrophy another study involves putting partial reps at the Shrek's position on a calf exercise up against using a full range of motion and found the partial and the stretched position tended to produce greater medial and lateral gastrocnemius hypertrophy yet another study used a multi-hit machine and indicates a partial range of motion at the stretched position produces greater overall growth compared to using a full range of motion now this specific study has only been presented in an abstract at a conference but it will presumably be published soon in any case could this information extend to other exercises such as coals recall if preacher curves are superior to incline curls a potential reason for this is that preacher codes more effectively challenge the biceps at a longer length but performing partial incline curves as the initial Position will effectively and ultimately challenge the biceps at a longer length the same logic holds for standard curls full range of motion standard curves are most challenging when the elbows are flexed to 90 degrees but performing partial standard Curves in the initial position more effectively challenges the biceps at that longer length if you're feeling experimental You may wish to try out implementing partials at longer lengths you could even experiment with integrated partials with each rep ultimate dating between a full range of motion repetition and a partial long length repetition a final option is with exercises that are most challenging at the middle to shorten muscle position like incline and standard curls you could perform reps two or very close to failure with a full range of motion and then immediately transition to performing partial reps at that longer length here are the summary bullet points some of you may be wondering what about preferentially targeting either the long or short heads of the biceps As We examined in our Ultimate Guide to biceps hypertrophy there currently isn't any strong evidence to suggest we can meaningfully bias the growth of either of the biceps heads so it's just not clear feel free to consider checking out our guide to side delts hypertrophy"

    "title": "How to Build Your Rear Delts (28 Studies)",
    "published_at": "2023-07-31T10:59:59Z",
    "transcript": "welcome to the house of hypertrophy the deltoids consisting of the front side and rear heads are a key muscle group for unlocking an all-round impressive physique the rear delts are particularly in unsung gem as this head only boosts the 3D look of the muscle especially when viewed from the side but how can we most effectively train this muscle how good are exercises like pull-ups and rows and what exercises effectively isolate this muscle amidst all the Sea of information on the internet it can be easy to drown in confusion but today we're going to be leveraging the current scientific literature as best as we can to infer how we can maximize radial hypertrophy let us Plunge in foreign we'll be analyzing a bunch of compound exercises you may not necessarily train a lot of these variations about to be mentioned and that is perfectly fine after all many people's goal is to predominantly Target muscles other than the rear delts with compound exercises we'll Circle back to this point soon horizontal pulls such as bent over rows cable rows inverted rows and dumbbell rows are one broad category of compound exercises that are frequently included in many people's training program there are different ways you can perform these horizontal pulls and not all of them equally challenge the rear delts all horizontal pools involve elbow flexion so we'll train the elbow flexors but if you're performing horizontal pulls with a grip closer to being narrower as done with close grip bent over rows seated rows inverted rows and most dumbbell row variations your predominantly performing shoulder extension how effective is this for the rear delts alongside the rear delts the teres minor Terry's major and Lads are the main muscles that can pull on the upper arm bone to produce shoulder extension but which of these muscles experiences the best stimulus as detailed in this 2019 review study out of Australia the teres major appears to have the largest leverage throughout shoulder extension note each line is a different study so here we can see two studies indicate that teres major have great leverage throughout shoulder extension before looking at the leverage for the other muscles what on Earth is leverage leverage refers to the muscle's moment arm here's the biceps and its line of force we know it acts on the elbow joints between the elbow joint and the line of Force if we draw a perpendicular line the distance of this line is the biceps moment arm fundamentally a longer moment our means a muscle has greater leverage and ability to generate movement think of a heavy door consider the moment arm as the distance between where you push the door and its hinges if you push the door close to its hinges it's challenging to open the door because the moment arm is small but if you push the door further from its hinges it's much easier to open the door because the moment arm is longer so muscles that have a longer moment arm in any exercise are the ones that for the most part have the greatest potential to generate movement and various pieces of scientific research suggest leverage may be one of the more critical factors in how the central nervous system decides what muscles to activate the most during a movement returning to our analysis the latissimus dorsi appears to have strong leverage for shoulder extension based on one study but another study actually finds much lower leverage upon analyzing this study closer they actually separated the lats into an upper middle and lower region and they established the upper region tended to have the best leverage for shoulder extension compared to the two other regions plotting this upper left region leverage into our graph it's still apparent the two studies got quite Divergent findings it's not clear why this is but this is a good time to mention that this research looking at leverage isn't Flawless measuring the moment on the length of muscles isn't simple Precision is required and researchers use varying methods it's also worth mentioning that with the lens they wrap around the posterior chest wall and neither of the two studies assessing the let's leverage accounted for this which means the estimated leverages are not going to be pinpoint accurate but besides these points it's also critical to understand and people are not anatomically identical and muscle's leverage can vary between people even with these limitations in mind this leveraged literature still provides a quantifiable insight into the potential contribution of muscles to a movement going back to our analysis three studies indicate the rear delts possess fairly good leverage as for the teres minor numerous studies indicates this tends to have lower leverage throughout shoulder extension so what does all this information mean for horizontal pools remember horizontal pools also tend to involve scapular retraction so the traps and rhomboids will also get involved moreover the lats could contribute to scapular attraction to some degree since it's been identified the majority of people may have some link between their lats and scapular even so I would sum up this data as suggesting that although the Terry's major and possibly less may see the bulk of the stimulus the rear delts will likely still be respectively targeted so this movement should do well to contribute to rear cell development however if you perform your horizontal pools with an even wider grip searches done during wide grip barbell rows seated Rose inverted rows and dumbbell rows perform like this they are likely going to be even more effective for their adults why as you transition from a narrower to wider grip with horizontal pulls you progress to performing shoulder horizontal extension as found in this classic analysis the rear delts tend to be the muscle with the greatest leverage for shoulder horizontal extension whether infraspinatus and supraspinatus being close behind the teres major and let's have a whole lot lower Leverage further pointing towards this we have fine wire Electro data establishing the rear delts experience slightly higher activity during shoulder horizontal extension motions compared to shoulder extension and Rowing motions and other fine wire electrode analyzes also find relatively High recordings from the rear delts during shoulder horizontal extension Now find wire electromyography involves inserting a fine wire needle into a muscle to record its electrical activity and this method overcomes a few limitations associated with surface electromyography which is where surface electrodes on the skin above a muscle are used to record electrical activity it is worth understanding this point in a little more detail since we will be referencing some surface electromyographic studies a little later fine wire electrodes minimize the potential of surrounding muscles to confound and interfere with our recordings and during movement the fine wire electrodes are able to follow the muscle tissue as it moves with surface electromyography this does doesn't really happen now this isn't to say find a way electrode research is perfect there are still shortcomings in one of the aforementioned studies they didn't seem to equate relative loading between the exercises nonetheless the totality of this leverage research and this fine wire Electro data leads me to believe that wider grip horizontal pools rank above closer grip horizontal pools for adults let us now transition our discussion to Vertical pools before we begin to provide advice about how you may train long term for optimizing rear Del hypertrophy vertical pools searches pull-ups and lap pull-downs are another common category of compound exercises that people heavily use in their training program there are different ways you can perform vertical pulls and not all of them are likely equally effective for targeting the rear delts like horizontal pulls vertical pulls involve elbow flexion so we'll train the elbow flexors but if you're performing vertical pulls with a grip closer to being narrower such as close grip pull-ups and lap pull-downs you're predominantly performing shoulder extension we've already established the leverage various muscles have for shoulder extension when dissecting close grip horizontal pulls so you're actually performing a similar motion at the shoulder during closer grip vertical pulls and closer grip horizontal pulls the main difference being vertical pulls enable a greater overall range of motion approximately between 180 to 0 degrees whereas the horizontal pools tend to involve shoulder extension between 75 to minus degrees that is you can achieve shoulder hyperextension with horizontal pulls we'll Circle back to this point soon now the leverage data does not go beyond 120 degrees and we know vertical pulls involve shoulder angles Beyond this range but this is not a major problem because both closer grip vertical and horizontal pull variations tend to be the hardest and thus maximally challenge the muscles below 120 degrees and we know the rear delts have solid leverage here motion at the scapular will occur during vertical pulls typically scapular depression and or downward rotation so other muscles will be recruited interestingly recall we previously noted there's data implying the majority of individuals have some link between the let's and the scapular so the LED involvement from vertical pulls May further be enhanced through assisting with depression and downward rotation nonetheless as with closer grip horizontal pulls I would say closer grip vertical pulls respectively Target the rear delts what if you perform vertical pulls with a wider grip as you progress from a narrower to wider grip such as wider grip pull-ups and pull Downs you predominantly transition to performing shoulder adduction the teres major let's and subscapularis are the main muscles that have the capacity to pull on the upper arm bone to execute shoulder abduction returning to the 2019 review study out of Australia they also detailed what the current scientific research says about the leverage these various muscles have throughout shoulder abduction two studies indicate that let's possess large leverage and the same two studies also indicate the Terry's major possess large leverage a few studies indicate the subscapularis has relatively smaller leverage most studies suggest the rear delts have minimal to no leverage for shoulder adduction throughout the range of motion but this doesn't mean the rear delts aren't involved whatsoever with wider grip vertical pulls in reality most people don't perform super wide grip vertical pulls that is purely shoulder abduction rather it tends to be a somewhat wide grip that uses a mixture of shoulder adduction and shoulder extension in technical terms you might consider this adduction in the scapular plane on-screen shows the results of a few studies that have analyzed The Leverage of the rear Del overall for scapular plane adduction although some of them indicate very small leverage others do find fairly decent leverage but overall I would say wider grip vertical pools are going to rank below closer grip vertical pools for targeting the red delts indeed a 2002 surface electromyography analysis out of the USA supports this they found closer grip lap pull Downs evoked higher reardale activity compared to wider grip lap pull-downs as alluded to earlier surface electromyography semg has multiple limitations in fact if you followed the house of hypertrophy for a while you'll know I'm highly critical of it there are examples where surface electromyography research fails to predict actual muscle hypertrophy results yet this doesn't necessarily mean all semg research is erroneous there are some cases where it does predict muscle hypertrophy for example previous semg Research indicates when training the calves placing the feet outwards enhanced medial gastrocne activity while placing the feet inwards enhanced lateral gastrocodemius activity indeed research measuring actual muscle hypertrophy finds calf presses with the feet outwards preferentially grew the medial gastrocnemius while performing them with a few inwards preferentially grew the lateral gastrocnemius thus the question is are the findings of the present surface electromyography analysis correct given the leverage research we've overviewed I'm inclined to believe it is probably closer to being correct so here's the overall rankings of the compound exercises we've analyzed for rear delt development some of you may be questioning why I placed closer grip horizontal pulls above closer grip vertical pulls despite the fact that both involve shoulder extension recall I mentioned you can achieve shoulder hyperextension with horizontal pulls something not typically attained with narrow grip vertical pulls this shoulder hyperextension likely further biases the rear delts hence why I opted to rank closer grip horizontal pulls above closer grip vertical pulls some of you might push back against this and suggest since close to grip vertical pulls involve a greater overall range of motion they should be ranked above closer grip horizontal pulls I certainly understand where this point of view is coming from but as we'll see a little later on a greater range of motion simply doesn't seem to be associated with more muscle hypertrophy before providing further information and then advice about how you may train long term for optimizing retail hypertrophy some of you may be wondering about performing vertical pools with a supinated grip like done in chin-ups and supinated grip LED pull-downs whenever you're using a suprated grip on vertical pulls you're predominantly performing shoulder extension like you do with closer grip vertical and horizontal pulls however it's not Crystal Clear if the supinated grip does anything to reduce involvement of the shoulder extensors such as the rear delts intriguingly the aforementioned 2002 semg analysis out of the USA found suprated grip LED pulldowns evoked lower rear Del activity compared to closer grip lap pull-downs in fact the supinated grip let pull Downs rear tail activity was similar to that obtained in wider grip lap pull-downs again we need to view the surface electromyography studies through a lens of caution the truth is I don't know if these findings are valid one could spare click that supinated grips likely heavily involves the biceps and then heavy biceps involvement lowers the activity of the shoulder extensors such as the results I think this is certainly a valid speculation thus super plated vertical pulls May either be alongside wider grip vertical pulls if the surface electromography findings reflect the truth or above the wider grip vertical pools if they don't as alluded to near the start of the video you're most likely not training all of these variations in your program but if a few of these compound exercises are already in your program is that all you need for developing the rear delts in the long term if you're a recreational lifter who isn't necessarily overly worried about truly maximizing radar hypertrophy rather you're just after notable improvements training with some of these vertical and horizontal pulls may be sufficient even if you're not necessarily trading the one ranked as the best we still know that other ones will contribute to rear delt development here's what you could do simply train with whatever horizontal and vertical pulling exercises you like after some months or even a year evaluate your rear delt progress if you're not satisfied with your rear delt development then at this point it's going to be a good idea to add in some isolated riddle exercises to your training if you're somebody with the intention of doing everything in your power to maximize radial hypertrophy then I believe it makes sense to also add some isolated retail exercise sizes on top of whatever vertical and horizontal pulls you may be performing in your training program fundamentally this seems to be a fine strategy for enhancing a muscle's development for example a recent study by Casiano speaks to this with the glute Max 33 previously untrained women trained three times per week for 10 weeks one group purely trained the leg press and stiff-legged deadlift each with these variables another group also trained the leg press and stiff legged deadlift but they added a hip thrust strictly speaking the hip thrust isn't actually an isolation exercise but as seen previously at the house of hypertrophy we know this movement predominantly just grows the glute Max this second group due to the addition of the hip thrust ended up performing more total sets it was ultimately found glute Max growth was Superior for this second group overall since isolation exercises are generally a lot less taxing and fatiguing I think they're just a great way to train a muscle more while attempting to keep recovery in check before detailing what may be some of the best reardale isolation exercises in my attempt to make this video as in-depth as possible I do want to mention two semg studies which find that reverse machine flies an isolation retail exercise evokes higher retail activity compared to seated rows these findings are quite interesting because the seated rows were performed in a way that meant shoulder horizontal extension was occurring which is the same movement occurring at the shoulder in machine reverse flies despite this the findings indicate higher radial activity from the machine reverse flies which at face value suggests they may provide a larger stimulus on the one hand many people may not be surprised with these findings but on the other hand I do certainly see why these results may be somewhat surprising to others because as just mentioned both of them fundamentally involve the same movement at the shoulder joint so why would retail involvement be different once again I can't overstate that we must view these semg studies through the lens of caution but if these findings reflect a truth one could speculate that the fact-seated roles involve motion at their elbow and perhaps the possibility some subjects retracted and engage their muscles around the scapular as plausible reasons behind the findings nevertheless machine reverse flies was the rear tail isolation exercise used in these two semg studies but what are the most effective exercises for isolating the results as per the leverage and find why I lectured research we know the rear delts are highly involved in shoulder horizontal extension and besides machine reverse flies dumbbell and cable reverse flights also involve this motion face pulls although technically a compound exercise also involve this motion when performed in this way finally dumbbell power raises involve the movement are any of these potentially more effective for building their adults at the time of recording this is how I would rank them I hypothesize cable reverse flies and dumbbell power raises are two of the best rear delt Builders with face pools and machine reverse flies ranked behind them and then finally dumbbell reverse flies no I don't believe this is a Flawless ranking and I know not everyone will necessarily agree with it but allow me to explain my thought process behind it with Dumbo reverse flies it's important to know just because they are ranked last it does not mean they are tragic for growing their eggs else I think they will do a good job the limitation with them however is that they are only most challenging at that shortened muscle position at the Final End range of motion machine reverse flies are a step up from this as they do a better job at providing resistance throughout the range of motion I've also placed face pulls at the same level and this one may be a little more controversial although Facebooks are more challenging at the shortened position in addition to involving shoulder horizontal extension they also involve external rotation and something I've yet to mention in this video is the rear delts are involved in external rotation thus perhaps the combination of these movements could be somewhat beneficial at the top of the rankings we have cable reverse flies and dumbbell power raises these involve shoulder horizontal extension but both of these movements involve the attainment of a great stretch of their adults and are highly challenging around that lengthened muscle position if you follow the house of hypertrophy for a while you'll know there's emerging research indicating that trading muscles at more lengthened positions seems to build more muscle this study from Japan compared seated Legos to Langley Coast seated let go stretch out of the hamstrings better and they more effectively grew the hamstrings another study by the same authors compared triceps overhead extensions to pushdowns and overhead extensions better stretch out the long triceps head they more effectively grew the overall triceps moreover emerging data indicate a partial range of motion at that long muscle length may be superior to using a full range of motion this study by Pedrosa involves comparing a partial range of motion leg extension as their initial position where the quads are at a longer length to a full range of motion vastus lateralis and rectus femoris hypertrophy tended to be overall better with a partial range of motion at the initial position another study by Casiano compared performing this car for exercise with a partial range of motion at the stretched position to using a full range of motion medial and lateral gastrocnemius hypertrophy favored using the partial range of motion at the stretched position finally a recent abstract from Japan indicates with a multi-hit machine using a partial range of motion as a long a length produced overall better muscle I purge fee compared to using a full range of motion no this particular study has only been presented as an abstract at a conference but I'm presuming it will be officially published soon I think more research is needed to examine if a partial range of motion at long muscle lengths always builds muscle more effectively than using a full range of motion in all circumstances but at least this literature further points towards that lengthened muscle position being valuable for evoking muscle growth and this combined overall literature surrounding muscle length leads me to hypothesize cable reverse flies and dumbbell power raises could be the two better result builders having said all of this some people have speculated the result should not grow more with exercises attaining a stretch why they believe so due to research looking at the length tension relationship of the rear delt sarcomas however as I've previously detailed in an article I believe this literature has a range of limitations that means it cannot be sincerely used to decipher if a particular muscle will benefit from exercise attaining a stretch or not thus in the absence of other research these rankings reflect my current speculations if any new research comes along that may influence my thinking into a different direction I'll be sure to update you all if you're

highest standard we don't just partner with anyone at the house of hypertrophy [Music] as a fun fact although we typically consider the deltoid to consist of three segments the front side and rear segments there is research suggesting the deltoids actually consist of seven segments fascinatingly text dating back from as early as 1734 have documented this and the segments are visible in lean individuals although there's no unanimous agreement functional data would suggest the first segment is the front head the second two segments the side head and the final four segments that we're ahead it's not currently clear of certain exercises May preferentially grow different segments of the rear head but we can't be confident that all the exercises described as being respectable or better for developing the rear head would effectively train all four segments nonetheless in summary both vertical and horizontal pulling exercises can effectively train their adults based on the available evidence this is how I would broadly rank their effectiveness if you're training some of these I do believe you will see great rear delt development in the long term if you're simply a recreational lifter who's not overly concerned about maximizing everything then I would say isolated retail exercises are probably not essential although I will say that if after a few months or a year of training your choice of horizontal and vertical pulling exercises if you're not satisfied with your rear delt development then at this point it is going to be worth adding in isolated rear delt training likewise if you're someone who is trying to do everything in your power to maximize radio hypertrophy adding isolated Ridout training to whatever compound exercises you're training is probably going to be required based on the available evidence this is how I would rank isolation retail exercises feel free to consider checking out our guide to cydelts hypertrophy"

    "published_at": "2022-10-03T11:00:03Z",
    "transcript": "foreign in this video we're comparing one three and five minutes of rest between sets for strength and hypertrophy outcomes bodybuilders are historically famous for utilizing short rests between sets an American Paper all the way back from 1987 reported the recruited bodybuilders rested 10 to 90 seconds between sets the legendary bodybuilder Arnold in his book recommended keeping rest periods down to a minute or less strength athletes more commonly utilize longer rests returning to the 87 American Paper their recruited powerlifters tended to rest 120 to 420 seconds between sets does the scientific literature support these practices is muscle hypertrophy enhanced with shorter rest intervals and muscle strength with longer wrists let's Analyze This [Music] interestingly the scientific literature suggests that optimal restoration for muscle hypertrophy depends on whether an exercise recruits a large amount of muscle mass or a small amount of muscle mass exercises involving a large amount of muscle mass include compound exercises but also lower body isolation exercises with these exercises it appears short rest periods are sub-optimal for muscle hypertrophy a 2016 New York study found in trained men performing a range of compound exercises plus a lower body isolation exercise with these training variables muscle hypertrophy outcomes were Superior when resting three minutes between sets versus one minute a 2020 Brazilian study found in untrained men performing the leg press with these training variables quad gains were Superior when resting 3 minutes versus one minute between sets a 2009 study from the USA found an untrained men trading a program heavily involving large muscle mass movements arm and thigh gains were greater when resting 2.5 minutes as opposed to one minute between sets finally a 2017 Japanese paper found an untrained men training the bench press and squats with these variables triceps gains were similar between resting for 2.5 minutes or 30 seconds yet thigh gains tended to be better when resting for 2.5 minutes thus this overview literature is solid evidence with large muscle mass exercises resting 2.5 to 3 minutes between sets evokes greater hypertrophy versus shorter rest periods what about five minute rest periods this 2016 English study had trains men perform the leg press and leg extension with these variables long-term hypertrophy was not evaluated but the researchers established myofibular protein synthesis elevations after training was overall Superior when using five minutes of rest between sets versus one minute this is mainly evident in the immediate hours after training the temporary increases in testosterone were actually greater when using one minute of rest between sets this finding elegantly depicts how temporary increases in anabolic hormones like testosterone mean nothing for actual contractile protein synthesis and by extension long-term muscle growth this is notable as it's often purported short rests are superior for hypertrophy since they promote greater temporary anabolic hormone increases but again it's evident temporary anabolic hormone spikes aren't associated with hypertrophy other scientific papers corroborate this progressing forward how does 2.5 to 3 minutes compare to five minutes of rest between sets unfortunately there's no precise research exploring this the paper with the closest relevancy is this 2005 Finnish study which found in-trained men performing squats and leg presses quad gains were similar between resting two or five minutes between sets yet a confounder is the two minute rest condition involved performing one extra set per exercise then the five minute rest condition this may lead one to believe if sets were equated the five minute rest period would have been Superior but I should note this study wasn't the best designed or controlled subjects performed other exercises and training was unsupervised the researchers relied on training Diaries accordingly I believe better quality data is required to evaluate the efficacy of 5-minute rest periods for hypertrophy at the least I think it's sensible to recommend 2.5 to 3 minutes of rest between large muscle mass exercise sets for hypertrophy an individual may wish the experiment with five-minute rest intervals if they have the time and are willing to do so now if 2.5 to 3 minutes of rest between sets is difficult for you to achieve due to time constraints super setting exercises that train opposing or non-related muscle groups can be an effective method to shorten your workout duration while still technically resting longer between sets of the same exercise what about rest periods with exercises training smaller amounts of muscle mass I.E isolation upper body exercises the research isn't as refined in this area but what exists suggests short rests are viable if not may be superior this 2016 Japanese study had men trained largely isolated biceps and triceps movements one group trained with repster failure with 20 rep max loads per set and 30 seconds rest between sets while another group trained with reps to failure with 8 rep max loads and three minutes of rest between sets both groups perform the same number of sets and it's worth noting the use of different loads between groups is probably not a major issue as we know reps between 6 and 35 are similar for hypertrophy when reps are performed two or close to failure arm games were greater for the group resting 30 seconds between sets another 2018 Japanese paper had untrained main train dumbbell curls one condition involved three sets of reps to failure with an 80 one rep max load and three minutes of rest between sets a second condition with three sets of reps to failure with a 30 one rep max load and 90 seconds of rest between sets and a third condition involving a drop set with repster failure performed with these five loads back to back with no rest between them elbow flexor gains were similar between all three conditions suggesting a three minute 90 seconds and no rest I.E drop sets are comparable for gains though I should note the drop set condition technically involved two more sets so this is a potential confounder and consideration yet another 2018 Japanese study had untrained mentoring triceps pushdowns one condition involved normal sets with 90 second rest intervals while a second condition involved drop sets with no rest between reps to failure triceps gains tended to favor the drop set condition suggesting short risks specifically no rest with drop sets may be beneficial though the drop set condition technically involved one more set so this is a consideration and potential confounder again this literature isn't super refined but I think it's decent enough to infer with exercises training a small amount of muscle mass short rests are viable if not potentially and I must emphasize potentially Superior in this studies finding 2.5 to 3 minutes of rest between sets produces more hypertrophy than shorter rests in large muscle mass movements they equate as sets between the different rest interval conditions which is of course what we wanted but with these large muscle mass exercises could performing more sets with shorter rest be effective to produce equivalent hypertrophy to fewer sets with longer rests most likely yes we brief this 2020 Brazilian study earlier finding when training the leg press with these variables quad gains were Superior when resting for 3 minutes versus one minute between sets yet this study also had a third condition I did not mention this condition performed sets of reps to failure with one minute of rest between sets and aim to match the volume load attained by the condition using three minutes of rest between sets this resulted in this condition performing an average of 4.5 sets of reps to failure with one minute of rest between sets per session and this condition saw similar hypertrophy to the three minute condition they only used three sets of reps to failure per session so with large muscle mass exercises more sets where shorter rest can likely produce similar hypertrophy to using longer rests with fewer sets it's worth noting from a Time perspective both would be fairly similar of course using the three minute rest would be less fatiguing and the total quality of your volume may be superior but the short arrest may still be useful if you prefer short rests want to change up your routine and or want to enhance cardiovascular adaptations [Music] in line with probably everyone's expectations longer rests between sets appear to be more favorable for enhancing muscle strength we mentioned this 2016 New York study that found in trained to men performing these large muscle mass exercises with these training variables hypertrophy outcomes were great to when Racing 3 minutes versus one minute between sets bench press and squat strength gains were also greater when resting three minutes between sets this 1995 USA study had trains men perform this training program and found squat strength gains tended to be greater when resting for 3 minutes versus 1.5 minutes or 30 seconds between sets what about even longer rest intervals this 2010 Brazilian study had trained to me to execute this program and found leg press and bench press strength gains were not significantly different between resting for three or five minutes between sets but both rest periods produce larger strength gains versus resting one minute between sets no though the differences between the three and five minute rest periods were non-significant statistically the leg press gains in particular seemingly favor the 5 minute rest period this is only a single measure from a single study and more research is certainly needed to determine if five minutes of rest between cess is superior to three minutes of rest again you could experiment with 5 minutes of rest between sets if you're willing to foreign [Music] looking at large muscle mass exercises with set numbers controlled resting 2.5 to 3 minutes between sets produces more hypertrophy than resting for one minute or less it's not clear if restoration is beyond 2.5 to 3 minutes provide more hypertrophic benefit more research is needed it's worth knowing if you perform more sets with short rests on large muscle mass movements you likely can see similar hypertrophy to Long rest with fewer sets with small muscle mass exercises short rest seem to be perfectly fine if not potentially again emphasizing potentially as more data is needed Superior as for strength adaptations three minutes produces greater gains versus shorter durations and similar to the discussion on hypertrophy with large muscle mass movements more research is needed to analyze if five minutes of rest is better than three minutes if you've made it this far I have a free ebook you might like it's the ultimate guide to bench pressing for strength and or hypertrophy with over 100 scientific references whether you train for strength and or hypertrophy we discuss technical factors like grip width and bar path

    "title": "The BEST Training Frequency (New Research)",
    "published_at": "2022-11-14T12:00:05Z",
    "transcript": "foreign to the house of hypertrophy a brand new study comparing training in muscle once a week to three times per week for hypertrophy and strength has come out in my view it's the single best designed study on training frequency to date primarily as it provides individual data allowing us to know if the best training frequency differs between individuals furthermore this new study has actually shifted my opinion on trading frequency since my last video on the topic let's dive straight into the new paper 24 trained men with an average 203 kilogram unilateral leg press one rep max were recruited subjects were split into two groups in one of the groups the researchers equated total training tonnage between training once and three times per week this actually resulted in the once per week frequency performing the max number of reps they could per set while they're three times per week frequency in order to accumulate similar tonnage to the once per week frequency had to hold back and perform many of the sets further from failure in my view as proximity to failure is crucial for muscle growth and there's not a strong relationship between training tonnage and muscle growth this group isn't useful or applicable to the real world the second group is the more interesting group that more accurately translates to the real world so I'll only detail this but if you're still interested in the first group I've detailed all you need to know about this group in the pinned comment anyway with the second group subjects had one leg assigned to train once a week and the other leg assigned to train three times per week with the leg assigned to train once a week subjects perform nine sets of the max reps they could on the unilateral leg press all in one session per week with the three times per week lick subjects perform three sets of the max reps they could on the unilateral leg press across three sessions per week so total sets per week were the same between both legs note both legs Target rep numbers per set depended on the week and subjects adjusted to load each set when necessary to make sure they hit that week's rep number Target it was ultimately found both strength measured by unilateral leg press 100 Max and muscle growth measured by quadriceps cross-sectional area at around a 50 region were not statistically different between the one and three times per week leg now statistical significance or non-significance is often considered to be a definitive finding but as detailed in this great article this is very misleading it is entirely plausible to have a non-statistically significant confinding but for there to be potentially a real difference due to this looking at other statistical data is also helpful fortunately the researchers provided us with this when looking at these additional statistics there appears to be a potentially real difference between the frequencies the effect sizes which measures how big differences are and the accompanied confidence intervals Point towards the three times per week leg experiencing greatest strength and muscle growth the graph with individual data plotted also demonstrates that a number of individuals experienced notably more strength and muscle growth with their three times per week leg yet it's essential to point out there still were a number of individuals who saw minimal differences in gains between the two training frequencies or even slightly more gains with a once a week frequency actually one individual saw markedly more strength gains with a once per week leg versus the three times per week leg this study is perfect experimental evidence of individual differences with training frequency some trained individuals gain notably more with a three times per week frequency While others don't in this week's completely unrelated info check out these Indian bodybuilders from the 1920s I ran across from a post by menu given it was the 1920s you can be pretty sure they were Natty super inspiring all right on to the next part [Music] some may be thinking surely the results just outlined State the obvious of course individual differences exist yet someone could come along and say humans are humans we all have muscles constructed with the same elements the composition of muscle tissue is going to be very comparable between humans so what works for one human should robustly extend to what works for another human but experimental data allows us to rebuttle these assumptions the data further allows us to inspect how consistent and how large these individual differences are perhaps even more excitingly scientific research might eventually uncover why these individual differences exist What mechanisms cause this individual to experience markedly more strength gains when training once versus three times per week What mechanisms cause some individuals to grow more training three times per week While others to not hopefully sports science research gets to this point a great strength of the study was each subject trained both once and three times per week one leg trained once a week while the other leg trained three times per week this is a powerful study designed as it rules out genetics nutrition and outside lifestyle factors as confounders yet Sports Science Savvy individuals may be wondering if the cross-education effect is a concern for the unaware the cross-education effect is the phenomenon where training only one limb can produce gains in the opposite limb despite that opposite limb not being directly trained as subjects train to each leg with a different training frequency does the cross-education effect mess up the data with the muscle growth results it very likely does not the muscle growth transfer from one limb to the opposite seems to be tiny for example this 2005 USA study had 243 men and 342 women trained only one of their biceps with a unilateral preacher and concentration curls the trained by step increased in cross-sectional area by an average of 18.9 percent however the untrained bicep only increased in cross-sectional area by an average of 1.4 percent with strength the transfer from one limb to the opposite is more significant the same 2005 USA study found a trained bicep increased unilateral preacher called Wonder at max strength by 54.1 percent while the untrained bicep saw a 10.6 increase in unilateral preacher curl wondering max strength yet it's very possible the cross-education effect is minimized in trained individuals training both their limbs with different training variables as done in the study outlined the fact that we observed an average difference in strength gains between the once and three times per week leg hints at this if the cross-education effect was an issue we'd expect a bi-directional transfer of strength gains between limbs leading to similar strength gains between legs but this didn't occur average strength gains favorite delay trading three times per week versus once a week so the study we overviewed was highly insightful but what does the rest of the hypertrophy training frequency research say there was a 2019 meta-analysis on training frequency anti-purchase fee that was detailed in my old video on the topic meta-analysis statistically combined the results of numerous individual studies on a given topic and meta-analyzes are often considered the highest form of scientific evidence in all variations of science evidence hierarchies the meta-analysis found no difference in muscle growth between higher and lower frequencies now remember the study we overviewed in addition to presenting individual data still suggests more average muscle with a three times per week frequency versus one frequency given the evidence hierarchy shouldn't we consider that meta-analysis finding above the average findings from that single paper in my perhaps controversial view not necessarily the methods of the meta-analysis and included studies matter a limitation of the mentioned meta-analysis is they considered the high and low frequencies specific to the study for example in one study training three times per week was classed as a low frequency while in another study training three times per week was classed as a high frequency moreover many of the included studies in the meta-analysis are Divergent from the one we analyzed either differing training frequencies were compared like once versus twice a week or six versus three times per week it's involved training with fewer than nine weekly sets involved untrained individuals or measured muscle growth with less precise methods like Dexter or skin folds another extremely important point is all of these studies compare two different groups of people unlike the study outlined in this video each subject did not train with both training frequencies so genetics nutrition and outside lifestyle factors can all confound the studies included in that meta-analysis finally linked to this point and over vital importance the meta-analysis does not provide us with an insight into individual differences the new study does 2018 meta-analysis found strength gains were similar between lower and higher frequency training however as was the case with a hypertrophy meta-analysis many of the included studies are Divergent from the one we analyzed either differing training frequencies were compared like once versus twice a week or two versus three times per week involved training with fewer than 9 weekly sets or involved untrained individuals all of them also compare two different groups of people meaning genetics nutrition and outside lifestyle factors are potential confounders [Music] finally again this meta-analysis does not provide us with an insight into individual differences the new study does of course the study outlined in the video only compared a one to three times per week training frequency it would be great to see similarly designed studies comparing other frequencies like two versus three times per week or even three versus five times per week at the end of the day my concluding recommendations are that if you're training with a low frequency and seeing great gains I don't believe you should change anything based on this new data remember there are certainly individuals who see no difference between lower and high frequencies or even better gains with lower frequencies however you could still experiment with higher frequencies in the future if you wish if you're training with a lower frequency and you're not content with the gains You may wish to experiment with higher frequencies to see if this can notably change things the data demonstrates there are individuals who see greater gains with higher frequencies if you've made it here

    "transcript": "When training under certain variables,\u00a0\nlifting weights can temporarily increase the\u00a0\u00a0 concentrations of a variety of systemic anabolic\u00a0\nhormones, such as testosterone and growth hormone. Based on my assessment of the literature,\u00a0\nit seems performing exercises that involve\u00a0\u00a0 a large amount of muscle mass, using moderate\u00a0\nloads and rap ranges with a good number of sets\u00a0\u00a0 and short rest intervals evokes the greatest\u00a0\ntemporary increases in anabolic hormones. As an example, one paper established that\u00a0\nperforming 10 sets of 10 repetitions with a\u00a0\u00a0 70% one-rep max load on the back squat (with\u00a0\nthe load adjusted on a set by set basis to\u00a0\u00a0 ensure the achievement of 10 repetitions)\u00a0\ngenerated significant temporary elevations\u00a0\u00a0 in total testosterone, free testosterone, and\u00a0\ngrowth hormone. On the whole, these spikes peak\u00a0\u00a0 anywhere from immediately after to 60 minutes\u00a0\nafter the training session and thereafter fall. For quite a long time, there have been hypotheses\u00a0\nthat these temporary spikes in anabolic hormones\u00a0\u00a0 triggered via lifting weights could be\u00a0\nimportant for long-term muscle hypertrophy. So much so that there have been a considerable\u00a0\nnumber of studies only assessing the temporary\u00a0\u00a0 anabolic hormonal responses to using\u00a0\na variety of training variables.\u00a0\u00a0 The idea behind these studies is that by\u00a0\nestablishing which training variables and\u00a0\u00a0 exercises best generate anabolic hormonal spikes,\u00a0\nwe would know what optimally builds muscle. This isn't entirely a ludicrous idea, spiking\u00a0\nthe concentrations of anabolic hormones via\u00a0\u00a0 lifting weights could theoretically increase the\u00a0\nlikelihood they exert their anabolic effects. Let me explain. We know that circulating testosterone\u00a0\n(more precisely free testosterone)\u00a0\u00a0 can bind to what we call androgen receptors\u00a0\nlocated within muscle fibers and thereafter\u00a0\u00a0 prompt an increase in muscle protein synthesis\u00a0\u00a0 (which in our case simply references an increase\u00a0\nin the proteins that make muscles bigger). Testosterone can also bind to a membrane-bound\u00a0\nreceptor to activate something called the\u00a0\u00a0 PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway, which is quite a well-known\u00a0\nsignaling pathway where a variety of specific\u00a0\u00a0 proteins interact in a chain reaction fashion to\u00a0\ngenerate an increase in muscle protein synthesis. Considering these events, a spike in circulating\u00a0\ntestosterone evoked via lifting weights could\u00a0\u00a0 theoretically increase the likelihood they\u00a0\noccur, presumably amplifying muscle hypertrophy. Comparably, growth hormone is primarily believed\u00a0\nto exert its anabolic effects via stimulating\u00a0\u00a0 an increase in IGF-1 production from the liver,\u00a0\nIGF-1 thereafter can activate the PI3K/Akt/mTOR\u00a0\u00a0 pathway. Therefore, a spike in growth\u00a0\nhormone concentrations evoked via lifting\u00a0\u00a0 weights could theoretically increase\u00a0\nthe likelihood this event occurs. Aside from these gene expression\u00a0\nevents, there are also nongenomic\u00a0\u00a0 roles by which a spike in anabolic hormones\u00a0\ncould heighten long-term muscle hypertrophy. Testosterone can increase the concentrations\u00a0\nof calcium within muscle fibers.\u00a0\u00a0 Calcium plays a fundamental role in\u00a0\nforce-producing events. Due to this, a spike in\u00a0\u00a0 testosterone within a workout can boost calcium\u00a0\nconcentrations within muscle fibers, thereby\u00a0\u00a0 enhancing force production which could enhance\u00a0\nthe degree of tension experienced by the muscle,\u00a0\u00a0 ultimately leading to more muscle hypertrophy as\u00a0\nmechanosensitive proteins within muscle fibers\u00a0\u00a0 detect tension and thereafter convert tension into\u00a0\u00a0 a signaling cascade that culminates in\u00a0\nan increase in muscle protein synthesis. All of these hypotheses sound\u00a0\nplausible and interesting.\u00a0\u00a0 However, do they truly occur in reality? In other words, should you be aiming to\u00a0\ntrain in a way that maximally spikes the\u00a0\u00a0 anabolic hormone response in order to\u00a0\noptimally stimulate muscle hypertrophy? From the current literature, I believe there\u00a0\nare at least 2 ways we could evaluate this. The first way is to evaluate the correlation\u00a0\u00a0 between spikes in anabolic hormones\u00a0\nand long-term muscle hypertrophy. That is, do the individuals that experience the\u00a0\ngreatest spikes in anabolic hormones ultimately\u00a0\u00a0 experience the greatest muscle hypertrophy. If\u00a0\nso, we would have some evidence that temporary\u00a0\u00a0 spikes in anabolic hormones evoked via lifting\u00a0\nweights may be important for building muscle. The second way is to compare a training program\u00a0\nthat generates greater temporary spikes in\u00a0\u00a0 anabolic hormones to one that generates lesser (or\u00a0\neven non-existent) spikes in anabolic hormones.\u00a0\u00a0 If muscle hypertrophy is greater with\u00a0\na training program that generates\u00a0\u00a0 greater spikes in anabolic hormones, we\u00a0\nwould have further potential evidence\u00a0\u00a0 indicating temporary elevations\u00a0\nin anabolic hormones is important. Let us dive into the current literature,\u00a0\nstarting with the correlation data. Intriguingly, two studies have\u00a0\nindeed observed a correlation\u00a0\u00a0 between the magnitude of spikes in anabolic\u00a0\nhormones and long-term muscle hypertrophy. Mangine et al. had 33 men with an average\u00a0\nof 5.7 years of training experience perform\u00a0\u00a0 a range of exercises 4 times per week for 8 weeks. Every session, subjects trained\u00a0\neach exercise for 4 sets with 3-12\u00a0\u00a0 repetitions with 70-90% one-rep max load,\u00a0\nusing 1 to 3 minutes of rest between sets. Blood samples taken at various time points\u00a0\nduring training sessions on the first\u00a0\u00a0 and last week successfully demonstrated\u00a0\ntraining immediately temporarily spiked\u00a0\u00a0 testosterone, IGF-1, and growth hormone. Moreover, by the end of the 8th week, thickness\u00a0\nand cross-sectional area of the rectus femoris and\u00a0\u00a0 vastus lateralis (measured at approximately\u00a0\n50% of the thigh bone length) increased. Most relevant to our discussion, a thorough\u00a0\nanalysis of the data indicates there was a\u00a0\u00a0 relationship between the temporary spikes in\u00a0\ntestosterone and muscle hypertrophy. In other\u00a0\u00a0 words, it appears the subjects that experienced\u00a0\nthe greatest temporary increases in testosterone\u00a0\u00a0 concentrations as a result of training ultimately\u00a0\nexperienced the highest increases in thickness and\u00a0\u00a0 cross-sectional area of the rectus femoris\u00a0\nand vastus lateralis. The temporary spikes\u00a0\u00a0 of other hormones, including growth hormone,\u00a0\ndid not seem predictive of muscle hypertrophy. However, another study by Mccall et\u00a0\nal. somewhat conflicts with this data. 11 men with prior resistance training experience\u00a0\nperformed a range of exercises each for 3 sets\u00a0\u00a0 with a 10 rep-max load, using 1 minute of rest\u00a0\nbetween sets, three times per week for 12 weeks. Blood samples taken at various time\u00a0\npoints during training sessions in\u00a0\u00a0 the 4th and 8th week demonstrated that training\u00a0\nsuccessfully temporarily elevated growth hormone\u00a0\u00a0 concentrations, but had little impact on\u00a0\ntestosterone and IGF-1 concentrations. Measurements taken before and after\u00a0\nthe 8 training weeks revealed training\u00a0\u00a0 increased whole biceps cross-sectional\u00a0\narea and cross-sectional area of slow\u00a0\u00a0 and fast-twitch fibers obtained from the biceps. Relevant to our discussion, the temporary\u00a0\nspikes in growth hormone correlated with\u00a0\u00a0 increases in slow-twitch as well as fast-twitch\u00a0\nfiber cross-sectional area gains. In other words,\u00a0\u00a0 those that experienced the highest temporary\u00a0\nelevations in growth hormone evoked via training\u00a0\u00a0 tended to experience the most growth of the\u00a0\nfast and slow-twitch fibers of the biceps. There were no other correlations, implying\u00a0\ncontrary to the Mangine study, there was no\u00a0\u00a0 association between testosterone spikes and\u00a0\nhypertrophy. However, recall testosterone\u00a0\u00a0 concentrations were virtually unaffected via\u00a0\ntraining, and so this may explain this finding. Overall, the results of this Mcall et al. study\u00a0\nare a little difficult to wrap our heads around.\u00a0\u00a0 Although a correlation between growth hormone\u00a0\nspikes and slow and fast-twitch fiber growth\u00a0\u00a0 was noted, there was no correlation\u00a0\nbetween growth hormones spikes and\u00a0\u00a0 increases in whole biceps cross-sectional\u00a0\narea, which is difficult to reconcile. What's also difficult to reconcile is IGF-1\u00a0\nconcentrations were virtually unimpacted\u00a0\u00a0 via training, and as we noted earlier,\u00a0\nit's thought growth hormone primarily\u00a0\u00a0 exerts its anabolic effects via stimulating an\u00a0\nincrease in IGF-1 production from the liver. Nonetheless, these two studies by Mangine and\u00a0\nMcall, despite conflicting to some degree and\u00a0\u00a0 having some inconsistencies, broadly indicate\u00a0\nsome relationship between temporary hormones\u00a0\u00a0 spikes generated via lifting weights\u00a0\nand long-term muscle hypertrophy. However, 4 other studies find very weak or\u00a0\nnon-existent associations between temporary\u00a0\u00a0 spikes in anabolic hormones and\u00a0\nlong-term muscle hypertrophy. West and Phillips found that after 56 men\u00a0\n(untrained at least in the last 8 months\u00a0\u00a0 before the study) trained a variety of exercises\u00a0\neach for 2-4 sets of 6-12 reps 5 times per week\u00a0\u00a0 for 12 weeks, there was no correlation between\u00a0\ntemporary spikes in free testosterone and growth\u00a0\u00a0 of slow and fast-twitch fibers from the vastus\u00a0\nlateralis, nor was there a correlation between\u00a0\u00a0 temporary spikes in IGF-1 and growth of slow and\u00a0\nfast-twitch fibers from the vastus lateralis. However, there was a weak correlation between\u00a0\ntemporary spikes in growth hormone and slow and\u00a0\u00a0 fast-twitch fiber growth, but again\u00a0\nthese relationships were very weak.\u00a0\u00a0 There was also a weak correlation between cortisol\u00a0\ntemporary spikes and fast-twitch fiber growth,\u00a0\u00a0 but not slow-twitch fiber growth. It's worth mentioning cortisol is actually\u00a0\ncatabolic, it increases muscle protein breakdown\u00a0\u00a0 and as such, is considered counteractive\u00a0\nto hypertrophy, so this relationship\u00a0\u00a0 (again, which was weak) between cortisol\u00a0\nspikes and fast-twitch fiber growth does\u00a0\u00a0 not readily make much sense, and perhaps\u00a0\nmay be best interpreted as a coincidence. Another study by Fink et al. found after 20\u00a0\nmen (untrained at least in the last 2 years\u00a0\u00a0 leading up to the study) trained a variety of arm\u00a0\nexercises each for 3 sets with 8-20 repetitions\u00a0\u00a0 and between 30 seconds and 3 minutes of rest\u00a0\nbetween sets, there was no correlation between\u00a0\u00a0 temporary spikes in growth hormone (measured\u00a0\nduring a training session in the second week)\u00a0\u00a0 and increases in arm cross-sectional area. No\u00a0\nother hormones were assessed in this study. Thirdly, Mitchell et al. found after\u00a0\n23 men (untrained at least in the year\u00a0\u00a0 leading up to the study) trained a range of\u00a0\nexercises each for 2-4 sets with 6-12 reps,\u00a0\u00a0 using 60-120 seconds of rest between sets\u00a0\nfor four times per week for 16 weeks,\u00a0\u00a0 there was no relationship between any temporary\u00a0\nspikes in the main anabolic hormones evoked via an\u00a0\u00a0 acute training loading protocol (which occurred\u00a0\nduring the first and last weeks of training)\u00a0\u00a0 and growth of slow and fast-twitch\u00a0\nmuscle fibers from the vastus lateralis. Finally, Morton et al. found after 49 men (with\u00a0\nat least 2 years of training experience) trained\u00a0\u00a0 a range of exercises for 3 sets of 8-25 reps\u00a0\nto failure 4 times per week for 12 weeks,\u00a0\u00a0 there was no relationship between all temporary\u00a0\nspikes in the anabolic hormones evoked via an\u00a0\u00a0 acute training loading protocol (which\u00a0\noccurred before and after the training\u00a0\u00a0 period) and growth of slow and fast-twitch\u00a0\nmuscle fibers from the vastus lateralis. So in total, the majority of the\u00a0\ncurrent literature fails to find\u00a0\u00a0 a correlation between temporary spikes evoked\u00a0\nvia training and long-term muscle hypertrophy. Now, this is only correlational data, and it\u00a0\nstill does not necessarily inform us how a\u00a0\u00a0 training with a program that generates significant\u00a0\ntemporary spikes in anabolic hormones compares to\u00a0\u00a0 a program that generates lesser (if any) spikes in\u00a0\nanabolic hormones for direct muscle hypertrophy. The best way to assess this is to directly analyze\u00a0\nthe current literature that has looked at this. Quite interestingly, one study by Ronnestad et\u00a0\nal. indicates long-term muscle hypertrophy may\u00a0\u00a0 be enhanced with a program that generates\u00a0\nhigh temporary spikes in anabolic hormones. 11 previously untrained men had one arm\u00a0\nassigned to a low hormone condition and their\u00a0\u00a0 other arm assigned to a high hormone condition. Both arms were trained\u00a0\ntwice per week for 12 weeks. Each session, the low hormone arm trained the\u00a0\nbiceps curl, hammer curl, and reverse curl each\u00a0\u00a0 for 2 sets with a 6-10 rep-max load. This training\u00a0\nsession, due to involving low amounts of muscle\u00a0\u00a0 mass, failed to evoke any significant temporary\u00a0\nspikes in testosterone or growth hormone. The high hormone arm, each session, performed\u00a0\nexactly what the low hormone arm did,\u00a0\u00a0 but before doing so, performed\u00a0\nthe leg press, leg extension,\u00a0\u00a0 and leg curl each for 3 sets with a 10 rep-max\u00a0\nload using 60-90 seconds of rest between sets.\u00a0\u00a0 Due to these additional leg exercises which\u00a0\ninvolve large amounts of muscle mass, as well\u00a0\u00a0 as the short rest intervals between sets of them,\u00a0\nthis lower-body training generated significant\u00a0\u00a0 spikes in testosterone and growth hormone during\u00a0\nthe subsequent biceps exercises, with the growth\u00a0\u00a0 hormone spike remaining further elevated\u00a0\nafter the completion of the biceps exercises. By the end of the study, increases\u00a0\nin cross-sectional area of the elbow\u00a0\u00a0 flexors at two proximal sites were\u00a0\nsimilar between both conditions,\u00a0\u00a0 but at two distal sites, increases\u00a0\nwere greater for the high hormone arm. Therefore, this data suggests preceding biceps\u00a0\nexercises with lower body training that evokes\u00a0\u00a0 spikes in testosterone and growth hormone may\u00a0\nultimately enhance overall biceps hypertrophy. This is quite fascinating, however,\u00a0\u00a0 a different study by West et al.\u00a0\nsomewhat conflicts with these findings. 12 previously untrained men\u00a0\nhad one arm assigned to a low\u00a0\u00a0 hormone condition and their other arm\u00a0\nassigned to a high hormone condition. Both arms were trained one to\u00a0\ntwo times per week for 15 weeks. Each session, the low hormone arm performed an\u00a0\narm curl (they weren't specific on which arm\u00a0\u00a0 curl) for 3-4 sets of 8-12 repetitions with a 95%\u00a0\n10 rep-max load. Due to the low amounts of muscle\u00a0\u00a0 mass trained, this exercise failed to temporarily\u00a0\nspike free testosterone, growth hormone, or IGF-1. The high hormone arm, each session, performed\u00a0\nexactly what the low hormone arm did,\u00a0\u00a0 but thereafter performed 5 sets\u00a0\nof 10 repetitions on the leg press\u00a0\u00a0 and 3 sets of 10 repetitions on a\u00a0\nleg extension/leg curl superset,\u00a0\u00a0 both were performed with a 95% 10 rep-max load.\u00a0\nDue to these lower body exercises performed after,\u00a0\u00a0 this session successfully provoked spikes\u00a0\nin testosterone, growth hormone, and IGF-1. Despite this, by the end of the study,\u00a0\nincreases in cross-sectional area of the\u00a0\u00a0 elbow flexors at all measured regions\u00a0\nwere similar between both conditions.\u00a0\u00a0 Moreover, increases in slow-twitch and\u00a0\nfast-twitch fiber cross-sectional area\u00a0\u00a0 from the elbow flexors were also\u00a0\nsimilar between both conditions. What could explain the conflicting findings\u00a0\nbetween the West and Ronnestad studies? The West study had the high hormone condition\u00a0\nperform the lower body exercises that evoked\u00a0\u00a0 spikes in anabolic hormones after the biceps\u00a0\nexercise, whereas the Ronnestad study had\u00a0\u00a0 the high hormone condition perform the lower\u00a0\nbody exercises before the biceps exercises. Perhaps performing the lower body exercises\u00a0\nthat generate spikes in anabolic hormones\u00a0\u00a0 prior to the biceps exercises, due\u00a0\nto resulting in you performing the\u00a0\u00a0 biceps exercises under elevated\u00a0\nanabolic hormone concentrations,\u00a0\u00a0 somehow potentiates long-term biceps\u00a0\nhypertrophy via some mechanism. One such mechanism might relate to enhanced\u00a0\ntestosterone and androgen receptor content. More precisely, creating an elevated anabolic\u00a0\nenvironment via performing lower body exercises\u00a0\u00a0 prior to biceps training may not only elevate\u00a0\ncirculating testosterone concentrations\u00a0\u00a0 but also androgen receptor\u00a0\ncontent within the biceps itself.\u00a0\u00a0 Such events would presumably enhance\u00a0\nthe likelihood testosterone can bind to\u00a0\u00a0 androgen receptors to thereafter provoke\u00a0\nan increase in muscle protein synthesis. I speculate this because one study by\u00a0\nSpiering et al. found that performing\u00a0\u00a0 a range of compound upper body exercises\u00a0\neach for 4 sets with a 10 rep-max load\u00a0\u00a0 (which temporarily spiked testosterone) before\u00a0\nperforming 5 sets with a 5 rep-max load on\u00a0\u00a0 a knee extension and flexion dynamometer\u00a0\nincreased androgen receptor content within\u00a0\u00a0 the vastus lateralis 180 minutes after\u00a0\nexercise. This was in contrast to only\u00a0\u00a0 performing 5 sets with a 5 rep-max load on\u00a0\nthe knee extension and flexion dynamometer,\u00a0\u00a0 which failed to spike testosterone and androgen\u00a0\nreceptor content within the vastus lateralis. Stated another way, performing exercises that\u00a0\nspike anabolic hormones before training a certain\u00a0\u00a0 muscle may ultimately increase the androgen\u00a0\nreceptor content within that certain muscle. Having said all of this, some data challenges\u00a0\nthese aforementioned ideas and results. There exist studies finding\u00a0\nthat despite a training\u00a0\u00a0 protocol evoking temporary spikes in testosterone,\u00a0\u00a0 androgen receptor content actually downregulates\u00a0\nin the hours after (that is, it decreases). Additionally, if spiking anabolic\u00a0\nhormones prior to training a muscle\u00a0\u00a0 enhanced its hypertrophy long-term, we\u00a0\nwould expect training compound exercises,\u00a0\u00a0 due to spiking anabolic hormones as they\u00a0\ninvolve large amounts of muscle mass,\u00a0\u00a0 prior to single-joint biceps and triceps exercises\u00a0\nto enhance biceps and triceps hypertrophy. However, this does not appear to be the case. Three studies have found biceps and/or\u00a0\ntriceps hypertrophy was similar regardless\u00a0\u00a0 of if compound or biceps and triceps isolation\u00a0\nexercises were performed first in a session.\u00a0\u00a0 If anything, the results of these studies\u00a0\nmight favor performing the biceps and triceps\u00a0\u00a0 isolation exercises first, therefore\u00a0\nconflicting with the Ronnestad study. On the basis of this data, I believe we cannot be\u00a0\ncertain the results of the Ronnestad study can be\u00a0\u00a0 truly confirmed, the results might just be random\u00a0\nand related to the small sample size of the study. Moving forward, two further areas of\u00a0\nthe literature indicate a program that\u00a0\u00a0 evokes higher spikes in anabolic hormones\u00a0\ndoes not confer additional hypertrophy. Firstly, Schwanbeck et al. found in men,\u00a0\nperforming free weight squats and bench\u00a0\u00a0 presses temporarily spiked free testosterone more\u00a0\nthan smith machines squats and bench presses.\u00a0\u00a0 Yet, after an 8 week training period, a\u00a0\nfree weight program (including the free\u00a0\u00a0 weight squat and bench press) produced similar\u00a0\nincreases in quadriceps and biceps thickness to\u00a0\u00a0 an exclusive machine program (that included\u00a0\nthe smith machine squat and bench press). Secondly, as we noted much earlier in this video,\u00a0\nusing shorter rest intervals between sets (90\u00a0\u00a0 seconds or less) tends to evoke greater spikes in\u00a0\nanabolic hormones (particularly growth hormone)\u00a0\u00a0 compared to training with longer\u00a0\nrest intervals (2.5 minutes or more).\u00a0\u00a0 However, as we've thoroughly described in\u00a0\nour complete guide to rest intervals video,\u00a0\u00a0 it seems with compound exercises and all\u00a0\nother training variables equivalent, resting\u00a0\u00a0 for 2.5 minutes or more generates more muscle\u00a0\nhypertrophy than resting for 90 seconds or less. Therefore, this free weight vs machine literature,\u00a0\nas well as the rest interval literature,\u00a0\u00a0 together further support the idea that\u00a0\nprograms that evoke higher temporary spikes\u00a0\u00a0 in anabolic hormones do not necessarily\u00a0\nproduce greater long-term hypertrophy. Combining all of the current\u00a0\nevidence assessed thus far,\u00a0\u00a0 and its apparent training in a way designed to\u00a0\nmaximally spike anabolic hormones is unnecessary. Not only are there weak (virtually non-existent)\u00a0\ncorrelations between the magnitude of temporary\u00a0\u00a0 spikes in anabolic hormones and muscle\u00a0\nhypertrophy, but programs that generate\u00a0\u00a0 higher temporary spikes in anabolic hormones\u00a0\ndo not appear to enhance muscle hypertrophy. Why might this be? The earlier mechanisms we outlined, that\u00a0\nspikes in anabolic hormones could increase the\u00a0\u00a0 likelihood of hormone-receptor interactions that\u00a0\nculminate in increased muscle protein synthesis,\u00a0\u00a0 seemed pretty logical. But evidently,\u00a0\nthis seems to not be occurring in reality. There are a few reasons I can think of\u00a0\nthat could potentially resolve this. Firstly, receptor content could\u00a0\njust downregulate (that is,\u00a0\u00a0 decrease in number) despite spikes in anabolic\u00a0\nhormones, thereby counteracting the increase in\u00a0\u00a0 anabolic hormones and making it no more likely\u00a0\nhormone receptor interactions would be enhanced.\u00a0\u00a0 Supporting this, and as I noted earlier\u00a0\nalready, there's evidence despite training\u00a0\u00a0 evoking a spike in testosterone,\u00a0\nandrogen receptor content decreased. Secondly, it's important to recognize these\u00a0\ntemporary spikes in anabolic hormones are\u00a0\u00a0 typically not very substantial, and it's\u00a0\nquite possible these transient elevations\u00a0\u00a0 are just too insignificant to influence muscle\u00a0\nhypertrophy. Of course, we know that chronic\u00a0\u00a0 supraphysiological elevations of anabolic hormones\u00a0\n(achieved via exogenous administration, that is,\u00a0\u00a0 you use steroids), very powerfully enhance muscle\u00a0\nhypertrophy. Yet, the very transient elevations\u00a0\u00a0 achieved via training naturally generally\u00a0\ndo not reach supraphysiological levels. Thirdly, it's quite plausible\u00a0\nthe temporary spikes in anabolic\u00a0\u00a0 hormones may just simply be a response to the\u00a0\nbuild of metabolites (like lactate) within a\u00a0\u00a0 muscle and/or be more so oriented towards\u00a0\nmobilizing fuel for muscle contraction,\u00a0\u00a0 rather than promoting an increase in\u00a0\nmuscle protein synthesis post-exercise. At this time, I don't believe we have\u00a0\nenough evidence to comment on which of\u00a0\u00a0 these three reasons (if any) explains the\u00a0\ncurrent observations of the literature. Nonetheless, at the end of the day,\u00a0\nI think everything outlined in this\u00a0\u00a0 video more or less indirectly\u00a0\ndemonstrates that for natural\u00a0\u00a0 individuals that are within the normal\u00a0\nphysiological anabolic hormones ranges,\u00a0\u00a0 local factors within the muscle are more important\u00a0\nfor muscle hypertrophy than any systemic factors. What I mean by this is training sufficiently\u00a0\nto stimulate the full spectrum of muscle fibers\u00a0\u00a0 (which would enable mechanosensitive\u00a0\nproteins within the fibers to detect\u00a0\u00a0 tension and subsequently initiate a signaling\u00a0\ncascade the results in an increase in muscle\u00a0\u00a0 protein synthesis), and then fuelling your\u00a0\nmuscles correctly via sufficient caloric\u00a0\u00a0 and protein intake (depending of course\u00a0\non your goals) is far more important for\u00a0\u00a0 muscle hypertrophy than any transient spike\u00a0\nin systemic anabolic hormone concentrations. As always, thank you for watching.\u00a0\nI truly hope you found the video\u00a0\u00a0 interesting and informative in some way!"

    "transcript": "welcome to the house of hypertrophy are you missing out on more hypertrophy if you're not training muscles based on their fiber type what does training muscles based on their fiber type even mean muscles generally contain slow and fast twitch muscle fibers though there are subtypes of fast twitch fibers and even hybrid fast and slow touch fibers exist for this video we don't need to worry about these based on multiple studies here are the average split of fast and slow twitch muscle fibers various muscles contain quite a few muscles contain a fairly even split of fast and slow switch fibers but the Soleus appears to be overwhelmingly slow twitch whereas some upper body muscles like the pector S major triceps and biceps tend to be slightly more fast twitch training muscles based on their fiber type suggest that muscles with more slow twitch fibers should be trained with lighter loads and higher reps while muscles with more fast switch fibers should be trained with heavier loads with lower reps indeed it's not uncommon for people to speculate the calves are going to be best trains with higher repetitions whereas muscles like the biceps triceps and pectorized major should be trained with heavier loads the rationale behind this is since slow twitch fibers are generally low Force producing butt fatigue resistant higher reps are going to better grow them whereas since far switch fibers are generally High Force producing but very fatigable heavier loads are going to better grow them but is training muscles based on their fiber types supported by the research are you missing out on more hypertrophy if you're not doing this let's find out thank you a 2020 study from New York investigated the Soleus as well as the medial and lateral gastrocnemius collectively these make up the calves we know the Soleus is predominantly slow twitch whereas the medial and lateral gastrocnemius is more so an even split of slow and fast touch fibers although based on the data mentioned previously it may also be considered more slow twitch all 26 untrained men trained the unilateral seated and standing calf raise twice per week for 10 weeks with one leg we'll call this the light load leg subjects trained both exercises with four sets of 20 to 30 repetitions to momentary muscular failure with their other leg we'll call this the high load leg subjects trained both for exercises with 4 sets of 6 to 10 repetitions to momentary muscular failure both legs rested 90 seconds between sets before and after the study thickness of the Soleus as well as the medial and lateral gastrocnemius was measured it was found all three muscles grew similarly with a light and high loads this therefore these results fail to support training muscles based on their fiber type since if this worked we'd expect the Soleus particularly as it's overwhelmingly slow switch to grow more with the light loads but High loads were equally effective as the light loads for developing this muscle the same applies to the medial and lateral gastrocnemius [Music] further indirect evidence opposes the validity of training muscles based on their fiber type recall the biceps triceps and pector S major tent on average to be slightly more fast twitch than slow twitch leading some to suggest heavier loads are needed to optimize their hypertrophy yet a range of studies indicates provided you're performing repetitions to or very close to failure repetitions in the ballpark of between 6 to 35 similarly grow these muscles this is in line with the other research examined previously at the house of hypertrophy finding other muscle groups such as the quads tend to experience similar hypertrophy between 6 to 35 reps when those reps are performed two or very close to failure furthermore the premise behind training muscles based on their fiber type that higher reps a better gross slow switch muscle fibers while heavier loads better grow fast with muscle fibers isn't truly supported by the research either a meta-analysis by gurjit combined the results of 5 studies and found that slow twitch fiber growth is comparable between training with heavy and lighter loads provided reps are performed two or near to failure likewise the analysis found fast twitch fiber growth was comparable between training with heavy and lighter loads provided reps are performed too or near to failure these results make a lot of sense due to henneman's size principle which states muscle fibers are progressively recruited from slow to fast based on the demands placed on the muscle when we're training with heavy loads we readily recruit fastwitch fibers on top of the slow switch fibers with lighter loads far switch fibers are not needed initially but when you continue performing reps with the lighter loads and their failure the recruitment of fast touch muscle fibers occurs in attempt to sustain repetition performance indeed we have data showing when performing reps 2 or very close to failure activation of both slow and fast Edge fibers is comparable between lighter and heavier loads training muscles based on their fiber type suggest muscles with more slow twitch fibers should be trained with higher reps while muscles with more fast switch fibers should be trained with heavier loads however the current research does not support this it appears that provided you're performing reps two or very close to failure reps in the ballpark between 6 to 35 produce similar slow and fast which fiber hypertrophy no it's important to mention all the data presented in this video are the averages from the studies and I think it's likely the results that 6 to 35 reps can produce similar perch if you extend to many people yet there is some new data indicating some people may grow more with a certain rep range versus another for reasons currently unknown it might not be related whatsoever to fiber types this itself deserves its own video as the data is very fascinating but just know if you're having great success with a certain rep range over another that's perfectly fine I'd actually be really interested to hear if anyone watching this has found this to be the case it would be awesome if you let me know in the comment section thank you"

    "title": "Time Under Tension Is OVERRATED...or Is It? (10 studies)",
    "published_at": "2021-05-14T15:32:24Z",
    "transcript": "When it comes to maximizing muscle growth,\nit's far from uncommon to hear that time under tension is an important component. Time under tension refers to the duration\nyou place a muscle under strain. Typically, it's represented as the duration\nof a set for an exercise. For instance, performing 10 reps on the biceps\ncurl with each rep consisting of a 2-second lifting phase and a 2-second lowering phase\nresults in a total time under tension of 40 seconds. It's often claimed a longer time under tension\nmaximizes hypertrophy. It's thought longer durations place the muscle\nunder more strain, resulting in a more powerful stimulus for hypertrophy. For example, numerous sources claim around\n30-60 seconds of time under tension per set is optimal for building muscle. In this video, with help from scientific research,\nwe'll critically assess these claims. Indeed, some evidence indicates a longer time\nunder tension may enhance muscle growth, but the details are important. Usui et al. divided 16 untrained young men\ninto a slow or normal speed group. Both groups trained the back squat to around\n90 degrees of knee flexion for 3 sets of 10 reps with a 50% one-rep max load, three times\nper week for 10 weeks. The slow speed group performed each rep with\na 3-second lowering phase and a 3-second lifting phase. The normal speed group performed each rep\nwith a 1-second lowering phase and a 1-second lifting phase. Thickness of the rectus femoris and vastus\nintermedius was measured at 30, 50, and 70% of the thigh length, while thickness of the\nvastus lateralis and vastus medialis was measured at 50% of the thigh length. The normal speed group experienced virtually\nno growth at all measured areas, while the slow speed group experienced significant increases\nat 70% of the thigh length of the rectus femoris as well as 50 and 70% of the thigh length\nfor the vastus intermedius. Taken at face value, this study indicates\nslower repetition speeds result in greater muscle growth. However, there is a noteworthy limitation\nwith this study. Both groups performed 3 sets of 10 reps with\na 50% one-rep max load on the back squat each session. The slow speed group would have actually been\ntraining closer to failure. Failure is defined as the point at which you\ncannot perform any more repetitions with a given load. This is because, with a given load, slower\nrep speeds mean you perform fewer reps. You can imagine this for yourself. When keeping load and repetition number constant,\nusing slow rep speeds would be more fatiguing compared to faster rep speeds. As a result, we don't know if the greater\nmuscle growth observed for the slow speed group was actually because of the longer time\nunder tension or because they were training closer to failure. As far as I'm aware, there are only two other\nstudies in the research supporting the idea slower repetition tempos produce greater increases\nin measures of muscle growth. But both of these studies share the same limitation\nin that the slower repetition conditions were training closer to failure. Watanabe et al. had a group of untrained men\nperform 3 sets of 8 reps with a 50% one-rep max load on the knee extension and leg curl,\ntwice per week for 12 weeks. A slow speed group performed each exercise\nwith a 3-second lowering and 3-second lifting phase, while a normal speed group used a 1-second\nlowering and 1-second lifting phase. Increases in quadriceps and hamstring thickness\nwere significantly greater for the slow speed group. However, all subjects trained with 3 sets\nof 8 reps with a 50% one-rep max load. Consequently, the slow speed group was training\ncloser to failure. A second study by Watanabe et al. had untrained\nmen train the knee extension for 3 sets of 12 reps with a 30% one-rep max load, twice\nper week for 12 weeks. A slow speed group performed the exercise\nwith a 3-second lowering and 3-second lifting phase, while a normal speed group used a 1-second\nlowering and 1-second lifting phase. Increases in quadriceps cross-sectional area\nfavored the slow speed group. Both groups trained with 3 sets of 12 reps\nwith a 30% one-rep max load, again meaning the slow speed group would have been training\ncloser to failure. Collectively, although in these three studies,\nthe slow speed groups experienced greater muscle growth, we cannot be certain the greater\ngrowth was because they trained with a longer time under tension or because they trained\ncloser to failure. The only way we can know is to look at studies\nthat not only had groups use different repetition speeds, but also had subjects perform their\nrepetitions to failure. Let us evaluate a recent study by Lacerda\net al., which I believe to be the best study to date exploring if a longer time under tension\nenhances muscle growth. 10 untrained men had one leg assigned to a\n2-second condition, and their other leg assigned to a 6-second condition. Both legs trained the unilateral knee extension\nfor 3-4 sets to failure with a 50-60% one-rep max load, 2-3 times per week for 14 weeks. The leg assigned to the 2-second condition\nperformed the exercise with a 1-second lifting phase and a 1-second lowering phase. The 6-second condition leg performed the exercise\nwith a 3-second lifting phase and a 3-second lowering phase. I should emphasize again that both conditions\ninvolved performing repetitions to failure with their respective repetition speed. On average, the 6-second condition involved\na time under tension of between 37 to 52 seconds, whereas the 2-second condition involved a\ntime under tension between 25 and 38 seconds, so some of their sets were performed under\nthe 30-second threshold which numerous sources recommend. However, both conditions produced similar\nincreases in rectus femoris and vastus lateralis cross-sectional area. Therefore, when repetitions are performed\nto failure, a longer time under tension does not appear to enhance muscle growth. Another recent study by Chavez et al. supports\nthese findings. Untrained men performed the unilateral knee\nextension for 3 sets to failure with a 70% one-rep max, twice per week for 8 weeks. Some subjects trained one leg with a 2-second\nlifting and 2-second lowering phase, called the 4-second condition, and their other leg\nwith a self-selected repetition speed. On average, subjects performed a 0.9-second\nlifting and 0.9-second lowering phase with this leg. Again, I should emphasize both conditions\ninvolved performing repetitions to failure. However, increases in vastus lateralis cross-sectional\narea were similar between both conditions. Now, these are not the only two studies assessing\nthe impacts of different time under tension durations on direct measures of muscle growth\nwhen subjects carry out their repetitions to failure. A meta-analysis by Schoenfeld et al. sums\nup the other studies. For those unaware, meta-analyses are studies\nthat combine the results of numerous individual studies looking at the same topic. Combining the results of 4 studies, increases\nin measures of muscle growth were similar between fast and medium repetition speeds. In this analysis, fast rep speeds were classified\nat repetitions that lasted between 0.5 to 4 seconds, whereas medium rep speeds were\nrepetitions that lasted between 4 and 8 seconds. Therefore, this analysis indicates that provided\nrepetitions are performed to failure, there is no difference in muscle growth between\nperforming reps with a 0.5-second duration or 8-second duration. Interestingly, there is a study not included\nin this analysis suggesting that super slow rep speeds may actually be inferior for building\nmuscle. Schuenke et al. had untrained women perform\nthe leg press, squat, and knee extension for 3 sets, 2-3 times per week for 6 weeks. Some subjects performed each exercise to failure\nwith a 1-2 second lifting phase and a 1-2 second lower phase using an 80-85% one-rep\nmax load. This was the traditional strength group. Other subjects performed each exercise to\nfailure with a 10-second lifting phase and a 4-second lowering phase using a 40-60% one-rep\nmax load. This was the super slow group. Increases in vastus lateralis slow-twitch\nand fast-twitch fiber cross-sectional area were significantly greater for the traditional\nstrength group compared to the super slow group. Now, this is only one study, so I believe\nwe cannot be truly confident repetition tempos longer than 10 seconds are suboptimal. More research is needed. So, when overviewing the current evidence,\nit appears repetition durations lasting from 0.5 seconds up to 8 seconds produce comparable\nmuscle growth, opposing the notion a longer time under tension enhances growth. Now, all of these studies were conducted on\nuntrained subjects. That includes the 4 studies in the Schoenfeld\net al. meta-analysis. One might argue that in trained individuals,\na longer time under tension would enhance muscle growth. To my knowledge, there aren't any papers with\ntrained subjects in this area unfortunately. However, physiologically, I believe it seems\nunlikely a longer time under tension would enhance muscle growth, provided repetitions\nare performed to or very close to failure. I say this because, irrespective of repetition\nspeed, mechanical tension would likely be adequately high provided repetitions are carried\nout near failure. Mechanical tension is currently the best-categorized\nmechanism of muscle growth. Mechanical tension is equal to the force produced\nby a muscle. One key component of how much force a muscle\nproduces is the number of muscle fibers recruited. In a very general sense, muscles consist of\nslow-twitch fibers and fast-twitch fibers. Slow-twitch fibers are highly resistant to\nfatigue but produce low amounts of power, whereas fast-twitch fibers are less fatigue\nresistant but produce high amounts of power. Generally, when force requirements are low,\nslow-twitch muscle fibers are recruited, but as force requirements increase, faster-twitch\nmuscle fibers are recruited. High levels of muscle fiber recruitment, so\nhigh levels of slow-twitch and fast-twitch fiber recruitment, is one important component\nfor inducing muscle growth. Regardless of time under tension, performing\nrepetitions to or very close to failure likely results in sufficiently high levels of muscle\nfiber recruitment. A study by Morton et al. demonstrates this. A group of men with at least 2 years of training\nexperience performed the leg extension for 3 sets with 4 different conditions. One condition involved performing repetitions\nto failure with an 80% one-rep load using a 1-second lifting, 1-second pause, and 1-second\nlowering phase. On average, the time under tension for this\ncondition was 26 seconds per set. The second condition involved performing repetitions\nto failure with an 80% one-rep max load too, but using a 3-second lifting, 1-second pause,\nand 3-second lowering phase. On average, the time under tension for this\ncondition was 31 seconds per set. The third condition involved performing repetitions\nto failure with a 30% one-rep max load using a 1-second lifting, 1-second pause, and 1-second\nlowering phase. On average, the time under tension for this\ncondition was 54 seconds per set. The fourth condition involved performing repetitions\nto failure with a 30% one-rep max load using a 3-second lifting, 1-second pause, and 3-second\nlowering phase. On average, the time under tension for this\ncondition was 76 seconds per set. The researchers found that all four conditions\nresulted in similar recruitment of slow-twitch and fast-twitch fibers from the vastus lateralis. Note, recruitment was measured via glycogen\ndepletion of the fibers. Put differently, regardless of load or repetition\nspeed, overall muscle fiber recruitment was likely similar. This supports the idea that provided repetitions\nare carried out near to failure, mechanical tension is likely sufficiently high regardless\nof the repetition tempo used. The research on rep ranges provides further\nevidence that a longer time under tension does enhance muscle growth. Two meta-analyses indicate that reps between\n5 and 35 produce similar muscle growth, again, provided those reps are performed to or very\nclose to failure. This includes research done on trained subjects. For instance, Morton et al. found that in\nmen with at least 2 years of training experience, there was no difference in vastus lateralis\nfast-twitch and slow-twitch fiber growth after training the leg press and knee extension\nwith either 8-12 reps to failure or 20-25 reps to failure. Of course, performing 20-25 reps means you\nexperience a longer time under tension versus performing 8-12 reps, yet this did not matter. Finally, I should mention that theoretically,\nthere may be a minimal time under tension threshold per set required for optimal hypertrophy. For instance, we've detailed in a previous\nvideo that one-rep max training does not produce muscle growth. Therefore, accumulating some reps and consequently\nsome time under tension is likely needed to elicit optimal adaptations. As we've mentioned already, reps between 5\nand 35 are likely similarly effective for muscle growth, when reps are carried out to\nor near failure. Therefore, the time under tension accumulated\nwith 5 normal speed reps may be the minimal time under the tension threshold per set. Although, as we've discussed in a previous\nvideo, reps as low as 3 could build muscle effectively, so the threshold could be even\nlower. Ultimately, it would be interesting to see\nmore research evaluating the minimal time under tension threshold for muscle growth per set. In conclusion, I believe there is sufficient\nevidence to suggest that a longer time under tension does not enhance muscle growth. Furthermore, the numerous recommendations\nthat sets should last from 30-60 seconds are not substantiated. However, this should not be misinterpreted\nto say that using a longer time under tension is useless. Slowing your repetition speeds could be a\nway of applying progressive overload. For instance, in one session you may perform\n3 sets of 8 reps with 20kg on an exercise using a 2-second lifting and 2-second lowering\nphase. Next session, you may use the same load, reps,\nand sets but use a 3-second lifting and 3-second lowering phase. Additionally, using a variety of repetition\nspeeds in your training program could potentially be one effective way of ensuring more balanced\ngrowth across a muscle, as there is some evidence that different repetition tempos produce different\nregional muscle growth. We've covered the research on this in a previous\nvideo."

    "published_at": "2022-10-31T12:00:07Z",
    "transcript": "[Music] welcome to the house of hypertrophy how crucial is the length you supply tension to a muscle does hypertrophy notably differ between training a muscle in a more shortened or stretched position if so does this apply to all muscles let's dissect what the scientific literature suggests parting with the quadriceps does this muscle grow more with exercises achieving a stretch a 2014 UK study compared leg extension training with a partial range of motion at a shortened muscle length to one at a stretched muscle length and vastus lateralis growth across three regions was greater when training at a stretched muscle length the differences were particularly notable at the 50 and especially 75 regions another 2014 study by the same researchers compared leg extensions with a partial at short length to a full range of motion that would have achieved a stretch vastus lateralis gains were overall better with a full range of motion where the differences being very large at the 75 region a 2013 Denmark study compared squatting at shortened muscle links to training a larger range of motion that stretched the quads and thigh growth across all measured regions was more pronounced with a larger range of motion like the two previous studies the differences again were more striking in the lower regions of the muscle a 2019 Japanese paper interestingly compared a partial range of motion to a full range of motion Squad and quadriceps gains were similar between both the partial range of motion was done to 90 degrees of new flexion and this still achieves a stretch of the quads so maybe the stretch attained with 90 degrees of knee flexion is sufficient for Quad growth further stretch isn't beneficial or any worse but this is purely speculation from a single Paper more research would be needed to verify this idea in any event it is clear to see stretch either through a large range of motion or a partial range of motion in the stretched positions provokes prominently greater hypertrophy particularly at the lower quadriceps regions a fascinating question is how does a large range of motion compare to a partial range of motion at striped positions for quadriceps development a 2021 Brazil study examined this matter of fact they compared virtually all kinds of range of motions a full range of motion a partial one at stretched positions a partial one at shortened positions and a combination of partial at stretched and shortened positions rectus femoris and vastus lateralis growth was overall period with a partial range of motion at stretched positions versus all other conditions the differences were particularly discernible at the lower regions of the muscle thus perhaps partials at stretched positions could be better for chord development versus a full range of motion yet it's worth remembering this is merely one study and only the leg extension was utilized hopefully future research further Compares stretched partials and a full range of motion you could experiment with stretch partials if you wish anyhow it's clear you'd want to select exercises that stretch the chords and ensure you use some kind of range of motion that attains that stretch I've patched the clues and the doctors together as there's only one paper technically exploring how stretch influences their hypertrophy this paper is the aforementioned 2019 one from Japan which compared a partial to a full range of motion squat the full squats would have stretched the glute Max and the doctors more and both these muscles grew strikingly more with this versus the partial range of motion there actually is another 2020 Brazilian study technically examining stretch on the glutes they compared full range of motion squats to hip thrusts full range of motion squats would Supply tension to the glutes while stretched while hip thrust Supply tension while shortened it was supposedly found glute Max hypertrophy was markedly more wither squads yet a major problem is this specific group of researchers has had the validity of their data questioned a lot of their work seems to be improbable so I don't believe we can sincerely trust the authenticity of these results it would be neat to have future data comparing squats to hip thrust full group development at any rate that Japanese paper is still Fair evidence with squatting variations at least deeper ranges of motion that stretch the glutes and adductors more notably induces greater hypertrophy [Music] evaluating the hamstrings except for the biceps from aura's short head which is a one joint muscle that only crosses the knee joint all the other heads of the hamstrings are too jointed since they cross both the knee and hip joints due to this structural Point seated curls are going to stretch all two jointed hamstring muscles more than lying their curls even if the range of motion is the same between them a 2021 Japanese paper established that when comparing these two movements hypertrophy of all the two joint hamstring muscles were Superior with seated lechos while biceps for more a short head hypertosphere were similar between both seated and line cores the researchers also nicely assessed regional growth of the biceps femoris long head and semitendinosis and growth at the upper and lower regions of these muscles was also Superior with the seated Liquors there's no other direct research on the hamstrings but I think given this study indicates the hamstrings May benefit from stretch performing deadlift variations with minimal reflection which permits greater hamstring stretch May better develop the hamstrings for example a speculate stiff-legged deadlifts May produce greater hamstrings hypertrophy compared to Conventional deadlifts given the former commonly involved lower knee flexion and thus greater hamstring stretch [Music] evaluating the biceps a 2012 Brazil study compared partial to full range of motion preacher curls and found biceps thickness gains tended to favor the full range of motion but the differences between groups was not statistically significant suggesting the difference could be due to random chance yet I think the difference could be due to a real effect as if the biceps didn't respond more favorably to stretch we'd expect a partial range of motion at Short lengths on the preacher curl to be similar to a partial at stretched positions but a 2021 Japanese paper made this comparison and observed overall greater biceps Regional gains with stretched positions the difference was particularly striking at the 70 region now there is another 2021 Brazil paper some used to suggest that biceps do not respond more to stretch these researchers compared barbell preacher curls the cable preacher curls with the same range of motion and observe similar biceps thickness gains barbell preacher course would stress the biceps at a more stretched position versus cable curls so one may suggest if the biceps responded to stretch more the barbell preacher curl should have elicited more gains yet I think it's worth noting cable preacher curls still plays some tension on the biceps at a stretched position and perhaps even more importantly biceps thickness was only measured at the halfway region of the muscle given we've gone through data indicating stretch can be very potent for growing the lower regions of a muscle including the study just overviewed before this perhaps gains in such regions would have favored barbell over cable preacher curls a 2019 Japanese paper may suggest the triceps do not grow more with more stretch they compared Skull Crushers performed with a partial range of motion to a full range of motion and triceps growth at one region favored the partial range of motion yet the partial U still fairly stretched the triceps so this study does not precisely suggest the triceps don't benefit from a stretch it's just further range of motion on the skull crusher didn't confer added benefit it's currently unknown mechanistically why this partial was superior to the full range of motion in this paper nevertheless we have other research suggesting the triceps particularly the long head May grow more from stretch the medial and lateral heads only cross the elbow joint but the long head crosses the shoulder joint plus the elbow joint and is resultantly stretched when placed overhead if the long head grew more with stretch overhead triceps extension should develop this muscle more than push Downs a 2018 Greek study found this long head thickness gains at two regions tended to favor overhead extensions versus push Downs now the difference in this study was not statistically significant but I think this study was underpowered it only had nine subjects I confidently speculate this as another 2022 Japan paper did observe significantly greater long head growth after training with overhead extensions versus push Downs fascinatingly this Japanese paper also found that bind the lateral and medial head growth was also Superior with the overhead extensions versus push Downs no I've seen some people on the internet simply disregard this paper as there's currently no explanation for the great immediate and lateral head growth with overhead extensions since these muscles are not stretched anymore in the overhead position but I think we can all agree just because we can't explain something it does not mean it did not happen there could be other mechanisms in play with simply not currently aware of it's also worth noting this particular Japanese study was very well designed it was a within subject design meaning subjects trained one arm with overhead extensions and their other arm with push Downs thereby removing confounders such as nutrition genetics and outside lifestyle [Music] crystallizing things thus far we have scientific support the quads glutes adductors hamstrings biceps and triceps May indeed all experience more pronounced gains across numerous regions with stretch unfortunately no research has explored the effectiveness of stretched-based exercises on the back shoulder calves ABS or chest muscles hopefully future research will change this with the chest though some very indirect data might suggest it benefits from stretch a 2022 Spain study involved training the Smith machine bench press with either a full range of motion two-third top range emotion or one-third top range of motion strength increases on all three bench press ranges of motion were Superior after training the full range of motion these findings partly oppose the principle of specificity which states you get the best adaptations on what you train so we'd expect training the two-third top range of motion to produce the best strength with this range and training with a one-third top range of motion to produce the best strength with this range of motion but neither of these two events happened full range of motion training produced Superior strength on both these could muscle growth explain these results one reason for the principle of specificity is simply that what you train frequently allows you to develop better skill and coordination on that movement thereby leading to more strength yet a Smith machine was used in this study and this lowers if not removes any skill component to the movement thus the role of muscle growth by way of increasing the number of force generating units may play more of a factor in promoting strength with Smith machine exercises so perhaps the full range of motion group saw the most muscle growth potentially due to the greater chest stretch thus explaining the greatest strength gains on all bench press ranges of motions [Music] numerous muscles grow notably more across their regions with stretch so it's worthwhile selecting exercises and range of motions that attain stretch in your training one could experiment with a partial range of motion in stretched positions if they like it's clear to see this can build significant muscle and that there's a crystal clear difference between a partial and shortened positions and one in stretched positions I'm currently not comfortable in concluding a partial range of motion in stretched positions is superior to a full range of motion as only one study has explored and found this it would be awesome to see more research examining this with other movements if any new data comes out we of course will be covering this as a House of hypertrophy if you've made it here I have a free ebook you might like The Ultimate Guide to bench pressing for strength and hypertrophy with more than 100 scientific references from technique to training variables to comparisons and other fascinating science we cover it all grab it

    "transcript": "High-intensity training refers to high effort,\u00a0\u00a0 low volume, and lower frequency training.\u00a0\nWe'll cover the precise details shortly. But often, high-intensity training is contrasted\u00a0\nto high volume and perhaps more frequent training,\u00a0\u00a0 the training style many iconic figures\u00a0\nduring the Golden era of bodybuilding,\u00a0\u00a0 such as Arnold, are known to\u00a0\nhave performed and recommended. As Arnold describes in his 80s\u00a0\nEncyclopedia of modern bodybuilding,\u00a0\u00a0 he believed \u201cyou need to do at\u00a0\nleast 5 sets in order have the\u00a0\u00a0 volume of training necessary to fully\u00a0\nstimulate the available muscle fiber.\" In this video, we're going deep\u00a0\ninto high-intensity training to\u00a0\u00a0 figure out if it's truly the\u00a0\noptimal muscle-building way,\u00a0\u00a0 as well as compare it to higher volume\u00a0\nand more frequent training regimes. Numerous different variations of\u00a0\nhigh-intensity training exist,\u00a0\u00a0 and famous bodybuilders such as Mike Mentzer and\u00a0\nDorian Yates were known to train in this style. However, many folks (including Mentzer and Yates)\u00a0\u00a0 credit Arthus Jones for popularising\u00a0\nhigh-intensity training in the 1970s.\u00a0\u00a0 The term \u201chigh-intensity training\" appears\u00a0\nas early as 1973 in an article by Jones.\u00a0\u00a0 Jones\u2019 further writings on the topic can be\u00a0\nfound in his numerous magazine and book writings. Who was Arthus Jones? He founded Nautilus, a company that\u00a0\nmanufactured training machines,\u00a0\u00a0 machines designed to match the\u00a0\nstrength curves of a muscle. Jones was far from the typical\u00a0\nman. He travelled extensively.\u00a0\u00a0 His motto was \"younger women, faster\u00a0\nairplanes, and bigger crocodiles\". A Nautilus building in\u00a0\nFlorida was home to a Gomek,\u00a0\u00a0 an 18-foot saltwater crocodile\u00a0\nJones wanted to grow to record size. He ran businesses that imported wild animals and\u00a0\u00a0 is believed to have owned a zoo in\u00a0\nLouisana after the 2nd world war. We noted many variations of\u00a0\nhigh-intensity training exist.\u00a0\u00a0 But 3 common themes are consistent\u00a0\nthroughout all variations. The first is the emphasis on training\u00a0\nto failure and sometimes even beyond. Arthus Jones instructed in\u00a0\nhis Nautilus Bulletin books,\u00a0\u00a0 \"a set is properly finished only when\u00a0\nadditional movement is utterly impossible,\u00a0\u00a0 curl until you can't even begin to bend your\u00a0\narms, squat until you can't start up from\u00a0\u00a0 the low position, press until you cannot move\u00a0\nthe bar away from your shoulders and chest\". Mike Mentzer's stated in his book \"working to this\u00a0\npoint of failure, when another rep is impossible\u00a0\u00a0 despite the greatest effort, ensures you pass\u00a0\nthrough the break-over point, a point in the\u00a0\u00a0 set below which growth cannot be stimulated,\u00a0\nand above which growth will be stimulated\". The second common theme is performing a low number\u00a0\nof sets per exercise, typically only one set. In another Arthus Jones' book, he says \"how\u00a0\nmany sets of the exercise? one. Additional\u00a0\u00a0 sets usually serve no purpose and may produce\u00a0\na state of overtraining with some subjects\". A quote by Dorian Yates reads \"One set at\u00a0\nextreme intensity does the muscle-building job\". The third main common theme is\u00a0\nthe low frequency of training. Arthur Jones initially advocated for three\u00a0\nfull-body weekly workouts, but later amended to\u00a0\u00a0 training each muscle only once or at most twice\u00a0\nper week, he states \"how many weekly workouts,\u00a0\u00a0 not more than two, and some people will produce\u00a0\nbetter results from only one weekly workout.\u00a0\u00a0 More is not always better, and in the\u00a0\ncase of exercise is usually worse\". Mike Mentzer echoed this, recommending 96-120\u00a0\nhours of rest between training sessions.\u00a0\u00a0 In fact, Mentzer also states in his book he had a\u00a0\u00a0 number of personal clients who\u00a0\ntrained once every 10-14 days. All three themes are closely connected. High-intensity advocates suggest when\u00a0\ntraining with true maximal effort\u00a0\u00a0 (as you do when training failure), you can\u00a0\nonly perform so much volume (hence the one\u00a0\u00a0 set recommendations), and only so frequently\u00a0\ntoo (hence the low-frequency recommendations. As Arthus Jones describes \u201cThe secret, if\u00a0\nthere is one, is high-intensity. And when\u00a0\u00a0 you actually train with high-intensity,\u00a0\nyou don\u2019t need a lot of volume.\u201d Likewise, Mike Mentzer states \u201cIf you\u2019re\u00a0\nskeptical [of Heavy Duty\u2019s low volume],\u00a0\u00a0 your subconscious child is telling you\u00a0\nthat more is better. In some cases,\u00a0\u00a0 that\u2019s true. More money is better than\u00a0\nless. But you can\u2019t take that principle\u00a0\u00a0 and blindly apply it to exercise and\u00a0\nexpect to get anything out of it.\u201d Heavy duty was the name of Mike\u00a0\nMentzer's high-intensity training style. Now we have a good understanding\u00a0\nof what high-intensity training is,\u00a0\u00a0 is this method of training truly superior\u00a0\nfor muscle hypertrophy and strength? A few stories exist of individuals allegedly\u00a0\ngaining an incredible amount of muscle mass with\u00a0\u00a0 high-intensity training in a short time, with the\u00a0\nColorado experiment being the most fascinating. 63 lbs of muscle in 28 days\u00a0\nthrough high-intensity training?\u00a0\u00a0 Allegedly the infamous\u00a0\nColorado experiment found this. The experiment took place in 1973,\u00a0\nat the Colorado State University\u00a0\u00a0 under the supervision of Dr. Elliot Plese. In this experiment, Casey Viator\u00a0\n(a successful bodybuilder,\u00a0\u00a0 who was actually the youngest ever AAU\u00a0\nMr. America winner at the age of 19)\u00a0\u00a0 trained high-intensity style for 28 days,\u00a0\nwhile Arthus Jones himself trained for 22 days. The program is believed to look like this,\u00a0\nat least something along these lines. One set was performed to failure in the\u00a0\nprescribed rep ranges, and all exercises\u00a0\u00a0 were performed with no rest between them. All\u00a0\nexercises were performed on Nautilus machines too. The findings were published in the\u00a0\nSeptember ironman magazine in 1973. Viator gained 63.21lbs of muscle\u00a0\nand Arthu 15.44lbs of muscle. Incredible results, but are\u00a0\nthey too good to be true? Likely, I\u2019d argue yes. In the 4 months before this experiment, Casey\u00a0\nViator was believed to not have trained at all,\u00a0\u00a0 as he was recovering from\u00a0\na serious accident at work. Similarly, Jones was believed to not have trained\u00a0\nin the 4 months preceding the Colorado experiment,\u00a0\u00a0 yet he had training experience in the past and\u00a0\u00a0 at one point was believed to\u00a0\nhave been a muscular 205lbs. As a result, muscle memory (the phenomenon\u00a0\nwhere your body can quickly rebuild lost muscle)\u00a0\u00a0 is certainly confounding this experiment. Aside from this, Casey at least was clearly\u00a0\na gifted individual for putting on mass,\u00a0\u00a0 so genetics are a consideration,\u00a0\nsomething Arthus Jones did make clear. I think the use of anabolics\u00a0\ncannot be ruled either. Now, Arthus Jones was opposed to anabolics,\u00a0\nsomething he expressed many times in his writings. In a report on the Colorado experiment,\u00a0\nJones is reported to have said\u00a0\u00a0 \"the use of so-called growth drugs\u00a0\nis neither necessary nor desirable.\" Moreover, in a T-nation article by Ellington\u00a0\nDarden, someone who worked with Arthus Jones,\u00a0\u00a0 it\u2019s reported Jones hired someone to shadow\u00a0\nCasey to ensure no anabolics were used. Despite all this, I still think it\u2019s impossible\u00a0\nto rule out the possibility of anabolics,\u00a0\u00a0 even if Casey did not use during the 28 days,\u00a0\nprior use can presumably still influence things. Aside from the Colorado experiment,\u00a0\nEllington Darden also put forth other\u00a0\u00a0 accounts of individuals gaining abnormal amounts\u00a0\u00a0 of muscle mass with high-intensity\u00a0\ntraining in the T-nation article. Furthermore, I also came across\u00a0\nan article by Tim Ferris,\u00a0\u00a0 the author of the popular 4-hour work\u00a0\nweek, describing how he used Arthur\u00a0\u00a0 Jones's high-intensity style training\u00a0\nto put on 34lbs of muscle in 4 weeks. So what are we to make of all these accounts? Do they prove high-intensity training is\u00a0\nthe ultimate muscle hypertrophy system? In my view, no. As alluded to, many plausible confounders exist.\u00a0\nThe anecdotal data are also difficult to verify,\u00a0\u00a0 and none of these experiments\u00a0\nCOMPARE how high-intensity\u00a0\u00a0 training differs from other training methods. Something that does compare how different\u00a0\ntraining methods compare is experimental research. With each of the three themes\u00a0\nof high-intensity training,\u00a0\u00a0 we can examine what the experimental\u00a0\nresearch says about them. In my opinion, this is a much better way to\u00a0\nevaluate the efficacy of high-intensity training. We noted training to failure is one theme\u00a0\nin all high-intensity training protocols.\u00a0\u00a0 Recall Jones' and Mentzer's statements. But is training to failure truly needed\u00a0\nto maximize hypertrophy and strength? Starting with hypertrophy, in 2021,\u00a0\u00a0 Grgic et al. conducted a meta-analysis\u00a0\nof all the available evidence. For the unaware, a meta-analysis statistically\u00a0\ncombines all the current evidence on a topic,\u00a0\u00a0 thus increasing statistical power\u00a0\nand reliability when done well. Based on 7 studies (collectively\u00a0\ncomprising 130 men and 89 women),\u00a0\u00a0 there was no difference in muscle growth between\u00a0\ntraining to failure and not training to failure. After independently assessing the involved\u00a0\nstudies, most had the non-failure training\u00a0\u00a0 groups leave 3 to 0 repetitions in reserve (that\u00a0\nis, they stopped 3 to 0 reps away from failure),\u00a0\u00a0 thus it seems training with this\u00a0\nis similar to training to failure. Having said this, a subgroup analysis of\u00a0\nstudies done on trained individuals only\u00a0\u00a0 did find training to failure to be\u00a0\nbetter than not training to failure. However, a major limitation is only 2 studies\u00a0\nwere involved in this subgroup analysis, and both\u00a0\u00a0 of these may not necessarily suggest training to\u00a0\nfailure in trained individuals is truly superior. In the one study by Karsten et al.,\u00a0\nthey found leaving 5 reps in reserve\u00a0\u00a0 was inferior to training to failure,\u00a0\nthus this study only suggests training\u00a0\u00a0 to failure may be better than leaving 5 reps\u00a0\nin reserve. It does not tell us how leaving\u00a0\u00a0 3 to 0 reps in reserve could compare\u00a0\nto failure training in trained folks. The other study included in the subgroup\u00a0\nanalysis was by Pareja-Blanco et al.,\u00a0\u00a0 and it found failure training was better for\u00a0\noverall hypertrophy versus non-failure training.\u00a0\u00a0 However, this was a velocity-based study,\u00a0\nthey had subjects terminate their sets once\u00a0\u00a0 their lifting velocity decreased by a certain\u00a0\npercentage, so it\u2019s difficult to know what reps\u00a0\u00a0 in reserve the non-failure training group used.\u00a0\nBut based on some data provided, it seems the\u00a0\u00a0 non-failure group may have been training with\u00a0\n5 or more reps in reserve. For example, this\u00a0\u00a0 group seemed to perform only around 5 reps with\u00a0\na 70% one-rep max load, fairly far from failure. Thus, again, this study does not inform us of how\u00a0\u00a0 leaving 3 to 0 reps in reserve\u00a0\nmay compare to failure training. Fortunately, since this analysis by Grgic et al.\u00a0\nin 2021, a study by Santanielo et al. has emerged. These researchers ultimately established\u00a0\u00a0 in men with an average of 5.1\u00a0\nyears of training experience,\u00a0\u00a0 leaving mainly 3 to 0 repetitions in reserve was\u00a0\nsimilar to training to failure for hypertrophy. Thus, trained folks may also experience optimal\u00a0\u00a0 gains while stopping 3 to\u00a0\n0 reps away from failure. Mechanistically, I'd argue\u00a0\nthese findings make sense. When we think about what causes muscle\u00a0\ngrowth, training to failure probably does\u00a0\u00a0 not provide any more benefit than\u00a0\nstopping 3 to 0 reps from failure. Allow me to explain. Back in 2010, Brad Schoenfeld published a famous\u00a0\npaper postulating that mechanical tension,\u00a0\u00a0 muscle damage, and metabolic stress\u00a0\nare all drivers of muscle hypertrophy. Fast forward to 2019, Brad\u00a0\nSchoenfeld teamed up with\u00a0\u00a0 Wackerhage and others to create an updated paper. They detail how the evidence behind metabolic\u00a0\nstress and muscle damage being drivers of\u00a0\u00a0 hypertrophy is not clear cut. Many cases exist\u00a0\nwhere more metabolic stress or more muscle damage\u00a0\u00a0 are not associated with more hypertrophy. Conversely, the evidence seems to\u00a0\ndemonstrate mechanical tension as\u00a0\u00a0 the most likely and potent hypertrophy stimulus. In other words, we have solid\u00a0\nreasons to believe mechanical\u00a0\u00a0 tension is the primary driver of hypertrophy. And when we understand what precisely mechanical\u00a0\ntension is, there's evidence training to failure\u00a0\u00a0 does not produce higher levels versus\u00a0\nstopping 3 to 0 reps shy of failure. Let's dive into this a little further. Mechanical tension is equal to the\u00a0\nforce generated by muscle fibers.\n\u00a0 Components within muscle\u00a0\nfibers, called mechanosensors,\u00a0\u00a0 detect forces produced by the muscle fiber and\u00a0\ntransduces these forces into a signaling cascade\u00a0\u00a0 that results in muscle protein synthesis (which\u00a0\nare the proteins that make our muscles bigger). The concept of motor units helps us\u00a0\nunderstand overall mechanical tension further. A motor unit refers to a single motor neuron\u00a0\n(that originates from the spine) and the\u00a0\u00a0 multiple muscle fibers it innervates.\u00a0\nWhen the single motor neuron sends an\u00a0\u00a0 electrical signal through to the muscle fibers\u00a0\nit innervates, those muscle fibers produce force. Within a whole muscle,\u00a0\ndifferent motor units exist,\u00a0\u00a0 and their characteristics lie across a spectrum. On one end are low threshold motor units, and\u00a0\non the other end are high threshold motor units. Typically, a low-threshold motor unit consists of\u00a0\na small motor neuron that innervates slow-twitch\u00a0\u00a0 muscle fibers that produce low amounts of force\u00a0\nbut are highly fatigue resistant. Due to this,\u00a0\u00a0 low-threshold motor units are described as\u00a0\nhighly fatigue resistant but low force-producing. A high-threshold motor unit generally consists of\u00a0\na large motor neuron that innervates fast-twitch\u00a0\u00a0 muscle fibers that produce high amounts of\u00a0\nforce but are highly fatigable. Therefore,\u00a0\u00a0 high-threshold motor units are described\u00a0\nas high-force producing but very fatigable. For maximizing overall mechanical tension (and\u00a0\nthus the stimulus for overall muscle growth),\u00a0\u00a0 we\u2019d want to recruit as many motor\u00a0\nunits as possible during an exercise\u00a0\u00a0 (from the low-threshold motor units all the\u00a0\nway up to the high-threshold motor units). We'd also want each of the motor units\u00a0\nto be producing decent amounts of their\u00a0\u00a0 respective force capacities for a fair duration. Here\u2019s the main points: Firstly, It\u2019s not clear when you\u00a0\nreach maximal motor unit recruitment,\u00a0\u00a0 and the motor unit literature indicates\u00a0\nthis can differ between muscles. However, the literature indicates this is\u00a0\nlikely achieved a while before failure. For instance, one study suggests maximal\u00a0\nmotor unit recruitment for the shoulder\u00a0\u00a0 and trap muscles may be obtained\u00a0\n3-5 repetitions before failure. Secondly, by the time you\u2019ve reached failure,\u00a0\u00a0 many motor units are likley past-producing\u00a0\ntheir highest forces and are just fatiguing. Remember, it\u2019s tension (analogous to force)\u00a0\u00a0 that\u2019s categorized as a prime stimulus for muscle\u00a0\nhypertrophy. The idea that more motor unit fatigue\u00a0\u00a0 is beneficial for muscle hypertrophy is\u00a0\nnot supported by the current literature. A motor unit modeling study by Potvin and\u00a0\nFuglevand demonstrates our points nicely. Their model included 7 different motor\u00a0\nunits, ordered in terms of thresholds. Motor unit 1 was the lowest threshold motor unit,\u00a0\u00a0 while motor unit 120 was the\u00a0\nhighest threshold motor unit. The graph on-screen depicts the\u00a0\ncontribution of each motor unit to a 50%\u00a0\u00a0 maximal isometric contraction held until failure.\u00a0\nThe total contraction lasted 100 seconds. Except for motor unit 120,\u00a0\nall of the other motor units\u00a0\u00a0 were recruited from the start of the contraction. Motor units 1, 20, 40, and 60 produced steady low\u00a0\nforces throughout the full contraction duration.\u00a0\u00a0 This makes sense, these would be\u00a0\nconsidered the low-threshold motor units\u00a0\u00a0 (which produce low forces but\u00a0\nare highly fatigue resistant). Motor unit 80, a higher-threshold motor\u00a0\nunit, produced its most force for the\u00a0\u00a0 set at the start of the contraction,\u00a0\nwhere it thereafter gradually fatigued. Motor unit 100, a higher-threshold motor\u00a0\nunit, continued to increase its force\u00a0\u00a0 contribution up until the 65-second\u00a0\nmark, and thereafter began to fatigue. Motor unit 120, the highest-threshold motor unit,\u00a0\u00a0 was recruited at the 70-ish second\u00a0\nmark, and steeply increased its force\u00a0\u00a0 contribution up until the 95-ish second\u00a0\nmark, where it then steeply fatigued. This data demonstrates motor unit recruitment,\u00a0\nas well as the maintenance of at least\u00a0\u00a0 decent amounts of force production\u00a0\nfrom the individual motor units,\u00a0\u00a0 is achieved before failure.\u00a0\nAt the point of failure,\u00a0\u00a0 no additional motor units nor enhancements\u00a0\nin individual motor units force occurred. This probably explains why\u00a0\nleaving 3 to 0 repetitions\u00a0\u00a0 in reserve is sufficient for muscle growth. I should restate this data was from\u00a0\nmodeling isometric contractions. Recruitment patterns and strategies\u00a0\nlikely differ between isometric and\u00a0\u00a0 the isotonic contractions that\u00a0\noccur during typical exercises. Yet, I\u2019m unaware of any reason to\u00a0\nbelieve the main points (that failure\u00a0\u00a0 offers no additional motor unit recruitment or\u00a0\nenhancements in individual motor units force)\u00a0\u00a0 would not also be the same\u00a0\nwith isotonic contractions. Moving on, is training to failure\u00a0\nneeded to max strength gains? The Grgic et al. meta-analysis found based\u00a0\non 15 studies (collectively comprising 265\u00a0\u00a0 men and 129 women), there was no difference in\u00a0\ngains between failure and non-failure training. A subgroup analysis also found the results\u00a0\nstayed true for trained individuals. After independently assessing\u00a0\nthe studies, most of them\u00a0\u00a0 seem to have had subjects leave between 5\u00a0\nto 0 repetitions in reserve. So training\u00a0\u00a0 with 5-0 reps in reserve may be similar to\u00a0\nfailure training for producing strength gains. Making this section clear, training\u00a0\nto failure does not seem to promote\u00a0\u00a0 additional hypertrophy or strength adaptations. Recall that high-intensity folks advocate low\u00a0\nvolumes, typically only one set per exercise. Does the literature support this recommendation? In 2017, a meta-analysis by Schoenfeld et\u00a0\u00a0 al. combined the results of 15 studies\u00a0\ncomparing low to high volume training. Of the 15 studies, 14 had the low volume\u00a0\ngroups train with 1 set per exercise,\u00a0\u00a0 while the high volume groups\u00a0\ntrained with 3 sets per exercise. It was found high volume was better than\u00a0\nlow volume for increasing muscle mass. Since 2017, three additional studies\u00a0\npublished also indicate performing\u00a0\u00a0 3 sets per exercise produces more\u00a0\nmuscle growth than performing 1 set. Why is this? It seems the higher volume attained with 3 sets\u00a0\u00a0 ultimately stimulates the anabolic\u00a0\npathways within muscle fibers more. Demonstrating this, a 2010 study\u00a0\nby Burd et al. compared fed-state\u00a0\u00a0 myofibrillar protein synthesis\u00a0\nafter training with either 3\u00a0\u00a0 or 1 set of reps to failure on the leg\u00a0\nextension with a 70% one-rep max load. Performing 3 sets resulted not only in\u00a0\na greater fed-state myofibrillar protein\u00a0\u00a0 synthesis amplitude but also a longer\u00a0\nduration versus performing the 1 set. What about strength adaptations, how do\u00a0\nlow and high volumes compare for this? For this, we have a 2017\u00a0\nmeta-analysis by Ralston et al. They combined 9 studies comparing\u00a0\nlow vs high volumes for strength.\u00a0\u00a0 7 of the 9 studies had the low volume\u00a0\ngroups train only one set per exercise,\u00a0\u00a0 and the high volume groups\u00a0\ntrain with 3 sets per exercise. It was found strength gains were\u00a0\ngreater with the high volumes,\u00a0\u00a0 indicating that 3 sets per exercise\u00a0\nproduce greater strength than 1 set. So overall, the current literature indicates\u00a0\u00a0 that 1 set per exercise does not\u00a0\nmaximize size or strength gains. Another point mentioned by some high-intensity\u00a0\nfolks is that sets should never be added. Arthus Jones' stated, \"never perform more\u00a0\nthan three sets of any one exercise\". Mike Mentzer states \"the tendency among\u00a0\nenthusiastic bodybuilders is to add more\u00a0\u00a0 sets to their workouts, etc., etc\", \"this tendency\u00a0\nmust be kept in check and avoided at all costs\". Yet, some data suggests in trained individuals,\u00a0\u00a0 modestly increasing weekly sets performed for\u00a0\na muscle group may accelerate muscle growth. A study by Aube et al. had\u00a0\ntrained men train the back\u00a0\u00a0 squat and leg press with a variety of set numbers. After 8 weeks of training, the researchers\u00a0\ndivided the subjects into a high,\u00a0\u00a0 moderate, or low responder group in terms\u00a0\nof how much they grew their anterior thigh. Remember, the subjects were trained and had been\u00a0\nconsistently training before the study commenced. It was found those who grew their anterior thigh\u00a0\nthe most in the high responder group had increased\u00a0\u00a0 their weekly set numbers the most relative to\u00a0\nwhat they were performing before the study. Another study by Scarpelli et al. found in\u00a0\ntrained men, having them perform 20% more\u00a0\u00a0 weekly sets for their quadriceps relative\u00a0\nto what they performed before the study,\u00a0\u00a0 produced larger vastus lateralis growth versus\u00a0\nperforming a prescribed number of 22 weekly sets. Collectively these data indicate\u00a0\nfor trained individuals,\u00a0\u00a0 modestly increasing weekly\u00a0\nset numbers (perhaps by 20%)\u00a0\u00a0 can be effective for accelerating muscle gains,\u00a0\nand may be a useful tool in the event of plateaus. The final main common theme of high-intensity\u00a0\nregimes is lower frequency training. We noted Jones' ultimately recommended training\u00a0\neach muscle group no more than twice per week,\u00a0\u00a0 with perhaps better results from only one. Mike Mentzer recommended 96-120 hours of rest\u00a0\nbetween training sessions. In fact, recall\u00a0\u00a0 Mentzer also states he had a number of personal\u00a0\nclients who trained once every 10-14 days. What does the literature\u00a0\nsay on training frequency? A range of studies has examined when keeping\u00a0\nall other weekly training variables equal\u00a0\u00a0 (including the number of sets performed\u00a0\nfor a muscle group each week),\u00a0\u00a0 whether higher or lower\u00a0\nfrequency training is better. A 2019 meta-analysis by Schofield et\u00a0\nal. combined 13 studies that did this\u00a0\u00a0 and established similar muscle growth between\u00a0\nlower and higher training frequencies. Out of the 13 studies included, 11\u00a0\nhad subjects train with a total of 12\u00a0\u00a0 weekly sets per muscle group or fewer. So when training with a total of 12\u00a0\nor fewer weekly sets per muscle group,\u00a0\u00a0 lower and higher training frequencies\u00a0\nseem to be similarly effective. As one illustration of this, Gomes et\u00a0\nal. recruited 23 trained men with an\u00a0\u00a0 average bench press one-rep max of 103kg\u00a0\nand an average squat one-rep max of 132kg. A lower frequency group trained their\u00a0\nmuscle groups at a once per week frequency,\u00a0\u00a0 while a higher frequency group trained their\u00a0\nmuscle groups at a five times per week frequency. Both groups accumulated 10\u00a0\nweekly sets per muscle group. After 8 weeks of training, lean mass\u00a0\ngains were similar between both groups. Now, when performing higher training\u00a0\nvolume (more than 12 weekly sets),\u00a0\u00a0 the research is conflicting on whether lower\u00a0\nor higher frequency training is better.\u00a0\u00a0 Some find higher frequency to be better, others\u00a0\nlower frequency, and some with no differences.\u00a0\u00a0 We've more thoroughly examined this in our\u00a0\nultimate guide to training frequency video. Nonetheless, it's clear to see for hypertrophy,\u00a0\nthe research fails to demonstrate lower frequency\u00a0\u00a0 training is superior. Higher frequency\u00a0\ntraining appears perfectly viable. As for strength, a 2018 meta-analysis by Grgic et\u00a0\u00a0 al. combined 7 studies and found with\u00a0\nall other weekly training variables equal\u00a0\u00a0 (again, including weekly sets per muscle\u00a0\ngroup), training frequency had no impact. All 7 studies had subjects train with a total of\u00a0\n12 or fewer weekly sets per muscle group. Thus,\u00a0\u00a0 with these volumes, both low and high-frequency\u00a0\ntraining appear similarly effective for strength. When performing more than 12 weekly sets per\u00a0\nmuscle group, one study by Bartomolemi et al.\u00a0\u00a0 compared training muscles with a frequency\u00a0\nof 3/4x per week to only once a week. Strength gains were superior\u00a0\nfor the 3/4x frequency group. However, this isn't a consistent finding. 3 other studies indicate with more\u00a0\nthan 12 weekly sets per muscle group,\u00a0\u00a0 lower and higher frequencies were\u00a0\nsimilarly effective for strength gains. Fascinatingly, returning to the 2018 Grgic\u00a0\net al. meta-analysis, the researchers found\u00a0\u00a0 when combining studies that did not equate weekly\u00a0\nsets between lower and higher frequency training\u00a0\u00a0 (resulting in the higher frequency training groups\u00a0\nperforming more weekly sets on their exercises),\u00a0\u00a0 strength gains were greater\u00a0\nwith higher frequency training. This suggests using higher frequency\u00a0\ntraining as a tool to help you perform\u00a0\u00a0 more weekly sets may be an effective\u00a0\nway to produce greater strength gains. In total, the research suggests lower\u00a0\nfrequencies are not superior for strength gains.\u00a0\u00a0 Higher frequency training is perfectly viable. In fact, the Grgic et al. meta-analysis\u00a0\nsuggests higher training frequencies,\u00a0\u00a0 when used in a way to accumulate more weekly sets,\u00a0\ncan effectively produce more strength adaptations. Moving forward, I wanted to discuss\u00a0\none point behind why high-intensity\u00a0\u00a0 folks seemingly advocate lower frequencies. I think they assume that the body's\u00a0\ncapacity to recover is very limited. I'm not saying the body can handle\u00a0\nan infinite amount of training.\u00a0\u00a0 There's going to be a point above which\u00a0\nmore training will cause recovery problems. Yet, I feel high-intensity folks significantly\u00a0\nunderestimate where this point may be. After all, the repeated bout effect exists. Ever notice how when you first start\u00a0\ntraining, extreme soreness and muscle\u00a0\u00a0 performance decrease in the multiple days\u00a0\nafter. But after further weeks of training,\u00a0\u00a0 soreness is minimal and no longer is muscle\u00a0\nperformance hampered for multiple days after. This is because of the repeated bout effect, the\u00a0\nname given to the range of adaptations your body\u00a0\u00a0 produces to make you resilient to damage,\u00a0\nsoreness, and force production decreases. It's not clear precisely what creates the repeated\u00a0\nbout effect, but a 2017 study hypothesized neural,\u00a0\u00a0 muscle-tendon, connective tissue, and\u00a0\ninflammatory adaptations may all play a role. Now, many studies aiming to examine the time\u00a0\ncourse of recovery after lifting weights\u00a0\u00a0 only do so after a single training session. For example, this study found after trained\u00a0\nmen performed a session consisting of 3\u00a0\u00a0 sets of repetitions to failure with a 12\u00a0\nrep-max load on the bench press and squat,\u00a0\u00a0 performance was still not fully\u00a0\nrecovered 48 hours after the session. Some may say this data indicates if your\u00a0\ntraining with multiple sets to failure,\u00a0\u00a0 more than 48 hours of rest\u00a0\nis required between sessions. However, this suggestion ignores\u00a0\nthe fact the recovery time course\u00a0\u00a0 was only examined after one training\u00a0\nsession. What would happen to the\u00a0\u00a0 recovery time course after repeatedly\u00a0\ntraining with multiple sets to failure? Due to the repeated bout effect,\u00a0\u00a0 we'd expect recovery durations\u00a0\nto progressively become shorter. My favorite study demonstrating\u00a0\nthis concept is this paper. They had 12 previously untrained perform\u00a0\n5 sets of 15 maximal eccentric only leg\u00a0\u00a0 extension repetitions on an isokinetic\u00a0\ndynamometer once a week for 10 weeks. Due to the machines, training loads would\u00a0\nhave increased as subjects got stronger. 5 sets of 15 MAXIMAL eccentric\u00a0\nrepetitions are extremely fatiguing. Eccentric training is known to\u00a0\nproduce more soreness and damage\u00a0\u00a0 compared to normal training\u00a0\nwhen first exposed to it. The data from the study demonstrates this. After the first training session, Creatine kinase\u00a0\u00a0 (an indirect measure of muscle damage) was\u00a0\nsignificantly elevated a day later, and muscle\u00a0\u00a0 soreness and maximal isometric force production\u00a0\nwere still decreased 5 DAYS after the session. However, as the training weeks progressed,\u00a0\nthe repeated bout effect kicked in and\u00a0\u00a0 all markers gradually decreased. This is\u00a0\nsomething I feel people underappreciate. By the 10th week, the training\u00a0\nsession produced NO soreness,\u00a0\u00a0 NO creatine kinase increases, and NO decreases\u00a0\nin maximal isometric force in the upcoming days. In other words, subjects were\u00a0\nrecovering within 24 hours of\u00a0\u00a0 the intense eccentric training session\u00a0\nafter 10 weeks of consistent training. Again, I'm not saying your body can recover\u00a0\nfrom an infinite amount of training,\u00a0\u00a0 rather the body can adapt robustly and\u00a0\nhandle a good amount of training over time.\u00a0\u00a0 I feel high-intensity training\u00a0\nregimes underappreciate this. I want to make it clear that by no means\u00a0\nwhat this video aim to discredit or hate on\u00a0\u00a0 high-intensity training. The goal was to evaluate\u00a0\nif high-intensity training is supported by the\u00a0\u00a0 current literature in the most non-bias way\u00a0\nI can. I hope I was able to accomplish this. I\u2019d like to say Mike Mentzer's book\u00a0\nis highly interesting and in my view\u00a0\u00a0 extraordinarily well written. I feel Mike\u00a0\nMentzer was simply interpreting the data and\u00a0\u00a0 knowledge that was available at the time\u00a0\nhe composed the book (the early 2000s). Since then, we have a substantial amount of new\u00a0\nresearch, and presumably in the next 20 years,\u00a0\u00a0 more will emerge. Nevertheless, I still wanted to discuss aspects\u00a0\u00a0 of high-intensity training I\u00a0\nthink are positive in some way. We mentioned training to failure does not\u00a0\nappear to be essential. Stopping 5-3 reps\u00a0\u00a0 from failure seems to be sufficient for maxing\u00a0\nstrength and hypertrophy gains, respectively. Yet, stopping a certain number\u00a0\nof reps from failure requires\u00a0\u00a0 you accurately judge how far from failure you are. This is challenging, and having experience with\u00a0\ntraining to failure is likely required to do this. Psychologically, it's easier to train to failure\u00a0\nwhen performing only one set per exercise. So high-intensity training can be a great\u00a0\u00a0 way to accustom yourself to the\u00a0\nfeeling of training to failure. Progressing on, it's important to\u00a0\nremember high-intensity training\u00a0\u00a0 will unquestionably still build\u00a0\na substantial amount of muscle. We've mentioned how performing 3 sets per exercise\u00a0\u00a0 tends to be better than 1 set\u00a0\nfor strength and hypertrophy. Yet, performing 3 sets does not\u00a0\ngive you 3x the more strength and\u00a0\u00a0 hypertrophy versus performing 1 set,\u00a0\nrather only marginally more gains. Returning to the Ralson et al. meta-analysis\u00a0\u00a0 which found greater strength gains with\u00a0\nhigh volume versus low volume training,\u00a0\u00a0 the effect size difference was 0.18, which is\u00a0\ninterpreted as being a trivial difference only. As for the Schoenfeld et al. meta-analysis which\u00a0\u00a0 found greater hypertrophy with high\u00a0\nvolume versus low volume training,\u00a0\u00a0 the effect size difference was 0.24, which\u00a0\nis interpreted as a small difference only. Now, it's important to remember\u00a0\nthe studies involved in these\u00a0\u00a0 analyses largely lasted 12 weeks\u00a0\nor less, so these trivial to small\u00a0\u00a0 gains achieved with 3 sets versus 1 set\u00a0\nmay become more pronounced long-term. Regardless, it's clear you're still going\u00a0\nbuild a lot of muscle with low volume\u00a0\u00a0 training like high-intensity training.\u00a0\nMany people, for one reason or another,\u00a0\u00a0 may not want to invest extra time in higher\u00a0\nvolume training for slightly more gains. So\u00a0\u00a0 high-intensity training can be a great\u00a0\ntime-efficient method for these folks. Finally, and this is a very important point I\u00a0\nwant to emphasize, it might be possible that\u00a0\u00a0 some individuals truly grow more with lower\u00a0\nvolume training versus higher volume training. Remember all the research findings\u00a0\npresented thus far are the average results. Such results are not always\u00a0\napplicable to an individual. Matter of fact, this study demonstrates this. 16 men and 18 women trained the unilateral\u00a0\nleg press and unilateral leg extension with\u00a0\u00a0 a 7-10 rep-max load, three\u00a0\ntimes per week for 12 weeks. With one-leg, subjects trained\u00a0\neach exercise with only one set.\u00a0\u00a0 With the other leg, they trained\u00a0\neach exercise with three sets. Cross-sectional area of the quadriceps\u00a0\nwas measured before and after the study. The graph shows the individual\u00a0\nresponses for each participant.\u00a0\u00a0 The Y-axis shows the cross-sectional area\u00a0\nincreases for the leg that trained with 3 sets,\u00a0\u00a0 and the X-axis shows the cross-sectional area\u00a0\nincreases for the leg that trained with 1 set. The results show a near 50/50 split, with 50%\u00a0\nseeing better gains with 3 sets per exercise,\u00a0\u00a0 and the other 50% seeing similar\u00a0\nor more gains with 1 set. The researchers also looked at strength (they\u00a0\naveraged out the results from 3 different\u00a0\u00a0 strength tests), and the findings\u00a0\nwere similar, a near 50/50 split. These findings truly surprised me, and if\u00a0\nthey can be replicated on a larger scale,\u00a0\u00a0 they might suggest many folks experience\u00a0\nno benefit with higher volumes. However, it's essential to remember\u00a0\nonly 34 subjects were in this study,\u00a0\u00a0 so it's very difficult to say this\u00a0\nexact distribution applies to everyone. Moreover, all these subjects were\u00a0\nuntrained. As mentioned , there's\u00a0\u00a0 data showing increasing set numbers in\u00a0\ntrained individuals benefits hypertrophy,\u00a0\u00a0 so I'm skeptical these distributions\u00a0\nhold true for trained individuals. Regardless, it is likely true some individuals\u00a0\ngrow at least the same or even possibly more with\u00a0\u00a0 lower volume training, and high-intensity\u00a0\ntraining may be great for these folks. Crystalizing everything, the current literature\u00a0\u00a0 does not suggest high-intensity training\u00a0\nis optimal for building muscle or strength. Training to failure isn't essential,\u00a0\nhigher volumes tend to be better than\u00a0\u00a0 lower volumes on average, and higher training\u00a0\nfrequencies are also perfectly viable for gains. Still, high-intensity training will build a\u00a0\nsubstantial amount of muscle and strength,\u00a0\u00a0 and for some individuals, low-volume\u00a0\ntraining like this could actually be optimal."

    "transcript": "In this video, we aim to establish whether you're\u00a0\u00a0 missing out on superfast gains by\u00a0\nnot performing superslow training. Traveling back to the 1980s, it's claimed an\u00a0\nindividual named Ken Hutchins, upon conducting\u00a0\u00a0 resistance training research on older women with\u00a0\nfragile bones, developed superslow training. Super slow resistance training seemed\u00a0\nto be ideal for this demographic,\u00a0\u00a0 as one article claims Hutchins stated \"these women\u00a0\nwere so weak we were afraid for their safety\". What precisely is superslow training? I ran across a PDF authored by Ken Hutchins,\u00a0\non which he makes a distinction between\u00a0\u00a0 superslow training as a protocol and\u00a0\nsuperslow training as a philosophy. As a protocol, superslow training simply\u00a0\nrefers to performing exercises with a\u00a0\u00a0 10-second lifting duration and\u00a0\na 4-10-second lowering duration. As a philosophy, superslow training\u00a0\nappears to be a whole training methodology.\u00a0\u00a0 Ken notes sessions should not exceed 30 minutes,\u00a0\n3-7 days of rest are required between sessions,\u00a0\u00a0 among a few other factors. Environmental factors are also mentioned,\u00a0\u00a0 with Ken, quite intriguingly, believing\u00a0\ntraining sessions should be devoid of music. Other sources also state that superslow workouts\u00a0\ntypically only comprise one set per exercise. Though superslow training seemingly\u00a0\nhas formal origins in older women,\u00a0\u00a0 Wikipedia states, something like\u00a0\nthe superslow training was used\u00a0\u00a0 by bodybuilders and powerlifters to\u00a0\nbreak plateaus well before the 80s. Of course, these claims are difficult to verify. Now, there are indeed many similarties\u00a0\nbetween superslow training,\u00a0\u00a0 Arthur Jones' high-intensity training,\u00a0\nand even training recommendations from\u00a0\u00a0 other individuals such as Dr. Dough\u00a0\nMcGuff's stuff from \"Body by Science\". In the future, I do plan to assess these\u00a0\nother training methodologies in more depth. But in this video specifically, we'll be\u00a0\nfocusing on the protocol of superslow training.\u00a0\u00a0 That's the 10-second lifting and 4-10-second\u00a0\nlowering repetition tempo recommended. When I say superslow training from hereafter, know\u00a0\nI'm merely referring to THIS repetition tempo. So, is superslow training a superior way\u00a0\nto develop muscle hypertrophy and strength? Allow us to explore the existing literature.\u00a0\nFirst, we'll examine superslow training's\u00a0\u00a0 effectiveness for strength development, and then\u00a0\nits effectiveness for hypertrophic adaptations. A 2001 Westcott et al. study is often cited as\u00a0\u00a0 evidence for superslow training being\u00a0\na potent strength-building stimulus. In the paper, two studies are described. Both studies involved just over 70\u00a0\npreviously untrained men and women\u00a0\u00a0 (their ages ranged from 25-82). They were assigned into either\u00a0\na superslow or regular group. Both of these groups trained\u00a0\na range of nautilus machine\u00a0\u00a0 exercises 2-3 times per week for a total of 8\u00a0\nweeks (in study 1) or 10 weeks (in study 2). The exercises performed each session were the leg\u00a0\nextension, leg curl, leg press, neck flexion, neck\u00a0\u00a0 extension, pullover, chest press, chest crossover,\u00a0\nlateral raise, biceps curl, and triceps extension. The regular group, each session, performed\u00a0\neach exercise with 1 set of 8-12 repetitions,\u00a0\u00a0 with each repetition consisting of a\u00a0\n2-second lifting and 4-second lowering tempo. The superslow group, each session,\u00a0\nperformed 1 set of 4-6 repetitions,\u00a0\u00a0 with each repetition consisting of a 10-second\u00a0\nlifting and 4-second lowering duration. Both groups, throughout the study duration,\u00a0\u00a0 attempted to gradually increase the load\u00a0\nthey used on their exercise sets within the\u00a0\u00a0 variables prescribed to them (in other\u00a0\nwords, they progressively overloaded). Before and after the study, the\u00a0\nregular group's strength was tested via\u00a0\u00a0 measuring the maximum load they\u00a0\ncould lift for 10 repetitions,\u00a0\u00a0 with each repetition consisting of a\u00a0\n2-second lifting and 4-second lowering tempo. Conversely, the superslow group's\u00a0\nstrength was tested via measuring\u00a0\u00a0 the maximum load they could\u00a0\nlift for a single repetition,\u00a0\u00a0 with that repetition consisting of a\u00a0\n10-second lifting and 4-second lowering tempo. In study 1, these tests were done\u00a0\nwith all of the trained exercises.\u00a0\u00a0 In study 2, these tests were\u00a0\ndone only with the chest press. In both studies, on average, the superslow group\u00a0\nexperienced greater strength gains. As noted by\u00a0\u00a0 the authors, the superslow group saw roughly 50%\u00a0\nmore strength gains versus the regular group. So, there we have it. Superslow training is\u00a0\noptimal for evoking strength adaptations. Not so fast. As with all studies, limitations exist,\u00a0\nand there is one very notable limitation. As many of you likely noticed, the strength\u00a0\ntests were different between both groups\u00a0\u00a0 (in terms of repetition numbers\u00a0\nand the repetition tempos used). Generally, most people think of strength as the\u00a0\nmaximum load a person can lift on an exercise\u00a0\u00a0 without using any deliberate tempo, rather the\u00a0\nperson just attempts to lift as much as they can\u00a0\u00a0 (this is typically called a\u00a0\nperson's one-repetition maximum). This begs the question: how would typical\u00a0\none-repetition maximum strength gains\u00a0\u00a0 look between the superslow and regular groups? Fortunately, another study by\u00a0\nKeeler et al. examined this. 14 previously untrained women (with an average\u00a0\u00a0 age of 32) were allocated into\u00a0\na superslow or regular group. Both groups trained a range of\u00a0\nexercises 3 times per week for 10 weeks. The exercises performed each session were the\u00a0\nleg extension, leg curl, leg press, bench press,\u00a0\u00a0 seated row, biceps curl, triceps\u00a0\nextension, and lat-pulldown. The regular group,\u00a0\u00a0 each session, performed each exercise for 1 set\u00a0\nof 8-12 repetitions with an 80% one-repetition\u00a0\u00a0 max load, with each repetition consisting of a\u00a0\n2-second lifting and 4-second lowering tempo. The superslow group, each session, performed\u00a0\u00a0 each exercise for a single set of 8-12\u00a0\nrepetitions with a 50% one-rep max load,\u00a0\u00a0 with each repetition consisting of a\u00a0\n10-second lifting and 5-second lowering tempo. Both groups, throughout the study, attempted\u00a0\nto increase the load they used to maintain\u00a0\u00a0 their respective relative loading (again, an 80%\u00a0\none-rep max load for the regular group and a 50%\u00a0\u00a0 one-rep max load for the superslow group). Before and after the study, one-repetition\u00a0\nmaximum while not using any deliberate tempo\u00a0\u00a0 (just trying to lift the maximum weight) on all\u00a0\ntrained exercises were evaluated for both groups. For 5 of the 8 exercises, the regular group\u00a0\nexperienced much greater strength gains.\u00a0\u00a0 For the other 3 exercises\u00a0\n(the row, triceps extension,\u00a0\u00a0 and biceps curl), strength gains were not\u00a0\nstatistically different between both groups.\u00a0\u00a0 Though, it's still worth noting the percentages\u00a0\nstill appear to favor the regular group. Therefore, this study indicates for\u00a0\nincreasing one-repetition maximum strength,\u00a0\u00a0 superslow training is suboptimal. These findings are logical. Superslow training, because of the very slow\u00a0\nrepetition tempos, would require you to train\u00a0\u00a0 with relatively light loads (that is, a lower\u00a0\npercentage of your one-repetition maximum). This matters as the current data\u00a0\nindicate training with heavier loads\u00a0\u00a0 (80% one-repetition maximum or heavier)\u00a0\nevokes greater one-repetition maximum\u00a0\u00a0 strength gains compared to\u00a0\ntraining with lighter loads. Such findings are intuitive. If you want\u00a0\nto increase the maximum load you can lift,\u00a0\u00a0 training with heavy loads should\u00a0\npromote this more than lighter loads. As such, I think for individuals wishing to\u00a0\nmaximize their one-repetition maximum strength,\u00a0\u00a0 simply training with heavier loads, and\u00a0\naiming to move them as fast as you can,\u00a0\u00a0 is a sound recommendation. Now, this does not mean super slow training is\u00a0\nutterly useless for anything strength-related.\u00a0\u00a0 Recall the Westcott et al. study found\u00a0\nthat for increasing the maximum load\u00a0\u00a0 you can lift WHILE using a 10-second\u00a0\nlifting and 4-second lowering tempo,\u00a0\u00a0 training with this very tempo was\u00a0\nextremely effective at accomplishing this. Consequently, if an individual wish to maximize\u00a0\nthe loads they can lift with a superslow tempo,\u00a0\u00a0 superslow training is probably going\u00a0\nto be the best way to accomplish this.\u00a0\u00a0 This information may be particularly useful\u00a0\nfor those who simply cannot train with very\u00a0\u00a0 heavy loads (due to underlying conditions or\u00a0\nas they simply dislike heavy load training). Progressing on, is superslow training\u00a0\nsuperior for muscle building? As of right now, I'm only aware of one\u00a0\nstudy by Schuenke et al. exploring this. 19 previously untrained women (with an average\u00a0\u00a0 age of 21) were assigned to\u00a0\na superslow or regular group. Both groups trained the leg\u00a0\npress, squat, and leg extension.\u00a0\u00a0 Each for 3 sets, 2-3 times per week for 6 weeks. The regular group performed each exercise set\u00a0\nwith 6-10 repetitions, using an 80-85% one-rep\u00a0\u00a0 max load, with each repetition consisting of a\u00a0\n1-2-second lifting and 1-2-second lowering tempo. The superslow group performed each exercise set\u00a0\nwith 6-10 repetitions, using a 40-60% one-rep\u00a0\u00a0 max load, with each repetition consisting of a\u00a0\n10-second lifting and 4-second lowering tempo. Both groups rested for 2 minutes\u00a0\nbetween sets. Also, if subjects\u00a0\u00a0 could perform more than their prescribed\u00a0\nrepetition numbers, loads were increased. By the end of the study, growth of fast and\u00a0\nslow-twitch muscle fibers from the vastus\u00a0\u00a0 lateralis (part of the quadriceps)\u00a0\nwas greater for the regular group. Correspondingly, this data interestingly\u00a0\u00a0 suggests superslow training might be\u00a0\nsuboptimal for evoking hypertrophy. Some may be thinking this is likely\u00a0\ndue to the use of the light loads\u00a0\u00a0 (40-60% one-rep max loads) by the superslow group.\u00a0\nHowever, as we've examined in previous videos,\u00a0\u00a0 loads between 30% and 80% one-rep max\u00a0\nproduce similar muscle hypertrophy\u00a0\u00a0 when repetitions are performed very close or to\u00a0\nfailure (as was more or less done in this study). Due to this, the use of the light\u00a0\nloads per se, by the superslow group,\u00a0\u00a0 likely would not be sufficient\u00a0\nto explain these results. So what does? There is another potential explanation,\u00a0\nwe'll explore this shortly. But first, I wanted to critically examine\u00a0\na rationale superslow training proponents\u00a0\u00a0 sometimes put forth as to why they believe\u00a0\nsuperslow training is superior for hypertrophy. Namely, they claim superslow training creates\u00a0\nmore tension in a muscle for a given workload. Tension (that's mechanical tension) is equal\u00a0\nto the force generated by muscle fibers. Something called mechanosensors within\u00a0\nmuscle fibers can detect these forces\u00a0\u00a0 and transduce them into a signaling cascade\u00a0\nthat results in muscle fiber hypetrophy. Based on this, to maximize overall muscle\u00a0\ngrowth, we'd want to recruit as many\u00a0\u00a0 muscle fibers as possible and have them sustain\u00a0\nfairly decent forces for a sufficient duration. Superslow training proponents believe a\u00a0\nsuperslow tempo accomplishes this best,\u00a0\u00a0 due to the force-velocity relationship. The force-velocity relationship states\u00a0\nthat faster muscle contractions result\u00a0\u00a0 in less force production, while slower muscle\u00a0\ncontractions result in greater force production. Consequently, a superslow tempo,\u00a0\ndue to the slow muscle contraction,\u00a0\u00a0 maximizes the amount of force a\u00a0\nmuscle can produce. Put another way,\u00a0\u00a0 it maximizes mechanical tension and\u00a0\nthus is superior for building muscle. However, I believe this is a misapplication\u00a0\nof the force-velocity relationship and\u00a0\u00a0 is more than likely misleading.\u00a0\nLet's establish why I think this. It's essential to recognize\u00a0\nthe conditions in which the\u00a0\u00a0 force-velocity relationship was established. It can be established with unfatigued isolated\u00a0\nmuscle fibers contracting a single or few times\u00a0\u00a0 at different velocities. For example, when\u00a0\nmaximally stimulating a fiber at different\u00a0\u00a0 shortening velocities, force outcomes are in\u00a0\nline with the force-velocity relationship. It can also be established when comparing\u00a0\u00a0 unfatigued muscle contractions at\u00a0\ndifferent forces or velocities. As a simple example, compare performing one\u00a0\nrep with a 90% one-rep max load to with a\u00a0\u00a0 30% one-rep max load. Despite you trying to\u00a0\nmove both of these loads as fast as you can,\u00a0\u00a0 your muscles will generate more force and\u00a0\ncontract slower against the 90% one-rep max load.\u00a0\u00a0 This is in line with the\u00a0\nforce-velocity relationship. However, these aforementioned conditions in which\u00a0\nthe force-velocity relationship applies are very\u00a0\u00a0 different from lifting a constant light load\u00a0\nto or very close to failure, and they do not\u00a0\u00a0 mean that lifting this constant light load slowly\u00a0\nwill result in greater muscle force production. Henneman's size principle helps us understand why. Different types of muscle\u00a0\nfibers exist within a muscle.\u00a0\u00a0 These different types of muscle fibers can\u00a0\nlikely be categorized across a spectrum. On one end are slow-twitch muscle fibers,\u00a0\u00a0 which generally produce low forces\u00a0\nbut are highly fatigue resistant. On the other end are fast-twitch muscle fibers,\u00a0\u00a0 which generally produce high\u00a0\nforces but are highly fatigable. Henneman's size principle indicates\u00a0\nwhen muscle force requirements are low,\u00a0\u00a0 only recruitment of slower-twitch muscle fibers\u00a0\nis necessary. But, as force requirements increase,\u00a0\u00a0 or you near failure while attempting\u00a0\nto sustain a given force output,\u00a0\u00a0 those faster-twitch muscle fibers\u00a0\nare incrementally recruited. Here's the thing, with a given light load, lifting\u00a0\nit slower actually reduces the force requirements. Force is equal to mass multiplied by acceleration.\u00a0\nIn our case, mass mainly refers to the load used.\u00a0\u00a0 Using a slower tempo will reduce your\u00a0\nacceleration during a repetition,\u00a0\u00a0 thus resulting in lower force requirements. A study by Schilling et al. demonstrates this. They found when a national weightlifter\u00a0\nperformed the back squat with 170kg,\u00a0\u00a0 using a 10-second lifting\u00a0\nand 4-second lowering tempo\u00a0\u00a0 produced lower mean and peak propulsive forces\u00a0\ncompared to using a maximal lifting speed Consequently, lifting light loads with a slower\u00a0\u00a0 repetition will actually result in\u00a0\nlow mechanical tension INITIALLY. However, notice I said initially.\u00a0\u00a0 Using slower repetition tempos is not\u00a0\nnecessarily suboptimal for hypertrophy. Recall not only do force requirements\u00a0\ndetermine the number of muscle fibers recruited\u00a0\u00a0 (as well as the force produced\u00a0\nby recruited individual fibers),\u00a0\u00a0 but your proximity to failure while trying\u00a0\nto sustain a given force output does as well. With a given light load, although\u00a0\nusing a slower repetition tempo\u00a0\u00a0 will involve less force production\u00a0\ncompared to using a faster tempo,\u00a0\u00a0 as you continue to perform repetitions\u00a0\nand get closer and closer to failure,\u00a0\u00a0 the recruitment of more muscle fibers (as well\u00a0\nas probably increased force production by some\u00a0\u00a0 recruited individual fibers) must occur for you to\u00a0\ntry and sustain repetitions with this given load. As a result, regardless of whether a\u00a0\nfaster or slower repetition tempo is used,\u00a0\u00a0 so long as repetitions are\u00a0\nperformed very close or to failure,\u00a0\u00a0 you likely end up recruiting a similar\u00a0\nnumber of muscle fibers and potentially\u00a0\u00a0 exposing the individual recruited\u00a0\nfibers to comparable levels of force. Put another way, mechanical tension\u00a0\nlikely ends up being similar. So, to summarize this\u00a0\nhypertrophy discussion so far,\u00a0\u00a0 it's very likely superslow training DOES\u00a0\nNOT produce more mechanical tension. Rather, it's likely so long as repetitions\u00a0\nare performed very close or to failure,\u00a0\u00a0 slower repetitions tempos would be similarly\u00a0\neffective to faster repetition tempos. However, if this is true, why did the Schuenke\u00a0\nstudy find superslow training to be suboptimal? First and foremost, it's worth\u00a0\nnoting this was only a single study.\u00a0\u00a0 Also, limitations and\u00a0\nconsiderations exist within it.\u00a0\u00a0 As one example, the subjects were previously\u00a0\nuntrained women, meaning it's not clear\u00a0\u00a0 if the results obtained would apply to\u00a0\nindividuals outside of this demographic. Even so, let us put forth a\u00a0\npotential hypothesis behind\u00a0\u00a0 why superslow training could\u00a0\nbe suboptimal for hypertrophy. As noted moments ago, it's likely so long\u00a0\nas repetitions are performed very close or\u00a0\u00a0 to failure, slower repetitions tempos would be\u00a0\nsimilarly effective to faster repetition tempos. In most cases, I believe this\u00a0\nstatement is true. For example,\u00a0\u00a0 a meta-analysis by Schoenfeld et al. found that\u00a0\nindividual repetition tempos between 0.5 to 8\u00a0\u00a0 seconds produced similar muscle hypertrophy when\u00a0\nrepetitions were performed to or close to failure. However, there might be a problem with\u00a0\nusing individual repetition tempos\u00a0\u00a0 beyond the 8-second range (which\u00a0\nis done with superslow training). This problem is central fatigue. Remember, the reason your muscles produce\u00a0\nforce is thanks to the electrical signals\u00a0\u00a0 they receive from the central nervous\u00a0\nsystem (the brain and spinal cord). Central fatigue refers to fatigue during exercise\u00a0\nthat decreases the number of electrical signals\u00a0\u00a0 sent to the muscle. At the level of the\u00a0\nmuscle, this means a reduction in muscle\u00a0\u00a0 fiber recruitment and/or a reduction in the\u00a0\nforce generated by recruited individual fibers.\u00a0\u00a0 Put another way, central fatigue\u00a0\ncan lower mechanical tension. Contrary to what most people seem to believe,\u00a0\nlight load and longer-lasting contractions\u00a0\u00a0 generate more central fatigue versus higher\u00a0\nload and shorter-lasting contractions. As an example, Yoon et al.\u00a0\net al. had 9 men and 9 women,\u00a0\u00a0 on separate days, perform a contraction\u00a0\nof their biceps at either 20% of their\u00a0\u00a0 maximum voluntary contraction force or 80%\u00a0\nof their maximum voluntary contraction force.\u00a0\u00a0 They held each contraction until force\u00a0\ndeclined by 10% of the target force. On average, subjects held the 20% contraction\u00a0\nfor around 14 minutes before they could no\u00a0\u00a0 longer produce the required force, whereas the 80%\u00a0\ncontraction was only held for around 25 seconds. But, the 20% contraction produced greater\u00a0\ncentral fatigue than the 80% contraction. Now, as we've already noted in this video,\u00a0\u00a0 loads as light as 30% one-rep max produce\u00a0\nsimilar hypertrophy to 80% one-rep max loads,\u00a0\u00a0 when repetitions are performed\u00a0\nvery close or to failure. Moreover, much of these studies had subjects\u00a0\nuse a 2-4 second individual repetition tempo.\u00a0\u00a0 Thus, we can likely conclude any\u00a0\ncentral fatigue generated within\u00a0\u00a0 these training variables does not interfere\u00a0\nwith muscle hypertrophy and is perfectly fine. Similarly, we've also already noted that\u00a0\nindividual repetition tempos between 0.5 to\u00a0\u00a0 8 seconds are similarly effective for hypertrophy\u00a0\nwhen repetitions are performed very close or to\u00a0\u00a0 failure. In these studies, it seems mainly\u00a0\n50% to 80% one-rep max loads were used.\u00a0\u00a0 Thus, we can also likely conclude any\u00a0\ncentral fatigue generated within these\u00a0\u00a0 training variables does not interfere with\u00a0\nmuscle hypertrophy and is perfectly fine. However, and this is the key\u00a0\npoint, perhaps superslow training\u00a0\u00a0 (due not only to the light loads but probably more\u00a0\nso the superslow repetition tempo of 10-second\u00a0\u00a0 lifting and 4-10 seconds of lowering that would\u00a0\nsignificantly extend the set duration) ultimately\u00a0\u00a0 evokes excessive central fatigue levels that\u00a0\ndo indeed interfere with muscle hypertrophy. Perhaps this explains the Schuenke study findings. It's worth again emphasizing this is merely\u00a0\na hypothesis based on the findings of a\u00a0\u00a0 single study. At the end of the day, future\u00a0\nresearch would be needed to substantiate this."

    "transcript": "foreign to the house of hypertrophy when you train we all know muscle and strength games happen you may even know tendons and Bones adapt too yet a lesser appreciated adaptation is the repeated bowel effect which directly links to muscle damage recovery and fatigue it also indirectly links to other training areas like exercise selection training volume and training frequency let's dive into the repeated bow effect and then discuss what it means for you [Music] when training intensely when you're unaccustomed to it significant damage and swelling of the muscle and connective tissue prolonged decreases in muscle strength delayed onset muscle soreness and muscle stiffness happen in the following days after chances are you felt this if you're brand new to training or you've returned to training after a break and your first session is super intense you'd have experienced substantial soreness and fatigue in the days after however when you repeat the training this time you'll experience lower damage and swelling of muscle and connective tissue a lower reduction in strength and lower delayed onset muscle soreness and stiffness in the following days why is this your body adapts to protect your muscles from damage and speed up your recovery this is the repeated bow effect but how much can the repeat about effect help your recovery in the long term foreign the best study to date showing the potential power of the rbe is from 2020 out of Greece the researchers recruited untrained men which is great since their muscles tend to have the greatest vulnerability to damage the training was far from what most people typically do I'll describe it in then detail why this irregular training was a great idea subjects trained their quads on an isokinetic dynamometer which applied forces to bend the knee producing their Max effort to resist it thus loading their quads under eccentric contractions eccentric contractions are where the muscle produces Force while lengthening during the concentric contractions the dynamometer did not resist allowing them to extend their knee easily so the training was eccentric only a recession they performed 15 of these eccentric only repetitions for 5 sets with two minutes of rest between the sets the training was performed once a week for 10 weeks why they say this training was a great idea it would have been seriously damaging eccentric contractions are known to produce significant damage higher rip numbers contrary to what may be popular belief are more damaging and the fact five sets were performed further adds to the damage remember subjects also produce their Max effort to resist the dynamometer meaning these eccentric contractions were maximal thus inducing more fatigue than the sub Max eccentric contractions occurring in typical workouts the fact each rep was Max effort also technically means as subjects got stronger Progressive overload naturally took place [Music] right before and one two three and five days after each training session across the 10 weeks numerous measurements were taken to assess the subject's fatigue specifically the pain-free range of motion subjects could move their knee joint through their delayed onset muscle soreness levels their concentric strength their eccentric strength and their isometric strength were measured on top of these right before and two days after each training session blood samples were taken to measure creatine kinase which is an indirect measure of muscle damage and C-reactive protein which is a marker of inflammation so what did the researchers find thank you foreign weeks of training their pain-free range of motion and delayed onset muscle soreness continuously decreased in the following days after each training session by weeks eight to ten the subjects experienced virtually no delayed onset muscle soreness compare this to weeks one to three where substantial soreness were seen after training the recovery of their concentric eccentric and isometric quad strength across the 10 weeks became a lot faster in the days after training for example by week's 8-10 very little decreases in eccentric strength was experienced in the days after training contrast this to weeks one to three where the fatigue was a lot worse both creatine kinase and C-reactive protein continuously decreased across the 10 weeks indicating that the training was producing very little to no damage and inflammation in the later weeks these findings indicate that rbe can be powerful training that first produces a ton of fatigue and damage for multiple days after no longer really did so as you continue to train across the weeks now with recovery of concentric eccentric and isometric quad strength there wasn't always faster recovery every single week for example with isometric strength recovery When comparing weeks seven to eight recovery was slightly worse in week eight so it can be normal for Recovery to fluctuate between weeks you may even notice this with your training but the key is when looking at the bigger picture recovery becomes faster so consistent training is needed to develop the repeated bow effect

rest assured the app is sincerely high quality since the rbe lowers soreness and muscle damage isn't this bad for building muscle this assumes soreness and damage are strong drivers of hypertrophy but the research fails to support this we've analyzed This research in a previous video anyway what could the rbe potentially mean for your training exercises training muscles with a stretch of great for hypertrophy this study by Mao compared overhead extensions to push Downs overhead extensions stretched the long head of the triceps triceps hypertrophy was Superior with the overhead extensions another mouse study compared seated to Lang lekos seated Lego stretched the bi-articular hamstring muscles more hamstrings hypertrude was Superior with a seated Legos but exercises training muscles with a stretch can cause quite a bit of muscle damage which may be unideal if you'd like to train these exercises with more volume or frequency yet the rbe would suggest as time passes your recovery from stretched exercises should become quicker allowing you to train them more if you'd like another implication of the rbe is high frequency training where you train a muscle in five or more days per week can be viable though initially some people may struggle to recover between sessions the rbe can change this across time indeed as analyzed in our trading frequency video there are studies showing high frequency training to be perfectly fine for building muscle in trained individuals likewise the rbe also makes it possible to handle more training volume over time indeed as analyzed in our video on set numbers increasing your sets as you progress throughout your training career might be helpful for muscle hypertrophy finally the rbe can make certain recovery worries not an issue some people understandably have recovery concerns about training to failure or even past failure with something like Drop sets your recovery durations will likely always be longer when you're training to failure or past it but the rbe may make this not a practical issue set your training three times a week initially you may struggle to recover from performing a few test 2 or pass failure position but with some time the rbe develops and performing a few sets to a pass failure May no longer be a recovery concern foreign [Music] with the Greek study we presented the average results the researchers fortunately provided the individual data as well virtually all individuals aligns with their average results seeing much less fatigue from training across the 10 weeks yet there were seemingly around two to four individuals who although saw improvements across the 10 weeks still experienced fairly notable fatigue after training in a 10th week thus some individuals fail to develop the rbe as well as others ultimately with training experience you should be able to determine how your recovery progresses perhaps you'll align with many individuals who experience significantly less fatigue over time or perhaps not of course factors besides training such as nutrition age stress levels and sleep will all contribute to your recovery foreign [Applause] [Music] adaptation is the rbe which significantly decreases the damage and strength loss you see from training intensely over time it has potential links to training in these ways some may be hungry for more information what about accumulated fatigue is this really a concern what about CNS fatigue and connective tissues I actually plan to have future videos on these so stay tuned some may also be wondering does fatigue and the repeats about effect differ between muscles and if so does this impact training volume and frequency recommendations also is it possible to develop the repeated about effect without even experiencing damage and soreness in the first place we've answered these two questions on our new patreon page we have a video detailing how it is actually possible to develop the repeated about effect without experiencing damage and soreness in the first place plus we have an article analyzing the literature on how fatigue and the repeats about effect May differ between muscles I'd be sincerely grateful if you consider checking out the patreon page I'm hoping that the content over there will be valuable and in interesting to you if you don't like it you're free to cancel at any time and you can ask for

    "transcript": "what range of exercises can help elevate your lat development to new heights if you've ever plunged into the depth of let training info on the internet conflicting info exists the validity of lap pulldowns and barbell Rose for Lati poetry has been questioned it's also been said freeway pullovers aren't even a let exercise in this video we're going to roll through the confusion and arrive at a clearer landscape of what the current scientific literature informs us about maximizing lat hypertrophy welcome to the house of hypertrophy foreign which cover a wide area across the back have subdivisions a 2013 Canadian analysis divided the lets into two regions an upper thoracic region and a lower lumbar pelvis coastal region an Olden 1998 Australian analysis also noted the upper thoracic region but divided the lower region into transitional refi iliac and Coastal fibers finally a 2007 analysis also from Australia considered the let's have six regions predominantly based in the line of actions of the muscle tissue the findings of this same paper indicate that the central nervous system can somewhat activate certain regions more than other regions depending on the movement this tells us that different exercises May grow certain regions of the lat slightly more this may come as a surprise to some but the notion that certain parts of a muscle May grow more than other parts isn't a myth the scientific research verifies this phenomenon called Regional hypertrophy exists as just one example we've previously seen at the house of hypertrophy that both barbell squats and hip thrusts predominantly grow the lower regions of the gluteus maximus more than the middle and upper regions foreign pull-ups and lap pull-downs are one type of compound exercise many people have some kind of vertical pull in their training program vertical pools can be performed with different grip widths and this will likely influence let hypertrophy in different ways firstly vertical pulls involve elbow flexion so we'll train the elbow flexors moreover vertical pulls also tend to involve scapular depression and or downward rotation and since the majority of people's LEDs attached to the scapula the muscle May assist in these motions nonetheless if you're performing vertical pulls with a grip closer to being narrower searches close grip pull-ups and close grip lap pull-downs you're predominantly performing shoulder extension underhand vertical pulls searches chin ups and underhand lap pull Downs predominantly tend to involve shoulder extension too alongside the lads the teres major teres Miner and rear delse are the main muscles that can pull on the upper and bone to enforce shoulder extension which of these muscles experience the best stimulus a classic analysis from the USA assists us it established throughout shoulder extension that both the Terry's major and let's possess the largest leverage whereas the rear delts and Terry's minor leverages were lower in case you're unaware leverage refers to a muscle's moment arm which is the perpendicular distance between its line of force and the center of the joint it moves the longer the moment arm the greater The Leverage and ability of the muscle to move the joints multiple papers suggest that leverage plays an important part in how the central nervous system decides what muscles to recruit in a movement closer grip vertical pools tend to be most challenging near that contracted position so the rear tails are going to be involved relatively well but we're still getting an excellent Terry's major and lat stimulus are we potentially biasing a particular region of the let's with these closer grips this 2008 analysis from Australia established a cross shoulder extension the upper region had greater leverage compared to the middle and lower regions particularly at the lower shoulder angles which is where vertical pools are quite challenging indeed recall we mentioned a 2007 Australian paper that split the lets into six regions this paper recorded that electrical activity of the six regions during an isometric shoulder extension contraction through surface electromography held at around zero degrees which is where vertical pools are challenging semg is far from perfect as I've discussed multiple times previously but the usage of isometric contractions in this case likely enhances its reliability it was found that upper layer regions tended to display higher activity compared to the other regions thus based on The Leverage and active data it seems close to grip vertical pools are going to be particularly effective for targeting the upper region this isn't to be mistaken for saying the middle and lower regions aren't targeted whatsoever they certainly will be involved it's just that we're probably biasing the upper portion to some degree what about differences between underhand vertical pools and overhand or neutral grip close to grip vertical pulls well-controlled Research unsurprisingly indicates that biceps are involved more with an underhand grip does this mean let activity is reduced I'm only aware of this 2002 analysis out of the USA that found comparable lat activity between close grip pull-downs performed with a neutral grip and underhand lap pull-downs so in the absence of other data this finding May preliminarily indicate that underhand grip does not reduce lat involvement wider grip vertical pools such as wide grip pull-ups and lap pull-downs likely train the lats in a slightly different way as you move from a closer to wider grip you transition to performing shoulder adduction alongside the lands the teres major middle and lower pack Terrace major and rear delts are the main muscles that can pull on the upper arm bone to enforce shoulder adduction which of these muscles experience the best stimulus on the basis of this 2008 Australian analysis we can see the rear delts leverage rapidly drops off and throughout the angles that are most challenging in a wide grip vertical pull the rear delts do not have much leverage conversely all the other muscles the teres major all three let regions and the middle and lower pectorates major have great leverage throughout the range of motion focusing on the lat regions we can see that the middle and lower regions have slightly more leverage compared to the upper region indeed the previously mentioned 2007 Australian paper that split the let into six regions established during an isometric shoulder adduction contraction the lower regions tended to display greater activity granted these isometric contractions were held at 20 degrees of abduction an angle not reached with wider grip vertical pulls but based on the leveraged data I'm assuming this lower region buyers still exists throughout the range of Motion attained in wider grip vertical pulls therefore it seems wider grip vertical pulls will bias the middle and lower regions we just saw this graph from the 2008 Australian paper indicating the middle and lower let regions have slightly more leverage in the upper region but some of you may be drawn to another part of this graph the fact that middle and lower pecs have great leverage you may be surprised at this after all those couples are never recommended as a great chess Builder so what's going on to perform vertical pools as close to Pure shoulder abduction what I describe as a very wide grip is needed interestingly I stumbled across this Reddit user reporting chess soreness after using a wide grip on pull-ups with their elbows all the way out to the side most people rarely do this instead a medium or slightly wider grip is more common these involve a mixture of shoulder adduction and extension presumably lowering pector s major contribution it's also plausible medium grip width vertical pulls do well to Target all regions of the lats fairly well so what does this mean for you in due time we'll provide trading recommendations but first let's deconstruct the effectiveness of rows for building the Nets [Music] horizontal pulls including barbell rows dumbbell rows seated Rose and inverted rows are another type of compound exercise many people have at least one kind of horizontal pull in their training program as was the case with vertical pools the grip width is a notable Factor with a grip closer to narrower searches done with close grip barbell rows seated Rose and inverted rows shoulder extension occurs shoulder extension also occurs with one-sided rowing exercises that keep the elbow to the side of the body horizontal pulls tend to be most challenging near that contracted position and recall the upper lats possess more leverage and display greater activity around here therefore similar to closer grip vertical pools close the grip horizontal pulls made bias the upper left region yet there are at least three distinctions between closer grip horizontal and vertical pulls the overall range of motion the lat length obtained and the degree of shoulder hyperextension and scapular retraction could any of them influence lead hypertrophy starting with range of motion close-up grip vertical pulls move the shoulder joint from around 170 to 0 degrees horizontal pulls move the shoulder joint from approximately 75 to 0 degrees perhaps even entering negative degrees that is shoulder hyperextension depending on the execution your default assumption might be the greater range of motion with close secret vertical pulls means they're more effective for building Nets but I would argue this probably isn't true in multiple prior videos I've referenced emerging research suggesting larger ranges of motions are not necessarily better this study found partial leg extensions at a lengthened muscle position build the quads overall better than a full range of motion another paper found partial calf presses at the length and position grew the gastrocnemius more than using a full range of motion finally the results of a study soon to be published indicate length and partial hip extensions produced overall more hypertrophy versus a full range of motion it's unclear how far this logic extends so for now I'm not confident in saying everyone must perform vertical and horizontal pulls with a lengthened partial range of motion at the very least this data just demonstrates larger ranges of motions aren't always better what about the the fact vertical pools attain a greater stretch of the lens could this not mean they're better than horizontal pulls for building the lens although the lats are lengthened more with closer grip vertical pulls a key consideration is the exercise is not challenging near the most stretched position preliminary data indicates if that more length and position does not coincide with being challenging it might not be more effective for example this study from Japan compared partial range of motion Skull Crushers to full range of motion Skull Crushers full range of motion Skull Crushers involve lengthening the triceps more but it does not coincide with it being very challenging rather Skull Crushers are most challenging when the forearm is parallel to the floor the researchers found those partial Skull Crushers grew the triceps more and more recent steady compared incline curls to preacher curls incline curls attain a great stretch of the biceps but are more challenging at the mid to contracted position the results indicate preacher curls through the elbow flexes more finally what about the fact horizontal pulls can involve bringing the arm behind the body upper extension and notable scapular attraction can occur positioning your arm behind you and retracting your scapular highly involves the upper back muscle area but I'm skeptical this negatively interferes with the lat stimulus across the rest of the range of motion muscle activity isn't always mutually exclusive accordingly despite the distinctions I think closer grip vertical and horizontal pulls May comparably develop alerts As you move to performing wider grip horizontal pulls such as wide grip barbell rows seated rows and inverted rows you transition to performing shoulder horizontal extension one-sided Rose performed with the elbows fled away from the body also involve shoulder horizontal extension are these more effective for developing the lats based off the 1997 Australian analysis we can see throughout shoulder horizontal extension the rear delts infraspinatus and supraspinatus possess the best leverage while the lats have a lot lower leverage as a result we can confidently say that if the goal is to maximize lat engagement with horizontal pulls close to grips maintaining the elbow to the body that necessitates shoulder extension best accomplish this thus far we've discussed the potential effects of vertical and horizontal pulls for developing the lens but we've yet to touch on the influence of modality that is does using a barbell dumbbell machine or bodyweight exercise matter for instance although we know wider grip pull-ups and wider grip lap pull-downs predominantly involve shoulder adduction could one not be better or so although we know barbell machine dumbbell and body weight rows can involve shoulder extension are any better most likely not modality largely has little influence on hypertrophy outcomes this recent study involved comparing a free weight to machine program a poetry of the measured muscles was comparable between both a finding supported by other papers another paper indicates push-ups produce comparable chest and triceps gains to barbell bench presses that's not to say there is no difference whatsoever between the modalities finer differences exist pull-ups May Engage The forearms somewhat more than lap pull downs one arm rowing exercises involve a greater rotational component compared to on variants but in the precise context of developing the lats with all the aforementioned exercises I can't see any strong reason to believe certain modalities are superior except for one that is some have suggested since barbell rows involve loading the lower back this means it is inferior for the Lance [Music] this 2009 analysis from Canada found LA activity was greater with inverted roads compared to barbell rows while lower spinal erector activity was greater with Barbara Rose another 2005 analysis from Japan found a lot activity was slightly greater with seated rows compared to barbell Rose while trap activity was greater with Barbara Rose truthfully I'm unsure what to make of these findings you may suggest Barber Rose involved too much of a demand to stabilize the Torso creating higher activity in the lower spinal area and perhaps traps to the extent that involvement is reduced but a Counterpoint might be the findings are attributable to the multiple limitations of semg and that although there's a demand to stabilize the Torso with Barbara Rose It ultimately should be limited by shoulder extension strength and thus we should expect lat involvement to be similar between barbell rows and other rows the only way to solve this is if we had research directly comparing let hypertrophy between Barber Rose and other rows since this currently does not exist I'm just going to say it's fine to train with Barbara Rose if you desire other factors May influence your decision of course perhaps you're trading plenty of other exercises that train the spinal Erectors and you don't want any further stimulus from Rose thus machine or bodyweight rowing variations are going to be a better option [Music] so we know shoulder extension-based compound exercises closer grip vertical or horizontal pulls that may bias the upper leg region can be complementary to shoulder adduction compound movements that is wider grip vertical pools that bias the middle to lower regions if you have at least one shoulder extension based compound exercise and one shoulder adduction exercise I think there's an extremely high probability you'll see excellent lat hypertrophy over the long term I think it's also possible that only training medium grip vertical pulls since they might involve targeting all that regions relatively well will do an excellent job at developing the latch in the long term it's not impossible to perform a program with a mixture of these either but do you need an exercise that isolates the lats to ensure maximal development unfortunately there isn't any directly related research although I will say there's this fascinating study finding with a barbell bench press not everyone experienced the same relative recruitment of the chest triceps and shoulders what I mean is some may see the highest activity in the chest while Others May see the highest activity in the shoulders if we extrapolate this data it's possible someone experiences relatively lower stimulation of the lats from the exact same compound exercise compared to someone else here's my recommendation if you're not overly concerned about getting every ounce of last muscle mass from the lens isolated lat exercises may not be essential but if after a few months or even years of training your desired vertical and or horizontal pulls you're not satisfied with your lat development then it may be time to add in isolated exercises if you're someone who wants to do everything in your power to squeeze out maximum hypertrophy then including isolated lat training may be worthwhile of course there's nothing absolute about what I just said there are other scenarios in which you'd want to have isolated lat training for example if for whatever reason you don't want to perform vertical and or horizontal pulls or you're performing them in a way sub optimally for the lats such as only performing wider grip horizontal pulls which we know are likely not great for the less than having isolated lat training can be worthwhile another case is maybe you're someone who still isn't concerned with truly maximizing light hypertrophy but perhaps you just like some exercise variety and therefore desire to include isolated lat training but what are the most favorable isolated lat exercises foreign ERS are an isolation exercise that can train the lats and they can be performed with free weights cables or even machines recall earlier I stated that modality likely does not matter for light hypertrophy with horizontal and vertical pulls however pullovers are a rarer case there are actually some differences between the three-way cable and machine variations that may be important allow me to present the findings of two studies at first you may be confused as to why I'm detailing them but it will make sense soon both papers had subjects before maximal isometric shoulder extension contractions at different shoulder elevation angles both of them indicate that let's display their highest activity at lower shoulder elevation angles and incrementally display lower activity at higher shoulder elevation angles in this event the usage of isometric contractions likely enhances its reliability these findings do make sense as you elevate your arm and get closer to the overhead position the lats are going to have progressively lower leverage here's the important Point free weight pullovers are most challenging with arms overhead the point where the lats have their lowest activity as a result it's been speculated freeway pullovers are an ineffective lat exercise in fact at these higher shoulder elevation angles the middle and lower PEC regions likely have decent leverage indeed a few semg studies report the pectoralis major middle and low regions experience relatively greater activity compared to the leads during freeway pullovers so does this research conclusively mean freeway pullovers aren't a great lat exercise According to some on the internet their answer is a resounding yes but I am less certain because there are other aspects of the scientific literature we shouldn't ignore the layers are stretched well in the overhead position the rebuttal to this is so what if the lats are stretched the fact is not going to be activated much renders this meaningless however it's worth understanding its leverage and activity are not going to be zero it's just limited but limited activity plus stretch might still produce a good stimulus four-let hypertrophy research on the back squat and glute Max depicts this bad exports are of course most challenging at the lower portion and at these deeper angles of hip flexion the gluteus maximus is stretched well but it has much lower leverage ability to produce force and displays lower activity as measured through semg despite this a paper out of Japan established deeper scores through the gluteus maximus more effectively than 90 degree knee flexion squats another recent paper found back squats mostly to parallel produce similar upper middle and lower glute Max hypertrophy to hip thrusts thus stretch plus limited leverage and activity may still be a fine stimulus for hypertrophy may be suggesting crew weight pullovers may still be effective for the let's at the end of the day if it's an exercise that interests you feel free to try it out from a regional perspective the lower lats are probably going to have a bit more leverage versus the other regions at the overhead position so pullovers might slightly bias this region cable pullovers involve a great stretch of the lat since they attain an overhead position comparable to freeway pullovers yet compared to freeway pullovers cables involve a greater active range of motion the arms will go through lower elevation angles which we know is where the lats have greater activity thus actual electrical activity from the lats will likely be greater in the cable variation indeed there was this 2022 semg analysis from Spain comparing barbell pullovers to Cable pull-downs LED activity was greater with a cable movement the cable pull down isn't identical to a cable pullover but the shoulder motion and resistance profile are similar enough from a regional perspective since cable pullovers involve getting the arms near the side the upper region will certainly be involved well but since the movement is most challenging at that mid position the middle to lower lat regions might be potentially biased for all these reasons we make speculate cable pullovers to be a bit better than freeway pullovers but understand this is hypothetical you could say since freeway pullovers are most challenging at that very length and position while cable pullovers are most challenging in the mid position freeway pullovers have the edge yet I'm unsure if this factor is enough to make it undeniably better than cable pullovers machine pullovers assuming the machine sufficiently provides High Resistance throughout the range of motion are probably more favorable compared to freeway or cable pullovers the high tension throughout the range of motion means that the length and position is challenging and we have a potential slight lower lat region bias at this position like freeway pullovers but the fact we also have high tension at lower angles where the lats display greater electrical activity and the portions where the upper region possesses greater leverage means we get these benefits too so if you wish to have a pullover in your program to best train the lens go with the machine pullovers of course this isn't an absolute recommendation your gym may not have this machine if yours does but the machine feels off then go with either the free weight or cable variant [Music] there is one more lat to exercise worth dissecting high rows where you roll with your arms starting at a slanted angle so not quite fully overhead this is a compound exercise as shoulder and elbow motion occurs but it is a movement that can effectively Target the latch nonetheless depending on the equipment and setup you can train one arm at a time and bring your arm across your body to some degree doing so will result in you attaining a great stretch of the lats since the let's wrap around the rib cage if you have a machine that provides a solid challenge at the more lengthened position perhaps one with a more even resistance profile this will likely be excellent you could make the case these high rows are slightly better than machine pullovers we know machine pullovers achieve a great stretch of the leads but this is at the overhead position where the let's display their lowest leverage and thus activity conversely High Rolls involve comparatively lower arm elevation so the lats are slightly better activated in this position but we still have a great latch stretch thanks to bringing the arm slightly across now whether this difference is enough to meaningfully impact let hypertrophy in the long term it's currently unknown ultimately if you have access to both feel free to go with your preference it's not impossible for you to incorporate both of them into your program either some may be curious about the technique and execution of the aforementioned

pulls which better Target the rear delts infraspinatus and supraspinatus nonetheless closer grip vertical and horizontal pulls will likely be highly effective for targeting the upper leg regions wider grip vertical pools will likely be highly effective for targeting the lower leg regions medium grip vertical pools potentially involve targeting all regions fairly well if you're trading some of these compound exercises there's a high probability you'll see tremendous lat development over the long term there are a variety of cases where you may wish to add in isolated lat training pullovers are a great isolation movement that effectively targets the leads this is how I would rank the different modalities high rows performed with the arms slightly across the body to attain a great latch stretch

    "transcript": "welcome to the house of hypertrophy we're dissecting the scientific literature on how you can develop and evolve your side doubts but first here are some fun facts about the doubts you never knew if we combine the front side and rear delts the deltoids are actually the biggest muscle in terms of volume of the upper body being bigger than the pectoris major and latissimus dorsi furthermore although we typically consider the delts that consist of the front side and rear heads it's actually possible for us to divide it into seven segments in fact a piece of text dating back from 1734 appears to be the first to document this in more modern studies the precise way researchers divided deltoid can differ some use origin insertions or functional data nonetheless these studies arrive at the notion of seven doubt segments here's how an analysis by Brown and colleagues depicted the seven segments based on each segment having distinct Origins and or insertions looking at muscular individuals with a low level of body fat the segments can somewhat be seen though there's no unanimous agreement I think we can generally consider D1 as the front head D2 and D3 as the side head and D4 to D7 as the rear head we'll reference these segments more throughout the video and in future videos at the house of hypertrophy nevertheless the doubts are a pivotal muscle for enhancing a physique many hypertrophy enthusiasts and of course competitive bodybuilders wish to acquire capped 3D delts across the interwebs there's no shortage of information on how to develop the delts or any other muscle but in this video we aim to cut through the noise and provide Crystal Clear information derived from the current scientific literature on what you need to know to grow those side delts how effective are compound exercises such as overhead presses bench presses and rows for developing the side delts we'll also be examining the utility and execution of shoulder abduction exercises like lateral raises and upright rows let's Dive In there currently aren't any studies directly comparing different exercises for Sitel hypertrophy fortunately we still have solid literature from which we can infer hell to effectively develop this ideals before analyzing this literature we need to know about the principle of neuromechanical matching to optimize growth of a muscle we of course want to highly activate it with an exercise however how does your central nervous system so that's your brain and spinal cord decide what muscles to activate during an exercise think about it the biceps brachialis and brachial radiolis are three muscles that can Flex the elbow joints but in any elbow flexion exercise how does the brain and spinal cord decide to distribute activation across the three muscles it appears your brain and spinal cord preferentially activate the muscles with the best leverage during a movement this is known as the principle of neuromechanical matching the nervous system matches the recruitment of muscles to their mechanical advantage or leverage what on Earth is leverage leverage in this case refers to the muscles moment arm a muscle's moment arm is the perpendicular distance between its line of force and the center of the joint it moves a longer moment are means a muscle has a better mechanical advantage and potential to generate movement think of a heavy door imagine you're pushing this heavy door at different points we can think of the moment arm as the distance between where you push the door and the doors hinges if you push the door close to its hinges it's difficult to open the door since the moment arm is small if you push the door further away from its hinges it becomes easier to generate the required torque to open the door because the moment arm is longer thus longer moment arms enable greater torque and so once again the muscles with the best leverage that is the longest moment arms in any given exercise will likely be the once most highly activated why have I just described all this it's because we have solid research exploring the leverage the deltoids and numerous other muscles have for different movements from this we can derive conclusions about how the side delts may be most effectively trained foreign a range of compound exercises in their training program and vertical presses including overhead presses handstand push-ups and machine overhead presses are a category of compound exercises that heavily train the delts but how effective are these for developing the side delts all vertical presses involve elbow extension so we'll train the triceps but in so far as the shoulders if you're performing vertical presses with a narrower to moderate hand spacing you're predominantly performing shovel deflection if you're struggling to see how shoulder flexion occurs ignoring movement at the lower arm reveals this it's also evident vertical presses involve shoulder flexion at higher angles but how effective are these vertical presses which predominantly involve shoulder flexion for side delt hypertrophy there are a few muscles that have leverage for the movement of shoulder flexion and the side tails are one of them also it appears both segments of the side delts have leverage for shoulder flexion however the front delves are the muscle that tends to have the greatest leverage while the side delts leverage tends to be be a whole lot less very generally the front Del's Leverage is mainly three to four times greater thus following the principle of neuromechanical matching the side Tails will be activated to some degree but it likely won't be sufficient to substantially trigger side dealt hypertrophy rather the front delts will see the bulk of the stimulus what if you perform a Vertical Press with a wider grip or even with the dumbbells on either side of your head you're now predominantly performing shoulder abduction eliminating the lower arm shows this also this shoulder abduction is at higher angles there are a few muscles with leverage for the movement of shoulder abduction including the side delts and both of its segments have leverage for it at higher angles of abduction both the front and side delts appear to be the ones with the greatest leverage and they both have fairly comparable leverage thus these types of vertical presses where shoulder abduction predominantly transpires will better activate the side delts indicating it presumably will deliver great side dealt gains in the long term as as well as front delt gains of course but will it be enough for truly maxing side dealt hypertrophy in the long term I'm going to speculate probably not I think to truly up to my side out hypertrophy we'd want an exercise where it solely has the greatest leverage for carrying out movement at a single joint before analyzing what exercises achieve this let's quickly dissect how effective exercises like the bench press and rolls are for side tail development [Music] horizontal presses are another category of compound exercises that include the bench press push-ups and machine chest pressing variations and these can also involve some degree of shoulder flexion thus the side delts will be stimulated to some degree with horizontal pressures but it will most likely be quite trivial since we know the front delts are the predominant shoulder flexor on top of this horizontal presses involve shoulder horizontal flexion if you're struggling to see this ignoring the lower arm reveals this the picturesque major is the muscle that largely has the greatest leverage for shoulder horizontal flexion the side Tails actually appear to have no leverage whatsoever for this motion rather they have leveraged the shoulder horizontal extension shoulder horizontal extension can occur with horizontal pulls which include exercises like barbel rows cable rows and Australian pull-ups more precisely shoulder horizontal extension predominantly occurs when using a wider grip with these various rows thus this will train the side delse but it likely won't trigger notable side dealt hypertrophy because numerous other muscles have greater leverage for shoulder horizontal extension such as the rear delts which seemingly have up to three times The Leverage for shoulder horizontal extension versus the side delts narrower grips with horizontal pulls predominantly involve shoulder extension and the side doubts do not have leverage for this whatsoever rather we know it's involved in the opposite movement that is shoulder flexion [Music] thus far we've established various compound exercises can stimulate the side delts of notes vertical pressures particularly vertical pressures performed with a wider grip or with the dumbbells either side of your head are likely going to be great for Sitel hypertrophy but as alluded to I'm skeptical it will be enough to truly maximize sided hypertrophy long term presumably we want an exercise where the side delts largely have the greatest leverage for carrying out movement at a joint what exercise can achieve this you probably guessed it lateral raises tons of lateral raise variations exist you can perform it in different planes no I'm not talking about airplanes but rather the plane of movement lateral raises can be done in the frontal or scapular plane you can vary the bends you have in the elbow and hips you can perform it with a neutral internally or externally rotated upper arm you can also perform it with different equipment dumbbells machines and cables foreign how do various muscles contribute to shoulder abduction at different stages in the frontal and scapular planes in both these planes in the initial abduction stages 0 to 30 degrees the supraspinatus tends to have the largest leverage followed closely by the side delts and then the front delts in the middle abduction stages from 31 to 90 degrees the supraspinatus is leverage rapidly drops off and the side delts display the greatest leverage with the front delves fairly close behind in the final stages of abduction Beyond 90 degrees the supraspinatus has barely any leverage while the sidel and particularly the front delt especially in the scapular plane see increasing leverage at this stage as alluded to when dissecting overhead presses that involve predominantly shoulder abduction earlier the side and front delts appear to have fairly comparable leverages other muscles like the infraspinatus and teres minor have much smaller leverages throughout all stages what does all this information mean for lateral race execution strictly speaking this data may suggest lateral raises in the range of 30 to 90 degrees of abduction may be the best way to isolate the seidels since below 30 degrees the supraspinatus are highly involved while above 90 degrees we appear to get relatively more involvement of the front delts however I think for most people performing the exercise roughly between 0 to 90 degrees is perfectly fine the exercise is still very challenging Beyond 30 degrees which is where the side delts have predominantly the best leverage when directly comparing lateral raises in the frontal to scapular plane it's evident the leverages of the muscles are more or less similar some may be wondering about the traps no not those traps I'm talking about the trapezius the traps will naturally be activated during shoulder movement there's currently no data I'm aware of that can inform us of how trap involvement May compare between different lateral raise variations nevertheless feel free to experiment around with the different planes and even variations to find your preference interestingly quite a lot of people actually report that lateral raises in the get a plane feel better for them foreign variations such as dumbbell lateral raises enable you to use internal or external rotation as opposed to the standard neutral upper arm internally rotating your upper arm with lateral raises likely enhances recruitment of the rear delts while externally rotating your upper arm likely enhances recruitment of the front delts in fact a 2020 EMG analysis by Curry teller supports this if you followed the house of hypertrophy for a while you actually know I'm critical of surface EMG studies since it has numerous limitations and there are examples where it simply fails to predict muscle hypertrophy outcomes nevertheless I think these EMG findings are pretty logical and using surface EMG to compare subtle changes with the same exercise may be potentially more reliable compared to using EMG for comparing different exercises nevertheless I'd recommend individual stick to a fairly neutral on position if the goal is triggering Max side delt hypertrophy [Music] some individuals may like to slightly Bend at the hip during lateral raises some may also like to have a slight Bend in their elbow I'm unaware of any solid research that provides insight into whether these provide any meaningful benefit or not I will mention it's likely that excessively bending the helper will only further enhance front delt recruitment so avoiding excessive elbow bending is probably sensible if the aim is to Target the side delts ultimately feel free to experiment with bending at the hip or elbow to examine what you prefer please lateral raises can be performed with dumbbells machines and cables and that are even lying and leaning variations at the end of the day these fundamentally all involve shoulder abduction and thus are all going to be great for evoking sidel hypertrophy it's currently not clear if any other subtler differences between them could impact hypertrophy one potential difference relates to resistance curves dumbbell lateral raises involve fairly minimal tension in the initial stages of abduction while cable lateral raises involve more consistent tension throughout the abduction range of motion so the side tails are loaded more at the stretched position remember the supraspinatus is highly involved in abduction in the initial stages but the cytos are still going to be involved well in these initial stages the reason I bring all this up is that in recent years the literature indicates that exercise that train muscles in a stretched position tend to build a muscle faster there currently aren't any studies demonstrating this with adults but some individuals have used research looking at the operating range of the side doubt sarcomas to speculate this muscle should indeed benefit from stretch however I believe there are a range of limitations with research looking at the operating range of a muscle sarcomas to the point where I don't think it's that useful for informing us on whether a muscle will truly grow more with exercises attaining a stretch nonetheless hopefully we get future research examining how the side delts respond to stretch it's possible that cable lateral raises could very well be slightly better this is not to say dumbbells are useless again at the end of the day these all involve shoulder abduction and thus are all going to be great for developing the side delts in fact with the dumbbells you could experiment with partial range of motions in that initial position you won't be able to attain as great of a stretch as you can with cables and we know the supraspinatus is also going to be trained well in this range but this somewhat lengthened side dumbbell loading might still be great for developing the side delts for example we've previously analyzed this study by Pedrosa at the house of hypertrophy which found that partial range of motion leg extensions in the initial position which far from maximally stretches the quads but still trains them at a more length and position produced overall greater quad hypertrophy versus full range of motion leg extensions so perhaps partial range of motion lateral raises in that initial position are also great another option is that you could perform your dumbbell lateral raises normally with repetitions to failure and then immediately perform additional reps with a partial range of motion in that initial position feel free to experiment around if you prefer to keep things simple just select whatever lateral raise variation you prefer once again all of them fundamentally involve shoulder abduction finally within the same program or across many months of different trading Cycles you can of course vary the type of lateral raises you train with lateral razors are one of those exercises where you're never going to be lifting super heavy loads trying to go heavy can result in people using excessive momentum with poor technique don't be afraid to use lighter loads we have a multitude of studies demonstrating that provided you're performing repetitions to or near to failure reps between 6 to 35 can be similarly effective for building muscle moreover you don't need to worry about trying to increase the loads you lateral raise with every session week or even couple of months progressively overloading through increasing the number of reps you perform across workouts with the same load can be perfectly fine we've previously analyzed the 2022 study out of the USA that found across eight weeks progressively overloading through increasing the number of reps you perform with the same load was as effective for building muscle to progressively overloading by increasing the load you use with a certain rep range another alternative is to use slower repetition tempos the current evidence suggests individual rep tempos in the range of 0.5 to 8 seconds can be similarly effective for building muscle so as opposed to training with higher rep ranges with fairly normal rep speeds you could use the same light load but perform the reps with a much slower control Tempo again feel free to experiment around and find what you prefer if you're looking for further ideas about constructing a high poetry program the alpha progression app can help it has a custom workout generator that deploys training variables based on meta-analyzes and reviews from their scientific literature plus it's very flexible specify

you like it and go beyond the link gives you 20 off a subscription we don't just partner with anyone at the house of hypertrophy so rest assured the app is quality [Music] there's actually another compound exercise we've yet to mention that is likely highly effective for developing the side delts this is upright rows which involves shoulder abduction typically up to 90 or slightly more degrees their currently aren't any studies directly comparing lateral raises to Upright rules for direct sidel hypertrophy so it's not currently clear how they may compare it's possible upright rows since it involves significant scapular elevation that will highly recruit the traps is slightly less effective for the side delts but this is very much speculative if you only had to choose one for the side delves to ER on the side of caution I think lateral Raiders are probably going to be a better pick but in the real world training muscles with multiple exercises can be perfectly viable so the upper row is an exercise some people may consider some of you may be thinking isn't the upright row a dangerous exercise the guys over at E3 rehab have done a tremendous job summarizing the actual scientific literature surrounding this topic I'll leave links to their videos in the pins comment but let me speed through the main points upright rows are believed to call shoulder impingement here's the top right of the body we have the humerus and the acromion which is part of the scapula the space between the two structures is called the sub of crow meal space and within it are various tissues like the supraspinatus tendon it's still upright Rose through involving shoulder abduction with internal rotation narrow the subacromial space and result in the supraspinatus tendon being compressed causing damage by the acromion however multiple lines of research would question this and even question the whole notion of impingement as a theory firstly we'd expect the upper area of the supraspinatus to be frayed and damaged via compression from the acromion but a number of analyzes find it's predominantly the underside that shows this secondly there are very generally three acromion shapes that people may have flat curved and hooked we'd expect people with a hook shape to experience more shoulder problems due to increased frequency of impingement but the data does not support this related to this in those with subacromial pain smaller acromiohumeral distances do not appear to be associated with that pain thirdly there have been speculations stemming from a 2011 paper that if you do perform the upright rows perform it to no high higher than 90 degrees of abduction however this appears to be misguided rather it seems the smallest distance between a supraspinatus tendon and a coraco acromial arch occurs between 40 and 75 degrees in most people at 90 degrees it actually seems the supraspinatus tendon is no longer in a position to be compressed some of you may be wondering about the internal rotation with upright rows fascinatingly the same paper indicates internal rotation actually seems to increase or have no effect on a chromial humeral distances thus opposing the idea that internal rotation makes things worse given this information if impingement was the enemy we would want to avoid abducting our shoulder to 40 degrees in all instances and plain lateral raises in whatever plane you're performing it would be dangerous fourthly some have used the fact that upright roles mimic the Hawkins Kennedy test a test used to diagnose impingement as evidence that upright rows are dangerous however this test actually has poor specificity and has been described have little diagnostic value Fifth and finally shoulder decompression surgery which involves shaving down the acromion and other structures to increase the subacromial space should reduce pain and enhanced shoulder function due to reducing impingement however a solid amount of literature suggests this surgery fails to provide clinically important benefits over Placebo surgery and pain function or health-related quality of life as described in a 2021 paper the impingement theory has become Antiquated that is outdated and we would also recommend to abandon the term shoulder impingement as it refers to this mechanical Theory so in summary there simply isn't any strong evidence to support the idea that upright roads are dangerous and we have compelling days of challenging the impingement Theory as a whole when combining the front side and rear heads the delts are the largest muscle in terms of volume of the upper body fascinatingly we can actually divide the delts into seven segments there's no unanimous way to describe these segments but we may consider the front delts to be the first segment the side doubts to be the next two segments and the rear delts to be the remaining four segments many compound exercises will train this idealse most notably vertical presses particularly ones which involve wider hand spacing that necessitate shoulder abduction will likely be quite effective for growing the side delts moreover upright rows are another compound exercise that will most likely be very good for growing the seidels many fear the upright row is dangerous but we analyze the range of studies that would question this as well as the whole impingement Theory generally I do think if the aim is to maximize Saito hypertrophy some kind of lateral race is going to be helpful there are tons of lateral raise variations it's currently not clear if any particular one is truly Superior it's possible that cable lateral raises could be slightly better as this more effectively loads the side doubts in a stretched position but at the end of the day they are all likely going to be highly effective for triggering Sitel hypertrophy since they all fundamentally involve shoulder abduction in their approximate 0 to 90 degree range which is where the side delts tend to have the greatest leverage so feel free to train with your preferred lateral raise variation and execution if you're interested in the breakdown of the science of how often you should train a muscle feel free to check out this video or if you're interested in the science of rep ranges for hypertrophy feel free to check out this video"

    "title": "Can Repetition Tempo Impact Regional Muscle Growth?",
    "published_at": "2021-02-08T12:55:53Z",
    "transcript": "repetition tempo is probably one of the least thought about variables in a muscle building program repetition temper refers to the duration you perform the various muscle actions in an exercise as a random example you could perform an exercise with a three second eccentric phase zero second isometric and a one second concentric phase i recently came across research exploring if repetition tempo could impact regional muscle growth in other words could different repetition tempos produce different growth on parts of a muscle this could make sense it's possible that performing an exercise with a faster or slower tempo could activate different regions of a muscle more so than others resulting in different regional hypertrophy indeed erp and colleagues compared heavy parallel back squat training using a 75 to 90 one rep max load throughout the study to jump parallel back squat training using a 30 watermax load for a regional growth of the quadriceps muscles the jump parallel back squats were performed very far from muscular failure meaning they were just explosive jumping repetitions whereas the repetitions for the heavy parallel back squat would have been substantially slower as they were training closer to muscular failure heavy parallel back squat training produced greater upper region growth of the vastus lateralis and vastus intermedius compared to jump parallel back squat training however jump parallel back squat training resulted in greater lower region growth of the vastus lateralis and vastus intermedius given range of motion was controlled between the groups they both squatted to parallel repetition speed was probably the reason for these differences in regional growth now this study did compare strength hypertrophy style training to power style training what about the use of different repetition tempos in typical strength slash hypertrophy training programs denis and colleagues split 44 untrained women into one of four groups a five second concentric one second eccentric group a one second concentric five second eccentric group a three-second concentric three-second eccentric group or a control group the control group of course did not train and experienced no gains so we won't mention them any further the three training groups performed the knee extension for sets of six reps with a fifty percent warner max load and 180 seconds of rest between sets three times per week for ten weeks weeks one and two had the subjects perform three sets per session weeks three and four four sets per session and weeks five to ten five sets per session the five second concentric one second eccentric group performs a knee extension with a five second concentric phase and a one second eccentric phase with a one second concentric five second eccentric group performs a knee extension with a one second concentric phase and a five second eccentric phase the three second concentric three second eccentric group performs a knee extension with a three second concentric phase and a three second eccentric phase the cross-sectional area of the rectus femoris vastus medialis vastus lateralis and vastus intermedius was measured at 30 50 and 70 of the thigh length at fifty percent of the thigh length for the rectus femoris the five second concentric one second eccentric group and one second concentric five second eccentric group both experienced similar but statistically greater increases versus the 3 second concentric 3 second eccentric group there were no other statistically significant differences however looking at the overall data there potentially could be some other practically meaningful differences at seventy percent of the thigh length for the rectus femoris increases seem to favor the three second concentric three second eccentric group versus the other two groups at thirty percent of the thigh length of the vastus lateralis increases seem to favor the five second concentric one second eccentric group versus the other two groups at thirty percent of the thigh length for the vastus intermedius increases seem to favor the one second concentric five eccentric group versus the other two groups at fifty percent of the thigh length of the vastus medialis increases seem to favor the three-second concentric three-second eccentric group versus the one-second concentric 5-second eccentric group finally at 70 percent of the thigh length of the vastus medialis increases also seem to favor the three-second concentric three-second eccentric group versus the one-second concentric five-second eccentric group it is important to note that as these differences were not statistically significant we should be cautious here the observed percentage differences may just be sampling error nonetheless given there was one statistically significant difference between groups this study does suggest different repetition tempos can produce different regional growth a noteworthy limitation of this study was all three groups trained the knee extension with sets of six reps using a fifty percent wanna max load due to the differences in repetition tempo between groups they would not have been training in equal proximity to muscular failure during typical exercises such as the knee extension you are limited by your concentric strength with all else equal so the reps unload as was the case with all three groups prolonging the concentric phase would make the exercise more difficult therefore the five-second concentric one second eccentric group would have been training the closest to failure followed by the three second concentric three second eccentric group and then the one second concentric five second eccentric group this could have confounded the results perhaps some of the potential differences between groups were actually a result of differences in fatigue however remember at fifty percent of the thigh length for the rectus femoris increases were statistically greater for the five second concentric one second eccentric group and one second concentric five second eccentric group versus the three second concentric three second eccentric group the five second concentric one second eccentric group and one second concentric five second eccentric group would have been experiencing different levels of fatigue yet they experienced similar hypertrophy at this region and both greater than the 3 second concentric 3 second eccentric group indicating fatigue was probably not a factor here rather it seems repetition temper was the reason let's move on to another study by pearson and colleagues 13 well-trained men with at least three years of training experience and could squat an average of two times body weight had one leg assigned to a fast eccentric condition and their other leg assigned to a slow eccentric condition they trained each leg on the unilateral leg extension twice per week for eight weeks the leg assigned to the fast eccentric condition performs the exercise with a one second concentric and one second eccentric duration the leg assigned to the slow eccentric condition also performed the exercise with a one second concentric but they used a three second eccentric duration from weeks one to four three sets with an eight to ten rep max load was used for each leg per session from weeks five to eight four sets with an 8 to 10 rare max load was used for each leg per session as a note they alternated which leg was trained first each session thickness of the anterior thigh which included the rectus femoris and vastus medialis muscles was measured for both legs at 40 percent and 60 of the thigh length increases at 40 percent of the anterior thigh was similar between both the fast eccentric condition and slow eccentric condition however increases at 60 of the anterior thigh was statistically greater for the fast eccentric condition therefore this study suggests that one second eccentric duration on the knee extension preferentially stimulates the vastus medialis and rectus femoris at 60 of the thigh length supporting the idea different repetition tempos may induce different regional growth to sum up we do indeed have some evidence different repetition tempos can influence regional muscle growth that said only two of them evaluated repetition tempo during standard strength slash hypertrophy training styles so it isn't overwhelming evidence however if you were to use a variety of repetition tempos in your training program at the very least muscle growth should not be harmed a meta-analysis by schoenfeld and colleagues found that so long as reps were performed too or close to muscular failure probably at least two to three reps away from failure repetition durations ranging from 0.5 seconds to 8 seconds produces similar whole muscle growth and at best as we've seen different repetition tempos may induce different regional growth resulting in more uniform muscle hypertrophy i think this is quite an interesting area i hope more research eventually comes out here if it does happen i definitely plan to make updated videos [Music]"

    "title": "Stretch Between Sets for More Hypertrophy? (New Research)",
    "published_at": "2021-10-17T12:10:37Z",
    "transcript": "For those of you who have been following this\nchannel for a while, you might know that approximately 13 months ago, I created a video on whether\nstretching in between sets could enhance muscle hypertrophy. In the video, we explored a study by Evangelista\net al. that essentially found in previously untrained men, performing 30 seconds of pain-free\nstatic stretching between sets for the main muscle in an exercise resulted in greater\nincreases in muscle thickness measurements. At the time that video was published, that\nwas the only single published study examining stretching in between sets. Since then, 2 new studies have come out adding\nto the literature on stretching in between sets and hypertrophy. One study by Nakamura et al. examined the\noutcomes of static stretching between sets in previously untrained men, while the second\nstudy by Wadhi et al. assessed the outcomes of weighted stretching between sets in trained\nmen. Let us first overview the study by Nakamura\net al. 16 untrained men had one leg assigned to a\nstretching condition and their other leg to a traditional condition. They trained the bilateral squat with an inertial\nflywheel for 3 sets of 10 repetitions, using 3 minutes of rest between sets, twice per\nweek for 5 weeks. For those unaware, an inertial flywheel actually\noverloads the lowering (termed eccentric) phase of the movement. With the leg assigned to the stretching condition,\nduring the 3-minute rest interval between sets, they stretched the quadriceps for 30\nseconds, rested for 30 seconds, stretched the quadriceps for a further 30 seconds, and\nthen rested for the remaining 90 seconds before commencing the next set. With the leg assigned to the traditional condition,\nit performed no stretching and rested for the 3-minute rest intervals between sets. Before and after the study, muscle thickness\nof the vastus lateralis, vastus medialis, rectus femoris, lateral region of the vastus\nintermedius, and medial region of the vastus intermedius were each measured at an upper\nand lower region. Furthermore, thickness of the hamstrings and\ngluteus maximus was each measured at a single region. The researchers found that for all regions\nand muscles measured, changes in thickness were statistically similar between the stretching\nand traditional condition, indicating that stretching in between sets may not enhance\nmuscle hypertrophy. As a result, this study does not agree with\nthe original findings by Evangelista et al. Let us progress to overviewing the second\nstudy by Wadhi et al. 26 men with an average of 3 years of training\nexperience were allocated into a stretching or traditional group. Both groups trained twice per week for 8 weeks. Each session, the flat bench press and incline\nbench press were trained. Throughout the 8 weeks of training, they progressed\nfrom performing 3 sets per exercise to performing 5 sets. On training day one of each week, they aimed\nto perform 4-6 repetitions that were approximately 2 repetitions away from failure each set. Although the final set on the incline bench\npress was executed to failure. On training day two of each week, they aimed\nto perform 8-10 repetitions approximately 2 repetitions away from failure each set. Although, again, the final set on the incline\nbench press was executed to failure. When necessary, the load was adjusted on each\nset and over sessions to ensure subjects continued to train within the prescribed repetition\nranges, and at the same proximity from failure. The traditional group rested passively for\n2 minutes between their sets in a session. The stretching group similarly rested for\n2 minutes between sets in a session. However, for the first 30 seconds of this\nrest interval, they performed a loaded chest stretch on a cable machine, using approximately\n15% of the load they just used on the prior set. Also, subjects were instructed not to produce\nany active tension from the chest, rather let the chest be maximally be stretched by\nthe load. Before and after the study, thickness of the\npectoralis major at the belly, and at a lateral portion, was measured. What the researchers found was that increases\nat both regions of the pectoralis major were statistically similar between the stretching\nand traditional groups, suggesting weighted stretching between sets may not enhance muscle\nhypertrophy. So, combining these two new studies with the\nEvangelista study, and it now seems the ever so slight majority of the evidence indicates\nthat stretching in between sets might not help you build more muscle. Having said this, there still are some important\nconsiderations. These three studies, although generally looking\nat the effectiveness of stretching in between sets, are quite different from one another. The Wadhi study examined weighted stretching\nin between sets in trained men, whereas the other two papers by Nakamura and Evangelista\nexamined unload static stretching between sets in previously untrained men. Furthermore, if we more directly compared\nthe Nakamura and Evangelista studies, which have conflicting results, there are some potentially\nnoteworthy differences. Firstly, the Nakamura study used an inertial\nflywheel squat exercise, which as we've noted applies eccentric overload, whereas the Evangelista\nstudy used typical free weight and machine exercises, like the leg extension. Could these different exercise modalities\nsomehow explain the conflicting results? Secondly, in the Evangelista study, in which\nstretching was found to benefit muscle hypertrophy, they had subjects stretch for 30 seconds during\nthe rest intervals. Contrastingly, the Nakamura study had subjects\nstretch for 2 bouts of 30 seconds during each rest interval, totaling 60 seconds of static\nstretching in between sets. The reason this could matter is that longer\nduration static stretching appears to reduce muscle force production, and this could negatively\ninfluence the hypertrophic stimulus. For example, Siatras et al. found that stretching\nthe quadriceps for 60 seconds resulted in greater decreases in quadriceps force output\nversus stretching for 30 seconds. As a result, perhaps the reason the Nakamura\nstudy failed to find a benefit to static stretching in between sets was that subjects stretched\nfor a total of 60 seconds between sets. Perhaps a 30-second stretch instead, as used\nin the Evangelista study, is the ideal duration to induce enhancements in muscle growth. However, it's worth remembering that the Wadhi\nstudy, in which weighted stretching was employed, did use a 30-second stretching duration between\nsets, yet found no benefits for hypertrophy. All in all, it's clear to see that future\nresearch will still be of great benefit for trying to tease out the details on if and\nhow stretching in between sets could enhance muscle growth. Now, it's potentially worth discussing the\nfact that all the current three studies that have examined stretching in between sets have\nmeasured muscle growth via muscle thickness. Muscle thickness only measures one dimension\nof the whole muscle. How would the results of these studies look\nif they used an alternative muscle growth measurement? What if researchers measured cross-sectional\narea, (which measured two dimensions), volume (which measures three dimensions), or even\nsomething like fascicle length. I think the fascicle length measurement is\nan interesting one. As we've described in a previous video, an\nincrease in fascicle length likely reflects an increase in the length of muscle fibers,\nas muscle fibers are within fascicles. As we saw in that video, it appears stretching\nstimuli can induce increases in muscle fiber length. Furthermore, although not a unanimous finding\nin the research, some human evidence indicates intense static stretching protocols produce\nincreases in fascicle length (which presumably reflects an increase in muscle fiber length). This brings up the interesting question, could\nstretching in between sets be a tool to help increase muscle fiber length? Hopefully, future research can examine this. -\nAs a final section for this video, viewers may be interested in how stretching in between\nsets impacts strength adaptations. Many people would think, and justifiably so,\nthat given static stretching can decrease the force output of a muscle, stretching in\nbetween sets would reduce the strength adaptations you experience. However, the long-term research does not appear\nto strongly support this. In the Evangelista study, they found similar\nincreases in bench press and leg extension one-rep max between the group that stretched\npain-free for 30 seconds between sets and the group that rested passively. In the Nakamura study, they decided to look\nat one-rep max on the leg press, peak concentric, eccentric, and isometric torque on a leg extension\ndynamometer. Except for isometric torque, increases in\nthese strength measures were statistically similar between the stretching and traditional\nconditions. Intriguingly, the isometric torque increases\nwere greater for the stretching condition. Finally, in the Wadhi study, increases in\nbench press one-rep max were similar between the group that weighted stretched between\nsets and the group that rested passively. Therefore, the majority of the current data\nindicate stretching in between sets might not deleteriously influence strength adaptations,\nat least within the confines of the protocols used in the respective studies. To conclude the video, since the publication\nof the study by Evangelista, suggesting stretching in between sets could enhance muscle growth,\ntwo new studies now indicate stretching in between sets may not help build more muscle. However, these three studies are fairly heterogeneous,\nmeaning that future research will be of great value for teasing out if and how stretching\nin between sets could actually enhance muscle hypertrophy. I am aware of at least one study currently\nbeing conducted examining the outcomes weighted stretching in between sets. According to the author, it should be published\nby the end of 2021. So, hopefully, I'll be creating an updated\nversion of this video in the future. Thank you for watching. As always, I hope you found the video helpful\nor informative in some way."

    "published_at": "2022-02-03T12:00:21Z",
    "transcript": "in other words the subjects experienced between two to ten times more strength gains in just over half the time simply by being misled into thinking they were on in this video i'm not actually going to examine the scientific research directly exploring if tercesterone works instead i want to bring the viewers attention to the extremely interesting science on why something works even if it doesn't first things first if you're actually interested in the current research on tercestrone's effects on hypertrophy and strength i'll leave a link to an excellent discussion between jeff nippard and dr eric trexler discussing all you need to know in the description my summary is that simply is weak and limited evidence currently exploring the effectiveness of tercesterone matter of fact there is not actually a single long-term study in humans examining how tercesterone precisely impacts hypertrophy and strength the most commonly referenced human research has merely examined structurally similar compounds to testosterone but not precisely terkestrone now some of you may be thinking sure the scientific evidence currently fails to provide compelling evidence on tercosterone's effectiveness but there are tons and tons of individuals out there claiming to have experienced greater hypertrophy and strength gains thanks to tercesterone from reddit to youtube comment sections and even from the review section of your favorite doctor's website surely this is good enough probably not the problem with relying on individuals experiences is there could potentially be an array of confounding factors upon taking tercasterone might the individual have unconsciously or even consciously altered other variables might they have started training with more effort altering their nutrition sleeping more or might the placebo effect just have taken place that is they believed they were going to see an effect so they did well-designed scientific studies enable us to control these variables to degrees simply not possible when combining numerous experiences from individuals in this video i wanted to zone in on the placebo effect as i truly believe this effect should not be underestimated now i want to make it clear that by no means am i definitively saying tercastrone is all placebo it's completely possible future data could very well come out and validate the claims many have been making surrounding terchesterone however at this time at least i believe the power of the placebo effect should be considered imagine you're researching terkesterone reading the numerous anecdotal accounts you run across you come across individuals claiming to have put on x and y amounts of lean body mass and strength some individuals even claim they're as potent as anabolic steroids this all excites you you start believing that if you two take terkesterone freakish gains are possible when your fresh new bottle of terkestrone arrives you expect your gains to supersede what you've experienced before how much do these expectations and these expectations alone influence the gains you experience based on two fascinating studies i'd argue a lot more than people would think let's dive in and explore the data let us travel back to 1973 where two researchers by the name of ariel and savile aim to answer the question just how much of the effects of anabolic steroids are a result of the placebo effect 15 male versity athletes with at least 2 years of weight training experience first trained for 7 weeks during this period those that made the largest gains in one rep max strength on the bench press seated press standing press and squat would be rewarded with free access to steroids to use during a subsequent four week training period as the researchers promised six subjects of the initial 15 were selected to train for a further four weeks while given a 10 milligram pill of dianabol an anabolic steroid to take daily however the subjects were unaware that this was a complete sham the pill they took was a placebo pill it was not actually dianaball the results were truly surprising after the initial seven training weeks where the six subjects were not taking any placebo pill their one rep max's increased by an average of 4.35 kilograms for the bench press 0.73 kilograms for the standing press 2.27 kilograms for the seated press and 2.65 kilograms for the squat but after the four weeks in which the subjects took the daily placebo pills their warning max's increased by an average of 13.28 kilograms on the bench press 7.58 kilograms on the standing press 5.3 kilograms on the seated press and 18.94 kilograms on the squat in other words the subjects experienced between 2 to 10 times more strength gains in just over half the time simply by being misled into thinking they were on anabolic steroids even though they were merely consuming placebo pills another study by maguinaris and colleagues conducted in 2000 provides us with no less of a surprising insight into the power of the placebo the lead author of the study was a powerlifting coach previously his athletes precisely 11 nationally ranked powerlifters had asked the coach about the effectiveness of anabolic steroids which inspired the coach to conduct their study first the researchers assessed the subject's baseline warner and maxis on the bench press score and deadlift note their average one rep maxes were 189 kilograms for the bench press 257 kilograms for the squat and 260 kilograms for the deadlift so they were pretty damn strong [Music] in the first experimental session five minutes before testing one rep max on the bench press squat and deadlift the subjects were given two tablets and told they were immediate acting anabolic steroids however this was a sham the pills were simply placebo more precisely they simply contained saccharin after taking these two pills all subjects hit personal records the subjects one red maxes were an average 9.5 kilograms higher on the bench press 12.2 kilograms higher on the squat and 10.9 kilograms higher on the deadlift versus baseline fascinatingly the authors noted these performance increases represented a change from being nationally ranked to being internationally ranked for all subjects put another way simply thinking they took immediate acting anabolic steroids instantly elevated the subject's strength abilities to seriously impressive levels after this first experimental session all subjects were provided with two more placebo pills to use during their upcoming trading week during this week all subjects reported increased vigor and that they were lifting heavier lows or performing more repetitions than ever before in the second experimental session after the week of training warner max on the bench press score and deadlift was measured yet again however before the one rep max test some subjects were actually told the pills they took were merely a placebo these subjects compared to the first experimental session lifted 7.5 kilograms or less on the bench press 11 kilograms or less on the squat and 12.5 kilograms or less on the deadlift in other words despite them performing better than ever before in the first experimental session and the training week the simple revelation they had only been consuming a placebo all along plummeted their strength back down to their baseline the other subjects who remained unaware the pills they were taking were placebos did not really make any further gains on average but roughly maintain the impressive gains they experienced compared to the baseline values in my eyes the results of these two studies are truly astonishing and depict the sheer potential power of the placebo as a brief interlude it's worth noting that the only reason i'm aware of these data is that greg knuckles of stronger by science who i'm not in any way affiliated to detail these two studies in an awesome article on the science of steroids a few years back i'll leave a link to that article in the description returning on topic i think the two studies underscore that with any given supplement even anabolic steroids if you have an expectation it will work profoundly it's more than likely at least some degree of the gains you experience can be attributed towards this mere expectation now by no stretch of the imagination am i saying that anabolic steroids are all placebo it's well established that anabolic steroids mechanistically work for example basin and colleagues established that after 10 weeks merely injecting 600 milligrams of testosterone weekly without lifting weights produce larger quadriceps area triceps area and fat-free mass gains compared to lifting weights naturally what i am saying though is it probably is more than likely some degree of gains experienced with anabolic steroids can be attributed to the mere expectations of the user moreover when discussing supplements that simply do not currently have long-term human data supporting their effectiveness and we have numerous anecdotes announcing their effectiveness it's truly difficult to ascertain how much of this is attributed to the placebo effect it might just very well be most of it finally and separate from discussing supplements i think these two studies provide insight into just how much our expectations might influence outcomes with anything how much might an individual be restricting their potential based on their expectations perhaps we're all capable of a lot more than we think in any realm if we could detach from our current expectations and adapt expectations beyond what we previously perceived to be possible we might just experience what we thought we never could"

    "title": "Biceps Curls With NO WEIGHT Build Muscle Optimally (Study)",
    "published_at": "2021-09-01T13:58:34Z",
    "transcript": "Biceps curls are most commonly performed with\u00a0\nweights, be it with dumbbells or barbells. However, what if you saw someone doing this in the\u00a0\u00a0 gym (show image of lifting no weight),\u00a0\nbicep curling without any weight? What if I told you that this can build muscle? I'm not just talking about a\u00a0\nsmall degree of muscle growth,\u00a0\u00a0 rather potentially a similar amount\u00a0\nto bicep curling with weight. Sounds crazy right? But let's examine a study by Counts\u00a0\net al. that inspired this video. 5 men and 8 women, all previously untrained,\u00a0\nhad one arm assigned to a no-load condition\u00a0\u00a0 and their other arm assigned\u00a0\nto a high load condition. Both arms were trained three times per\u00a0\nweek (on non-consecutive days) for 6 weeks. With the arm that was assigned to the no-load\u00a0\ncondition, they performed a biceps curl with no\u00a0\u00a0 actual weight, but they aimed to squeeze and\u00a0\nmaximally contract the biceps throughout the\u00a0\u00a0 curling movement. They did this for 4 sets of 20\u00a0\nrepetitions with 30 seconds of rest between sets. Electrodes were placed on the biceps to give\u00a0\nfeedback of its activation, thereby encouraging\u00a0\u00a0 participants to further maximally contract\u00a0\nthe muscle throughout the range of motion. With the opposite arm assigned to the high load\u00a0\ncondition, they performed a dumbbell biceps curl\u00a0\u00a0 with 70% of their one-repetition maximum.\u00a0\nThey did this for 4 sets of 8-12 repetitions\u00a0\u00a0 with 90 seconds of rest between sets. Thickness of the biceps was\u00a0\nmeasured at three regions,\u00a0\u00a0 roughly 50, 60, and 70% of the upper arm length. What the researchers found was that\u00a0\nat all three regions of the biceps,\u00a0\u00a0 growth was similar between the no-load\u00a0\ncondition and high-load condition. In other words, biceps curls with no load, but\u00a0\ntrying to squeeze and maximally activate the\u00a0\u00a0 biceps throughout the curling motion resulted\u00a0\nin similar gains to regular dumbbell curls. These results are extremely interesting,\u00a0\u00a0 before we speculate why this occurred,\u00a0\nlet's first address some limitations. Firstly, some may suggest\u00a0\nthat the results of this study\u00a0\u00a0 could be explained by the cross-education effect. For those unaware, this is where\u00a0\ntraining *only* one side of your body,\u00a0\u00a0 can increase the strength and size of\u00a0\nthe opposite untrained side of your body,\u00a0\u00a0 we have a whole video dedicated\u00a0\nto this at House of Hypertrophy. Therefore, some may suggest the\u00a0\nmuscle growth for the no-load arm\u00a0\u00a0 was due to the cross-education effect obtained\u00a0\nfrom training their other arm with high loads. However, muscle growth seems to be extremely\u00a0\nlittle with the cross-education effect. For instance, this study by Hubal\u00a0\net al. had 243 men and 342 women\u00a0\u00a0 train only one of their biceps with\u00a0\nunilateral preacher and concentration curls. The trained bicep increased in\u00a0\ncross-sectional area by an average of 18.9%.\u00a0\u00a0 However, the untrained bicep only increased\u00a0\nin cross-sectional area by an average of 0.2%. Therefore,\u00a0\u00a0 it's highly unlikely the cross-education\u00a0\neffect confounds the results of this study. Moreover, as noted by Counts et al., it seems the\u00a0\ncross-education effect is minimal or nonexistent\u00a0\u00a0 when both sides of the body are trained with\u00a0\ndifferent protocols, as was done in the study. Another potential limitation is the use\u00a0\nof different rest interval durations.\u00a0\u00a0 Recall the no-load arm performed 4 sets of 20\u00a0\nrepetitions with 30 seconds of rest between sets,\u00a0\u00a0 while the high load arm performed 4 sets of 8-12\u00a0\nrepetitions with 90 seconds of rest between sets. Some may suggest that the use of shorter\u00a0\nrest intervals with the no-load arm\u00a0\u00a0 is better for building muscle. This is a possibility, however, this claim itself\u00a0\nis not completely supported by the research.\u00a0\u00a0 We have a whole video dedicated to the research on\u00a0\nrest intervals for muscle growth on the channel. As we noted, with isolation exercises\u00a0\n(which is what a biceps curl is)\u00a0\u00a0 research is conflicting on whether\u00a0\nshort or long rest intervals are better.\u00a0\u00a0 Opposingly, with compound exercises,\u00a0\nlonger rest intervals appear to be better. Therefore, all in all, it's hard to say if the\u00a0\nuse of different rest intervals in this study\u00a0\u00a0 meaningfully impacted the results. A final and notable limitation is that this study\u00a0\u00a0 was conducted on individuals with\u00a0\nno previous training experience.\u00a0\u00a0 Therefore, we can't be certain if the results of\u00a0\nthis study can be applied to trained individuals. Nevertheless, let us now explore the\u00a0\npotential reason for the study's results. I should note that if the following reasoning\u00a0\nis true, then the findings of this study\u00a0\u00a0 may indeed apply to trained individuals. Currently, mechanical tension is the\u00a0\nbest-categorized stimulus for muscle growth. Mechanical tension is simply equal\u00a0\nto the force generated by a muscle. Active tension is one important component of\u00a0\nmechanical tension. Passive tension is the other,\u00a0\u00a0 but for this video, we can ignore passive tension. Active tension is the force generated\u00a0\nby the contractile units of a muscle. To understand this, we first need to\u00a0\nunderstand the basics of a muscle's structure. Muscles are organized in hierarchical\u00a0\u00a0 layers (create an image with\u00a0\nnumber list (or arrow diagram). Within a whole muscle are\u00a0\nfascicles, within fascicles\u00a0\u00a0 are muscle fibers, and within\u00a0\nmuscle fibers are myofibrils. Myofibrils consist of an array of sarcomeres, and\u00a0\nsarcomeres are the contractile units of a muscle.\u00a0\u00a0 In other words, they are what\u00a0\nproduce a muscle's force. More precisely, when something\u00a0\ncalled the myosin head,\u00a0\u00a0 extends from the myosin filament and pulls\u00a0\non something called the actin filament\u00a0\u00a0 towards the M-line, the sarcomere\u00a0\nshortens and generates force. Something called mechanosensors\u00a0\u00a0 detects this force and goes on to initiate a\u00a0\nsignaling cascade that results in muscle growth. Zooming out, we can see that high levels of active\u00a0\ntension is a result of two components: the number\u00a0\u00a0 of muscle fibers recruited and the amount of\u00a0\nforce generated by these recruited muscle fibers. A high number of muscle fibers recruited\u00a0\nmeans more sarcomeres are generating force,\u00a0\u00a0 while a higher amount of force generated\u00a0\nby these recruited muscle fibers\u00a0\u00a0 means the sarcomeres are\u00a0\ngenerating a high amount of force. When training conventionally with weights, as\u00a0\nyou get closer and closer to failure (the point\u00a0\u00a0 at which you cannot perform any more repetitions\u00a0\nwith a given weight), the number of muscle fibers\u00a0\u00a0 recruited, as well as the force generated\u00a0\nby some recruited muscle fibers increases. Therefore, getting close to failure with\u00a0\na given weight creates high levels of\u00a0\u00a0 active tension. As a side note, this is\u00a0\nlikely why both heavy and light loads\u00a0\u00a0 can produce similar muscle growth, as discussed in\u00a0\nother videos on the House of Hypertrophy channel. Now, here's the main point, you can likely achieve\u00a0\nhigh levels of active tension without any weight. By simply moving a muscle through a range\u00a0\nof motion while simultaneously trying to\u00a0\u00a0 maximally contract and squeeze the muscle, you\u00a0\nare forcing the recruitment of many muscle fibers\u00a0\u00a0 as well as high force production by\u00a0\nmany muscle fibers. Put differently,\u00a0\u00a0 you are self-inducing high\u00a0\nlevels of active tension. Perhaps this explains why no-load bicep curls\u00a0\u00a0 may be as effective as normal\u00a0\nbicep curls with weights. This brings up a fascinating question: are weights\u00a0\u00a0 (or any other kind of external resistance)\u00a0\neven needed to achieve optimal muscle growth? If performing exercises where\u00a0\nyou simply maximally contract\u00a0\u00a0 and squeeze a muscle throughout a range of motion\u00a0\nprovides a sufficient muscle-building stimulus,\u00a0\u00a0 perhaps external resistances are not needed. Of course, it's essential\u00a0\nto recognize these thoughts\u00a0\u00a0 are based on a single study. This is anything\u00a0\nbut definitive and overwhelming evidence. Hopefully, we get more research in\u00a0\nthe future exploring this further,\u00a0\u00a0 so we can truly gain a greater understanding of\u00a0\nhow effective this may be, especially in trained\u00a0\u00a0 individuals. I most definitely plan to make\u00a0\nfuture videos if any new research comes out. Finally, it's worth mentioning\u00a0\nthat maximally contracting and\u00a0\u00a0 squeezing a muscle through a range\u00a0\nof motion is far from easy. Remember,\u00a0\u00a0 you're trying to produce as much\u00a0\nforce with the muscle as possible. In the Counts et al. study, it seems much\u00a0\nof the subjects found that with a few of\u00a0\u00a0 the sets, no-load training was harder and more\u00a0\nuncomfortable than training with the dumbbell. I highly recommend anyone to try out no-load\u00a0\ntraining at least once, I think you'll notice\u00a0\u00a0 how challenging it can be. Additionally,\u00a0\nyou may even notice quite a decent pump. Thank you for making it to the end of the\u00a0\nvideo, I hope the video was interesting\u00a0\u00a0 and informative. Any of the following\u00a0\ncan significantly help out the channel:\u00a0\u00a0 a comment, like, or share. Thank you again!"

    "transcript": "everyone knows if you get people to train not everyone sees the same gains for example this paper recruited 585 individuals and had them train their biceps for 12 weeks a fair number of individuals or biceps gains close to 20 but some saw as much as in their 50 increase and some actually experienced a five percent loss in size why after all all subjects trained identically exposing the muscle to Mechanical tension which we know to likely be the primary hypertrophy stimulus as detailed in another video genetics is often the default answer for sure there is evidence variation in genetic factors impact hypertrophy yet various physiological factors likely help explain why some grow more than others capillary density is one example the eidetic capillaries may be important for hypertrophy suggest under certain cases cardiovascular training might benefit long-term hypertrophy an idea we examined previously Androgen receptors are another popular one this will be the focus of today's video androgens such as testosterone produce the effects they do through Androgen receptors Androgen receptors are within cells including muscle fibers and androgens such as testosterone bind to Androgen receptors and events unfolding thereafter produce the physiological effects we associate with androgens like an increase in myofibular protein synthesis which is the creation of the proteins that make muscle fibers bigger it's logical having more Androgen receptors allows more of a person's antigens to be directed towards building muscle in fact in individuals using special supplements their traps and delts may grow disproportionately more massive traps and delts are often considered a Telltale sign they view special supplements the reason for this might be since the traps and delts tend to have more Androgen receptors enabling the exogenous supplements to more effectively produce hypertrophy in these muscle regions but what about the role of Androgen receptors in natural individuals one specific study is often utilized to suggest angiogen receptors play a crucial role in hypertrophy in natural individuals and a specific supplement is often recommended to increase Androgen receptor density naturally let's analyze all the data on Androgen receptors and hypertrophy with the aim of answering how scientifically supported is the idea that people with more Androgen receptors always grow more if Androgen receptors are important for hypertrophy are there any truly evidence-based ways or supplements to increase them foreign the most frequently cited paper on Androgen receptors is this 2018 one from Canada 49 trained men were recruited to perform resistance training four days a week for 12 weeks training increased to lean mass as well as slow and fast touch fiber sizes extracted from the vastus lateralis muscle before presenting the Androgen receptor data it's interesting to know the researchers examined the relationship between a range of resting hormone concentrations and muscle hypertrophy by backward elimination regression fundamentally the analysis did not find a relationship between any of the resting hormones and muscle hypertrophy so that includes total testosterone as well as free testosterone so those with higher overall levels of total of free testosterone did not necessarily see more hypertrophy than those with lower levels an idea we've explored in more depth in a prior video with Androgen receptors the researchers divided the subjects into high and low responders and found higher responders tended to have greater Androgen receptor content pooling the data of the high and low responders there were linear relationships between Androgen receptor content and lean mass slow twitch fiber and fast twitch fiber gains therefore this study suggests Androgen receptors may be one thing that delineates a hard Gainer from an easy Gainer despite this study being widely utilized in support of Androgen receptors for hypertrophy fewer people are aware of this other 2018 study out of the USA 67 untrained men trained a range of exercises with these variables after the study the researchers categorized subjects either as high responders moderate responders or low responders based on how much they grew their vastus lateralis total testosterone levels measured before and after training were comparable between the low moderate and high responders further supporting the idea those with higher testosterone levels do not always see greater gains however Androgen receptor content was also similar between the low moderate and high responders suggesting Androgen receptors may not be that important for hypertrophy so what are we to make of this hypertrophy is evidently multifactorial and it can be difficult for a study to successfully find what these variables are since there are so many moving Parts my current thoughts are although this second study fails to suggest Androgen receptors delineate high from low responders given there are so many moving Parts it alone isn't enough to debunk the whole idea Androgen receptors are important for hypertrophy it's potentially worth pointing out the first study was conducted on trained individuals while the second study was conducted on untrained individuals on top of this less known to most people as well we do have other studies linking Androgen receptors through hypertrophy in slightly different ways [Music] in both the previously mentioned studies Androgen receptor content did not increase with the resistance training but other Studies have found that resistance training naturally can sometimes increase adro receptor content some data Associates this angular receptor content increase with muscle hypertrophy specifically this 2011 study from Finland had untrained younger and older men trained twice a week for 21 weeks the change in Androgen receptor content experienced by the subjects correlated with their muscle fibercise gains as well as lean mass gains in other words the subjects that tended to increase their Androgen receptor content from resistance training the most tended to experience the best muscle fiber and lean mass gains another 2013 Canadian study observed similar things 23 untrained men trained four times per week for 16 weeks there was a correlation between changes in Androgen receptor content and muscle fibercise increases thus these two studies link the ability to increase Androgen receptor content with muscle hypertrophy which is a slightly different association between Androgen receptor content and hypertrophy the initial study found now it's worth mentioning all the data examined so far are merely associational and and based on comparisons between people so strictly speaking it isn't sufficient to prove that increasing a single person's Androgen receptor content definitively increases their muscle mass more controlled studies are technically needed to establish such a conclusion interestingly though there are animal studies that demonstrate if you block their Androgen receptors the amount of muscle hypertrophy and strength gains they experience from resistance exercise is diminished the implication of most of the data assessed throughout this video is that increasing Androgen receptor content might benefit muscle hypertrophy but as I said more quality data is needed to establish true causation between Androgen receptors and hypertrophy nonetheless can you increase Androgen receptor content as we've seen although some studies fail to find resistance training increases Androgen receptor content we do have documented instances where lifting weights naturally produces an increase in Androgen receptor content it's not clear what precise training variables might optimize Androgen receptor content gains I'm wondering if what increases antigen receptor content differs between people and if this could be one explanation for individual differences in the optimal training program as I plan to explore in a book I'm working on the optimal training variables for evoking muscle hypertrophy can substantially vary between people and maybe this is because what increases a regulator of hypertrophy for one per person such as Androgen receptor content doesn't do the same thing in another individual rather a different set of training variables optimizes their Androgen receptor content however this is currently extremely speculative and nowhere near a definitive conclusion speaking of individual differences tracking your own training over time is highly useful for individualizing your training an alpha progression is an excellent app that helps this process your progression can be tracked with graphs allowing you to analyze long-term correlations between your training variables and progression rates you can input your program or try out their extremely flexible custom workout

description gets you two weeks free of all the app's features plus 20 off a subscription the house of hypertrophy will get 50 if you do purchase the app and this sincerely helps support these videos thank you does el carnitine El tartrate increase Androgen receptor content it is widely believed it does a belief stemming from this 2006 study from the USA 10 trained men were supplied with either L-Carnitine El tartrate or a placebo after 21 days resting Androgen receptor content was higher in the subjects taking L-Carnitine El tartrates however the problem is this is only one study the fact is one study can never be proof for something and this point is even more relevant in a supplement World take the example of de-aspartic acid in 2009 the first human study established that d-aspartic acid increased testosterone by 42 percent subsequently supplement companies sold the aspartic acid as a scientifically supported way to increase testosterone yet Six studies over the subsequent years failed to find d-aspartic acid increase testosterone one of them actually found a decreased testosterone while the other five found no effect I'm not saying future studies will come out failing to find L-Carnitine l-tartrate works there is no way to know until more data is published what I am saying though is just because one study supports the effectiveness of a supplement in no way can this qualify as definitive proof upon searching for ways to increase Androgen receptor content online you may come across claims intermittent fasting helps one article references data that didn't even directly explore Androgen receptor content rather the data was the short-term effects of intermittent fasting on testosterone to my knowledge no long-term day data explores the effects of intermittent fasting on Androgen receptor content the same article suggests caffeine may increase Androgen receptor content but the reference study was conducted on rats as far as I know no human data has explored the long-term association between caffeine and androgen receptor content Androgen receptors may play a role in muscle hypertrophy in natural individuals the precise role is somewhat murky though one study finds an association between resting levels of Androgen receptor content and muscle hypertrophy while two other studies find an association between Androgen receptor content increases with training and subsequent muscle hypertrophy we also have animal studies finding if you block Androgen receptors the amount of hypertrophy and strength they experience from training decreases there currently isn't any clear way to increase Androgen receptor content one study suggests L-Carnitine l-tartrate may do this but the problem is it's only one study the example of d-aspartic acid helps us understand why this is potentially problematic resistance training itself can produce increases in Androgen receptor content but it's not clear how consistent or individualized this effect is claims that intermittent fasting and caffeine increase Androgen receptor content lack long-term human data to verify this so unfortunately there isn't a proactive cool takeaway from this video however knowledge in itself is useful especially when misinformation pervades the Fitness Nutrition and supplement world I hope this video helps you understand the current science on Androgen receptors I also hope this video encourages you to be a little more skeptical about things even though something may be purported to be evidence-based actually being aware of what the evidence is precisely is needed for knowing the big picture this is my aim with the house of hypertrophy to help individuals understand the full picture of their scientific literature on various topics as always links to the studies in the video can be found in the description finally I have a free Ultimate Guide to bench pressing ebook that covers these areas feel free to get it in the link in the comments and description

    "published_at": "2021-10-04T11:05:09Z",
    "transcript": "Within the fitness world, there seem to\u00a0\nbe diverse opinions on how many sets a\u00a0\u00a0 person should perform to build muscle optimally. On one end of the spectrum, some believe a\u00a0\nlow number of sets are sufficient, with some\u00a0\u00a0 even proposing 1 set of repetitions to failure\u00a0\nper exercise is all you need to build muscle. On the other end of the spectrum,\u00a0\nothers suggest that so long as\u00a0\u00a0 you can successfully recover from\u00a0\nit, more sets mean more stimulus,\u00a0\u00a0 thus the higher number of sets you can\u00a0\nperform the better for muscle growth. However, what does scientific research say? Before exploring the research, it's useful to get\u00a0\nsome definitions and technical points out the way. In this video, a set is defined as a\u00a0\nbout of repetitions between 8 and 12,\u00a0\u00a0 performed 3 or fewer repetitions\u00a0\nfrom the point of failure.\u00a0\u00a0 This is what pretty much all the research\u00a0\nwe'll explore in this video used as a set. Furthermore, in this video,\u00a0\nwe'll actually be exploring\u00a0\u00a0 how many weekly sets you may want to\u00a0\nbe performing for each muscle group. Any exercise that involves a muscle group as\u00a0\u00a0 a prime mover will count towards\u00a0\nthat muscles group's weekly sets. For example, in a compound\u00a0\nexercise like the bench press,\u00a0\u00a0 the chest, triceps, and deltoid muscles are\u00a0\nprime movers. Thus, one set on the bench press\u00a0\u00a0 will count towards 1 set for the chest, 1 set\u00a0\nfor the triceps, and 1 set for the deltoids. Also, any isolation exercises\u00a0\nthat target a specific muscle\u00a0\u00a0 group will of course count towards\u00a0\nthat muscle group's weekly set count.\u00a0\u00a0 For instance, 1 set on the triceps skull crusher\u00a0\nwill count towards 1 set for your triceps. Okay, let us now explore the research on\u00a0\nhow many weekly sets you should perform\u00a0\u00a0 per muscle group to maximize muscle hypertrophy. Kicking things off, the results from a\u00a0\nmeta-analysis by Schoenfeld et al. seem\u00a0\u00a0 to indicate that the more sets performed for a\u00a0\nmuscle group per week, the more muscle growth. Based on data from 15 studies,\u00a0\u00a0 each additional weekly set was associated\u00a0\nwith an 0.37% increase in muscle size. Furthermore, performing 9 or more weekly\u00a0\nsets for a muscle group produced more\u00a0\u00a0 muscle hypertrophy than fewer than 9 weekly sets. However, there are two important\u00a0\nconsiderations with this meta-analysis. Firstly, the majority of the studies included did\u00a0\u00a0 not have subjects perform more than\u00a0\n9-12 weekly sets for a muscle group. Secondly, the majority of the studies were also\u00a0\nconducted on previously untrained individuals. As a result, probably the most accurate\u00a0\ntakeaway from this analysis is that for\u00a0\u00a0 beginners, performing 9-12 weekly sets per\u00a0\nmuscle group is likely better than fewer. This is probably a solid takeaway for beginners.\u00a0\u00a0 9-12 weekly sets is probably an\u00a0\nideal amount of work for them. We know that beginners gain the\u00a0\nfastest rate of muscle and strength,\u00a0\u00a0 but they also experience the most muscle\u00a0\ndamage and longest recovery durations.\u00a0\u00a0 Thus, performing more than 9-12 weekly\u00a0\nsets may not be necessary for them. However, what about once a beginner\u00a0\ngains a good degree of experience,\u00a0\u00a0 and what about individuals with\u00a0\nnumerous training years of experience? Could performing more than 9-12 weekly sets for\u00a0\ntrained individuals benefit muscle hypertrophy? As far as I'm aware, there have\u00a0\nbeen 6 studies exploring this.\u00a0\u00a0 3 of them essentially indicate the more sets the\u00a0\nbetter, while the other 3 suggest there's a point\u00a0\u00a0 where further weekly sets provide no further\u00a0\nbenefit or even regression for hypertrophy. Let us briefly examine these\u00a0\n6 studies in hope of finding\u00a0\u00a0 reasons that could explain\u00a0\nthe overall mixed results. We'll first examine the 3 studies\u00a0\nthat find more sets to be better. Brigatto et al. had 27 men with an\u00a0\naverage of 3.5 years of training\u00a0\u00a0 experience either train their muscle\u00a0\ngroups with 16, 24, or 32 weekly sets. All groups distributed their sets\u00a0\nover two non-consecutive days a week,\u00a0\u00a0 and training lasted 8 weeks. 50% of the weekly sets for a muscle\u00a0\ngroup were from compound exercises,\u00a0\u00a0 with the remaining 50% coming\u00a0\nfrom isolation exercises. Also, 60-second rest intervals were\u00a0\nused between sets in a session. Increases in biceps, triceps, and vastus\u00a0\nlateralis thickness were greatest for the\u00a0\u00a0 subjects performing 32 weekly\u00a0\nsets for their muscle groups. Radaelli et al. had 48 men with\u00a0\nprevious calisthenics experience\u00a0\u00a0 train their biceps with either 6,\u00a0\n18, or 30 weekly sets. Moreover,\u00a0\u00a0 subjects either trained their triceps\u00a0\nwith 9, 27, or 45 weekly sets. All groups distributed their sets over\u00a0\nthree non-consecutive days a week,\u00a0\u00a0 and training lasted 6 months. For their biceps, 50% of the weekly\u00a0\nsets were from compound exercises,\u00a0\u00a0 while the remaining 50% was\u00a0\nfrom isolation exercises. For the triceps, 2/3 of the sets\u00a0\nwere from compound exercises,\u00a0\u00a0 while 1/3 were from isolation exercises. Also, 90-120 seconds of rest was\u00a0\ngiven between sets in a session. Increases in biceps and triceps thickness favored\u00a0\nperforming the highest number of weekly sets. Schoenfeld et al. had 34 men with an average of\u00a0\n4.4 years of training experience perform either 6,\u00a0\u00a0 18, or 30 weekly sets for\u00a0\ntheir biceps and triceps.\u00a0\u00a0 Moreover, subjects either trained their\u00a0\nquadriceps with 9, 27, or 45 weekly sets. All groups distributed their sets over\u00a0\nthree non-consecutive days a week,\u00a0\u00a0 and training lasted for 8 weeks. For the biceps and triceps, 100% of the\u00a0\nweekly sets were from compound exercises.\u00a0\u00a0 For the quadriceps, 2/3 of the\u00a0\nweekly sets were from compound\u00a0\u00a0 exercises, with the remaining\u00a0\n1/3 from isolation exercises. Also, 90 seconds of rest was\u00a0\ngiven between sets in a session. Increases in biceps, triceps, rectus femoris,\u00a0\u00a0 and lateral thigh thickness favored\u00a0\nperforming the highest number of weekly sets. So, these three studies we've just\u00a0\noverviewed indicate between 30-45\u00a0\u00a0 weekly sets for a muscle group are\u00a0\nbeneficial for muscle hypertrophy. Let us now briefly detail the 3\u00a0\nother studies that oppose this,\u00a0\u00a0 and then figure out why this could be. Heaselgrave et al. had 49 men\u00a0\nwith at least 1 year of training\u00a0\u00a0 experience train their biceps with\u00a0\neither 9, 18, or 27 weekly sets. The subjects that performed 9 weekly\u00a0\nsets performed this all in one session,\u00a0\u00a0 while the subjects that performed\u00a0\n18 or 27 weekly sets distributed\u00a0\u00a0 it over two non-consecutive days\u00a0\na week. Training lasted 6 weeks. 2/3 of the weekly sets were from compound\u00a0\nexercises, with the rest from isolation exercises. Also, 3 minutes of rest between\u00a0\nsets was used in a session. Increases in biceps thickness seem to favor the\u00a0\ngroup performing 18 weekly sets for the biceps,\u00a0\u00a0 suggesting this is an optimal\u00a0\nnumber of weekly sets. Ostrowski et al. had 35 men with between\u00a0\n1-4 years of training experience train\u00a0\u00a0 their triceps with either\u00a0\n7, 14, or 28 weekly sets. All subjects distributed their weekly sets\u00a0\nover two non-consecutive days per week,\u00a0\u00a0 and training lasted 10 weeks. 70% of the weekly sets were\u00a0\nfrom compound exercises,\u00a0\u00a0 with the remaining 30% from isolation exercises. Also, 3 minutes of rest between\u00a0\nsets was used in a session. Increases in triceps thickness were similar\u00a0\nbetween the subjects performing 14 and 28\u00a0\u00a0 weekly sets, and both were greater than the\u00a0\nsubjects performing 7 weekly sets. Therefore,\u00a0\u00a0 this data suggest 14 weekly sets is sufficient,\u00a0\nwith extra sets providing no further benefit. Finally, Aube et al. had 35 men\u00a0\nwith at least 3 years of training\u00a0\u00a0 experience train their quadriceps\u00a0\nwith either 12, 18, or 24 weekly sets. All subjects distributed their weekly sets\u00a0\nover two non-consecutive days per week,\u00a0\u00a0 and training lasted 8 weeks. 100% of the weekly sets were\u00a0\nfrom compound exercises. Also, 2 minutes of rest between\u00a0\nsets was used in a session. Increases in anterior thigh thickness at two\u00a0\nregions were statistically similar between\u00a0\u00a0 all three weekly set groups. Indicating\u00a0\nthat 12 weekly sets may be sufficient. So, these three studies collectively indicate\u00a0\nthat between 12-18 weekly sets may be sufficient,\u00a0\u00a0 or perhaps even optimal (in the case of the\u00a0\nHeaselgrave et al. study), for building muscle. Why might these 3 studies conflict\u00a0\nwith the other 3 studies that suggest\u00a0\u00a0 more weekly sets result in\u00a0\nmore muscle hypertrophy? There are three potential\u00a0\nhypotheses I can think of. Firstly, perhaps individual differences\u00a0\nexplain the conflicting results.\u00a0\u00a0 More specifically, the optimal number of\u00a0\nweekly sets may be highly individualized.\u00a0\u00a0 The 3 studies that found more sets to be better\u00a0\nmight have predominantly recruited subjects that\u00a0\u00a0 respond favorably to a high number of weekly\u00a0\nsets, while the other 3 studies may not have. To some degree, I think part of this hypothesis\u00a0\nis true. That is, it's probably very likely that\u00a0\u00a0 certain individuals respond better to a high or\u00a0\nlower number of weekly sets for a muscle group. However, this might not be\u00a0\nthe only thing going on,\u00a0\u00a0 as we'll see with the second and third hypotheses. The second hypothesis, relating to rest intervals,\u00a0\u00a0 might actually be a very strong hypothesis\u00a0\nthat could explain the divergent results. More precisely, the 3 studies that\u00a0\nfound more sets to be better seemed\u00a0\u00a0 to predominantly have subjects rest 60-90\u00a0\nseconds between their sets in a session.\u00a0\u00a0 Put differently, they used short rest intervals. In contrast, the 3 studies that found 12-18\u00a0\nweekly sets per muscle group to be sufficient\u00a0\u00a0 or optimal had subjects rest 2-3\u00a0\nminutes between sets in a session.\u00a0\u00a0 In other words, they used long rest intervals. The reason this is potentially significant\u00a0\nis that the research seems to indicate using\u00a0\u00a0 long rest intervals makes each set\u00a0\nmore effective for building muscle. We've explored this in-depth\u00a0\nin our rest interval video.\u00a0\u00a0 However, let us briefly detail a study by Longo et\u00a0\nal. that demonstrates this concept extremely well. They found that when performing 3 sets of\u00a0\nrepetitions to failure with an 80% one-rep\u00a0\u00a0 max load on a leg press, resting for 3\u00a0\nminutes between sets produced greater\u00a0\u00a0 increases in quadriceps cross-sectional area\u00a0\nversus resting for 1 minute between sets. However, when subjects performed 4 to\u00a0\n5 sets of repetitions to failure with\u00a0\u00a0 an 80% one-rep max load and used\u00a0\n1 minute of rest between sets,\u00a0\u00a0 quadriceps cross-sectional area increases were\u00a0\nsimilar to performing 3 sets of repetitions to\u00a0\u00a0 failure with an 80% one-rep max load and\u00a0\nusing 3 minutes of rest between sets. Therefore, this study nicely demonstrates\u00a0\nthat longer rest intervals make each set\u00a0\u00a0 more effective for building muscle. If you\u00a0\nuse shorter rest intervals between sets,\u00a0\u00a0 you have to perform more sets to receive\u00a0\nsimilar growth to using longer rest intervals. Now, it should be noted that a leg press, a\u00a0\ncompound exercise, was used in this study.\u00a0\u00a0 This conclusion we've just made seems to\u00a0\nbe only relevant to compound exercises,\u00a0\u00a0 the research on rest intervals with\u00a0\nisolation exercises is far from clear. Nevertheless, many compound exercises were\u00a0\nused in the studies explored in this video,\u00a0\u00a0 and perhaps this logic explains the results. Given longer rest intervals\u00a0\nmake each set more effective,\u00a0\u00a0 it perhaps makes sense that the\u00a0\n3 studies that used longer rest\u00a0\u00a0 intervals found 12-18 weekly sets per\u00a0\nmuscle group to be sufficient or optimal. Conversely, given shorter rest intervals\u00a0\nrequire you to perform a higher number of\u00a0\u00a0 sets to receive the equivalent muscle\u00a0\ngrowth to using longer rest intervals,\u00a0\u00a0 it makes sense that the three studies that used\u00a0\nshort rest intervals found that up to 30 to 45\u00a0\u00a0 weekly sets per muscle group provided\u00a0\nmore benefit for muscle hypertrophy. Of course, it's important to\u00a0\nrecognize this is only a hypothesis.\u00a0\u00a0 However, I personally believe it's a pretty strong\u00a0\nhypothesis and may indeed explain the results. However, the third hypothesis,\u00a0\u00a0 relating to training frequency, adds a further\u00a0\ntwist to our interpretation of the evidence. The 3 studies that found 12-18 weekly sets to\u00a0\nbe sufficient or optimal for building muscle\u00a0\u00a0 all had subjects distribute their weekly sets\u00a0\nfor a muscle group over only 2 days a week. It's possible there could exist a limit\u00a0\nto the number of sets you can perform for\u00a0\u00a0 a muscle group per session, meaning that the\u00a0\nhighest number of set groups in these studies,\u00a0\u00a0 which we know performed around 24-28 weekly\u00a0\nsets per muscle group, might have experienced\u00a0\u00a0 more muscle growth if they distributed their\u00a0\nweekly sets across more than two days a week. However, does a limit to the number of sets you\u00a0\u00a0 can perform for a muscle group\u00a0\neach session actually exist? One factor we might have to consider here is the\u00a0\none we've just mentioned: rest interval durations. It's likely that if a limit to the number\u00a0\nof sets you can perform per session exists,\u00a0\u00a0 it would be lower when using longer rest interval\u00a0\ndurations compared to using short rest intervals\u00a0\u00a0 durations, because as we've mentioned, longer\u00a0\nrest intervals make each set more effective. In the three studies that found 30-45 weekly sets\u00a0\nper muscle group produced more muscle growth,\u00a0\u00a0 we know they used short rest intervals. Moreover, they had subjects distribute their\u00a0\nweekly sets over two to three days each week.\u00a0\u00a0 In essence, this meant that the subjects\u00a0\nperforming 30-45 weekly sets per muscle\u00a0\u00a0 group were performing 15-16 sets\u00a0\nfor a muscle group each session. As the subjects that did this experienced the most\u00a0\ngrowth compared to others performing fewer sets,\u00a0\u00a0 we can potentially conclude that performing\u00a0\n15-16 sets per muscle group each session\u00a0\u00a0 is within any potential limit to the\u00a0\nnumber of sets you can perform per\u00a0\u00a0 session for a muscle group when\u00a0\nusing shorter rest intervals. However, this information fails\u00a0\nto help us understand what the\u00a0\u00a0 limit could be when using longer rest intervals. Unfortunately, there are no direct\u00a0\nstudies that can help us here.\u00a0\u00a0 But, there are two studies that\u00a0\nmay somewhat give us clues. A study by Ogasawara et al. subjected the\u00a0\ngastrocnemius of rats to sets of 10 electrically\u00a0\u00a0 induced muscle contractions, using 3 minutes of\u00a0\nrest between sets (which is a long rest interval). They found that muscle protein\u00a0\nsynthesis progressively increased\u00a0\u00a0 up to performing 10 sets of this per session.\u00a0\u00a0 However, muscle protein synthesis was\u00a0\nless when performing 20 sets per session. As a result, this data potentially suggests\u00a0\nthat the limit the number of sets you can\u00a0\u00a0 perform per muscle group each session when using\u00a0\nlonger rest intervals lies between 10-20 sets. Of course, two important limitations of this study\u00a0\nare that rats were used, and only acute muscle\u00a0\u00a0 protein synthesis measurements, not long-term\u00a0\nmuscle growth measurements, were explored. Another study by Damas et al., conducted on\u00a0\nhumans, provides potential further insight. They found that when performing 12\u00a0\nsets for the quadriceps in one session,\u00a0\u00a0 muscle protein synthesis increases seemed to have\u00a0\nonly been slightly greater compared to performing\u00a0\u00a0 8 sets for the quadriceps in one session.\u00a0\nThey used 2-minute rest intervals between\u00a0\u00a0 sets in this study (which is probably just\u00a0\nabout what we'd call a long rest interval). As a result, this data potentially implies, when\u00a0\nusing longer rest intervals, performing 12 or more\u00a0\u00a0 sets per muscle group each session may not result\u00a0\nin much further benefit, indicating this could\u00a0\u00a0 be near or at the limit to the number of sets\u00a0\nyou can perform per muscle group each session. Of course, a limitation is that only acute\u00a0\nmuscle protein synthesis measurements,\u00a0\u00a0 not long-term muscle growth\u00a0\nmeasurements, were assessed. Nevertheless, returning to the 3 studies that\u00a0\nfound 12-18 weekly sets to be sufficient or\u00a0\u00a0 optimal for building muscle, and used longer rest\u00a0\nintervals, we know that the highest set groups in\u00a0\u00a0 these studies, performing 24-28 weekly sets,\u00a0\ndistributed their sets across 2 days a week. This means they performed roughly 12-14 sets\u00a0\nfor a muscle group each session, and this number\u00a0\u00a0 is potentially at or past the potential limit\u00a0\nindicated by the Ogasawara and Damas studies.\u00a0\u00a0 Thus, perhaps if they distributed their weekly\u00a0\nsets across 3 or more days a week, they would\u00a0\u00a0 have experienced more muscle growth than the\u00a0\nother groups performing fewer weekly sets. Of course, it's important to recognize\u00a0\nthis is a hypothesis based on limited data.\u00a0\u00a0 Ultimately, future direct research would be\u00a0\nneeded to truly prove if this is correct. Before moving on to the\u00a0\nfinal section of this video,\u00a0\u00a0 let us briefly summarize our current\u00a0\nconclusions to make everything crystal clear. For beginners, 9-12 weekly sets per muscle\u00a0\ngroup is probably near-ideal for them. In more trained individuals, if you\u00a0\nuse longer rest intervals between sets\u00a0\u00a0 (2 or more minutes), the current research\u00a0\npotentially indicates between 12-18 weekly\u00a0\u00a0 sets could be sufficient for muscle hypertrophy.\u00a0\nHowever, there remains a possibility that more\u00a0\u00a0 weekly sets could be better if you distribute\u00a0\nyour weekly sets across 3 or more days per week,\u00a0\u00a0 but this remains a tentative conclusion until\u00a0\nmore direct future research explores this. If you use shorter rest intervals between sets\u00a0\n(90 seconds or less), it seems performing up\u00a0\u00a0 to 30-45 weekly sets per muscle group could be\u00a0\nbeneficial, so long as you probably spread this\u00a0\u00a0 volume across two or more days per week. However,\u00a0\nI'm not too sure how practical this will actually\u00a0\u00a0 be for most people. Performing 30-45 weekly sets\u00a0\nfor your muscle groups is likely going to require\u00a0\u00a0 a substantial amount of training time. Moreover,\u00a0\ndue to the short rest intervals and numerous sets,\u00a0\u00a0 doing this is likely going to be subjectively\u00a0\nmore fatiguing and tiring versus using longer rest\u00a0\u00a0 intervals and performing fewer sets. If you think\u00a0\nyou can handle this, and it's something you'd\u00a0\u00a0 like to try, go for it. Otherwise, it's probably\u00a0\nbest to use longer rest intervals and fewer sets. Moving on to the final section of this\u00a0\nvideo, for the majority of the viewers\u00a0\u00a0 that are currently training, there's\u00a0\na good chance that you probably don't\u00a0\u00a0 have to change your training based on\u00a0\nthe research recommendations presented. Regardless of whether you are above, within,\u00a0\nor below the weekly set recommendations,\u00a0\u00a0 if you're making progress with\u00a0\nyour current training program,\u00a0\u00a0 there's probably no need to change things. On the other hand, and this is probably one\u00a0\nof the more important sections of this video,\u00a0\u00a0 if in the future (or now itself) you\u00a0\nexperience a plateau in muscle hypertrophy,\u00a0\u00a0 or you're minimally responding\u00a0\nto your program hypertrophy-wise,\u00a0\u00a0 you may want to modestly increase the number\u00a0\nof sets you perform for your muscle groups. The reason I say this is because\u00a0\ntwo studies demonstrate that\u00a0\u00a0 increasing the number of sets you\u00a0\nperform can probably be effective\u00a0\u00a0 for spurring on more muscle hypertrophy in\u00a0\nplateaued or low responding individuals. A study by Aube et al., which is one study\u00a0\nwe've already overviewed in this video,\u00a0\u00a0 demonstrates this. As we noted, this study found in men with\u00a0\nat least 3 years of training experience,\u00a0\u00a0 there was no statistical difference in\u00a0\nanterior thigh growth between performing 12,\u00a0\u00a0 18, or 24 weekly sets for the quadriceps. However, after the study, the researchers\u00a0\ndid something quite interesting. They split the subjects, based on their results,\u00a0\ninto one of three groups: a low responder group,\u00a0\u00a0 which contained subjects that grew the anterior\u00a0\nthigh the least, a high responder group which\u00a0\u00a0 contained subjects that grew the anterior thigh\u00a0\nthe most, and a moderate responder group which\u00a0\u00a0 contained subjets that grew the anterior thigh\u00a0\nto an extent between the other two groups. Remember, the subjects of this study had at least\u00a0\u00a0 3 years of training experience and were\u00a0\ntraining before the study took place. Fascinatingly, it seems that those\u00a0\nthat grew their anterior thigh the\u00a0\u00a0 most in the high responder group had\u00a0\nincreased their weekly sets by the\u00a0\u00a0 greatest number relative to what\u00a0\nthey were doing before the study. Specifically, they were performing an\u00a0\naverage of 6 more weekly sets for the quads.\u00a0\u00a0 For the moderate responders, they\u00a0\nwere performing an average of 4 more\u00a0\u00a0 sets relative to what they were before\u00a0\nthe study, and for the low responders,\u00a0\u00a0 they were only performing around 1-2 more sets\u00a0\nthan what they were doing before the study. Therefore, this study indicates\u00a0\nincreasing the number of sets you\u00a0\u00a0 perform can help further enhance\u00a0\nthe muscle growth you experience,\u00a0\u00a0 and perhaps may be a useful tool to get\u00a0\npast plateaus or aid low responders. Now, in this study, the subjects\u00a0\nexperienced the most benefit by\u00a0\u00a0 increasing the number of sets for a\u00a0\nmuscle group by roughly 6 per week. However, larger jumps than this\u00a0\nmight not actually be better. Scarpelli et al. illustrates this. They recruited 16 men with at least 2\u00a0\nyears of training experience and had them\u00a0\u00a0 train the unilateral (one-leg)\u00a0\nleg extension and leg press. With one leg, each subject individually performed\u00a0\u00a0 20% more weekly sets for their quadriceps\u00a0\nthan what they were doing before the study.\u00a0\u00a0 While with their other leg, all subjects\u00a0\nperformed a prescribed number of weekly\u00a0\u00a0 sets for their quadriceps (this ended\u00a0\nup being roughly 22 weekly sets). After an 8-week training duration, increases\u00a0\nin vastus lateralis cross-sectional area (were\u00a0\u00a0 significantly greater for the leg that performed\u00a0\n20% more weekly sets for their quadriceps. Put differently, a progressive\u00a0\nincrease in weekly sets\u00a0\u00a0 (20%) seems to be beneficial for muscle growth. Now, here's an important point,\u00a0\nfor 8 out of 16 of the subjects,\u00a0\u00a0 the prescribed number of weekly sets (again,\u00a0\nroughly 22 weekly sets) was actually MORE than\u00a0\u00a0 20% of the weekly sets they had been performing\u00a0\nfor their quadriceps prior to the study\u00a0\u00a0 (it ranged from being 30% to 120% more\u00a0\nweekly sets than usual for these subjects). Yet, results still favored the\u00a0\nleg that was only performing 20%\u00a0\u00a0 more weekly sets. This finding emphasizes\u00a0\nthat larger jumps (30-120%) in weekly sets\u00a0\u00a0 are not necessarily better than more modest 20%\u00a0\nincreases in weekly sets for muscle hypertrophy. So, to summarize this final section of the video,\u00a0\u00a0 if you consider yourself a low responder or\u00a0\nyou have plateaued, modestly increasing the\u00a0\u00a0 number of weekly sets you perform for a muscle\u00a0\ngroup (perhaps by 20%) may be of great benefit. However, although this conclusion probably\u00a0\napplies to many people, there are likely some\u00a0\u00a0 individuals out there who contrastingly experience\u00a0\ngreater adaptations with lower weekly set numbers. This study had 16 men and 18 women train\u00a0\nthe unilateral leg press and leg extension,\u00a0\u00a0 with a 7-10 rep max load, three\u00a0\ntimes per week for 12 weeks. With one-leg, subjects trained\u00a0\neach exercise with only one set,\u00a0\u00a0 resulting in a total of 6 weekly sets for the\u00a0\nquadriceps. With the other leg, they trained\u00a0\u00a0 each exercise with three sets, resulting in\u00a0\na total of 18 weekly sets for the quadriceps. Cross-sectional area of the quadriceps\u00a0\nwas measured before and after the study. The graph on the screen shows the\u00a0\nindividual responses for each participant,\u00a0\u00a0 with the Y-axis showing the cross-sectional\u00a0\narea increases for the leg that trained each\u00a0\u00a0 exercise with 3 sets, and the X-axis showing\u00a0\u00a0 the cross-sectional area increases for the\u00a0\nleg that trained each exercise with 1 set. Quite a few participants demonstrated better\u00a0\ngains when performing 3 sets per exercise,\u00a0\u00a0 as you'd expect based on the research provided\u00a0\nin this video. However, there were still a few\u00a0\u00a0 subjects that responded slightly better\u00a0\nwith performing one set per exercise.\u00a0\u00a0 This study nicely underscores the idea that\u00a0\nindividual differences without a doubt exist. That brings us to the end of the\u00a0\nvideo, let us summarize the video\u00a0\u00a0 into a few key takeaway points\u00a0\nto make everything crystal clear. For beginners, 9-12 weekly sets per muscle group\u00a0\nis probably sufficient for building muscle. In more trained individuals, if you\u00a0\nuse long rest intervals between sets\u00a0\u00a0 (2 or more minutes), 12-18 weekly sets\u00a0\nper muscle group might be sufficient.\u00a0\u00a0 However, although very tentative at this time,\u00a0\nperforming more than this could provide more\u00a0\u00a0 muscle growth if you distribute your weekly\u00a0\nsets across three or more days per week. If you use short rest intervals between sets\u00a0\n(90 seconds or less), up to 30-45 weekly sets\u00a0\u00a0 per muscle group could be beneficial for muscle\u00a0\nhypertrophy, provided these sets are distributed\u00a0\u00a0 across 2 or more days per week. However, this\u00a0\nis probably not practical or sustainable for\u00a0\u00a0 most people, so perhaps you'd simply want to opt\u00a0\nfor using longer rest intervals with fewer sets. For many individuals watching this that\u00a0\nare currently training, so long as you\u00a0\u00a0 are making progress, you definitely do not\u00a0\nhave to change anything based on this video. However, once you hit a plateau, or if\u00a0\nyou consider yourself a low responder,\u00a0\u00a0 you may wish to modestly increase the number\u00a0\nof sets you perform per muscle group each week\u00a0\u00a0 (probably by 20%), as this could be beneficial. Finally, it's worth remembering\u00a0\nindividual differences are real.\u00a0\u00a0 Some individuals out there might\u00a0\nactually experience better muscle\u00a0\u00a0 hypertrophy when performing a lower\u00a0\nnumber of sets per muscle group."

    "title": "Do You Gain MORE Muscle Fibers With Training? (Research Overview)",
    "published_at": "2021-08-28T14:20:07Z",
    "transcript": "In response to resistance training,\u00a0\nmuscles typically increase in size. One of the most commonly accepted and supported\u00a0\nways that this occurs is via an increase in the\u00a0\u00a0 size of their individual muscle fibers. This\u00a0\nwhole process is called muscle hypertrophy. However, another plausible way\u00a0\nmuscle could increase in size\u00a0\u00a0 is through something called muscle hyperplasia. Muscle hyperplasia refers to an increase in\u00a0\nthe number of muscles fibers within a muscle. In theory, this could be achieved by completely\u00a0\nnew muscle fibers being manufactured,\u00a0\u00a0 or by pre-existing muscle\u00a0\nfibers splitting into two. In this video, we'll thoroughly examine the\u00a0\nexisting research on muscle hyperplasia,\u00a0\u00a0 with the primary aim of answering if\u00a0\nmuscle hyperplasia truly occurs in humans. Although we'll be assessing\u00a0\nhuman research shortly,\u00a0\u00a0 animal studies are highly valuable for\u00a0\npotential insights into muscle hyperplasia. As we'll come to find out, there are major\u00a0\nmethodological and ethical constraints\u00a0\u00a0 that limit the quality and validity\u00a0\nof human research in this area. With studies conducted on animals, these\u00a0\nconstraints become less of a problem. First things first, for researchers\u00a0\nto explore if muscle fiber number can\u00a0\u00a0 increase, they need to train\u00a0\nthe animals in some form. Commonly, this is done in one of three ways:\u00a0\u00a0 stretching, synergistic\u00a0\nablation, or weight training. Stretching involves using some piece of weighted\u00a0\nequipment to stretch a muscle of an animal. For instance, on-screen depicts\u00a0\nhow a study by Alway et al.\u00a0\u00a0 stretched the anterior latissimus\u00a0\ndorsi of Japenese quails. Note, I did say anterior latissimus dorsi.\u00a0\u00a0 Interestingly, Japenese quails also\u00a0\nhave a posterior latissimus dorsi. In animal studies that use\u00a0\nstretching to train the muscle,\u00a0\u00a0 they either do so chronically or intermittently. In studies that chronically stretch the animal,\u00a0\u00a0 they typically stretch the muscle\u00a0\nfor 30 whole straight days. Conversely, in studies that\u00a0\nuse intermittent stretching,\u00a0\u00a0 they stretch the muscle for 1 whole\u00a0\nday, followed by 2-3 days of rest.\u00a0\u00a0 This cycle is repeated throughout\u00a0\nthe full duration of the study. As we can see, these stretching protocols\u00a0\nare extreme. Consequently, we should be\u00a0\u00a0 extremely cautious in trying to extrapolate\u00a0\nresults from studies using this to humans. As for synergistic ablation,\u00a0\nthis is undoubtedly more extreme. It involves surgically removing\u00a0\na muscle from a muscle group,\u00a0\u00a0 thereby overloading the remaining\u00a0\nmuscles in that muscle group. Most commonly, this technique is used in rodents\u00a0\u00a0 and involves surgically removing the\u00a0\ngastrocnemius from the calf muscle group,\u00a0\u00a0 thereby resulting in the soleus being\u00a0\nsignificantly overloaded during normal tasks. As this is method is highly extreme,\u00a0\nwe also need to be extremely cautious\u00a0\u00a0 in trying to extrapolate results\u00a0\nfrom studies using this to humans. Finally, weight training involves having animals\u00a0\nperform exercises in a similar way to humans. For instance, this study by Tamaki et\u00a0\nal. used a custom piece of equipment\u00a0\u00a0 to get rats to squat for 15 sets of 15\u00a0\nrepetitions with a 65-75% one-rep max load. As this method is substantially\u00a0\nmore comparable to what humans do,\u00a0\u00a0 studies using this method may be considered more\u00a0\napplicable to humans than the other two methods. Okay, so now that we've established the various\u00a0\nways in which researchers can train the muscles\u00a0\u00a0 of animals, let us establish how they can\u00a0\nmeasure if muscle fiber number has increased. There seem to be two ways of\u00a0\ndoing this, either via direct\u00a0\u00a0 counting or counting from a cross-section. Direct counting involves removing the whole\u00a0\nmuscle and counting every single muscle fiber. Of course, this can only be performed\u00a0\nonce. You can't perform this method before\u00a0\u00a0 and after a training duration, as once you've\u00a0\nremoved the muscle, it cannot be put back. Therefore, to determine if the number\u00a0\nof muscle fibers has increased,\u00a0\u00a0 there are two plausible ways used. In the first way, researchers get the\u00a0\nanimals to train only one side of their body,\u00a0\u00a0 while their other side of\u00a0\nthe body remains untrained. Then, after a training duration, if the\u00a0\nnumber of muscle fibers in the trained muscle\u00a0\u00a0 is more than the number of muscle\u00a0\nfibers in the untrained muscle,\u00a0\u00a0 we assume that training\u00a0\nincreased muscle fiber number. The underlying assumption here is\u00a0\nthat before the training period,\u00a0\u00a0 the trained and untrained muscles would have\u00a0\nhad a comparable number of muscle fibers.\u00a0\u00a0 This may not always be an accurate\u00a0\nassumption and is thus a limitation. The second way involves using the direct\u00a0\ncounting method to compare the number of\u00a0\u00a0 muscle fibers within the muscles of an animal\u00a0\nthat trained to an animal that did not train. After a training duration, if the number of\u00a0\nmuscle fibers in the muscle of a trained animal\u00a0\u00a0 is greater than the number of muscle fibers\u00a0\nwithin the muscle of an untrained animal,\u00a0\u00a0 we assume that training\u00a0\nincreased muscle fiber number. The underlying assumption here is\u00a0\nthat before the training duration,\u00a0\u00a0 the number of muscle fibers between the trained\u00a0\nand untrained animals would have been similar. Again, this may not always be an accurate\u00a0\nassumption and is thus a limitation. Now, one major advantage of this\u00a0\nmethod is that as the whole muscle\u00a0\u00a0 is removed, all of the muscle fibers are\u00a0\ncounted from the muscle of the animals. However, this also makes it somewhat unpractical\u00a0\nfor researchers, as the dissection of a whole\u00a0\u00a0 muscle and counting of potentially ten's of\u00a0\nthousands of muscle fibers can be difficult. The second method, counting from a cross-section,\u00a0\nsomewhat solves this impracticality. It involves removing only a cross-section from the\u00a0\u00a0 muscle and then counting the number of\u00a0\nmuscle fibers in this cross-section. For practical reasons, I believe\u00a0\nresearchers don't take a cross-section\u00a0\u00a0 from the muscle of the same animal\u00a0\nbefore and after a training duration. Therefore, like the last method, researchers\u00a0\neither compare the number of muscle fibers\u00a0\u00a0 counted between a trained side and untrained side,\u00a0\u00a0 or between an animal that trained\u00a0\nand an animal that didn't train. Counting the number of muscle\u00a0\nfibers in a cross-section\u00a0\u00a0 is potentially more practical,\u00a0\nas only a sample is required. However, there is a vital\u00a0\nlimitation with this method. It's very possible that the number\u00a0\nof muscle fibers in a cross-section\u00a0\u00a0 could increase without an actual\u00a0\nincrease in muscle fiber number. One example of this is when an increase in\u00a0\nthe pennation angle of the muscle fibers\u00a0\u00a0 outpaces the growth of the muscle fibers. Let me explain. Remember, muscles attach to bones in order\u00a0\nto create movement in the human body. A muscle has two attachment points. Some muscles in the human body do not have\u00a0\ntheir muscle fibers run in a straight line\u00a0\u00a0 from their two points of attachment. Rather, some muscles have their fibers angled\u00a0\nslightly between the two points of attachment. The pennation angle is the name given\u00a0\nto the angle of the muscle fibers. When assessing a particular cross-section of a\u00a0\nmuscle, if an increase in pennation angle outpaces\u00a0\u00a0 the growth of the individual fibers, more muscle\u00a0\nfibers could be observed in that cross-section,\u00a0\u00a0 despite there being no actual\u00a0\nincrease in muscle fiber number. Another example in where more muscle\u00a0\nfibers could be observed in a cross-section\u00a0\u00a0 without an actual increase in muscle fiber number\u00a0\nrelates to an increase in muscle fiber length. Some muscle fibers may not actually\u00a0\nrun the full length of a muscle\u00a0\u00a0 and with training, there is evidence\u00a0\nmuscle fibers can increase in length. Therefore, when assessing a\u00a0\nparticular cross-section of a muscle,\u00a0\u00a0 it's possible that a muscle\u00a0\nfiber could increase in length\u00a0\u00a0 to the point where it is now newly\u00a0\nobserved in that cross-section. In general, as a result of these\u00a0\npotentially vital limitations\u00a0\u00a0 when counting muscle fibers from a cross-section,\u00a0\na direct count is considered more reliable. Hopefully we've now got a solid\u00a0\nunderstanding of how researchers can train\u00a0\u00a0 and measure an increase in\u00a0\nmuscle fiber number in animals. Let us now look at the results of such studies. A meta-analysis by Kelley combined the\u00a0\nresults of numerous animal studies. What the analysis found was that muscle fiber\u00a0\nnumber increased by 20.95% in studies that had\u00a0\u00a0 animals stretch, 11.59% in studies that\u00a0\nhad animals weight training, and 5.44%\u00a0\u00a0 in studies that used synergistic ablation. As we noted, given that studies using stretching\u00a0\nor synergistic ablation are quite extreme and\u00a0\u00a0 not applicable to what humans do, the weight\u00a0\ntraining data is most relevant and insightful. Specifically, 5 studies were comprised\u00a0\nin the weight training results. 3 of them\u00a0\u00a0 involved counting from cross-sections,\u00a0\nwhile 2 involved direct counting. All 5 of these studies found an\u00a0\nincrease in muscle fiber number,\u00a0\u00a0 and so this includes the 2\u00a0\nstudies that used direct counting. As mentioned earlier, given direct\u00a0\ncounting is considered more reliable\u00a0\u00a0 than counting from cross-sections,\u00a0\nand the 2 direct counting studies\u00a0\u00a0 found an increase in muscle fiber\u00a0\nnumber, this adds to our confidence\u00a0\u00a0 muscle hyperplasia may indeed increase\u00a0\nwith weight training (at least in animals). Alright, so the animal evidence seems to suggest\u00a0\u00a0 that weight training-like stimuli\u00a0\nmay induce muscle hyperplasia. But, results obtained from animals studies\u00a0\nmay not necessarily apply to humans. Unfortunately, there are major\u00a0\nethical and practical constraints\u00a0\u00a0 when attempting to find out if\u00a0\nmuscle hyperplasia occurs in humans. Recall that the direct method\u00a0\nof counting muscle fibers\u00a0\u00a0 involves removing a whole muscle\u00a0\nand counting all of the fibers. The first major problem here is that\u00a0\nI'm not too sure there are many humans\u00a0\u00a0 out there willing to have one of\u00a0\ntheir muscles completely removed. Even if there were willing human subjects,\u00a0\nand a researcher could get clearance,\u00a0\u00a0 human muscles can contain hundreds\u00a0\nof thousands of muscle fibers,\u00a0\u00a0 making the direct counting of all\u00a0\nof them extremely impractical. For instance, it's broadly estimated\u00a0\nthat the biceps brachii of humans\u00a0\u00a0 contains anywhere from 198,000\u00a0\nto 419,000 muscle fibers. As far as I'm aware, counting from a\u00a0\ncross-section has also not been done in humans. I think this because it's too difficult to obtain\u00a0\u00a0 a large enough sample from human\u00a0\nmuscles to be considered valid. Despite all of this,\u00a0\u00a0 researchers have used other ways in trying to\u00a0\nfind out muscle hyperplasia occurs in humans. There have been 4 cross-sectional studies\u00a0\nfinding potential indirect evidence\u00a0\u00a0 that muscle fiber number\u00a0\nmay increase with training. Specifically, these studies\u00a0\ncompared muscle characteristics\u00a0\u00a0 between a group of trained bodybuilders or\u00a0\npowerlifters to a group of untrained individuals. As you'd expect, the bodybuilders and powerlifters\u00a0\u00a0 had larger whole muscle cross-sectional\u00a0\nareas than the untrained individuals. However, the cross-sectional area\u00a0\nof the individual muscle fibers\u00a0\u00a0 assessed was not different between the untrained\u00a0\nindividuals and the bodybuilders or powerlifters. This led the researchers to suggests that\u00a0\nthe greater whole muscle cross-sectional\u00a0\u00a0 area observed for the bodybuilders or\u00a0\npowerlifters could be due to having\u00a0\u00a0 more muscle fibers that are produced by training. However, there is still a whole\u00a0\nhost of problems with this. One major one is that human\u00a0\nstudies can only assess the\u00a0\u00a0 size of a limited number of muscle fibers. This is because to assess the\u00a0\nsize of individual muscle fibers,\u00a0\u00a0 a small sample must first\u00a0\nbe taken from the muscle. The muscle fibers in this small sample may not be\u00a0\u00a0 identical to muscle fibers\u00a0\nelsewhere in the muscle. Therefore, it's possible the muscle\u00a0\nfibers in other regions of the muscle\u00a0\u00a0 that were never sampled could have been\u00a0\nlarger in the bodybuilders or powerlifters\u00a0\u00a0 compared to the untrained individuals, thereby\u00a0\nexplaining the larger whole muscle size. Nevertheless, aside from these\u00a0\nsimilar 4 cross-sectional studies,\u00a0\u00a0 there is another cross-sectional\u00a0\nstudy by Eriksson et al.\u00a0\u00a0 finding potential evidence for\u00a0\nmuscle hyperplasia in humans. They found that in trained powerlifters,\u00a0\nthere were signs of splitting\u00a0\u00a0 from muscle fibers obtained from\u00a0\nthe vastus lateralis and trapezius. The splits varied in depths, but the authors noted\u00a0\nthat some splits did completely divide the fibers. They also assessed a group\u00a0\nof untrained individuals,\u00a0\u00a0 in which no splitting of muscle fibers from\u00a0\nthe vastus lateralis or trapezius was found. Therefore, this study suggests the\u00a0\npowerlifters may have experienced\u00a0\u00a0 an increase in muscle fiber number via\u00a0\nsplitting of pre-existing muscle fibers. Although the mentioned 5 cross-sectional\u00a0\nstudies potentially imply humans may\u00a0\u00a0 experience muscle hyperplasia, other\u00a0\nhuman studies suggest otherwise. A study by Schantz et al. compared 5\u00a0\nbodybuilders to 18 untrained individuals. Contrary to much of the previous\u00a0\ncross-sectional studies we detailed,\u00a0\u00a0 the bodybuilders had a larger whole muscle AND\u00a0\nlarger individual fiber cross-sectional areas\u00a0\u00a0 compared to the untrained individuals, suggesting\u00a0\nit was the larger individual muscle fibers\u00a0\u00a0 that perhaps explained the\u00a0\nlarger whole muscle size. A study by MacDougall et al. found the same thing. A group of bodybuilders had a\u00a0\nlarger bicep cross-sectional area\u00a0\u00a0 and biceps muscle fiber cross-sectional\u00a0\narea compared to untrained individuals. Moreover, using a simple equation,\u00a0\u00a0 the researchers attempted to estimate\u00a0\nfiber numbers in the subjects. What they did, for each subject, was divide\u00a0\nthe cross-sectional area of their biceps\u00a0\u00a0 by the average cross-sectional area\u00a0\nof the muscle fibers in their biceps. The cross-sectional area of the\u00a0\nbiceps was corrected for any\u00a0\u00a0 impact connective tissue would have had. Therefore, the result of this equation\u00a0\nwould give a very rough estimate\u00a0\u00a0 of how many fibers each subject\u00a0\nmay have had in their biceps. Overall, the researchers found that\u00a0\nthe fiber numbers in the bodybuilders\u00a0\u00a0 was similar to the untrained individuals,\u00a0\u00a0 thus potentially suggesting muscle fiber\u00a0\nnumbers do not increase with training. Finally, a study by Mccall et al.\u00a0\u00a0 actually used the same equation we just\u00a0\nmentioned, but in a long-term study design. They had 8 trained men train a variety\u00a0\nof free weight and machine exercises,\u00a0\u00a0 each for 3 sets of repetition to failure with a 10\u00a0\nrep-max load, for 3 times per week for 12 weeks. Before and after the study, the researchers\u00a0\nmeasured biceps cross-sectional area,\u00a0\u00a0 cross-sectional area of a portion\u00a0\nof muscle fibers from the biceps,\u00a0\u00a0 and fiber numbers within the\u00a0\nbiceps via the mentioned equation. After the 12 week training duration,\u00a0\nbiceps cross-sectional area and biceps\u00a0\u00a0 fiber cross-sectional area increased.\u00a0\nBut, estimated fiber numbers did not. So the results of this study would seem\u00a0\nto suggest that muscle fiber number\u00a0\u00a0 does not increase with training in humans. However, the authors mentioned\u00a0\nsomething quite interesting. 2 subjects experienced quite high increases in\u00a0\ncross-sectional area of a few muscles fibers from\u00a0\u00a0 the biceps (specifically the fast-twitch fibers),\u00a0\nbut they experienced similar overall increases\u00a0\u00a0 in biceps cross-sectional\u00a0\narea to the other 6 subjects. In other words, it seems like\u00a0\nthese 2 subjects were outliers. When these 2 subjects were removed\u00a0\nfrom the fiber number estimated data,\u00a0\u00a0 the average of the remaining 6 subjects\u00a0\ndid display an increase in fiber numbers. Therefore, perhaps this study did actually\u00a0\nfind muscle hyperplasia in humans. However, as with pretty much all the human studies\u00a0\nwe've been assessing, there are limitations. Firstly this data is only from 6 subjects,\u00a0\nwhich is an extremely small sample size.\u00a0\u00a0 On top of this, the equation\u00a0\nused to estimate fiber number\u00a0\u00a0 is very rough, and there are many\u00a0\nscenarios in which it can be inaccurate. To sum up the human evidence, it's\u00a0\nclear to see there is no distinct answer\u00a0\u00a0 on whether muscle hyperplasia occurs. Not only are there conflicting results, but the\u00a0\nindividual studies on both sides of the argument\u00a0\u00a0 are highly questionable in quality and validity. Of course, in large part,\u00a0\nthis is simply because direct\u00a0\u00a0 fiber counting is impossible in human subjects. When combining and analyzing the\u00a0\nanimal and human evidence together,\u00a0\u00a0 I think there are a couple of different\u00a0\nviewpoints a person could take. Perhaps you think that the human evidence is not\u00a0\nparticularly valuable (due to the limitations),\u00a0\u00a0 but given the animal evidence may suggest\u00a0\nfiber number can increase with weight training,\u00a0\u00a0 you view this as promising evidence that\u00a0\nfiber number similarly increases in humans. Or perhaps you think that promising animal\u00a0\nevidence coupled with a few indirect human\u00a0\u00a0 studies may be sufficient to believe an increase\u00a0\nin muscle fiber number occurs in humans. On the other hand, perhaps\u00a0\nyou believe animal studies\u00a0\u00a0 are not particularly useful and combined with\u00a0\nthe mixed and questionable human studies,\u00a0\u00a0 you're skeptical or just uncertain if\u00a0\nfiber number can increase in humans. Of course, these are not the\u00a0\nonly viewpoints you can take,\u00a0\u00a0 they are just some that readily came to my mind. All in all, I think the all of\u00a0\nviewpoints could be justified. Moving on, I think a discussion on the\u00a0\npotential role of anabolic steroids\u00a0\u00a0 in increasing muscle fiber\u00a0\nnumbers could be interesting. Recall we detailed 4 cross-sectional studies\u00a0\nfinding that a group of bodybuilders or\u00a0\u00a0 powerlifters had a larger whole\u00a0\nmuscle cross-sectional area,\u00a0\u00a0 yet similar individual muscle fiber\u00a0\ncross-sectional area to untrained\u00a0\u00a0 individuals, potentially indicating\u00a0\nan increase in muscle fiber number\u00a0\u00a0 explains the larger whole muscle cross-sectional\u00a0\narea in the bodybuilders or powerlifters. In 3 of these 4 studies,\u00a0\u00a0 some bodybuilders and powerlifters had\u00a0\nused or were using anabolic steroids. Therefore, perhaps this suggests\u00a0\u00a0 users of anabolic steroids may be the most\u00a0\nsusceptible to increasing muscle fiber numbers. A couple of studies by Eriksson\u00a0\net al. further supports this. In two studies, they found that compared\u00a0\nto a group of natural powerlifters,\u00a0\u00a0 a group of powerlifters on steroids had a higher\u00a0\npercentage of muscle fibers from the trapezius and\u00a0\u00a0 vastus lateralis expressing proteins that would\u00a0\nbe present when new muscle fibers are created. In a third study, they found that in\u00a0\nthe trapezius and vastus lateralis,\u00a0\u00a0 more powerlifters on steroids displayed signs of\u00a0\nsplitting muscle fibers than natural powerlifters. Having said all of this,\u00a0\u00a0 there is also evidence that anabolic steroids\u00a0\nmay have no impact on muscle fiber numbers. Recall we also mentioned a study by\u00a0\nMacDougall et al. who used an equation\u00a0\u00a0 to estimate rough fiber numbers in the biceps\u00a0\nof bodybuilders and untrained individuals. All of the bodybuilders in this\u00a0\nstudy were on anabolic steroids,\u00a0\u00a0 yet the results found similar fiber numbers\u00a0\nbetween them and the untrained individuals,\u00a0\u00a0 suggesting anabolic steroids\u00a0\nhad no effect on fiber numbers. In summary, it's quite plausible that\u00a0\nanabolic steroids enhance or make an\u00a0\u00a0 increase in muscle fiber number more\u00a0\nlikely, but unfortunately the human\u00a0\u00a0 evidence isn't sufficient enough\u00a0\nto verify or falsify this claim. As we've seen throughout the video,\u00a0\nthe evidence is far from conclusive\u00a0\u00a0 on whether muscle hyperplasia occurs in humans. But let's assume for a second it does. What would be the body's reason\u00a0\nfor increasing muscle fiber number? There are two pretty interesting\u00a0\nhypotheses I've come across\u00a0\u00a0 that I thought would be\u00a0\nworth sharing in this video. The first one suggests an\u00a0\nincrease in muscle fiber number\u00a0\u00a0 may be due to an abnormal regeneration\u00a0\nresponse to damaging exercise. At a fundamental level, this suggests\u00a0\nthat when muscle fibers are damaged as\u00a0\u00a0 a result of hard or novel training,\u00a0\nthe recovery process may abnormally\u00a0\u00a0 result in the splitting of\u00a0\npre-existing muscle fibers. To go into more detail, a paper by Murach et al.\u00a0\u00a0 put forth two potential ways\u00a0\nin which this could occur. The first is where a damaged\u00a0\nmuscle fiber is degraded.\u00a0\u00a0 Then, satellite cells (which are\u00a0\ncells involved in muscle regeneration)\u00a0\u00a0 irregularly fuse to the muscle fiber. The\u00a0\nsatellite cells then differentiate (which means\u00a0\u00a0 to transform) into undeveloped muscle fibers, and\u00a0\nonce they develop, a split muscle fiber appears. The second is where the muscle fiber experiences\u00a0\ndamage on one side of its outer wall.\u00a0\u00a0 Satellite cells fuse to this particular\u00a0\nlocation and differentiate into an\u00a0\u00a0 undeveloped muscle fiber, and once they\u00a0\ndevelop, a split muscle fiber appears. Now, there is some evidence to\u00a0\npotentially support either of these. When overviewing the animal\u00a0\nevidence earlier in this video,\u00a0\u00a0 we noted how stretching and synergistic ablation\u00a0\nprotocols increased muscle fiber number. These\u00a0\u00a0 protocols are quite extreme and likely involve\u00a0\nsignificant damage and regeneration responses,\u00a0\u00a0 meaning an abnormal regeneration response\u00a0\ncould explain the increase in fiber numbers. Moreover, recall we mentioned a study by\u00a0\nEriksson et al. finding in trained powerlifters,\u00a0\u00a0 there were signs of splitting from muscle fibers\u00a0\nobtained from the vastus lateralis and trapezius. Something we haven't mentioned is the\u00a0\nresearchers found the splitting was coupled\u00a0\u00a0 with evidence of dead muscle fiber segments\u00a0\nand muscle fibers attempting regeneration. Hence, an abnormal damage regeneration response\u00a0\u00a0 may explain the splitting muscle\u00a0\nfibers in the trained powerlifters. Aside from an abnormal damage regeneration\u00a0\nresponse, another potential reason the body might\u00a0\u00a0 increase muscle fiber number relates to individual\u00a0\nmuscle fibers reaching a certain size threshold. This suggests that an individual muscle\u00a0\nfiber grows up to a certain size.\u00a0\u00a0 From here, the individual\u00a0\nmuscle fiber splits into two. Supporting evidence for this comes from a\u00a0\nfascinating study done by Murach et al. on mice. They found that after 8 weeks of progressive\u00a0\nweighted wheel running, the cross-sectional area\u00a0\u00a0 of the soleus muscle fibers had increased,\u00a0\nwith no changes in muscle fiber number. However, by the 12th week of training, the\u00a0\ncross-sectional area of the soleus muscle fibers\u00a0\u00a0 had decreased, with a concurrent\u00a0\nincrease in muscle fiber number. Therefore, this likely suggests that the\u00a0\nmice's soleus muscle fibers increased in\u00a0\u00a0 cross-sectional area for 8 weeks, but thereafter\u00a0\nsplit, producing the increase in fiber number\u00a0\u00a0 and decrease in muscle fiber cross-sectional area. This brings up an interesting question, why might\u00a0\na muscle fiber split upon reaching a certain size? I think one of the strongest\u00a0\nanswers to this relates to oxygen. Typically, oxygen diffuses from capillaries\u00a0\u00a0 to mitochondria that are\u00a0\nlocated within a muscle fiber.\u00a0\u00a0 Mitochondria can then utilize oxygen to generate\u00a0\nenergy that can power muscle force production. However, as muscle fibers continuously enlarge,\u00a0\nand given mitochondria concentrations do not\u00a0\u00a0 appear to increase with resistance training,\u00a0\nand may even decrease, there could come a point\u00a0\u00a0 where it's too difficult for oxygen\u00a0\nto diffuse out from capillaries\u00a0\u00a0 to certain mitochondria within the fiber, due\u00a0\nto an excessively large diffusion distance. As a result, the muscle fiber splits\u00a0\ninto two, thereby resulting in two\u00a0\u00a0 smaller muscle fibers that should have\u00a0\nno issue with oxygen diffusion distances. Indeed, there is evidence from rats\u00a0\nand crabs that fibers may split\u00a0\u00a0 when diffusing oxygen across a\u00a0\nmuscle fiber becomes difficult. To conclude, despite there being\u00a0\nsome interesting hypotheses\u00a0\u00a0 behind why the body may\u00a0\nincrease muscle fiber number,\u00a0\u00a0 the current research on whether muscle hyperplasia\u00a0\noccurs in humans from training is far from clear. When overviewing the current animal and\u00a0\nhuman research, some may believe it is\u00a0\u00a0 promising in suggesting fiber numbers may\u00a0\nincrease, whereas others may think otherwise. Ultimately, due to the major limitation\u00a0\nin studying whether muscle fiber number\u00a0\u00a0 can increase in humans, I'm not sure we're\u00a0\ngoing to get a conclusive answer anytime soon. Perhaps if non-invasive technologies can\u00a0\nbe developed to accurately count muscle\u00a0\u00a0 fiber numbers in the future, we'll\u00a0\nbe able to make firmer conclusions."

    "published_at": "2021-11-01T17:01:36Z",
    "transcript": "The flat barbell bench press is probably\u00a0\nthe most popular upper body exercise. This is probably quite justified,\u00a0\u00a0 it's a time-tested and highly\u00a0\neffective muscle and strength builder. As examined previously at House of\u00a0\nHypertrophy, the current literature\u00a0\u00a0 demonstrates the flat barbell bench press\u00a0\nis highly effective for chest hypertrophy.\u00a0\u00a0 Moreover, the current data indicates the\u00a0\nbarbell bench press may near equivalently\u00a0\u00a0 and significantly develop the upper,\u00a0\nmiddle, and lower chest regions. The push-up is also a\u00a0\nwell-known upper-body exercise. However, when directly compared to the\u00a0\nbench press for muscle hypertrophy,\u00a0\u00a0 it's far from uncommon for individuals to\u00a0\nassume the bench press is considerably superior. In this video, we're going to examine\u00a0\nthe validity of this assumption,\u00a0\u00a0 is the bench press truly superior to\u00a0\nthe push-up for muscle hypertrophy? To do this, we'll thoroughly examine\u00a0\nthe existing literature comparing the\u00a0\u00a0 push-up and bench press, including\u00a0\nboth longitudinal and acute studies. To kick things off, there are currently two\u00a0\nlongitudinal studies comparing the bench\u00a0\u00a0 press and push-up for increasing\u00a0\nmeasures of muscle hypertrophy. The first was conducted by two Japanese\u00a0\nresearchers, named Kikuchi and Nakazto, in 2017. 18 young men with at least a year of\u00a0\nresistance training experience were\u00a0\u00a0 allocated into a bench press or push-up group. Both groups trained twice per week for 8 weeks. Each session, the bench press group\u00a0\ntrained the flat barbell bench press\u00a0\u00a0 for 3 sets of repetitions to failure (the point\u00a0\nat which no more repetitions can be performed)\u00a0\u00a0 with a 40% one-rep max load, using\u00a0\n2 minutes of rest between sets. The push-up group, each session, utilized a\u00a0\npush-up variation that was roughly equivalent in\u00a0\u00a0 resistance to a 40% one-rep max bench press load.\u00a0\nFor some subjects, this meant a regular push-up,\u00a0\u00a0 whereas for others this was\u00a0\nsome kneeling push-up variation. Regardless of the push-up variation\u00a0\nused, the movement was carried out\u00a0\u00a0 for 3 sets of repetitions to failure,\u00a0\nusing 2 minutes of rest between sets. Before going any further, some viewers may be\u00a0\nscratching their heads at the 40% one-rep max\u00a0\u00a0 resistance used for both exercises. Perhaps\u00a0\nyou're thinking this study is completely\u00a0\u00a0 flawed because a 40% one-rep max load is surely\u00a0\nsuboptimal for provoking muscle hypertrophy. However, you'd be wrong. There's now\u00a0\nextensive literature demonstrating\u00a0\u00a0 that a wide range of loads are\u00a0\nsimilarly effective for hypertrophy. A network meta-analysis by Lopez et\u00a0\nal. combined the findings of 24 studies\u00a0\u00a0 and observed similar muscle hypertrophy\u00a0\nbetween light, moderate, and heavy loads. Differences in sex, training status, or the\u00a0\nmuscle examined did not alter these findings. Upon deeper inspection of the included studies,\u00a0\u00a0 much of them had subjects train with loads\u00a0\nranging from 30% to 80% one-rep max. Moreover,\u00a0\u00a0 subjects executed their repetitions at least 3\u00a0\nor fewer repetitions from the point of failure. Consequently, we have high-quality\u00a0\nevidence to suggest so long as\u00a0\u00a0 repetitions are performed 3 or\u00a0\nfewer from the point of failure,\u00a0\u00a0 training with loads between 30% and 80%\u00a0\none-rep max produces similar hypertrophy. Therefore, the 40% one-rep max resistance used in\u00a0\nthe Kikuchi and Nazakata study, which remember,\u00a0\u00a0 had subjects perform repetitions to failure,\u00a0\nis perfectly acceptable for hypertrophy. Returning to the study's details, before\u00a0\nand after the 8-week training duration,\u00a0\u00a0 pectoralis major thickness was evaluated at the\u00a0\nregion between the third and fourth ribs, while\u00a0\u00a0 triceps and biceps thickness was each evaluated\u00a0\nat approximately 60% of the upper arm bone length. The researchers found increases\u00a0\nin pectoralis major and triceps\u00a0\u00a0 thickness were similar between the\u00a0\nbench press and push-up groups. However, biceps thickness only significantly\u00a0\nincreased in the bench press group. This finding is quite intriguing. Most\u00a0\npeople would presume that neither the\u00a0\u00a0 bench press nor push-ups should grow the biceps,\u00a0\u00a0 as they act as an antagonistic muscle,\u00a0\nnot agonist, during these exercises. What could explain this finding? I'm not entirely certain, but the barbell bench\u00a0\npress necessitates a fair degree of stabilization\u00a0\u00a0 to smoothly move the barbell, perhaps the biceps\u00a0\nactively contract to some degree to contribute\u00a0\u00a0 towards this stabilization, thereby explaining\u00a0\nits measurable enhancements in thickness. Nevertheless, for the agonist muscles (at\u00a0\nleast the pectoralis major and triceps),\u00a0\u00a0 the findings of this study indicate\u00a0\nwith all other training variables equal,\u00a0\u00a0 the push-up can produce similar growth\u00a0\nto the flat barbell bench press. Let's swiftly move on to the second 2018 study\u00a0\nby Kotarsky et al. conducted in North Dakota. 23 men between the ages of 18 and 45, with\u00a0\n2-6 months of resistance training experience,\u00a0\u00a0 were assigned into a bench press or push-up group. Both groups trained three\u00a0\ntimes per week for 4 weeks. The bench press group performed the flat barbell\u00a0\nbench press with a load they could complete for\u00a0\u00a0 3 sets of 6 repetitions. Over the following\u00a0\nsessions, once they could successfully complete\u00a0\u00a0 3 sets of 8 repetitions with this\u00a0\nload for 2 consecutive sessions,\u00a0\u00a0 they increased the load by 4.5kg and reverted\u00a0\nto performing 3 sets of 6 repetitions. The push-up group had access\u00a0\nto numerous push-up variations,\u00a0\u00a0 ordered according to difficulty level, and\u00a0\ndivided into double-arm or single-arm variations. If a subject could perform any of the single-arm\u00a0\nvariations for 3 sets of 3 repetitions,\u00a0\u00a0 they commenced training with this\u00a0\nvariation. If not, they commenced\u00a0\u00a0 training with a double-arm variation they\u00a0\ncould execute for 3 sets of 6 repetitions. For those using a single-arm variant,\u00a0\nover the following sessions, once they\u00a0\u00a0 successfully progressed to performing it for 3\u00a0\nsets of 4 repetitions for 2 sessions in a row,\u00a0\u00a0 they progressed to performing the next level\u00a0\nwhile reverting to using 3 sets of 3 repetitions. For those using a double-arm variant,\u00a0\nover the following sessions, once they\u00a0\u00a0 successfully progressed to performing it for 3\u00a0\nsets of 8 repetitions for 2 sessions in a row,\u00a0\u00a0 they progressed to performing the next\u00a0\nlevel. If this next level was still\u00a0\u00a0 a double-arm variation, they\u00a0\nused 3 sets of 6 repetitions,\u00a0\u00a0 whereas if it was a single-arm variation,\u00a0\nthey used 3 sets of 3 repetitions. Before and after the 4-week training\u00a0\nduration, thickness of the pectoralis\u00a0\u00a0 major at 60% of the distance between the\u00a0\ncollar bone and nipple was evaluated. Curiously, neither group experienced\u00a0\nstatistically significant increases\u00a0\u00a0 in pectoralis major thickness. Despite this,\u00a0\nthe numerical mean increased in both groups. This could be due to a couple of reasons. Firstly,\u00a0\nthe study was only 4 weeks, which is a very short\u00a0\u00a0 duration. A longer duration would probably\u00a0\nresult in statistically significant findings. Secondly, as is unfortunately the case with most\u00a0\nresistance training studies, the sample size was\u00a0\u00a0 small. Small sample sizes can impact the ability\u00a0\nto detect changes between and within groups. Nevertheless, despite it not being\u00a0\nclassified as statistically significant,\u00a0\u00a0 the numerical mean for pectoralis major\u00a0\nthickness did increase in both groups. Intriguingly, the percentages favor the push-up\u00a0\ngroup. We can't read into this too much,\u00a0\u00a0 simply because as noted, it wasn't statistically\u00a0\nsignificant, and the sample sizes were small.\u00a0\u00a0 Perhaps these percentages differences\u00a0\nare simply explained by the push-up\u00a0\u00a0 group containing subjects, on average,\u00a0\nwith a higher responsivity to training,\u00a0\u00a0 rather than the push-up being superior\u00a0\nto the bench press for muscle growth. What we can probably conclude from this study, on\u00a0\nthe other hand, is that the bench press evidently\u00a0\u00a0 did not display considerable superiority\u00a0\nversus the push-up for muscle hypertrophy. To summarize thus far, one\u00a0\npaper by Kikuchi and Nakazato\u00a0\u00a0 established that with all other\u00a0\ntraining variables equivalent,\u00a0\u00a0 push-ups produced alike growth of the\u00a0\npectoralis major and triceps to bench pressing. Another study by Kotarsky et al., despite being\u00a0\nquite a limited study with notable considerations,\u00a0\u00a0 at the very least suggests the bench press was\u00a0\u00a0 evidently not considerably superior to\u00a0\nthe push-up for pectoralis major growth. If we were to combine these findings\u00a0\nwith other acute data and reasoning,\u00a0\u00a0 and it seems in all likelihood, push-ups likely\u00a0\nhave the capacity to produce similar hypertrophy\u00a0\u00a0 of the pectoralis major, triceps, and\u00a0\nanterior deltoid to the bench press. For one, the push-up and bench\u00a0\npress are biomechanically alike.\u00a0\u00a0 Both involve shoulder horizontal flexion and\u00a0\nextension, as well as elbow flexion and extension. On top of this, the degree of\u00a0\nrange of motion that occurs is\u00a0\u00a0 probably quite comparable between the two\u00a0\nexercises. With a barbell bench press,\u00a0\u00a0 the bar travels from a position of elbow lockout\u00a0\nto a position where it contacts the chest region.\u00a0\u00a0 Comparably, a regular push-up requires\u00a0\nyou to lower from a position of elbow\u00a0\u00a0 lockout to a position where the chest\u00a0\nregion contacts the ground surface. Considering these aforementioned points, its\u00a0\nunsurprising acute electromyographic studies have,\u00a0\u00a0 for the most part, found push-ups and\u00a0\nbench pressing elicit similar muscle\u00a0\u00a0 excitation of the agonistic\u00a0\nmuscles when load-equated. For those unaware, electromyographic studies\u00a0\n(specifically surface electromyographic studies)\u00a0\u00a0 strap up electrodes to a muscle to\u00a0\nrecord its excitation during an exercise. Remember, muscle fibers activate via electrical\u00a0\nsignals received from the nervous system.\u00a0\u00a0 In essence, electromyography measures the\u00a0\nelectrical signals delivered to a muscle's fibers,\u00a0\u00a0 we call this muscle excitation. Many people, including myself in the past, have\u00a0\nmistakingly stated electromyographic studies\u00a0\u00a0 measure muscle activation. Although muscle\u00a0\nexcitation does precede muscle activation,\u00a0\u00a0 there are intermediate steps within\u00a0\nthe process that means it's not\u00a0\u00a0 sensible to call muscle activation\u00a0\nand muscle excitation the same thing. With that out the way,\u00a0\u00a0 let's briefly review the current electromyographic\u00a0\nstudies comparing the bench press and push-up. A 2020 Canadian study by Alizadeh et al.\u00a0\nfound between a bodyweight push-up and an\u00a0\u00a0 equivalently loaded flat barbell bench press, both\u00a0\nperformed with the same hand-spacing distance,\u00a0\u00a0 excitation of the pectoralis major and anterior\u00a0\ndeltoid was similar during the concentric\u00a0\u00a0 and eccentric phases of the exercises. However,\u00a0\nlateral head triceps excitation seemed to be\u00a0\u00a0 slightly lower during the concentric phase\u00a0\nof the push-up versus the bench press. Another 2020 study by Tillar and\u00a0\nBall had subjects perform four\u00a0\u00a0 different load-equated conditions\u00a0\non the bench press and push-up. The push-up was performed with bodyweight,\u00a0\na 10kg, 20kg, and 30kg weighted vest,\u00a0\u00a0 while the flat barbell bench press was performed\u00a0\u00a0 with four different loads that equated\u00a0\nto each one of the push-up conditions. Additionally, it's worth mentioning the\u00a0\npush-up was performed with handles using\u00a0\u00a0 a pronated grip that replicated the grip\u00a0\nused during the flat barbell bench press. Excitation of the sternal and clavicular\u00a0\npectoralis major, long and lateral\u00a0\u00a0 triceps brachii, were similar between both\u00a0\nexercises at each load-equated condition.\u00a0\u00a0 However, anterior deltoid excitation seemed to be\u00a0\ngreater during the concentric phase on the bench\u00a0\u00a0 press versus the concentric phase of the push-up.\u00a0\nAlso, medial triceps head excitation was greater\u00a0\u00a0 during the eccentric phase of the bench press\u00a0\ncompared to the eccentric phase of the push-up. Finally, another paper by Tillar\u00a0\nused the exact same design. This time around, excitation of all of the\u00a0\nmeasured regions of the pectoralis major, anterior\u00a0\u00a0 deltoid, and triceps was similar between the\u00a0\nload-equated push-up and bench press conditions. Therefore, considering the totality of\u00a0\nthe existing electromyographic literature,\u00a0\u00a0 though there are some differences and\u00a0\ndisagreements between studies, the push-up and\u00a0\u00a0 bench press seem to induce similar excitation\u00a0\nof the agonistic muscles when load-equated. Now, it's worth noting electromyographic studies,\u00a0\nspecifically the technique of electromyography,\u00a0\u00a0 come with limitations and ample\u00a0\nroom for error. Furthermore,\u00a0\u00a0 electromyographic data does not necessarily\u00a0\ncorrelate with muscle hypertrophy outcomes. Nevertheless, combining the current\u00a0\nelectromyographic literature with the two\u00a0\u00a0 previously detailed longitudinal studies, as well\u00a0\nas the fact both exercises are biomechanically\u00a0\u00a0 alike, and it seems we have good grounds\u00a0\nto hypothesize the push-up and bench press\u00a0\u00a0 have the capacity to probably produce\u00a0\nsimilar hypertrophy of the agnostic muscles. Progressing further, it's worth discussing a\u00a0\u00a0 potential long-term problem\u00a0\nwith the regular push-up. As you get stronger and build muscle from\u00a0\nthe stimuli provided by your exercises,\u00a0\u00a0 you're going to want to overload your exercises\u00a0\nin some form in order to consistently maintain a\u00a0\u00a0 high muscle-building stimulus. This\u00a0\nis known as progressive overload. With the flat barbell bench press, such overload\u00a0\ncan easily be accomplished. As you get stronger\u00a0\u00a0 and bigger, you can increase the number of\u00a0\nrepetitions you perform with a given load,\u00a0\u00a0 but more importantly, you also can\u00a0\nincrease the load you train with. With the regular push-up, the number of\u00a0\nrepetitions you perform can be increased. However, there likely comes a point\u00a0\nwhere doing this becomes suboptimal\u00a0\u00a0 for stimulating hypertrophy. Recall we\u00a0\ndetailed how the literature demonstrates\u00a0\u00a0 loads between 30% to 80% one-rep max\u00a0\nelicit similar hypertrophy outcomes,\u00a0\u00a0 provided repetitions are executed 3\u00a0\nor fewer from the point of failure. As explored in a previous video, it's\u00a0\nunclear if loads lighter than 30%\u00a0\u00a0 one-rep max still can optimize hypertrophy.\u00a0\nThere are existing data suggesting it might not. Very generally, individuals can perform\u00a0\napproximately 35 repetitions with a 30%\u00a0\u00a0 one-rep max load. Therefore, it follows\u00a0\nthat if an individual performs more than\u00a0\u00a0 35 repetitions on the regular push-up, no longer\u00a0\nmight muscle hypertrophy be optimally stimulated. What's the solution to this? One solution is to progress via using\u00a0\nharder and harder push-up variations.\u00a0\u00a0 Recall this was the strategy\u00a0\nutilized in the Kotarsky study. There exist an array of push-up\u00a0\nvariations with varying difficulty levels. For example, a 2011 study by Ebben\u00a0\net al. examined what percentage of a\u00a0\u00a0 person's bodyweight they pushed during\u00a0\na few different push-up variations. Approximately 64% of a person's body weight\u00a0\nwas pushed during a regular push-up. Elevating\u00a0\u00a0 your hands decreased this percentage while\u00a0\nelevating your feet increased this percentage. Furthermore, a kneeling push-up required a subject\u00a0\nto push approximately 49% of their body weight. This data can aid us in figuring out\u00a0\nhow an individual can progressively\u00a0\u00a0 overload the push-up in the long run. In addition to these aforementioned push-up\u00a0\nvariations, as seen in the Kotarsky study,\u00a0\u00a0 single-arm push-up variations can\u00a0\nalso be highly useful for individuals\u00a0\u00a0 who've progressed to a level where double-arm\u00a0\nvariations no longer adequately challenge them. Other potentially notable push-up variations\u00a0\ninclude explosive push-up variations,\u00a0\u00a0 such as the clap or superman push-ups,\u00a0\u00a0 push-ups with handles to increase the range of\u00a0\nmotion, as well as push-ups with gymnastic rings. Having detailed all of this, there\u00a0\nis potentially an unforeseen concern\u00a0\u00a0 when an individual progresses via using\u00a0\nharder and harder push-up variations. Namely, different push-up variations likely\u00a0\ndistribute your bodyweight load across the\u00a0\u00a0 agnostic muscles differentially. This\u00a0\nmight not align with what you want. For example, as detailed a moment ago,\u00a0\nelevating your feet has you push a higher\u00a0\u00a0 percentage of your body weight versus a regular\u00a0\npush-up. However, it's also quite plausible\u00a0\u00a0 push-ups with elevated feet shift the loading\u00a0\nto your upper chest and anterior deltoids more,\u00a0\u00a0 thereby possibly reducing the stimulus\u00a0\nthe mid to lower chest region experiences. Additionally, many single-arm variations,\u00a0\npotentially due to reduced shoulder horizontal\u00a0\u00a0 flexion demands, may not recruit the chest\u00a0\nto do the degree a person would want to.\u00a0\u00a0 Moreover, although I'm not certain, single-arm\u00a0\nvariations are seemingly quite triceps dominant. These points may be insignificant for those that\u00a0\u00a0 mainly care about getting better\u00a0\nand progressing with push-ups. But for those using the\u00a0\npush-up as a hypertrophy tool,\u00a0\u00a0 this differential recruitment between different\u00a0\npush-up variations may be slightly unideal. Weighted push-ups can probably solve this. Specifically, aiming to progressively\u00a0\noverload the push-up via additional weights\u00a0\u00a0 (either through a weighted vest, plates, plates\u00a0\nin a backpack, or some other method) can likely\u00a0\u00a0 be highly effective for making the push-up a\u00a0\nstable and solid muscle hypertrophy stimulus. Recall earlier we presented two studies\u00a0\nby Tillar that found weighted push-ups,\u00a0\u00a0 for the most part, managed to elicit alike muscle\u00a0\u00a0 excitation of the agonistic muscles\u00a0\nto equivalently loaded bench pressing. Now, in theory, there could come a point where\u00a0\nweighted push-ups become slightly less practical. Namely, performing 50-70kg weighted\u00a0\npush-ups is probably feasible,\u00a0\u00a0 but, beyond this point, it may become\u00a0\ntricky to practically use heavier loads. However, there still exist solutions. Adding in paused repetitions, using deficit\u00a0\nstyle push-ups to increase the range of motion,\u00a0\u00a0 or even something like gymnastic rings can\u00a0\nbe tools to further progressive overload. Additionally, although\u00a0\npotentially more triceps dominant,\u00a0\u00a0 working on weighted single-arm push-ups variations\u00a0\nwould plausibly still be a great stimulus\u00a0\u00a0 for the pectoralis major and anterior deltoid. It's also worth noting again that repetitions\u00a0\nup to 35, so long as they are executed 3 of\u00a0\u00a0 fewer repetitions from failure, are similarly\u00a0\neffective for stimulating muscle hypertrophy. As a result, progressing heavily\u00a0\nweighted push-ups into the higher rep\u00a0\u00a0 ranges will likely still be powerful\u00a0\nfor stimulating muscle hypertrophy. For example, let's say you've worked up to\u00a0\nperforming 50kg weighted push-ups for sets\u00a0\u00a0 of 8 repetitions, and you wish to no longer add\u00a0\nfurther external load as it isn't practical.\u00a0\u00a0 From here, your new goal might be to hit sets of\u00a0\n30 repetitions with this 50kg weighted push-up. The main point I'm attempting to illustrate\u00a0\nhere is that although the bench press is far\u00a0\u00a0 simpler to progressive overload in the long run,\u00a0\u00a0 there are many routes in which an individual\u00a0\ncan successfully overload the push-up long-term. Before closing out the video, I think there are\u00a0\nsome other interesting things worth mentioning. The literature implies the push-up has a\u00a0\nfantastic carry-over to bench press strength. We've already overviewed the details of\u00a0\nthe Kikuchi and Nakazato, as well as the\u00a0\u00a0 Kotarsky studies. Yet, I haven't mentioned that\u00a0\nin both of these studies, one-repetition max on\u00a0\u00a0 the flat barbell bench press was evaluated\u00a0\nbefore and after the training durations. In both studies, increases in this measure were\u00a0\u00a0 statistically similar between the\u00a0\npush-up and bench press groups. However, the percentage increases seem to\u00a0\nmeaningfully favor the bench press group.\u00a0\u00a0 I think it's probably likely\u00a0\nthe small sample sizes in both\u00a0\u00a0 studies compromised the ability to\u00a0\ndetect this change as significant. The reason I say this is because it's\u00a0\nof course very logical training the\u00a0\u00a0 bench press is what would increase\u00a0\nyour bench press strength the most. Even so, the data nevertheless demonstrates the\u00a0\npush-up respectably improves bench press strength. What about the reverse of this? How well does bench press training\u00a0\ncarry over to push-up performance? Let us briefly return to the Kotarsky study.\u00a0\u00a0 Remember, they used a variety of push-up\u00a0\nvariations. Before and after the study, both\u00a0\u00a0 the push-up and bench press groups were tested\u00a0\non which level they could comfortably perform. By the end of the study, the push-up group managed\u00a0\u00a0 to increase the level they could\u00a0\ncomfortably perform significantly,\u00a0\u00a0 while although the bench press group also\u00a0\nincreased the level they could execute,\u00a0\u00a0 it was much smaller in magnitude and statistically\u00a0\nsignificantly less than the push-up group. Hence, although bench press\u00a0\ntraining can help push-up strength,\u00a0\u00a0 it may not produce pronounced increases. Although it's worth remembering this\u00a0\nKotarsky study was only 4 weeks in duration,\u00a0\u00a0 longer durations may change this. Generally, I think it's probably quite\u00a0\nlikely bench press training will have\u00a0\u00a0 measurable positive effects on\u00a0\npush-up performance long-term. Finally, throughout this video, we've primarily\u00a0\nbeen discussing the similarities between the\u00a0\u00a0 push-up and bench press, namely their similar\u00a0\nbiomechanical demands, muscle excitation,\u00a0\u00a0 muscle hypertrophy, and carry-over potential. But, there still are notable\u00a0\ndifferences between these two exercises. The push-up likely recruits and\u00a0\ndevelops the abdominal muscles to\u00a0\u00a0 a greater extent than the\u00a0\nflat barbell bench press. Illustrating this, a 2014 study by\u00a0\nCalatayud et al. found that a regular\u00a0\u00a0 push-up produced significantly greater\u00a0\nexcitation of the rectus abdominis and\u00a0\u00a0 external oblique versus the flat barbell bench\u00a0\npress performed with an 85% one-rep max load. These findings are logical. A push-up gets\u00a0\nyou into a plank position that necessitates\u00a0\u00a0 abdominal recruitment to support and stabilize the\u00a0\ntrunk. Opposingly, the flat barbell bench press\u00a0\u00a0 has you rest your trunk on a bench, meaning the\u00a0\nabdominal muscles need not be recruited as much. In addition to this, the push-up\u00a0\nlikely does a superior job to the\u00a0\u00a0 bench press for developing the serratus anterior. One of the functions of the serratus anterior\u00a0\nis the protraction of the shoulder blades. During a well-executed push-up, the shoulder\u00a0\nblades move freely throughout the movement.\u00a0\u00a0 Specifically, the shoulder blades\u00a0\nretract during the lowering phase\u00a0\u00a0 and protract during the lifting phase,\u00a0\nenabling serratus anterior recruitment. Conversely, a well-executed flat barbell\u00a0\nbench press typically has your shoulder\u00a0\u00a0 blades retracted and pinned down into\u00a0\nthe bench, meaning no protraction occurs. That brings us to the end of the video. To make everything crystal clear, let's\u00a0\nestablish a few key takeaway points:\u00a0 Combining the electromyographic literature\u00a0\nwith the two longitudinal studies,\u00a0\u00a0 as well as the biomechanical similarities\u00a0\nbetween the push-up and bench press,\u00a0\u00a0 and we seem to have good grounds\u00a0\nto hypothesize both exercises\u00a0\u00a0 likely have the capacity to produce similar\u00a0\nhypertrophy of the agonistic muscles.\u00a0 Overloading the bench press in the long-term\u00a0\nis simple, the load can be increased.\u00a0 On the other hand, the push-up is a\u00a0\nlittle more tricky to overload long-term.\u00a0 One solution is to progress via using\u00a0\nharder and harder push-up variations.\u00a0\u00a0 Although, a potential concern with this is\u00a0\nthat the different push-up variations may\u00a0\u00a0 differentially distribute the load amongst the\u00a0\nagonistic muscles. For some, this may be unideal.\u00a0 Probably the best resolution to this\u00a0\nis to train with weighted push-ups.\u00a0 Current data implies the push-up has a great\u00a0\ncarryover to bench press strength. Whether the\u00a0\u00a0 reverse of this is true isn't entirely clear.\nDespite there being many similarities between\u00a0\u00a0 the two exercises, there are some\u00a0\nnoteworthy differences. The push-up\u00a0\u00a0 recruits the abdominals and serratus anterior to\u00a0\na greater extent than the barbell bench press.\u00a0 Finally, although we've been directly comparing\u00a0\nthe bench press to the push-up in this video.\u00a0\u00a0 It's important to remember in the real world,\u00a0\nyou do necessarily have to pick between either.\u00a0\u00a0 Both can successfully be\u00a0\nperformed in a training plan."

    "transcript": "[Music] training card is clearly important for developing muscle and strength it's logical to think the more you train the more you gain you don't want to take your foot off the gas this has some truth to it more training volume up to a point tends to produce more size and strength on average but some evidence indicates maybe counterintuitively that training breaks could improve long-term muscle and strength gains in this video we'll examine this evidence try to figure out how deloads fit into this and wrap up with potential takeaways [Music] this 2013 japanese study about ogre sawara and colleagues is one of the most interesting weight training studies ever conducted 14 previously untrained men were recruited and designed into a continuous or periodic group the continuous group trained for 24 weeks straight while the periodic group alternated between training for six weeks and completely resting for three weeks for a full 24 weeks during the training weeks both groups train three times per week with each session consisting of training the barbell bench press for three sets of ten repetitions with a 75 percent one net max load with two to three minutes of rest between sets note the 75 one rep max load was updated every three weeks by the end of the 24 training weeks triceps growth pectoralis major growth and bench press warner max strength gains were similar between both the continuous and periodic groups that is despite the periodic group training 25 less due to the training breaks they took they still saw similar gains to the continuous group by the 24th week the graphics tell us how this was possible for all the measurements pectoralis major growth triceps growth and bench press strength the continuous group continued making gains across the 24 weeks but we can see their gains progressively slowed and became less as time went on for example during the first six weeks the continuous group increased their characterized major size by around 15 percent but by the last six weeks of training they only increased their pectorized major size further by approximately five percent conversely the periodic group lost some muscle and strength during their rest weeks but once they resume training their gains increased at the greater and faster amount versus the continuous group ultimately resulting in similar gains by the 24th week in fact the periodic group continued to experience a similar amount of gains throughout their training weeks their gains did not slow down and become less for example during the first six weeks the periodic group increased their pectoralis major size by around 15 and by the last six weeks of training they again increased their pectoralis major size by around a further 15 to 20 percent now here's the key point what happens if this study continued beyond 24 weeks given the continuous group gains gradually slowed down while the periodic group continued experiencing similar gains across their training weeks it's very possible the periodic group would surpass the gains of the continuous group at some point in other words training breaks could enhance your long-term muscle and strength gains [Music] why did the continuous groups gain slow down as they continue training and how did the periodic group continue gaining a similar amount during their training weeks desensitization and re-sensitization of anabolic pathways could be their respective answers within your muscles myofibular protein synthesis and myofibrillar protein breakdown are always ongoing myofibular protein synthesis refers to the creation of proteins that increase your muscle size while my fibular protein breakdown is the destruction of these same proteins when the amount of myofibular protein synthesis exceeds the amount of myofibrillar protein breakdown muscles increase in size at the cellular level myofibrillar protein synthesis is stimulated by signaling pathways signaling pathways are where a bunch of proteins interact with one another to ultimately increase or decrease protein synthesis or breakdown the pi3k akt m2 pathway is one of the best known pathways that increase my fibular protein synthesis one part of this pathway involves the p70 s6k protein enzyme and researchers often measure the activation of this protein after lifting weights as you'd expect phosphorylation which can be thought of as activation in this case of p70 s6k is increased after lifting weights and this brings us to our main point another study by ogre sawara and colleagues found that after 12 to 18 consecutive training sessions training was performed every other day phosphorylation of p70 es6k gradually decreased across these training sessions in other words the consecutive training sessions desensitized and lowered activation of p70 s6k implying lower my fibular protein synthesis increases and by extension muscle size gains however taking a 12-day training break was enough to re-sensitize p-70 es6k now this study was done on rats but a recent study corroborated these findings in humans they found only seven training sessions consisting of leg presses and leg extensions were enough to significantly reduce the phosphorylation of p70 s6k after training however a 10-day training break was enough to restore p70 s6k's responsiveness therefore consecutive training sessions seem to desensitize the anabolic pathways potentially explaining why the continuous groups were progressively fewer gains but training breaks can re-sensitize the anabolic pathways potentially explaining why the periodic group continued gaining a similar amount of gains during their training weeks we just saw that 10 days of no training was sufficient to resensitize p70 essex k in humans but recall the periodic group took three weeks off between training weeks unfortunately as noted in a recent analysis the research isn't crystal clear on the time course of muscle and strength loss during detraining but a few other studies also demonstrate losses of strength and muscle do occur within three to four weeks of no training of course strength and muscle loss would likely be a lot less if any at all with a 10-day break in fact one study by han and colleagues found that muscle fiber cross-sectional area was not significantly decreased after eight days of not training thus what if the periodic group instead of taking three weeks off only took 10 days off between their training weeks given muscle and strength loss would be a lot less if any at all during a 10-day break and this duration may be sufficient to re-sensitize anabolic pathways perhaps the periodic group would have seen more gains and surpassed the continuous group earlier of course this is speculation but it's very possible before moving on i want to note it's not clear how glycogen and its associated water changes fit into this lifting weights can increase glycogen and thus water storage within muscle fibers so some of the muscle size loss with the training is likely related to glycogen and water decreases nor actual contractile tissue loss unfortunately how much glycogen fluctuations can impact muscle loss and regain isn't super clear yet some data indicates it might not be that important one study found by just over doubling the relative concentrations of glycogen within the quadriceps which was achieved by having subjects first lower the glycogen levels through carbohydrate restriction and then significantly increase it via extreme carbohydrate intake the cross-sectional area of the vastus muscles increased by 3.5 percent this seems like a decent muscle size change but remember this was achieved by just over doubling the relative concentrations of glycogen stores here's the thing one study by hanan colleagues found although glycogen did increase with training the relative concentrations of glycogen remain the same indicating glycogen concentrations only scaled with increases in fiber size thus the effect of glycogen fluctuations on muscle size might be very little when discussing lifting weights only overall more research is needed to examine the relationship between glycogen and muscle loss during training breaks [Music] so far we've been talking about complete training breaks but what about deloads where you reduce volume and or intensity well-structured d-loads likely maintain muscle and strength and if they can still re-synthesize your anabolic pathways they could be an alternative to taking training breaks however i'm skeptical dealers would enable re-sensitization of your anabolic pathways as even though your volume and or intensity is decreased you're presumably still stimulating the anabolic pathways to a fair degree potentially preventing it from resetting but this is me purely speculating future research is needed [Music] recall both the continuous and periodic training groups kept training with the same regime the barber bench press was trained for three sets of ten repetitions with an intermittently updated 75 one rep max load however what if some kind of paradise regime was used instead whereby volume and intensity fluctuated throughout the program one idea behind periodization like this is to consistently vary the stimulus so gains continue increasing at a good rate something that could have helped the continuous group yet the current researcher does question this paradise training does not seem to produce more muscle growth than non-paradise training strength gains do appear to be greater with paradise versus non-paradise training but limitation is in the studies finding this the paradise training groups ultimately train with heavier average relative loads something that's better for strength if you equate average training relative loads between non-paradise and paradise regimes strength gains appear to be similar having said all of this a major limitation with all the paradise research is pretty much all of them last between 6 and 16 weeks so longer study durations are unquestionably needed to make better conclusions nevertheless if periodization is superior long term the question is by what mechanism if periodization regimes can reduce the amount of desensitization experienced by your anabolic pathways then perhaps training breaks would not be all that important but at the same time perhaps periodization plus training breaks would be even better for long-term gains if periodization regimes work through some other mechanism then again the combination of it with training breaks might be even better for long-term gains but future research is needed to establish the true effectiveness of periodization in the long term [Music] in summary short training breaks around 10 days could re-sensitize anabolic pathways responsible for muscle growth over the long term this could mean occasional short breaks will result in you building more muscle and strength it's not clear if deloads would be sufficient to re-sensitize anabolic pathways if they are this could be another route one could take if they do not wish to stop training altogether overall more research is needed in this area and for the time being it would be misleading of me to state for a fact that short training breaks will 100 build you more muscle and strength in the long term based on your interpretations of the data overviewed you may wish to experiment with training breaks at the very least though a practical takeaway from this video is that you should not be worried about training brakes whether you want to try and let a nagging injury heal but life's unpredictability gets in the way of training taking time off is perfectly fine at the very worst your muscle and strength remain the same or decrease during the time off depending of course on how long you took off but if you did lose muscle and strength once you resume training you will regain this lost muscle and strength at a faster pace thanks to muscle memory at the very best you actually re-sensitize your anabolic pathways and set yourself up for more gains once you return to training [Music]"

    "transcript": "[Music] what determines whether a muscle or muscle region is recruited during an exercise as detailed previously at the house of hypertrophy neuromechanical matching may be the primary answer that is the nervous system recruits muscle or muscle regions that have the greatest leverage for that exercise think of leverage as how easily a muscle or muscle region can produce force for a given exercise now chances are you're human and humans have many similarities in many situations the leverage a specific muscle or muscle region has for an exercise is going to be similar among numerous individuals for example the middle deltoid has the greatest leverage for shoulder abduction versus other muscles a finding consistent among numerous studies so a shoulder abduction exercise like lateral raises is going to preferentially grow the middle deltoid in virtually all individuals yet in other cases individual differences certainly exist in the leverage a muscle or muscle region has for an exercise in this video we'll explore the evidence for this what this means for your training and we'll wrap up trying to answer whether an individual can change what muscle region they predominantly recruit during an exercise let's dive in [Music] a 2021 study out of france had trained subjects before nordic curls and stiff-legged deadlifts while activation of three hamstring muscles semitendinosus semimembranosus and biceps femoris was recorded via surface electromyography for both exercises hamstring activation was not identical between individuals for example with the nordic curl quite a few individuals saw the highest activation in the biceps femoris but for others it was the semitendinosus or semimembranosus likewise for the stiff-legged deadlift some recruited the semimembranosus the most others the biceps femoris another 2020 study out of poland found during a barbell bench press the activation of the chest triceps and anterior deltoid differed between individuals some tended to activate the chest the most others the triceps the most and even others the anterior deltoid the most other research also finds during tasks such as walking and cycling muscle activation patterns differ between individuals now all of these research papers use surface electromyography abbreviated to emg which has limitations it does not precisely measure muscle activation rather it estimates the strength of the nerve signals to muscle fibers a few steps before actual muscle activation moreover many technical points exist where surface electromyography research can go wrong even so i still believe the mentioned studies are useful for one the french study had excellent reliability as they retested the measures in another session with similar recordings attained secondly the polish study did involve electromyography recordings from maximal isometric bench press contractions with their elbows at 90 degrees something that might be better for increasing the validity of the recordings so all in all i believe we have promising data indicated in certain situations not everyone experiences the same muscle recruitment patterns during an exercise this means just because one individual says their muscles grew a certain way with one or a selection of exercises it does not necessarily mean you'll experience the same thing over the long term you're going to want to try and figure out what selection of exercises work best for your body and goals this is why tracking your training and running your own small experiments can be of great benefit i've noted two example situations in the pins comment for those interested besides not everyone's anatomy and preferences are the same either certain exercises may suit someone's anatomy and or preferences more than someone else and this may indeed matter for long-term muscle growth for example a 2017 study out of the usa recruited 17 men with an average of 5.6 years of training experience subjects were assigned to a fixed or autoregulated group the fixed group was given this program to train weekly the auto-regulated group was free to select what exercises they wanted to train per muscle group each session from a wide list all other training variables were the same between groups by the end of the 9 week study duration lean body mass gains were greater for the autoregulated group presumably at least some of this result is due to trained individuals having a good understanding of what exercises work best for them leading to better muscle adaptations during compound exercises that recruit multiple muscle groups logical evidence suggests your technique biases towards recruiting your stronger muscle or muscle groups for example this 2009 study out of the usa established people with greater back strength relative to knee strength used their back more during a lifting task while people with greater knee strength relative to back strength used a more knee dominant strategy this could work against your goals say you want the barbell bench press to highly develop your chest yet perhaps you use a deltoid dominant technique unknowingly you may lower the bar as usual but you press up and then back resulting in a large part of the lifting phase being far from the line of your shoulders something that likely recruits the anterior deltoid more a better way would be to lower as usual and then instantly press backwards to reduce the distance between the bar and the shoulder line and then upwards when necessary this technique is likely more favorable for chest development and in fact elite bench presses tend to use this bar path no this precise bar path is executed easier during hard repetitions where the bar is moving slowly because you're nearing failure or you're using heavy weights with easier repetitions simply aiming to press backwards straight off the chest will suffice the takeaway here is it's good to be aware of the technique you're using during a compound exercise is it conducive to your goals this is one reason why recording yourself performing an exercise can be useful [Music] we've just mentioned how you want to be aware of your technique during compound exercises as this can influence which muscle groups you preferentially recruit but away from technique is there any way to change which muscle groups get preferentially recruited some new research suggests there might be specifically performing additional isolated training for a muscle group may subsequently increase its activation during a compound exercise we previously noted a study from poland indicating recruitment of the chest triceps and anterior deltoids differ between individuals on the barbell bench press but the researchers did something interesting they split subjects into one of three groups those with the lowest chest emg recordings during the bench press the chest group those with the lowest anterior deltoid emg recordings the anterior deltoid group and those with the lowest triceps emg recordings the triceps group the subjects went on to perform a targeted isolation training for their respective lowest emg muscle performing three exercises per session each for four sets of 10 to 15 repetitions to failure three times per week for six weeks these were the exercises used for each group per session all three groups also perform three sets with a full rep max load on the barbell bench press each week to ensure strength did not attenuate after the six-week training period recruitment of the chest anterior deltoid and triceps were remeasured and all three groups increased the recruitment of the muscle they trained the anterior deltoid group recruited the anterior deltoid more with a slightly non-significant decrease in triceps and chest involvement the chest group recruited the chest more with a sharp decrease in anterior deltoid involvement but little triceps recruitment change the triceps group recruited the triceps more with a decrease in chest and anterior deltoid involvement another study out of the usa recorded gluteus maximus involvement during bilateral and unilateral squads before and after a week of daily glute band training glute involvement during the bilateral and unilateral squats was increased after the week of daily glute band training thus the literature suggests performing isolated training for a muscle group and reducing or ceasing training for other muscle groups may lead to the trained muscle group increasing its involvement in a compound exercise more research is still needed to establish the true effectiveness of this method but if you would really like to change what muscle group you preferentially recruit during a compound exercise you may wish to experiment with this concept perhaps you like the back squat but you'd like it to recruit the glutes more than usual performing some added isolation training for the glutes for a while while minimizing work for other muscles may accomplish this similarly if you like deadlifts but you'd like it to recruit the glutes or hamstrings more than the spinal erectors performing glute or hamstring isolator training for a while while minimizing spinal erector training may accomplish this [Music] in summary individuals do not always recruit the same muscle or muscle regions during an exercise so over the long term you're going to want to figure out what selection of exercises works best for you anatomy and preferences also play a role here with compound exercises you should be mindful of whether your technique is executed in a way that predominantly recruits the muscle group you want to maximally train finally it's possible performing added isolation training for a muscle group for a while will increase that muscle's activation during a compound exercise this could be useful if you wish to change what muscle group you preferentially recruit during a compound exercise [Music]"

    "title": "Full Range of Motion Is NOT Optimal For Building Muscle (New Study)",
    "published_at": "2021-06-03T15:51:45Z",
    "transcript": "Up until recently, the scientific consensus\nwas trending towards the idea that a full range of motion is better than a partial range\nof motion for muscle growth. A full range of motion indicates you move\nthe joints involved in an exercise through their full potential in that movement. A partial range of motion indicates you move\nthe joints in an exercise through a select portion of their full potential. Excluding the new study we'll assess in this\nvideo, there have been 6 studies comparing a full to partial range of motion for hypertrophy. 4 of these found a full range of motion to\nbe better, 1 found no effect of range of motion, and the last one found a partial range of\nmotion to be better. In the comment section, after watching this\nvideo, you may wish to read a pinned comment detailing some info and notes about the one\nstudy that found a partial range of motion to be better. So, in total, although it's not particularly\noverwhelming, the overall evidence does suggest using a full range of motion is superior. However, if you were to carefully assess these\n4 studies, you could not truly conclude that a full range of motion is optimal. Let me explain. All of these studies used a partial range\nof motion that trained the muscle at a short or neutral length. Let's demonstrate this by quickly going through\neach of the four studies. Pinto et al. used a preacher curl, one group\nof subjects used a full range of motion, from 0 degrees of elbow flexion to 130 degrees\nof elbow flexion. Another group used a partial range of motion,\nfrom 50 to 100 degrees of elbow flexion. Due to this range of motion, the biceps would\nhave been working at a short to neutral length. Increases in biceps thickness favored the\nfull range of motion group. HOWEVERRRR, what if the partial range of motion\ngroup instead used a partial range of motion that trained the biceps at a long length. For instance, what if they trained from 0\nto 50 degrees of elbow flexion. Would this still be inferior to a full range\nof motion? The second study by Bloomquist et al. had\na full range of motion group perform squats from 0 to 120 degrees of knee flexion. A partial range of motion group performed\nthe exercise from 0 to 60 degrees of knee flexion, meaning the quadriceps would have\nbeen working at a short length. Increases in thigh cross-sectional area across\nmany regions of the muscle were significantly greater for the full range of motion group. But again, what if the partial range of motion\ngroup used a range of motion that trained the quadriceps at long lengths. For instance, what if they trained from 60\nto 120 degrees of knee flexion? The third study by Kubo et al. had a full\nrange of motion group perform squats from 0 to 140 degrees of knee flexion. A partial range of motion group performed\nthe exercise from 0 to 90 degrees of knee flexion, meaning the quadriceps, adductors,\nand glutes would have been working at a short to neutral length. Increases in quadriceps volume were similar\nbetween both groups, but increases in gluteus maximus and adductor volume were significantly\ngreater for the full range of motion group. Again, what if the partial range of motion\ngroup used the bottom range of motion in the squat, to train the muscles at a long length. Would the results still be the same? The fourth and final study by McMahon et al.\nhad a full range of motion group perform a range of lower body exercises from 0 to 90\ndegrees of knee flexion. A partial range of motion group carried out\nthe exercises from 0 to 50 degrees of knee flexion, resulting in the quadriceps being\ntrained at short lengths. Vastus lateralis cross-sectional area increases\nat most regions favor the full range of motion group. Again, what if the partial range of motion\ngroup used a range of motion that trained the quadriceps at a long length. For instance, what if they trained from 50\nto 90 degrees of knee flexion? So, on the face of it, these 4 studies collectively\nindicate a full range of motion is better than a partial one. But, upon closer analysis, they only truly\nindicate a partial range of motion that trains the muscle at a short to neutral length is\ninferior to a full range of motion. They do not inform us of how a partial range\nof motion that trains a muscle at a long length compares to a full range of motion. Fortunately, a new study by Pedrosa et al.\ndoes. 45 untrained women were assigned to one of\nfive groups: a long length, short length, full range of motion, varied, or control group. We won't mention the control group any further. They did no training and, as expected, experienced\nminimal gains. All four training groups trained a knee extension\nmachine with a 2-second lifting and 2-second lowering phase, three times per week for 12\nweeks. The long length group trained with a partial\nrange of motion that worked the quadriceps at a long length. From 100 to 65 degrees of knee flexion. The short length group trained with a partial\nrange of motion that worked the quadriceps at a short length. From 65 to 30 degrees of knee flexion. The full range of motion group trained with\na near full range of motion. From 100 to 30 degrees of knee flexion. The varied group, in one session, performed\nthe knee extension identical to the long length group, but in their next session, they performed\nit identical to the short length group. They continued alternating between these two\nranges of motions throughout the study. All groups trained the exercise each session\nwith 3-6 sets of 7 repetitions with a 60% one-rep max load, using 3 minutes of rest\nbetween sets. The 60% one-rep max load was specific to each\ngroup's range of motion. Every 2 weeks, one-rep max for each group's\nrespective range of motion was retested to readjust the 60% one-rep max training load. Cross-sectional area of the rectus femoris\nand vastus lateralis was measured at 40, 50, 60, and 70% of the thigh bone length. Looking at the results, the long length group\nexperienced the best muscle growth responses compared to all other groups. But, the varied group was a close second. These results are truly surprising and challenge\nconventional beliefs. Let us further break down the findings more. At 40% of the thigh bone length, increases\nin rectus femoris and vastus lateralis cross-sectional area were statistically similar between all\ngroups. But, at 50% of the thigh bone length, increases\nfor the rectus femoris and vastus lateralis were similar between the long length and varied\ngroup BUT greater than the other two groups. At 60% of the thigh bone length, increases\nfor the rectus femoris and vastus lateralis were similar between the long length and varied\ngroup BUT greater than the two other groups. Finally, at 70% of the thigh bone length,\nincreases for the rectus femoris and vastus lateralis were greatest for the long length\ngroup compared to ALL other groups. These results clearly demonstrate that there\nis a difference between a partial range of motion that trains a muscle at a short length\nand a partial range of motion that trains a muscle at a long length. Furthermore, a partial range of motion that\ntrains the muscle at a long length does not appear to be inferior to a full range of motion. In fact, at most measured regions, it was\nsuperior. Before we speculate on the reason for these\nresults, there is other research supporting the idea that training a muscle at a long\nlength is superior to training a muscle at a short length. A study by McMahon et al. had a long length\ngroup train the knee extension from 90 to 40 degrees of knee flexion, meaning the quadriceps\nwere trained at a long length. A short-length group trained the exercise\nfrom 50 to 0 degrees of knee flexion, meaning the quadriceps were trained at a short length. Cross-sectional area increases for the vastus\nlateralis at all measured regions were greater for the long length group. Unfortunately, this study did not have a full\nrange of motion group. Nevertheless, it clearly demonstrates how\na partial range of motion at a long muscle length is superior to one at a short length. Research on isometric training further supports\nthis. Isometric training is where you hold a muscle\nin a static contraction. A review paper by Oranchuk et al. combined\nthe results of 9 different studies and found that isometric training at a long muscle length\nproduced greater muscle growth compared to isometric training at a short length. So, to return to the core of this video, a\npartial range of motion that trains a muscle at a long length might be overall superior\nto a full range of motion. Why? There is no certain answer to this question\nyet. But, there are a few potential hypotheses. Firstly, training a muscle at a long length\nwith a partial range of motion could result in greater metabolic stress and muscle damage. For instance, one study found that an isometric\nknee extension at a long muscle length resulted in greater oxygen consumption compared to\ncontractions at a short length. Perhaps implying more metabolic stress. Additionally, a few studies found training\na muscle at a longer length resulted in greater muscle damage in the days after training compared\nto training at a shorter length. The caveat with these studies is they compared\nlong length partial range of motion or isometric training to short length training, not to\nfull range of motion training. When compared to a full range of motion, there\ncould still be a difference, but without research, it is difficult to say. Nevertheless, I believe these reasons are\nunsatisfactory. Mainly because the role of metabolic stress\nand muscle damage in muscle growth is far from clear. There are numerous lines of evidence that\nwould suggest more metabolic stress or more muscle damage does not result in more muscle\ngrowth. A much better-categorized mechanism of muscle\ngrowth is mechanical tension. And as it turns out, there might actually\nbe ways in which a partial range of motion at long muscle lengths induces greater mechanical\ntension. First, we need to establish what mechanical\ntension truly is. Mechanical tension is simply equal to the\nforce generated by a muscle. A muscle generates force via active tension\nor passive tension. Exploring active tension first, this is the\nforce generated by the contractile units of a muscle. Looking at the layers of a muscle, within\na muscle fiber are myofibrils. Myofibrils are home to the contractile units\nof a muscle, called sarcomeres. These generate force when something called\nthe myosin head extends from the myosin filament, and pulls on something called the actin filament\ntowards the M-line, shortening the length of the sarcomere. The force generated by this interaction ultimately\npulls on tendons and results in muscle contraction. Put simply, there are mechanosensors that\ndetect these very forces, and go on to initiate signaling cascades that result in muscle hypertrophy. Zooming out, high levels of active tension\nis a result of two components: muscle fiber recruitment and the amount of force generated\nby each muscle fiber. High levels of muscle fiber recruitment mean\nmore sarcomeres in a muscle are generating force, while a high amount of force generated\nby each muscle fiber means the sarcomeres are producing high amounts of force. There is some research demonstrating individuals\npossess greater voluntary activation when contracting a muscle at a long length. This implies that the body may be able to\nrecruit more muscle fibers and/or produce more force with each muscle fiber when you\ncontract muscles at a long length. Let me explain further. Voluntary activation refers to how much of\na muscle you can access to produce force. Generally, no one can actually activate a\nmuscle 100% fully. Using special equipment, researchers can figure\nout what percentage of a muscle's force-producing potential you can voluntarily activate during\nmaximal efforts. Quite a few studies have demonstrated that\nindividuals experience greater voluntary activation during contractions at longer muscle lengths. As one example, Douget et al. measured voluntary\nactivation of the quadriceps during different stages on a knee extension machine. When subjects performed a maximal contraction\nat 50 degrees of knee flexion, their voluntary activation level was 93.6% on average. When subjects performed a maximal contraction\nat 75 degrees of knee flexion, voluntary activation was slightly higher, on average 96%. Finally, when subjects performed a maximal\ncontraction at 100 degrees of knee flexion, voluntary activation was even higher, around\n98.5% on average. So, subjects experienced greater voluntary\nactivation when the quadriceps were at a longer lengths, indicating an enhanced capacity to\nrecruit more muscle fibers and/or produce more force with each muscle fiber. Therefore, performing a partial range of motion\nat long muscle lengths may allow you to experience higher levels of active tension for the full\nduration of the exercise. When using a full range of motion, your active\ntension capacity would fluctuate throughout the range of motion. When the muscle is at a long length, it would\nbe able to reach higher active tension levels, but as it moves to a more shortened length,\nits active tension capacity may slightly diminish. This fluctuation and inconsistency may explain\nwhy a full range of motion could be inferior to a partial range of motion at long muscle\nlengths. Aside from active tension, passive tension\nalso plays a role in mechanical tension. Returning to the structure of a muscle, we\ndetailed how within muscle fibers are myofibrils and how within myofibrils are sarcomeres. Passive tension is the force generated when\na sarcomere is stretched. More specifically, when a molecule within\nthe sarcomere called titin is stretched, it generates passive tension. This tension is essentially the resistance\nto stretch. Like an elastic rubber band, when you stretch\nit, it resistances stretch. Furthermore, once you let go, that tension\nthat resisted stretch can snap the rubber band back to its resting shape. Titin acts in much the same way. The passive tension generated by titin is\ndetected by mechanosensors which go on to initiate signaling cascades that result in\nmuscle hypertrophy. Now, one would assume that when a muscle is\nstretched, so at a long length, its sarcomeres are also stretched, meaning passive tension\nis high. However, somewhat confusingly, this isn't\nalways the case. A muscle can have its sarcomeres arranged\nin a way that means when it is stretched, its sarcomeres aren't stretched to the point\nof high amounts of passive tension. Moreover, at a given muscle length, within\nthe same muscle, different sarcomeres may be at different lengths. Having said this, they're still likely are\nmuscles, or at least parts of a muscle, that have its sarcomeres sufficiently stretched\nto the point of amounts of high passive tension when the muscle is at a long length. Although there isn't a substantial amount\nof research in this area, the muscles of the quadriceps do appear to have their sarcomeres\nsufficiently stretched to the points of amounts high passive tension when the quadriceps are\nat a long length, at least in the muscle regions measured in the study. Therefore, using a partial range of motion\nthat works a muscle at long lengths might result in a consistently high contribution\nof passive tension to the exercise. Conversely, when using a full range of motion,\nthe degree of passive tension may fluctuate throughout the exercise. It may be high when the muscle is at a long\nlength, but then sharply disappear when the muscle is shortened. The more consistent passive tension with a\npartial range of motion at long muscle lengths might further explain why it could be superior\nto a full range of motion. So, to summarize this section of the video,\nit's plausible that a partial range of motion at long muscle lengths results in greater\nactive and passive tension, making it a more powerful stimulus for hypertrophy compared\nto a full range of motion. I should emphasize that these are hypotheses,\nalthough I believe they are quite strong hypotheses, future research would need to verify them. Now, I think it would be useful to close off\nthe video with a discussion on some limitations and further considerations. The exercise used in the main study of this\nvideo by Pedrosa et al. was a knee extension machine. When using a full range of motion on this\nexercise, the exercise is hardest and requires the most amount of force production closer\nto full knee extension, when the quadriceps are at a short length. Therefore, during fatiguing repetitions, the\nquadriceps are being challenged the most at a short length, not a long length. In other words, when performing full range\nof motion repetitions on the knee extension, you are not training the quadriceps maximally\nat a longer length. Could this very fact explain why the long\nlength group achieved superior muscle growth? What if the study used an exercise that, with\na full range of motion, required maximal force production at long muscle lengths? For example, in a full range of motion squat,\nthe exercise is most challenging when the quads, glutes, and adductors are more lengthened\nthan shortened. Considering this, would a partial range of\nmotion squat at long lengths (so performing the bottom half of the squat) still produce\nmore muscle growth than a full range of motion squat? This is a question for future research. Regarding the Pedrosa et al. study, although\nit measured cross-sectional area at quite a few regions of the quadriceps, it did not\nmeasure everything. Measurements were taken at 40-70% of the thigh\nbone length for the rectus femoris and vastus lateralis, but what about 10-30% or 70-100%. Moreover, what about the vastus medialis and\nvastus intermiedus. It remains possible, although unlikely, that\nin these unmeasured regions, the full range of motion, or even the short length group,\ncould have experienced superior gains. Finally, it's very important to remember that\nthis is only one study. Replication is important in science. At the moment, it would not be sensible to\ntruly confirm and conclude that a partial range of motion at long lengths is superior\nto a full range of motion, future research is required. Based on your interpretation of this video,\nyou may wish to experiment with partial ranges of motions at long muscle lengths. Ultimately, there probably is no massive or\nterrible downside. The future of range of motion research looks\nexciting, and I look forward to creating new videos in the future if any new research comes\nalong."

    "title": "Does STRETCHING Between Sets Help Build More Muscle?",
    "published_at": "2020-09-30T11:42:27Z",
    "transcript": "i've previously discussed if flexing between sets could enhance muscle growth concluding that overall it did not seem to help build more muscle but what about stretching in between sets this isn't a new idea legendary bodybuilder frank zane states he used to stretch the primary muscle group worked in an exercise for 15 seconds between sets but what does the current research say on stretching in between sets can it help build more muscle a study by evangelista and colleagues aimed to determine just this 29 untrained men were assigned to either a stretching group or a non-stretching group both groups trained the same exercises the bench press seated row seated dip machine biceps curl leg extension and leg curl each for four sets of eight to twelve reps each set taken to failure twice per week for eight weeks the non-stretching group rested 90 seconds between sets the stretching group also rested 90 seconds between sets but during 30 of those seconds they held a static stretch between sets of the bench press they performed a stretch for the chest and front delts between sets of the seated row they performed a stretch for the lats between sets of the seated dip machine they performed a stretch for the triceps between sets of the biceps curl they performed a stretch for the biceps between sets of the leg extension they performed a stretch for the quadriceps between sets of the leg curl they performed a stretch for the hamstrings as a note all stretches were performed with the maximum range of motion participants could achieve pain-free thickness of the elbow flexors which would have included the biceps bracha and brachialis triceps brachii rectus femoris and vastus lateralis was measured before and after the a weeks for both groups although there were no statistically significant differences in elbow flexor triceps and rectus femoris thickness between both groups it is evident that the results do slightly favor the stretching group a longer study or more participants could result in these differences being significant for vastus lateralis thickness the stretching group did experience statistically significant greater increases compared to the non-stretching group so overall i would say this study suggests that stretching in between sets may indeed help build more muscle the reasons as to why stretching in between sets helps build more muscle in this study are not clear and i think much more research would be needed to confirm these results and identify the potential mechanisms anyway it's important to consider the context of this evangelista study when interpreting the results the participants were untrained training responses do differ between trained and untrained individuals so it's not clear whether these results would apply to trained individuals the participants also held the stretches with a maximum range of motion they could achieve pain-free this is probably a noteworthy point as previous research by junior and colleagues found that performing a quadricep stretch that was painful for the participants before leg extensions resulted in less vastus lateralis growth compared to performing only the leg extensions although this was stretching before training it's very possible that performing intense stretching in between sets could reduce muscle growth too furthermore the participants in their evangelista and colleague study held the stretches for 30 seconds holding stretches for longer than this could be counterproductive for instance seattle's and colleagues found that stretching the quadriceps for 60 seconds resulted in greater decreases in quadriceps force output compared to stretching for 30 seconds this more pronounced force loss with 60 seconds of stretching could mean the quadriceps receive less of a hypertrophic stimulus though i am guessing here and future research would be needed to validate this idea lastly at this current moment this is the only published research paper to have assessed the effects of stretching in between sets on muscle hypertrophy now i did actually find details about an unpublished paper by silva and colleagues assessing how stretching in between sets impacts hypertrophy this paper was presented at a conference only in summary here are the details 24 trained men were assigned to either a stretching or non-stretching group both groups performed four sets of eight to twelve reps of calf raises on the leg press machine during the rest intervals the stretching group allowed the leg press machine weight to stretch their gastrocnemius so i think they had their feet dorsiflexed on the leg press machine here the results showed that the stretching group experienced greater increases in gastrocnemius thickness compared to the non-stretching group although these results are interesting especially as this study was supposedly done on trained individuals these results should be taken cautiously simply because the study was never published and peer reviewed to wrap up the evangelista and colleague study provides us with evidence that stretching in between sets could help build more muscle albeit for untrained individuals ultimately regardless of your training experience you may wish to experiment with stretching in between sets and see how it works out for you of course it's going to be difficult if not impossible to actually figure out if it's helping you build more muscle but if you enjoy it and you ensure stretches are held for 30 seconds or less and at a comfortable intensity i think at the very least there would be no downside but again this is me just guessing based on a single study additionally you could implement stretching in between sets for only a few select movements or you could have intermittent training blocks where you implement stretching in between sets at the end of the day i really do hope more papers assess this topic especially in trained individuals so we can truly find out if stretching between sets enhances hypertrophy if any new papers come out i do definitely plan to make videos on [Music] them"

    "title": "The BEST Training Mode for Muscle Growth (Most Get WRONG)",
    "published_at": "2023-01-08T11:59:58Z",
    "transcript": "[Music] welcome to the house of hypertrophy what's the best training modality for hypertrophy some speculate free weights like barbells or dumbbells are superior since they produce greater temporary increases in anabolic hormones after training in fact others might suppose dumbbells are the optimal modality since they enable greater freedom of movement others might suggest machines are superior as they can help you isolate a specific muscle or because some machines provide variable resistance or even eccentric overload with body weight or resistance bands it's rare to hear people believing these are superior for muscle hypertrophy instead some might actually believe these are terrible for building muscle in this video we'll thoroughly examine the research on how barbells dumbbells machines body weight and resistance bands compare for muscle hypertrophy let's Dive In [Music] we have an in-depth video dissecting the literature on the stimuli behind muscle hypertrophy mechanical tension is likely the primary hypertrophy stimulus other hypothesized stimuli like muscle damage and metabolic stress simply don't have strong evidence they are powerful drivers of hypertrophy we thoroughly described mechanical tension previously but if you haven't seen it all you need to know for this video is that mechanical tension is the force produced by the fibers of a muscle within and around muscle fibers are mechanosensors that can detect forces and convert the forces into a signaling Cascade that produces muscle hypertrophy how do we achieve High mechanical tension and how does this tie into different training modalities the basic initial step is we want to use a movement that recruits a muscle and it appears the nervous system recruits muscles based on their leverage for a given movement this is called neuromechanical matching think of Leverage as how easily a muscle can produce Force for a given movement for example the biceps have significant leverage for flexing the elbow joints so elbow flexion will recruit the biceps elbow flexion can occur with barbells dumbbells machines body weight and resistance bands in other words no training modality has an inherent Advantage for initiating the recruitment of a muscle the specific movements not training modality is what results in a muscles recruitment now certain training modalities might be better for carrying out a certain movement we'll return to this point later but the main point is no training modality has a unanimous Advantage for initiating the recruitment of a muscle now simply initiating the recruitment of a muscle doesn't mean we're exposing that recruited muscle to high overall mechanical tension to create high overall mechanical tension we'd want to recruit as many muscle fibers as possible and have those individual fibers produce higher respective forces for a decent duration this is simply done by training two or close to failure within the 6 to 35 rep range reps on the lower side of this will readily involve High muscle fiber Recruitment and forces and these increase even more as you near failure reps on the higher side of this only initially require low muscle fiber recruitment but the key point is as you continue repping out a narrowing failure fiber Recruitment and forces increase significantly so much so that during those few reps before failure fiber Recruitment and forces and the duration of this High overall tension end up being comparable between lower and higher reps some may be wondering about reps below 6 or above 35 reps below 6 will involve high fiber Recruitment and forces but the duration of this tension exposure is probably too short to optimally stimulate hypertrophy rips above 35 might generate too much central nervous system fatigue that reduces your ability to recruit muscle fibers and therefore expose them to tension anyway getting too or near to failure within the 6 to 35 rep range can theoretically be done with all the training modalities indicating that neither has an inherent superiority for eliciting high mechanical tension using our example we know they're a barbell dumbbell machine body weights and resistance bands exercises that involve elbow flexion if you can get all of these two or near to failure in the 6-35 rep range it is more than likely all of them expose the biceps to comparably high overall mechanical tension levels now there is a potential problem with resistance band specifically we'll address this point a little later summarizing this section the primary hypertrophy stimulus is likely mechanical tension and all exercise modalities have the capacity to generate similar mechanical tension [Music] so far we've been discussing mechanical tension in relation to the active forces produced by muscle fibers that's the forces generated by their actual contractile units within muscle fibers yet muscle fibers and the surrounding extracellular Matrix can generate forces when stretched these are passive forces and these forces can also be detected by mechanosensors that go on to Signal muscle growth exercises that involve a stretch since they would involve both active and passive forces probably involve higher overall net mechanical tension this logic is a strong candidate as to why the research consistently finds exercises that train muscles as stretched positions produces more hypertrophy barbells dumbbells machines body weight and resistant spares can all theoretically attain stretch for example the quadriceps muscles all have leverage for knee extension and would be stretched when the knees are flexed barbell back squats Bulgarian split squats hex squats pistol squats and resistance banded squats would all attain stretch of the quadriceps again provided you can get two on air to failure within the 6 to 35 rep range with these presumably they would be similarly effective for stimulating muscle hypertrophy however there again is a potential problem with resistance bands they actually change the resistance curve of a squat and this may be unfavorable for hypertrophy we'll address this more later nevertheless the summary of this section is neither training modality is intrinsically Superior for training muscles at stretched positions so from an overall stimulus perspective it's evident there is no clear winner despite this some may counter this with other data some suggest free weights produce greater increases in anabolic hormones however Others May note that machines can provide variable resistance and overloaded eccentrics let's assess if these arguments have any real validity [Music] free weights tend to produce higher temporary increases in anabolic hormones for example a 2020 Canadian study compared a free weight to machine training session and found temporary increases in free testosterone were larger after the freeway session another 2013 study from the USA compared performing barbell squats to leg pressures and found temporary increases in testosterone and growth hormone was Superior after the barbell squats therefore surely these greater temporary anabolic hormone increases with free weights translates into greater muscle growth signaling they don't a substantial number of studies simply failed to find that greater temporary elevations in anabolic hormones results in more long-term hypertrophy it's quite possible that temporary elevations in animal equipments from training is a result of energy usage not signaling muscle growth some say free weight training leads to Chronic increases in arresting testosterone and this means more hypertrophy for example people have said barbell squats increased testosterone and therefore benefit overall muscle hypertrophy the problem is many studies find freeway training including barbell squats largely doesn't chronically increase resting testosterone levels we've analyzed the data in a previous video certain machines can provide variable resistance or eccentric overload but does this matter examining variable resistance first what actually is it many exercises don't equally challenge the muscle throughout the range of motion a barbell biceps curl is hardest at the midpoint of the movement but easier at the bottom and top portions machines with variable resistance vary the resistance throughout the range of motion resulting in the muscle being challenged equally throughout the range of motion as a fun fact Nautilus machines were popular from the 1970s onwards and these provided variable resistance Arthur Jones the founder of Nautilus believed variable resistance was more effective Arthur Jones was also one of the early promoters of high intensity training that's one set to failure disclaimer in theory it may be possible to produce variable resistance with things other than machines but all the studies exploring variable resistance used machines so is variable resistance training Superior a 2013 Finnish study had trained men perform leg presses leg extensions and leg curls with either variable or standard resistance vastus lateralis gains were comparable between the standard and variable resistance groups another 2013 finished study found the exact same thing in a group of previously untrained older men a 2019 polish study found when training preach occurs with these variables armed circumference gains did not differ between using variable or standard resistance finally a 1995 Canadian study compared variable to standard pre-checkers and bicep gains were similar between the two so all these studies failed to find variable resistance is more effective I think it's probably the case regardless of whether you're using variable resistance or not getting too or near failure ensures sufficiently High mechanical tension what about machines that provide eccentric overload like flywheels firstly though what is eccentric overload muscles are a lot stronger when producing Force while lengthening versus when producing Force while shortening case in point when training with normal bicep curls it requires more effort to lift than it does to lower machines providing eccentric overload increase the load in The Eccentric portion and return to normal load in the concentric portion disclaimer eccentric overload can be performed without machines using stuff like weight releases but all of the current studies I'm aware of evaluating eccentric overflow training use flywheels or other machines there are 11 of these studies and only four of them suggest eccentric overload produced more hypertrophy versus normal training the rest indicates similar muscle hypertrophy between eccentric and normal training so their evidence is not compelling that eccentric overload is better for muscle hypertrophy some may be thinking surely eccentric overload since it would produce greater muscle fiber recruitment during The Eccentric should add to the overall mechanical tension and thereby produce more muscle hypertrophy but as analyzed by Chris Beardsley differential fatigue mechanisms could reconcile this when compared to normal training eccentric overload training may involve disproportionately more fatigue that impairs the active forces generated by muscle fibers this potential lowered active forces with eccentric overload training May mean it does not involve more overall mechanical tension versus normal training maybe explaining why most studies find similar hypertrophy between normal and eccentric overloaded training foreign [Music] so far it's evident there isn't an inherent Superior training modality so we'd expect the research comparing hypertrophy between training modalities to largely find comparable hypertrophy indeed this seems to be the case a 2020 Belgian study had previously untrained individuals trained either a freeway only machine only or a combined freeway and machine program each exercise was trained with the following variables chest thigh and upper arm circumference increases were comparable between all three groups criticisms of this study are untrained individuals were used and circumference is far from the most precise measurement of muscle gains fortunately another 2020 Canadian study recruited trained men and women and assessed hypertrophy with ultrasound a much better measurement subjects either trained a free weight or machine only program biceps and quadriceps growth were ultimately similar between both programs with body weight training there have been two studies comparing it to free weights a 2017 Japanese study in trained men compared High rep bench press training to high rep push-up training and chest and triceps hypertrophy were similar between both some may suggest the use of High Reps in this study is a limitation but we've already mentioned how high reps are no less effective than lower Reps for hypertrophy so it's not a limitation in my view another 2018 USA study in men with some training experience compared low rep bench press to low rep push-up training the low reps with the push-ups were achieved by using harder push-up variations neither group experienced statistically significant chest gains but both groups saw numerical increases fascinatingly the percentages actually favored push-up training but this study was only four weeks and the greater percentage gains with the push-ups could be due to random variation at the least this study demonstrates barbells are not inherently Superior to other training modalities like body weights unfortunately I'm not aware of any studies comparing muscle hypertrophy between resistance banded training and other modalities but as alluded to we'll discuss some potential issues with resistance bands shortly nevertheless combining this long-term data with other logic and research outlined previously I believe the argument that no training modality is inherently Superior for muscle

these free videos at the house of hypertrophy thank you foreign studies there weren't any that directly compared dumbbell only training to other training modalities but some may speculate dumbbells could be superior compared to barbells machine's body weight and resistance bands dumbbells enable the greatest freedom of movement so in certain cases dumbbells may allow you to better carry out a movement a muscle has leverage for for example a dumbbell bench press permits slightly more horizontal flexion versus corresponding barbell machine and body weight movements the chest has great leverage for horizontal flexion so maybe dumbbell bench presses produce greater chest hypertrophy some EMG analyzes but not all find the dumbbell bench press produces higher chest activation versus barbell bench presses dumbbells may also allow you to achieve a greater stretch I'm actually skeptical that these points matter that much firstly EMG simply has an array of limitations it doesn't truly measure muscle activation rather it estimates electrical signal input to the muscle's fibers called neuromuscular excitation even when actual muscle activation or neuromuscular excitation is kept the same merely changing the length of the muscle produces different EMG recordings this is a big limitation of EMG cases exist where EMG data fails to translate to muscle growth compare a leg extension held isometrically at a short or long muscle length EMG data finds higher quadriceps EMG recordings from leg extensions held isometrically at a short length yet research actually measuring muscle growth finds leg extensions held isometrically at longer lengths produce notably more quadriceps hypertrophy versus the short length with dumbbell bench presses enabling more horizontal flexion I am unsure if the ability to move the dumbbells towards each other the top adds anything extra for hypertrophy since tension at the top is low and the muscle is at a shortened position some data indicate extra range of motion with a muscle short and doesn't create more hypertrophy with stretch we know that it's important for hypertrophy but I've yet to mention more stretch doesn't necessarily mean more hypertrophy a 2019 Japanese study found similar quadriceps hypertrophy between a 90 and 140 degree knee flexion squat despite the latter involving a greater quad stretch there could be a threshold to that amount of passive tension that triggers hypertrophy so I'm not currently convinced dumbbells could be superior due to slightly more motion or stretch hopefully we get future research directly comparing muscle growth between dumbbells and other training modalities so the current data indicator neither training modality has an inherent superiority for muscle hypertrophy but nuances do exist different modalities may involve slightly differing stabilization or biomechanics and this may subtly impact muscle recruitment generally extreme instability is going to be unfavorable for muscle hypertrophy since stability not the fatigue of the muscle would be the limiting factor your typical exercises with different training modalities are fairly stable exercises but subtle stability differences can exist between training modalities let's compare barbell and dumbbell bench presses again both involve horizontal flexion shoulder flexion and elbow extension but the dumbbell provides comparatively more instability this instability might actually produce greater biceps recruitment due to Greater antagonistic co-activation which fundamentally limits triceps Force output on top of this the barbell bench press actually involves lateral forces and these lateral forces probably enhance triceps recruitment with the barbell bench press with the dumbbell bench press meaningful lateral forces cannot be applied since attempting to do so would result in you throwing the dumbbells either side of you so although barbell and dumbbell bench presses involve horizontal flexion shoulder flexion and elbow extension stability and biomechanical factors probably mean dumbbells involve lower triceps involvement this lower triceps recruitment with the dumbbell variation could be useful or unideal depending on your goals note neutral hand Dumbo bench presses likely train the triceps well as there is research on this exercise finding it did induce notable triceps hypertrophy When comparing a bodywear exercise like the push-up to dumbbell or barbell bench presses the push-up requires greater core stabilization so it likely recruits the abdominal muscles more additionally push-ups can involve scapular protraction which results in Greater serratus anterior recruitments this higher abdominal and serratus anterior recruitment with push-ups could be useful or unideal depending on your goals comparing barbell back squats to Bulgarian split squats or even hack squats all involve hip and knee extension however barbell squats require you to load and stabilize the spine likely resulting in Greater spinal erector recruitment this could be ideal or unideal depending on your goals so summarizing this section although no training modality is likely inherently Superior for muscle hypertrophy certain stability and biomechanical differences between modalities can subtly impact hypertrophy outcomes [Music] training with different exercise modalities can be complementary in an overall training program we know according to the principle of neuromechanical matching muscles are recruited based on their leverage for a given Movement we also know different training modalities can involve the same movements but this isn't actually always the case it's impossible to carry out a vertical pull with a dumbbell or barbell body awake to machine or even resistance band can do this it's probably a great idea to have a vertical pulling movement in a program for back hypertrophy so dumbbell or barbell only programs can be sub-optimal to optimally train the rectus for more as part of the quadriceps you likely want isolated knee extension this cannot be done effectively with barbell or dumbbell movements and body weight or machine exercises are needed barbells and dumbbells don't really isolate knee flexion either body weight and machines can do this it's probably favorable to have a knee flexion exercise to optimally develop the hamstring muscle group coming soon to the house if I perch for YouTube channel we'll be releasing free Ultimate Guide videos on developing each major muscle these videos will provide great insight into what precise movements and exercises may be favorable so summarizing this section different training modalities can be complementary in an overall training program we should not view them as an either or [Music] body weight training and resistance bands may have problems with Progressive overload Progressive overload is fundamental for gaining muscle hypertrophy and strength long term two popular ways to Progressive overload are increasing load or the number of reps you perform Thinking of progressive overload as a cycle works well a challenging training session evokes muscle and strength gains these gains enable you to apply Progressive overload and in turn this application of progressive overload sustains a challenging training session Recent research as examined in another video indicates that progressively overloading via increasing load or reps are largely similarly effective for muscle hypertrophy therefore increasing rep numbers with body weight or resistance bands is perfectly fine for muscle hypertrophy however in the long term increasing load is going to be required since continually adding reps and going Beyond 35 reps per set may not be ideal for hypertrophy as we alluded to already there are harder body weight variations that technically increase load particularly with the upper body however progressively overloading body away lower body exercise long term is more challenging and limited and think it's more than likely body weight training alone isn't going to be optimal for lower body long-term hypertrophy we've discussed these points more in a previous video with resistance bands you can also use bands that are technically heavier loading but the practicality and feasibility of this long term is certainly questionable resistance bands also have other potential issues it's all too easy to allow the resistance band to snap back into position during the lowering phase of an exercise resulting in extremely little muscle loading in the lowering phase we already know that Max eccentric loading simply isn't additive for hypertrophy but I do think some eccentric loading is needed resistance bands also provide resistance that results in the exercise being challenging when the muscle is more shortened than stretched I don't think Max tension during stretched positions is required for optimal hypertrophy but you probably want decent tension at stretched positions sometimes resistance bands involve barely any tension at a stretched position for these Reasons I'm skeptical resistance bands are truly on par with our other training modalities but these are my speculations there's no research comparing actual muscle hypertrophy between resistance bands and other training modalities there's only mixed electromyography research with some indicating similar EMG recordings between resistance bands and free weights and others suggesting higher EMG recordings with free weights but we've already mentioned how EMG has an array of limitations that severely limit its usefulness in comparing the muscle growth potential between different things this isn't to say resistance bands build to no muscle of course there was this one 2020 Japanese study indicating resistance banded curls and extensions did produce measurable biceps and triceps hypertrophy we've already noted how if different modalities involve the same movement taking them to or close to failure within the 6 to 35 rep range should be similarly effective hypertrophy yet some individuals may prefer a certain training modality for carrying out a given movement for example both Bulgarian split scores and Barbo back scores involve knee and hip extension but maybe you find the Bulgarian split squat more comfortable certain exercises with a training modality like machines and resistance bands can involve lower joint loading and maybe this is favorable in certain circumstances yet the restricted nature of certain machines may not suit your Anatomy finally you may have quite significant imbalances between your two Limbs and during a bilateral exercise one side of your body may be performing disproportionately more work this can be unideal and dumbbell training can be a potential solution here so summarizing this section certain individual factors can play a role in deciding whether you want to train with barbells dumbbells machine sporty weight or even resistance bands [Music] neither exercise modality is inherently Superior for hypertrophy all can theoretically involve High mechanical tension which has been identified to be the primary stimulus for hypertrophy greater temporary anabolic hormone increases with free weights are not associated with more hypertrophy machines that provide variable or eccentric overload don't seem to produce more hypertrophy though subtle differences in hypertrophy can exist between training modalities due to different stability or biomechanical demands ultimately different training modalities can be complementary in an overall program resistance bands have potential pitfalls namely they can involve low tension in the lowering phase and some resistance banded exercises barely apply tension to the muscle at stretched positions furthermore progressively overloading resistance banded exercises long term as well as body weight lower exercises can be difficult to effectively achieve if you've

    "transcript": "those with high levels of testosterone in the normal physiological range builds more muscle right at least that's what seems to be commonly believed if someone has an impressive physique people may chalk it up to them having high testosterone various proclaimed testosterone boosting supplements may play on this idea claiming to boost testosterone and by extension muscle hypertrophy but it is testosterone intrinsically related to muscle hypertrophy let's examine the data [Music] do people with higher testosterone levels build more muscle than people with lower testosterone levels a study out of the USA helps answer this young trained men performed a range of exercises with these variables training successfully increased the whole biceps cross-sectional area as well as slow and fast Stitch fiber sizes extracted from the biceps resting testosterone levels did not change from the 12 weeks of training average levels were around 580 nanograms per deciliter with a standard deviation of around 172 nanograms per deciliter this indicates around 68 of the subjects had testosterone levels within the range of 346 nanograms per deciliter to 690 nanograms per deciliter yet no significant correlation between subjects resting testosterone levels and whole biceps slow twitch fiber and fasted fiber gains were found that is those with higher testosterone levels did not consistently see more games than those with lower testosterone levels a limitation of the study is only 11 subjects were recruited fortunately another Canadian study recruited 49 trained men and had them train a range of exercises with these variables training increased lean mass as well as slow and fast Stitch fiber sizes extracted from the vastus lateralis the researchers actually analyzed the relationship between a range of resting hormones and the hypertrophy measurements through backward elimination regression fundamentally the analysis did not find a relationship between any of the resting hormones and muscle hypertrophy so that includes testosterone as well as free testosterone in fact the coefficients of determination were quite low in non-statistical lingo this just indicates little of the muscle hypertrophy could be explained by resting hormone concentrations so testosterone levels were not predictive of muscle hypertrophy those with higher levels did not necessarily see more gains fascinatingly the researchers divide divided the subjects into low responders and high responders and then explored if intramuscular free testosterone differed between them intramuscular free testosterone concentration ranged from these levels and we can see there was no difference in levels between the higher and low responders so those who built the most muscle didn't have greater intramuscular free testosterone levels overall either a third study from the USA recruited 67 untrained young men and had them train a range of exercises with these variables after the study the researchers categorized subjects either as high responders moderate responders or low responders based on how much they grew their vastus lateralis if testosterone was the primary determinant of muscle hypertrophy across people we'd expect that high responders to have the highest levels yet average testosterone levels measured before and after training were comparable between the low moderate and high responders here are the individual data points superimposed on the bars we can clearly see there's no association between testosterone levels and being a low moderate or high responder each category involves subjects with lower testosterone levels moderate testosterone levels and higher testosterone levels one subject in the highest responder group had relatively low testosterone levels while a different subject in the lowest responder group had quite high testosterone levels so higher responders didn't necessarily have greater testosterone levels and this demonstrates perfectly how factors beyond testosterone levels play a role in muscle hypertrophy across people I also want to mention a few other interesting things from this data set most subjects did not experience any increase in testosterone from before to after the training period this is consistent with the majority of the literature most studies fail to find resistance training increases testosterone levels we've examined this data in a previous video however there were some individuals who did see an increase in testosterone in fact some individual source and priority crazy changes like this one individual in the low responder group who increased levels from around 750 nanograms per deciliter to above 1 500 nanograms per deciliter Supra physiological territory it's not clear if this is due to some measurement error for this person or if it's actually a real change if it was a real change the funny thing is he was still a low responder in the overall study there were other individuals seeing increases in testosterone from before to after training so maybe this suggests certain individuals can increase their testosterone through resistance training yet confounders still exist changes in their lifestyle elsewhere such as sleep or nutritional factors could explain the changes and not necessarily the resistance training another interesting thing with this data set is there were some individuals who had super physiological levels or at least close to it one individual in the higher responder group had Levels Close to 2 000 nanograms per deciliter the subjects of this study were supposed to be natural it's possible some of them lied explaining these levels but it is also possible they are natural and that they are just anomalies irrespective of your testosterone levels consistent training long term is Paramount for making gains looking workouts and being mindful of your progress is useful an alpha progression is a high quality app that can Aid

those with high levels of testosterone in the normal physiological range do not necessarily build more muscle it is very possible for someone with lower testosterone levels to experience greater muscle hypertrophy than someone with higher testosterone levels this perfectly illustrates how factors beyond testosterone are crucial for the hypertrophy process finally I need to make a technical point the studies we looked at made comparisons between the different people because of this our conclusions must be specific to this as I've carefully worded throughout this video the data proves people with higher testosterone levels do not necessarily build more muscle than people with lower levels and I also believe that data demonstrates that testosterone is not the primary determinant of muscle hypertrophy across people however this data isn't strictly able to tell us what happens if we change a single person's testosterone levels what I mean is if we get 1 person who has testosterone levels of say 400 nanograms per deciliter and they manage to increase levels to 800 nanograms per deciliter would they as an individual now build more muscle from training compared to if their levels remained at 400 nanograms per deciliter again the between people comparisons detail throughout this video cannot truly answer this question fortunately we do have data that can help answer this question there are studies analyzing how increasing testosterone influences muscle and strength gains when training as well as gains if no training was performed whatsoever the Insight from these studies is highly interesting and shall be examined in our next video nevertheless the key point from this video is testosterone is simply not the primary determinant of muscle hypertrophy across people it is very possible for someone with lower testosterone levels to build more muscle than a different person with higher testosterone levels finally I have a free Ultimate Guide to bench pressing ebook that covers these areas feel free to get it in the link in the comments and description [Music]"

    "transcript": "In this video, we'll be overviewing a\u00a0\nfascinating study by Martinez-Cava et al.\u00a0\u00a0 exploring how a full range of motion bench\u00a0\npress compares to a partial range of motion\u00a0\u00a0 bench press training only some part of the\u00a0\ntop range of motion for building strength. Then, we'll make some speculations on\u00a0\nhow hypertrophy may compare between\u00a0\u00a0 full and partial range of\u00a0\nmotion bench press training.\u00a0\u00a0 We'll also discuss very interesting potential\u00a0\nimplications of the results from the study. Martinez Cava et al. recruited 49 men with 6\u00a0\nmonths of training experience and allocated\u00a0\u00a0 them into a full range of motion, 2/3 range of\u00a0\nmotion, 1/3 range of motion, or control group. We won\u2019t discuss the control group from hereafter.\u00a0\u00a0 They did not train and expectedly\u00a0\nmade virtually no gains. All groups trained the smith machine barbell bench\u00a0\npress twice per week for a total of 10 weeks. Repetitions for the full range of motion\u00a0\ngroup were as follows: they lowered the\u00a0\u00a0 barbell from full elbow lockout all the way\u00a0\ndown to the chest, where they momentarily let\u00a0\u00a0 the bar rest for 2 seconds thanks to the smith\u00a0\nmachine spotters, before reversing the motion. The 2/3 range of motion group lowered the\u00a0\nbarbell from full elbow lockout to only\u00a0\u00a0 2/3rd of the way down to the chest, where\u00a0\nthey momentarily let the barbell rest for\u00a0\u00a0 2 seconds thanks to the smith machine\u00a0\nspotters, before reversing the motion. The 1/3 range of motion group lowered the\u00a0\nbarbell from full elbow lockout to only\u00a0\u00a0 1/3rd of the way down to the chest, where\u00a0\nthey momentarily let the barbell rest for\u00a0\u00a0 2 seconds thanks to the smith machine\u00a0\nspotters, before reversing the motion. All subjects performed their repetitions\u00a0\nwith a maximal intended lifting speed\u00a0\u00a0 and a controlled lowering speed. This was a velocity-based study,\u00a0\u00a0 meaning the velocity of each lifting\u00a0\nphase was recorded via special equipment. For each individual, as there\u2019s a\u00a0\nrelationship between the lifting\u00a0\u00a0 velocity during the 1st repetition on a\u00a0\nset and the relative load you\u2019re using,\u00a0\u00a0 the subjects were able to autoregulate\u00a0\nand train with the loads they intended to. The exact reps, sets, and loads used\u00a0\nthroughout the 10 weeks are shown on screen. Of course, the relative loads used for\u00a0\neach group are specific to the range of\u00a0\u00a0 motion they trained with. For example,\u00a0\nwhen subjects trained with a 70% one-rep\u00a0\u00a0 max load, the full range of motion group used 70%\u00a0\u00a0 of their full range of motion one-rep max,\u00a0\nthe 1/3rd range of motion group used 70%\u00a0\u00a0 of their 1/3rd one-rep max, and the 2/3rd range of\u00a0\nmotion group used 70% of their 2/3rd one-rep max. Before and after the study, a range of\u00a0\nstrength and power measurements were assessed. Most relevant for our purposes, all 3 groups had\u00a0\ntheir one-rep maxes on the full range of motion\u00a0\u00a0 bench press, 1/3 range of motion bench press,\u00a0\nand 2/3 range of motion bench press tested. The researchers expressed one-rep max gains\u00a0\nrelative to the participant\u2019s body weight. What they found was the full range of\u00a0\nmotion group saw the greatest gains in\u00a0\u00a0 one-rep max to bodyweight ratios for all\u00a0\nthree bench press variations. Also, the 2/3\u00a0\u00a0 range of motion group saw greater one-rep max to\u00a0\nbodyweight ratio gains compared to the 1/3 group. Stated another way, training with\u00a0\nthe full range of motion bench press\u00a0\u00a0 (which is what the full range of motion\u00a0\ngroup did) was the most effective for\u00a0\u00a0 increasing full range of motion bench\u00a0\npress, 2/3 range of motion bench press,\u00a0\u00a0 and 1/3 range of motion bench press\u00a0\none-rep max to bodyweight ratios. Also, training with a 1/3\u00a0\nrange of motion bench press\u00a0\u00a0 (which is was the 1/3 range of motion\u00a0\ngroup did) was the least effective for\u00a0\u00a0 increasing one-rep max to bodyweight ratios\u00a0\non all three of the bench press variations. These findings are highly interesting. Not\u00a0\nonly do they indicate a full range of motion\u00a0\u00a0 bench press is superior for increasing\u00a0\nfull range of motion bench press strength,\u00a0\u00a0 but a full range of motion bench press is\u00a0\nalso better for increasing partial range of\u00a0\u00a0 motion bench press strength versus training with\u00a0\nthat specific partial range of motion itself. It's not entirely clear what\u00a0\ncould explain these findings. However, could hypertrophy be involved? Although there's no direct research comparing a\u00a0\nfull and partial range of motion bench press for\u00a0\u00a0 hypertrophy, indirect data might indicate a full\u00a0\nrange of motion bench press would be superior. Let me explain. Compared to a partial range of motion\u00a0\nbench press training only the top portion\u00a0\u00a0 (such as a 1/3rd or 2/3rd range of motion), a\u00a0\nfull range of motion bench press would achieve\u00a0\u00a0 a much greater stretch under load of\u00a0\nthe chest, shoulders, and triceps. This matters as stretch under load seems\u00a0\nto be powerful for stimulating hypertrophy. A range of studies using exercises other than\u00a0\nthe bench press has found that using a range\u00a0\u00a0 of motion that accomplishes a stretch under\u00a0\nload of the working muscles produces more\u00a0\u00a0 hypertrophy than a range of motion that\u00a0\nminimally stretches the working muscles. So, how does this all relate to full range\u00a0\nof motion bench press training producing the\u00a0\u00a0 greatest strength gains across the three\u00a0\ndifferent bench press ranges of motions? One way muscles hypertrophy is\u00a0\nvia something called myofibrils\u00a0\u00a0 (which are found within muscle fibers) growing. Myofibrils contain contractile units (that\u00a0\nis, the force-generating units of a muscle).\u00a0\u00a0 One main way a myofibril grows is via increasing\u00a0\nthe number of force-generating units it has.\u00a0\u00a0 This would be very beneficial\u00a0\nfor increasing strength. As a result, perhaps full range of motion\u00a0\nbench press training produced more hypertrophy\u00a0\u00a0 (and thus myofibril growth) versus training\u00a0\nwith the 1/3rd or 2/3rd range of motions,\u00a0\u00a0 explaining why full range of motion\u00a0\nbench press training was the most\u00a0\u00a0 effective for increasing strength\u00a0\nacross all three ranges of motions. Of course, this is purely speculation. I think it's almost certain a full range of\u00a0\nmotion bench press produces more hypertrophy\u00a0\u00a0 than a partial range of motion bench press that\u00a0\ntrains only some top portion. But whether this\u00a0\u00a0 hypertrophy would truly explain the greater\u00a0\nstrength gains is difficult to verify, as other\u00a0\u00a0 factors such as neural adaptations and movement\u00a0\nefficiency would be in play with strength. Moving on, Martinez-Cava et al.\u00a0\nmentioned something quite interesting. Powerlifters, of course, aim to maximize\u00a0\ntheir one-rep max on the barbell bench press. However, it's arguable that many powerlifters,\u00a0\ndue to significantly arching their spine and/or\u00a0\u00a0 retracting their scapula, perform a\u00a0\npartial range of motion bench press. As this study found training a full\u00a0\nrange of motion bench press was\u00a0\u00a0 more effective for increasing partial\u00a0\nrange of motion bench press strength\u00a0\u00a0 than training that partial range\u00a0\nof motion bench press itself,\u00a0\u00a0 perhaps powerlifters might benefit from training\u00a0\nwith a fuller range of motion (via less arching\u00a0\u00a0 and/or scapular retraction) to ultimately\u00a0\nenhance their competition way of bench pressing. Furthermore, maybe cambered bar bench pressing,\u00a0\ndue to increasing the range of motion even\u00a0\u00a0 further, could be beneficial for those looking\u00a0\nto maximize their normal bench press one-rep max. Before ending this video,\u00a0\u00a0 let us discuss some notable limitations and\u00a0\nconsiderations of the Martinez-Cava et al. study. Firstly, as many of you were probably\u00a0\nthinking, a smith machine was used. There are way more similarities between the smith\u00a0\nmachine and barbell bench press than differences.\u00a0\u00a0 But, differences such as stabilization\u00a0\nrequirements and bar path still exist. It's not\u00a0\u00a0 clear if these differences would change anything\u00a0\nif the Martinez-Cava et al. study used a barbell. Secondly, there actually is some data that\u00a0\u00a0 somewhat oppose the findings\u00a0\nof the Martinez-Cava study. Two studies by Massey et al.\u00a0\nhad subjects either train:\u00a0 A full range of motion bench press (we'll\u00a0\ncall the full range of motion group)\u00a0 A partial range of motion bench press (training\u00a0\nonly the first 2-5 inches of the motion) (we'll\u00a0\u00a0 call the partial range of motion group)\nOr an even split of both full and partial\u00a0\u00a0 range of motion bench pressing\u00a0\n(we'll call the combination group). Before and after the study, the\u00a0\nresearchers only measured one-rep\u00a0\u00a0 max on the full range of motion\u00a0\nbench press for all three groups. In one of the studies, conducted on women with\u00a0\nlimited training experience, the full range of\u00a0\u00a0 motion group experienced the greatest increases\u00a0\nin full range of motion bench press one-rep max\u00a0\u00a0 versus the two other groups. These findings do\u00a0\nnot conflict with the Martinez-Cava et al. study. However, in the other study conducted\u00a0\non men with some training experience,\u00a0\u00a0 all three groups experienced increases in\u00a0\nfull range of motion bench press one-rep\u00a0\u00a0 max that was not statistically\u00a0\ndifferent between one another. Put another way, training a partial range\u00a0\nof motion bench press, or a combination of\u00a0\u00a0 full and partial range of motion bench pressing,\u00a0\nwas measurably no less effective than training a\u00a0\u00a0 full range of motion bench press for increasing\u00a0\nfull range of motion bench press one-rep max. It's not readily clear what\u00a0\nexplains these conflicting data.\u00a0\u00a0 More research is evidently still\u00a0\ngoing to be valuable and insightful. Lastly, remember that all of the bench\u00a0\npress studies we've overviewed used a\u00a0\u00a0 partial range of motion that trained the top part. But, could there be any benefit to a partial\u00a0\nrange of motion that trains the bottom part? We overviewed earlier that one reason as to why I\u00a0\nthink the full range of motion bench press would\u00a0\u00a0 produce more hypertrophy than a partial one\u00a0\nthat trains the top part is as a full range\u00a0\u00a0 of motion achieves a greater stretch under\u00a0\nload of the chest, shoulders, and triceps. But, a partial range of motion that trains the\u00a0\u00a0 bottom part would accomplish a stretch\u00a0\nunder load of the working muscles too.\u00a0\u00a0 Therefore, perhaps this would be\u00a0\nperfectly fine for muscle hypertrophy. In fact, could it be superior? I question this as a study by Pedrosa et al.\u00a0\n(which we\u2019ve overviewed in a previous video)\u00a0\u00a0 actually found a partial range of motion leg\u00a0\nextension at the bottom part (where the quadriceps\u00a0\u00a0 are stretched) produced overall more quadriceps\u00a0\ngrowth than full range of motion leg extensions. Of course, this study used a leg extension.\u00a0\u00a0 Thus, we cannot be certain these findings\u00a0\ncan be replicated with the bench press. Ultimately, it would be awesome to\u00a0\nsee if future research can explore\u00a0\u00a0 the effectiveness of a partial range of motion\u00a0\nthat trains the bottom part for hypertrophy,\u00a0\u00a0 as well as if this type of partial range of\u00a0\nmotion could have any benefit for powerlifters\u00a0\u00a0 or those looking to generally maximize their\u00a0\nfull range of motion bench press strength."

    "transcript": "[Music] welcome to the house of hypertrophy in this video we're examining antagonist supersets which have you perform two exercises that train opposing muscle groups back to back examples include the barbell row and bench press the overhead press and pull-up the leg curl and leg extension a biceps exercise with a triceps exercise let's dive straight into the literature foreign [Music] literature indicating antagonist supersets do not compromise performance in fact it has the potential to increase your work capacity a 2014 study out of Brazil compared performing a leg extensions only to performing leg curls before leg extensions performing the leg curls before the leg extensions increase the number of reps performed on the leg extension they also found the shorter rest between the two exercises the better the leg extensional rep performance specifically performing the leg extensions immediately after the leg curls outperformed using a 30 second one minute three minute and five minute rest between the two exercises for clarity subjects of course perform repetitions to failure on the exercises and a 10 rep max load was used on the exercises other experiments support these findings a 2015 straight out of Brazil compared performing three sets of bench presses and then three sets of seated rows traditionally to supersetting the two exercises with virtually no rest between them volume load on both exercises was greater for the superset condition the volume load is calculated by multiplying sets reps and load given both groups perform three sets and use 10 rep max loads the greater volume load for the superset would be explained by them being able to perform more repetitions it's also worth noting the superset session was of course shorter in duration three other studies demonstrate antagonist supersets increase performance versus normal sets all these studies also had subject superset the two exercises with minimal rest between them as per the first study assessed minimal rest is likely the best for increasing performance resting long between the two exercises may not produce performance gains a 2010 study from Australia further supports this a superset condition performed three supersets of bench pools with bench presses but use two minutes of rest between the exercises resulting in four minutes of rest between the identical exercises a traditional condition performed three sets on the bench pull followed by three bench press sets with four minutes of rest between sets both groups perform reps to failure with a full rep max load on the exercises overall volume load was not statistically different between the conditions now though this superset protocol didn't increase performance it still was quicker to complete than the traditional protocol so if an individual doesn't want to perform antagonist supersets with minimal rest between the two exercises having some rest between the two movements can still be effective for saving time so making things Crystal Clear antagonist supersets do not compromise performance rather using minimal rest between the two exercises actually seems to increase your rep performance resting longer between the two exercises does not seem to do this but it's still worth noting it's not detrimental either versus normal sets and it can still save time if you can't perform antagonist supersets for whatever reason perhaps because your gym is busy but you'd still lack a way to potentially increase performance antagonist stretching may work that is stretching an opposing muscle before an exercise seems to increase performance three studies from Brazil designed virtually the same find that stretching the chest immediately before seated rows increase seated row rep performance versus performing only seated rows with passive rest between and before sets why do antagonists supersets and stretching benefit rep performance it's not precisely clear but a hypothesis is it reduces antagonistic co-activation during any movement the antagonist and Agonist muscles produce Force this co-activation is believed to provide joint stability take a leg extension we all know the quadriceps are producing Force to perform the exercise but the hamstrings contract to a degree for knee joint stability by performing antagonist supersets or stretching you may reduce the antagonistic co-activation resulting in The Agonist muscle producing greater force some may be thinking given antagonistic co-activation provides joint stability could antagonists supersets or stretching be unsafe the truth is I don't know the definitive answer but there's reason to believe it's perfectly fine firstly none of the aforementioned studies reported adverse effects of antagonist supersets or stretching additionally we know that strength training in the long term chronically decreases antagonist co-activation anyway and this is one factor that contributes to long-term strength gains [Music] we've uncovered that antagonist supersets and antagonist stretching can increase performance but does it lead to more muscle and strength with antagonist stretching unfortunately there's no research exploring its long-term effects with antagonist supersets we do have two long-term studies but both of them are notably limited a 2009 study out of Australia recruited 15 men with at least one year of training experience and assign them to a traditional or superset group the design of the protocols was similar to the short-term Australia study we noted earlier both groups train the bench pool along with either the bench press or bench throw depending on the session the traditional group performed all bench pool sets first then moved on to the bench press or bench throw they rested four minutes between sets the superset group supersated The Bench pool and bench press or throw with two minutes of rest between the superseded exercises and four minutes of rest between the same exercise the exact sets and Reps used varied throughout the study but were of course the same for both groups overall their traditional group session lasted around 20 minutes while the superset group session lasted 10 minutes after eight weeks bench press and benchpool one rep max strength gains were not statistically different between both groups the percentages do seem to favor the superset group for the bench pool but this difference may be due to random chance as it was not statistically significant nonetheless this study did not have subjects perform antagonist supersets with minimal rest between the two exercises rather two minutes of rest was used between the two exercises we already established this does not increase performance so similar strength gains are probably expected at the least this study shows antagonist supersets can save time without compromising strength gains muscle gains were not assessed in this study but a 2022 study out of Japan looked at both muscle and strength gains 23 untrained individuals were assigned to a traditional or superset group both groups trained resistance banded biceps curse and overhead extensions three times per week for eight weeks a traditional group performed three sets of Curves and then three sets of overhead extensions with one minute of rest between sets a superset group superseted the two exercises with minimal rest between them for a total of three supersets and one minute of rest between supersets both groups performed every set with reps to failure biceps and triceps growth measured by a cross-sectional area did not statistically differ between groups yet percentages favor the traditional group but this might again be due to random chance triceps and biceps isometric strength gains did not statistically differ between both groups either yet the percentages favor the traditional group for bicep strength but again this may be due to random chance so overall this study does not actually look promising for antagonist supersets what's going on despite the superset Group performing the two exercises back to back they did not see increased volume performance versus the traditional group the resistance bands may have something to do with it they were light and subjects ultimately achieved 30 to 60 repetitions with the resistance banded exercises recall all the studies finding increased performance with antagonistic supercess or stretching used free weights or machines with much heavier loads around 10 rep max or heavier loads it's possible that antagonistic co-activation is greater with heavier loads versus light resistance bands so the reduction of antagonistic co-activation with supersets or stretching may only benefit heavier load with free weights or machines but this is me speculating and this speculation also assumes the antagonistic co-activation hypothesis is correct due to these reasons I don't believe this study is strong evidence against the effectiveness of antagonist supersets evidently more quality future research is needed [Music] in summary solid literature indicates antagonist supersets or stretching improves performance antagonist supersets also save time more quality research is needed to determine if long-term muscle and strength gains are enhanced with antagonist supersets or stretching for the time being I think it's very likely at the very least they do not compromise gains ultimately if it interests you I recommend experimenting with antagonist supersets or stretching it's possible you could notice the increased performance and maybe greater long-term adaptations if you've made it this far I have a free ebook you might like it's the ultimate guide to bench pressing for strength and or hypertrophy

    "transcript": "welcome to the house of hypertrophy some say the classic barbell bench is overrated and that dumbbell bench pressing is the way others swear machines due to their stability are your ticket to the city of gains it's easy to feel lost in the Maze of Chess training information online today we're going to obliterate the maze so that when it's all said and done you'll have a clearer overview of what the scientific literature says about Chess training without further Ado let's Dive In before getting into the heart of our analysis the chest refers to a few muscles but we're focusing on the PES major it covers the most area and is what most mean when they say the chest furthermore dividing the pector as major into different heads isn't Bro Science various scientific analyses have divided it into a clavicular and sternal costal head each with a unique nerve Supply in fact we could even go a step further and consider there to be three distinct regions for Simplicity we'll just refer to to the upper middle and lower pecks commencing our analysis the flat barbell bench West is one of the most famous exercises in the Galaxy seen in powerlifting Pro Sports and maybe even your dreams if you're anything like me some say barbell benching sucks for chess gains but the fact is the literature would not agree multiple papers established the petor major grows very well from Flat barbell benching seeing similar or even slightly more average growth than the expected rate of hypertrophy for instance this Japanese paper had previously untrained men train the exercise with these variables and we can see midp thickness increased throughout the study ending up seeing a 43% increase in thickness as for how flat bench pressing impacts other PEC regions two studies shed light onto this this 2022 Australian study had trained folks train the flat barbell bench west across 8 weeks a normal group performed four sets of five reps with an 85% one rep max load a cluster group used the same variables but they rested 30 seconds between each repetition in a set the cluster group didn't see gains Galore which isn't a surprise as the rest between repetitions would have resulted in them training quite far from muscular failure which isn't ideal the normal group experienced impressive hypertrophy across all three pector as major regions and this is the key finding flat benching appears to grow all PEC regions well this Japanese study is the second paper untrained men trained the flat barbell bench press with these variables a normal group trained every week across 24 weeks while a break group took a 3-we break every 6 weeks both groups experienced substantial and similar pector major hypertrophy across three regions thus this study suggests taking a 3-week Hiatus every 6 week didn't compromise gains a remarkably fascinating finding something talked about in previous videos anyhow the key is these results again reveal flat bench and grows the PCS well across its regions this begs two questions do we really need dedicated upper and lower PEC training when flat benching appears to evoke spectacular percentage gains across all regions stay tuned for some upcoming videos where we'll unravel the answer to this question but in this video we'll decode the second question which is since these papers didn't compare flat barbell benching to other exercises how does it stack up to other exercises hello there what's going on this is Vince with bad.com now if I was your trainer on the one hand some say barbell bench pressing is undefeatable since we can use heavy loads and easily progressively overload in the long term on the other hand Others May say the dumbbell Freedom renders it Superior or that the stability with machine variations is the secret source to maximum mus fiber Recruitment and thus hypertrophy who's right luckily we have researched comparing chest HP H pery between some of these exercises plus electromyographic research research actually measuring chest hypertrophy is supreme since it's the real thing we care about but we'll sprinkle in the EMG data where appropriate for those unaware EMG uses electrodes to record a muscle's electrical activity so it does not actually directly measure muscle activation but as electrical activity precedes muscle activation some say this makes EMG a perfect tool is this true not quite there are steps in between electrical activity and muscle Activation so there's not always a onetoone relationship and notably EMG doesn't always measure electrical activity accurately in the first place noise and Technical errors can mess things up we even have studies failing to find an association between EMG and actual muscle hypertrophy although some indirect papers find a relationship so overall the relationship between EMG and hypertrophy isn't straightforward we need to be cautious and some EMG studies are also better designed than others I'll do my best to describe this along the way beginning with machine chest presses versus the flat barbell bench press one EMG paper finds greater PEC and triceps activity with the barbell bench press yet two others find similar activity with this paper finding these two machine chest press variants produce comparable activity of all three PEC regions the front delt and triceps to Flat barbell benching most critically this recent study d directly compared P's major hypertrophy between this machine chest press and the flat barble bench press hypertrophy was quite similar between both therefore I believe we can contend various machine presses probably have the capability of producing similar pet gains to Flat benching delving into the push-up this Japanese paper compared High rep push-ups to high rep bench pressing and similar chest hypertrophy as well as triceps hypertrophy was seen between both perhaps some are pondering hold on a moment on the high reps in this study a crucial drawback it is not regular house of hyper viewers will be more than aware that reps approximately between six and 35 can produce similar hypertrophy provided reps are performed to or close to failure even so weighted push-ups are a possibility and this rather well constructed EMG analysis compared load equated weighted push-ups to flat barble bench pressing it found comparable PE triceps and even front deltoid activity between them push-ups can even be progressed via harder variations this study had subjects do just this in predominantly the 4 to eight rep range using these variations another group just overloaded the flat barble bench West in the 6 to8 rep range fascinatingly chest growth leaned towards the push-up group but this study was merely four weeks and nothing reached significance at the very least ad merely State this indicates the barbell bench is not undeniably Superior thus overall push-ups seem to possess the capacity to produce similar pet gains to Flat benches but this is contingent upon successfully progressing push-ups long term so you can continuously train hard in the 6 to 35 rep range transitioning to the Smith machine five EMG Studies have compared Smith machine to barbell bench pressing and the majority finds similar PEC triceps and frontel activity between them considering this is EMG data and there's an absence of any studies directly measuring hypertrophy my tentative hypothesis is Smith machine benching may be comparable to barbells for the pecks and it may be worth mentioning EMG might be more reliable When comparing exercises that are similar to one another which is the case here progressing to dumbbells let's first focus on the triceps as I think it's quite interesting three Studies have compared triceps activity between dumbbell and barbell bench pressing and all discovered slightly lower activity with a dumbbell why could this be it may be because during the barbell bench press although vertical forces are produced to lift the load some degree of lateral forces are naturally produced and the triceps are likely heavily involved in these lateral forces with the dumbbell however lateral forces cannot be produced attempting to do so would result in the dumbbells falling either side of you as for the PEX and front dels four Studies have made the comparison between dumbbell and barbell benching and the majority find similar PEC and front Del activity between both however there is a trap with EMG that we must be aware of EMG doesn't measure the passive forces muscles generate when they're stretched but emerging research suggests these importantly contribute to muscle hypertrophy dumbbells have the potential to permit a deeper PEC stretch compared to the barbell and even other variations for this reason it's potentially Numero Uno but there are some complications firstly larger dumbbells will obstruct your ability to actually attain a deeper stretch and in general I think most naturally don't execute the movement in a way that maximizes the stretch secondly it's even plausible that any extra stretch simply fails to translate into more gains it is true multiple studies suggest training muscles at stret positions is better for building muscle than shorten positions but this data doesn't necessarily mean getting an extra deeper stretch above an already solid stretch leads to more hypertrophy some studies allude to this this Japanese paper compared 90\u00b0 to 140\u00b0 knee flexion squads glutax and a duct H pery was indeed better with the deeper range of motion but quad Hy pery was similar between both yet another Japanese paper compared these partial tricep Skull Crushers to a full range em motion which attained a better stretch but triceps H perchu was actually better for the partial this study is somewhat of an outlier as it's the only one to date to find that reaching a better stretch led to worse hypertrophy in any case these are just two studies on the quads and triceps and there are currently no studies on the pecs but they at least present the concept that a greater stretch may not always equal greater gains having said all this others might suggest the convergence of the dumbbells at the top is advantageous but there's not much tension at this point and most studies suggest the contracted top position isn't that stimulatory for gains for all these reasons I hesitate to say dumbbells are clearly Superior rather it may be more reasonable to conclude they're largely similar for now last but not least what about dips no not that guacamole dip I'm talking about these dips there are currently no officially published studies measuring EMG or hypertrophy comparing dips to other different exercises I know this paper involves a comparison of EMG between different dips with the ring and normal dips producing decent levels for the chest front delts and triceps not much can be drawn from this so we can't really make any firm conclusions surrounding dips but in an upcoming video on the lower chest we'll dive into dips a little more disregarding dips we've seen the entirety of the evidence appear to suggest all variations may be comparably effective for chest hypertrophy how could this be given some of the arguments presented earlier although the barbell Ben can be trained with heavier loads heavier loads are not a prerequisite for maximizing the hypertrophy stimulus instead training two or n muscular failure is what does this this can be done with lighter loads which is likely why higher reps with lighter loads can produce similar muscle growth to lower reps with heavier loads as for the barbell bench press having great Progressive overload potential although Progressive overload is certainly important for sustaining long-term gains we simply can't say that exercise is easier to Progressive overload are superior very partial squats have great potential to be progressively overloaded but they are not great for hypertrophy as for the suggestion machines are the ticket to the city of gains thanks to their great stability greater stability has indeed been linked to enhanced muscle fiber recruitment but the context of This research should not be overlooked for illustration this paper min manipulated stability levels on a leg extension by strapping down the leg and torso the generalizability of This research is questionable and when push comes to shove the research measuring hypertrophy will always reign supreme to indirect mechanistic speculation and we have a few other analyses finding machines produce similar hypertrophy to free weights some of you may be wondering about the technique and execution of some of the affir mentioned exercises or just about programming for building muscle in general I'm

exceptional so these variations might be all quite comparable for developing the pcks but there are two underappreciated movements that arguably could be the best chess Builders the first one is this which provokes unrival chest tension just kidding of course I stumbled across this movement on multiple social media accounts you will feel a strong chest contraction simply because you're squeezing the plates but the pressing motion isn't aligned with gravity moreover the shoulder flexion that occurs during the movement is likely heavily done by the front delts you can perform the movement lying down which is an Improvement but the excessively close grip probably biases the triceps the overall stretch of the chest is quite significantly reduced and training this movement to or close to failure in the long term is probably not practical the actual two exercises that may be the best chest Builders are the cambered bar bench press and deficit push-up these allow you to achieve an even deeper stretch of the chest we know dumbbells have the potential to attain a deep stretch but we also know there are some complications with this these two variations May better allow you to attain a deep stretch consistently in the long term but as we said when dissecting the dumbbells it's still ambiguous if the greater stretch actually translates into greater gains we saw two studies questioning this as well but since there's no data on the chest nothing conclusive can be said for this reason the notion these two are the best chest Builders is very much hypothetical but I don't anticipate these being inferior so if you're able to experiment with either of these it may be worthwhile another experiment experimental option on the table are partial range of motions at stretch positions we have three studies finding that compared to a full range of motion a partial range of motion at stretched positions built more muscle overall more studies are necessary to understand its generalizability but it's certainly something you may like to test out with the bench press a partial range of motion at the stretch position is simply performing the bottom position as done by Ronnie Coleman here it is interesting to know Arnold mentions this style in his book stating that Sergio lever used to press the bar off his chest but not go all the way up he goes on to say after he used this for a few months his chest became more defined of course Arnold's anecdote isn't definitive proof I just thought it'd be interesting to share I should make it clear if that none of this appeals to you it's more than fine to stick with a typical range of motion on your [Music] exercises as alluded to coming soon to the house of hypy will be videos exploring the upper and lower chest more you might have also been wondering about isolation chest exercises fear not we'll also unravel the potential use of these onto the summary there's a saying all roads lead to ram in this case all roads may not lead to great chest hypertrophy but many of them likely can we've seen the famous flat barble bench press produces spectacular percentage gains across the PEC regions but we also know the literature suggests these variations probably have the capacity to produce similar pet gains to the flat barble bench press therefore you can train with your preference you're also not committing a federal crime if you train with a few of these as a vanilla example you could use the barbell on Monday machines on Wednesday and dumbbells on Friday having said all of this cambered bar benching and deficit push-ups are two movements that can help you easily and consistently train the pecs with a deeper stretch and I would say it's not a stretch hypothesize these could be the two best chess Builders this is currently hypothetical but you could try either of these outs a stretched partial range motion is another experimental option on the table you could try out remember to feel free to

    "transcript": "welcome to the house of hypertrophy in 6th Century BC live the six times Olympic wrestling champion Milo of Croton according to myth Milo would borrow a newborn calf lifting it each day over time not only did the calf grow into a bull but Milo grew in size and strength regardless of whether this story is true or even possible it demonstrates the most fundamental component of any training program Progressive overload Milo made sides and strength gains as the cough eventually a bull consistently served as a high level stimulus it became progressively heavier as Milo got stronger when Progressive overload is a missing component from a program that program will simply be minimally effective long term conceptualizing Progressive overload as a cycle works well a challenging training session evokes muscle and strength gains these gains enable you to apply Progressive overload and in turn this application of progressive overload sustains a challenging training session in the modern day I'm not sure many train with calfs or bulls rather freeway and or machine training seems far more common with these two of the most popular ways to Progressive overload are with all other training variables kept constant increasing load or the number of repetitions performed in this video we're going to be analyzing a brand new study comparing these two Progressive overload methods for muscle and strength [Music] thank you back in February this year some may know I released a video around a Brazilian study that had dropped at that time comparing Progressive overload via load or rep increases leg extension strength gains were not different between progressing through load or reps but muscle growth of the vastus Lateralus was greater for the load versus rep progression yet there were important limitations with this study it wasn't a randomized controlled trial rather it combined the results of two separate studies one study that progressed with load and another study that progressed with reps this actually resulted in the training frequency and duration differing between the load and rep progression groups confounding things due to this I previously said in the February video that better controlled research is needed to compare Progressive overload methods and I noted there was a researcher who had a study in the works this is the study that has now been released it's the first randomized controlled trial comparing load and rep increases for muscle and strength let's dive into it foreign trained individuals were randomly assigned to a load or rep group all subjects trained these four lower body exercises with these variables in the first session the load group attempted to increase the load they trained with across sessions while staying within the 8 to 12 rep range the rep group maintained the loads used in the first session and aimed to perform more repetitions across sessions on their exercise sets food Diaries although not always super reliable were measured by the researchers and fat carb protein and calorie intake were similar between the load and rep groups before and after the study strength was assessed via one rep max on the Smith machine Squat and muscle growth via thickness of the mid quad lateral quad middle gastrocnemius lateral gastrocnemius and Soleus increases in virtually all muscle growth measurements were similar between the load and rep groups although mid quad growth tended to slightly favor the rep group we'll discuss potential reasons shortly Smith machine squat strength gains were fairly similar between both groups with a low group seeing a small 2 kg greater increase versus the rep group so overall this study finds a load and red progressions are fairly comparable for increasing muscle and strength let's dissect these findings more while considering the broader literature [Music] we noted midcourt grows slightly favored of red progression versus load progression it's not clear why this is but the researchers speculated rep Rangers on the squat may have something to do with this the rep group trained with higher reps on the score in the later portion of the study and higher reps on the score May enhance rectus femorris recruitment a large part of the mid quads due to accumulated fatigue in the other vasty quad muscles lower reps on the squat as done by the load group may not involve this as two high Rex's s'mores activation with heavier loads made more meaningfully inhibit hip extension motions personally I'm not too sure of this speculation I think more research would be needed to verify how rectus Morse recruitment differs between higher and lower rep squats another explanation is the greater mid-court growth where the rep group was just due to chance especially given growth of the other muscles were similar between both groups somehow the rep group might just have had better rectus Morse Building abilities in any case this study still largely suggests muscle growth is similar between load and red progressions and this makes a lot of sense a wide range of studies suggests per set reps between 6 and 35 are similarly effective for muscle growth provided those reps are performed two or close to failure so long as you stay within this range from a session to session regardless of whether you do this by increasing load rep numbers or a combination of both it makes sense muscle growth outcomes should be the same as for the strength gains Smith machine squat games were fascinatingly very similar between both groups the load group saw a minimal 2 kg greater increase only given strength is based on lifting the heaviest loads you can I'm sure many would have expected the load group to have seen much more notably greater strength gains the lack of differences in strength may have something to do with the fact the test was conducted on a Smith machine squat neither group trained with a Smith machine squat rather a three-way Squat and so perhaps this strength test was too non-specific if one rep max free weight squat was tested maybe strength gains would have been more known to be superior for the load group another consideration is both groups trained with eight or more reps this matters as the literature suggests one red max strength games are superior when training with heavier loads that permit five or fewer Reps versus lower loads with more reps the reason for this is likely that training with heavier loads and fuel reps is more specific to a 100 Max thus it's likely that consistently training with heavier loads that permit five or few reps is a great idea if your goal is to Max 100 max strength and progressing load is needed to effectively do this across sessions progressing load or reps are probably similarly effective for muscle hypertrophy for strength though the new study indicates load and red progressions are similar it's limited as it used a non-specific strength test and subjects trained with rep numbers sub-optimal Force strength in all likelihood I think progressing load rather than reps is your safest bet for maxing one red max strength if you've made it here I have a free ebook you might like The Ultimate Guide to bench pressing for strength and high perch fee with more than 100 scientific references from technique to

    "title": "Lifting CAN Replace Cardio (True or False) ?",
    "published_at": "2023-02-06T11:59:57Z",
    "transcript": "welcome to the house of hypertrophy lifting is cardio somehow it takes about lifting and cardio exist on the internet for example it's reported Arthur Jones States lifting of weight is so much Superior for the purpose of improving the cardiovascular condition of a human being I don't think anybody's disputing the fact lifting can get your heart rate up but the question is can lifting be highly effective for developing cardiovascular fitness long term what cardiovascular fitness adaptations does lifting produce and is it a proper replacement for cardio in certain contexts let's examine the scientific literature high intensity interval training it is one form of cardiovascular training involving alternating between periods of intense exercise with less intense recovery periods it's performed by cycling or running commonly but it is possible to use standard weight training exercises a 2018 study examined the effectiveness of this for VO2 max games 16 well-trained power lifters and strong men were assigned into either a hit lifting or hit Cycling group both groups continued performing their resistance training as normal reporting to beat in a hypertrophy or general strength phase using these variables however the hit Cycling group added two weekly hit cycling sessions where they perform seven thirty second Sprints at an 8 to 9 rpe with 90 seconds of recovery between Sprints the hit lifting group added two weekly hit lifting sessions one session used the squads while the second session used deadlift each session the exercise was performed for seven sets of reps up to a 8 to 9 rpe using a sixty percent One Rate Max load and 90 seconds of rest between sets on average this group performed 8 to 15 reps per set in the duration of around 16 to 30 seconds after eight weeks leg extension strength gains were similar between both groups so neither hit protocol impaired strength adaptations worse both groups successfully increased their VO2 max yet the games were greater for the hit Cycling group so hit lifting certainly can enhance cardiovascular gains but the gains are likely inferior to hit cycling there are limitations to this study I've mentioned them in the comments for those interested but ultimately the limitations don't change the interpretation of the study so why was hit cycling Superior after all volume and intensity were equated between the hit cycling and lifting groups it could be because most lifting doesn't involve constant effort throughout it's easier to lower than to lift and there are pauses in between repetitions this can compromise the demand placed on a cardiovascular system versus something like cycling which involves a fairly constant exertion of effort finally for this section squats and deadlifts are relatively complex exercises the subjects of the study were well-trained power lifters and strongermen so it may not be an issue for them but for Less trained individuals who really want to perform hit lifting using less complex movements such as machine or dumbbell variations might be more sensible now some machines and dumbbell variations can be less cardiovascularly demanding due to lower muscle mass involvement but perhaps you compensate for this by just performing even higher rep numbers foreign studies suggests lifting isn't on par with more traditional cardio for cardiovascular fitness gains it's still evidence lifting canopositively influence cardiovascular fitness at the least indeed although not always consistently found in the literature resistance training can produce increases in capillary and mitochondria densities two Hallmark adaptations of traditional cardio capillaries are tiny blood vessels involved in delivering oxygen nutrients hormones and other things to cells mitochondria or organelles involved in generating energy for various biochemical and physiological processes of course increasing the density of these things enhances cardiovascular performance fascinatingly eccentric Hearts hypertrophy in bodybuilders is not uncommon and this is an adaptation prominently seen in endurance athletes that positively benefit the capacity of their hearts of course not all resistance training is equal training styles that prolong the duration of a set and involves shorter rest periods presumably enhanced cardiovascular adaptations for example a 2019 Canadian study established that training with 30 one rep max loads more effectively increased the content of several mitochondrial proteins versus training with an 80 one rep max load circuit training with typical resistance training exercises is likely going to be quite effective at producing cardiovascular fitness adaptations generally circuit training involves performing multiple different exercises with short rest periods between them and numerous rounds of these circuits can be performed in a session a 2017 meta-analysis from Spain combined the data from numerous studies and established circuit training produce notable VO2 max increases some may be wondering if circuit training compromises hypertrophy and strength gains minimal data has examined this unfortunately but one 2011 Spanish study suggests it may be fine 26 six trained men were assigned to either a circuit or traditional group the traditional group performed all the three to six sets on one exercise before moving to the next using three minutes of rest between sets and exercises the circuit group performed two different circuits for each circuit subjects performed a set on each exercise with 35 seconds of rest between exercises to complete one round this circuit was repeated for three to six rounds subjects rested five minutes before going on to their second circuit where they did the same thing after training Thrice a week for 8 weeks bench press and half squat strength games were similar between both groups lean mass body gains were also similar between both groups the caveat is this is only one study and lean body mass isn't the most precise measure of muscle hypertrophy so can lifting replace cardio not truly no we've seen lifting certainly can develop cardiovascular adaptations but it won't be near the magnitude of standard cardio it's also probably the case that those who do increase their VO2 max the most from lifting are the ones with poor VO2 Maxes to begin with this is demonstrated by a 2013 Japanese analysis which found those who increased their VO2 max the most from lifting were simply the ones with the lowest VO2 max to begin with also long duration continuous cardio training with typical modes likely produces adaptations to a degree simply not attainable with lifting and even high intensity interval training specifically continuous cardio training is likely Superior for enhancing mitochondria efficiency and respiration and truly producing substantial capillary density increases I encourage individuals to not be afraid of adding dedicated cardio on top of their lifting it can provide great health benefits for example a 2019 review and meta-analysis indicates resistance training alone was associated with a 21 decrease in risk of all cause mortality while cardio plus resistance training was associated with a 40 decrease in risk of all cause mortality as thoroughly explored in a previous video the idea cardio kills muscle and strength gains is largely overblown provided you're not super highly trained and or performing very high resistance training volumes updated analyzes fail to find adding cardio impairs muscle and strength gains moreover as thoroughly examined in another one of the videos at the house of hypertrophy various lines of scientific research indicate cardio can help you build more muscle in certain cases speaking of building more muscle consistent training is vital and tracking your progression and performance over time can help spot Trends and enhance the understanding of your own response to various training Alpha progression can greatly help this process at the house of hypertrophy rest assured I'm never going to promote trash Alpha progression is a unique and elegant app rated 4.9 stars

lifting weight has been documented to cause a variety of positive cardiovascular adaptations and variables that prolong the duration of sets and use short rest probably enhance these adaptations though lifting weights won't deliver these cardiovascular gains to the degree of standard cardio training plus there are unique benefits to long duration continuous cardio furthermore those who see the largest VO2 max games from lifting are likely that individuals with the poorest VO2 max levels to begin with now it's worth remembering if you're performing cardio the local endurance games such as mitochondria and capillary adaptations are largely specific to the muscle strained therefore using resistance training as a tool to enhance local cardiovascular adaptations in muscles not trained with your cardio it's certainly not a bad idea whatsoever finally I have a free Ultimate Guide to bench pressing ebook that covers these areas feel free to get it in the link in the comments and

    "transcript": "when consuming Fitness content online including mine much of the discussion is on training variables and nutrition how many sets or reps what training split and so on and so forth of course this is for good reason training and nutrition are absolutely important for strength and muscle development yet there's one factor I wanted to discuss away from training and nutrition that might play a crucial role in your adaptations this is your mind where your thoughts assumptions and beliefs reside rest assured I'm not going to throw a bunch of motivational quotes to you but what we'll do is evaluate some underappreciated research demonstrating how powerful mindsets may be for influencing your physiology and this includes your adaptations in response to training the idea that the mind can impact your body isn't new and chances are you have your own experiences with this for example when you're feeling anxious or nervous about something your heart rate increases and or you may feel butterflies in your stomach however our mind States might also have effects in areas we do not readily expect a fascinating study by Crum and Corbin demonstrates how your mindset about what you nutritionally consume May influence its physiological impact 46 individuals were recruited on two different days the participants drank a milkshake on one day they drank an indulgent milkshake that was labeled as high in fat and calories on the other day they drank a sensible milkshake that was labeled as low in fat and calories now before drinking the milkshake in both situations the subjects read the nutritional label and as you'd expect they rated the sensible milkshake as healthier after consuming the milkshake the response of grin was measured gin is a hormone that is elevated when energy intake is low to Signal the brain to reduce the sensation of hunger and thus motivate you to consume food after you've consumed sufficient food gin is suppressed so you feel satisfied and no longer hungry it was found grin sharply decreased after consuming the indulgent high fat high calorie milkshake but it minimally changed after consuming the sensible lowfat low calorie milkshake this is what you'd expect a high fat high calorie milkshake should suppress grillin way more than a lowfat low calorie milkshake but guess what the milkshakes assumed on both days were exactly the same the subjects were misled into thinking the two milkshakes were different through the fake labels displayed to them these findings are highly interesting they indicate despite the milkshake being exactly the same consuming with the mindset it's high fat high calorie suppresses the post grillin response whereas consuming it with a mindset it's lowfat low calories minimally impacts grin response some of you may be thinking sure these findings are super interesting in but how do they apply to developing muscle and strength let's find out what if we could trick someone into thinking they're taking anabolic steroids when in reality they're not would the mere belief they're taking anabolic steroids be enough to significantly increase their rate of adaptations or does the fact they're not actually taking anabolic steroids mean the rate of adaptations Remains the Same these are interesting questions and if we travel back in 1973 two researchers by the names of Ariel and savil aim to answer them 15 main Varsity athletes with at least 2 years of weight training experience first trained for 7 weeks during this period those that made the largest gains in one R max strength on the bench press seated press standing press and squat would be rewarded with free access to steroids to use during a subsequent 4-we training period as the research is Promised six subjects of the initial 15 were selected to train for a further 4 weeks while given a 10 mg pill of Dianabol an anabolic steroid to take daily however the subjects were unaware the pill they took was a placebo pill it was not actually diable the results were truly surprising after the initial seven training weeks where the six subjects were not taking any Placebo pill their one R Maxes increased by an average of 4.35 kg for the bench press 0.73 kg for the standing press 2.27 kg for the seated press and 2.65 kg for the squat but after the 4 weeks in which the subjects took the daily Placebo pills their one R Maxes increased by an average of 1328 Kg on the bench press 7.58 Kg on the standing press 5.3 Kg on the seated press and 18.94% between two to 10 times more strength gains in just over half the time simply by being misled into thinking they want anabolic steroids even though they were merely consuming Placebo pills another study by magaris and colleagues conducted in 2000 provides us with no less of a surprising insight into the power of the placebo the lead author of the study was a powerlifting coach previously his athletes precisely 11 nationally ranked powerlifting had asked the coach about the effectiveness of anabolic steroids which inspired the coach to conduct this study first the researchers assessed the subjects Baseline Warner Maxes on the bench press Squat and deadlift note their average War Maxes were 189 kg for the bench press 257 kg for the squat and 260 kg for the deadlift so they were pretty damn strong in the first experimental session 5 minutes before testing one Max's on the bench breast squore and deadlift the subjects were given two tablets and told they were immediate acting anabolic steroids however the pills were simply Placebo after taking these two pills all subjects hit personal records the subjects War Maxes were an average 9.5 kg higher on the bench press 12.2 kg higher on the squat and 10.9 kg higher on the deadlift versus Baseline fascinatingly the authors noted these performance increases represented a change from being nationally ranked to being internationally ranked for all subjects put another way simply thinking they took immediate acting anabolic steroids instantly elevated the subject strength abilities to seriously impressive levels after this first experimental session all subjects were provided with two more Placebo pills to use during their upcoming training week during this week all subjects reported increased Vigor and that they were lifting heavier loads or performing more repetitions than ever before in the second experimental session after the week of training One Max on the bench press score and deadlift was measured yet again however before the one R Max test some subjects were actually told the pills they took were merely a placebo these subjects compared to the first experimental session lifted 7.5 kg Less on the bench press 11 kg Less on the squat and 12.5 kg Less on the deadlift in other words despite them performing better than ever before in the first experimental session and the training week the simple Revelation they had only been consuming a placebo all along plummeted their strength back down to their Baseline the other subjects who remained unaware the pills they were taking were placebos did not really make any further gains on average but roughly maintain the impressive gains they experienced compared to BAS [Music] values the findings of the two papers overviewed are truly fascinating and demonstrate how your mindset or the belief you're taking anabolics can powerfully influence strength it's unfortunate neither study looked at muscle growth but given we've seen mindsets interact with physiology it's very possible muscle growth is similarly impacted it would be awesome if future research can examine this now how can you use these findings of the research we've overviewed to help yourself needless to say it's going to be pretty much impossible to truly trick and convince yourself you're taking anabolic steroids I'm not sure you're going to be able to truly convince yourself your daily vitamin D tablet is actually an anabolic steroid however now that you're aware of this research the most practical takeaway is probably that you just want to be mindful of your thoughts assumptions and expectations if you're someone who constantly says you have bad strength or mus muscle building capacities it's probably best for you to try to change this and try to adopt a more optimistic mindset for example You may wish to try and establish the mindset you have better abilities than you once thought after all remember that in the aerial svil and magnar studies the impressive strength increases didn't come from anabolic steroids they were only taking Placebo pills thus the impressive strength gains came from the individuals themselves they had that ability within themselves of course mind States apply to anything not just lifting weights just maybe we're capable of a lot more than we believe peace"

    "title": "What Is the Best Rep Range to Build Muscle? (Research-Backed)",
    "published_at": "2020-05-04T12:00:57Z",
    "transcript": "when it comes to building muscle reps between six and twelve are commonly used with the belief this best promotes muscle growth this idea does somewhat stem from a pre-existing rep range continue also stating one to five reps of superior strength or thirteen past reps are severe for endurance this continuum does have some truth to it the evidence to support the idea strength is best trained with lower reps given strength is based on lifting heavy loads training with lower ups makes sense likewise the evidence does also support the idea endurance is best trained with higher reps given endurance is based on sustaining multiple contractions this again makes sense however when it comes to the muscle growth rep range this continuum is slightly misleading this is simply because the current evidence does not support the idea of muscle growth is best achieved exclusively in the 6 to 12 rep range the best evidence relating to rep ranges and muscle growth comes from a 2017 meta-analysis by shown from aquatics for those unaware meta-analysis of studies that combine the results of multiple scientific studies that address the same topic returning to the meta-analysis by showing fear and colleagues they found that both low load and high load training resulted in similar increases in muscle growth provided reps were taken to muscular failure if we were to take a look at the individual studies involved in the meta-analysis we would see that the loads used range from 30% 1rm to 85% warrant this would equate two reps between 35 and 5 so why is the actual muscle growth rep range so wide to understand this we first must explore the concept of motor units motor units consist of a motor neuron and the muscle fibers they innervate multi-units can generally be classified into three kinds slow multi-units fast fatigue resistant motor units and fast fatigue herbal motor units slow most units are small motor neurons that innervate slow twitch muscle fibers these contracts slowly and produce low forces but are highly fatigue resistant fast fatigue resistant motor units are slightly larger motor neurons that innervate fast twitch oxidative fibers these contract faster and produced greater forces fast fatigue herbal motor units are larger motor neurons that innervate fast twitch glycolytic fibers these have the fastest contraction and greatest force producing abilities but they do fatigue quickly motor units are recruited in a progressive sequence when force requirements are low slow motor units are recruited however with increase in force requirements those faster motor units are recruited to aid those slow motor units high levels of multi unit recruitment is an important component of maximizing muscle growth simply because this is one of the main aspects of mechanical tension at this moment in the research mechanical tension is the best categorized rival of muscle growth physiologically mechanical tension is primarily equal to the amount of force generated by a muscle again this is more or less equal to multi recruitment it's believed various mechana senses lightly located within a neuron muscle fibers detect mechanical tension and subsequently initiate a signaling cascade that ultimately results in muscle growth based on the principles presented you may be tempted to take heavy loads and therefore lower reps are required to achieve high levels of multi-unit recruitment it is true heavy weights readily recruit faster most units as force requirements are initially high as a reps approach failure further recruitment also likely occurs with the light loads and therefore higher ups as force requirements are initially low slow machinists are primarily recruited however as reps get closer and closer to failure those faster motor units are recruited to help sustain water production what this means is that both light loads and high loads are capable of achieving high levels of most unit recruitment this is the primary reason as to why the actual muscle rep range is so wide before we end some of you may be wondering about the research related to perhaps below 5 and reps above 35 there is evidence that reps as low as 3 can build muscle optimally however three of the studies that did find this used a greater amount of sets with the low rep range groups so all in all it isn't entirely clear I should mention that it has been reported that training with heavy loads and multiple sets is more stressful on the joints and connective tissue potentially meaning that in the long run it's likely smarter to train with reps above 5 if the goal is to solely maximize muscle growth as full reps above 35 the only research that gives us a fair comparison comes from a list of idiots and colleagues they compared the use of 20% 1rm 40 % 1 RM 60 % 1 RM and 80% water up on the bicep curl a leg press what they found was that as expected the loads between 40 and 80 % RM led to similar increases and hypertrophy of the elbow flexors and vastus lateralis however using 20% at 1 RM led to significantly less hypertrophy of these muscles roughly half that up loads between 40 and 80 % worn around using 20% or 1 RM usually means you're performing more than 60 reps per set to achieve failure it's likely that using 20% of one room is just too light to maximize mechanical tension the threshold could be lower than 60 reps therefore just to be sure it's probably best to not exceed 35 reps additionally outside of the lab I'm not too sure many would willingly perform more than 35 reps for any exercise [Music]"

    "title": "The BEST Triceps Hypertrophy Exercise",
    "published_at": "2022-07-25T11:00:06Z",
    "transcript": "[Music] a brand new study out of japan by mayo and colleagues has recently come out comparing overhead extensions to push downs and its findings have important implications for maxing triceps hypertrophy let's dive into this great new paper [Music] 21 untrained adults comprising 14 men and 7 women had one arm assigned to an overhead condition and their other arm assigned to a push down condition both arms were trained across two sessions per week for 12 straight weeks the overhead condition arm-trained overhead cable extensions while the push-down condition arm-trained cable push downs both exercises were performed from zero to 90 degrees of elbow flexion and with a supinated grip every session the subjects alternated which condition was trained first and both of the exercises were trained for five sets of ten repetitions with two minutes of rest between sets training loads were gradually increased at the first second and third sessions from 50 to 60 to 70 percent of warner at max with a 70 percent warner max load used thereafter when a subject could not complete 10 reps on a set a researcher spotted and assisted them to ensure the attainment of 10 reps per set once a subject could complete 5 sets of ten reps on one of their exercises completely unassisted training loads were increased by five percent next session before and after the study the researchers measured the volume of the whole triceps as well as the volume of the long triceps head as the researchers had trouble differentiating between the lower part of the lateral and medial head they opted to measure combined lateral and medial head volume it was found that whole triceps volume increases were 1.4 volts greater for the overhead versus push down condition long head triceps volume increases to a 1.5 fold greater for the overhead versus push down condition and combined medial and lateral head volume increases were 1.4 volts greater for the overhead versus push down condition thus overhead extensions grew the triceps notably more than push downs this isn't the only paper comparing overhead extensions to push downs one other paper out of greece similarly found overhead extensions tended to grow the long head at 50 and 60 of the upper arm region more than push downs no other triceps regions were assessed unfortunately now this finding ended up not being classed as statistically significant and is likely related to the sample size of nine individuals plus the study only lasted six weeks yet it's important to understand statistical insignificance doesn't necessarily mean no difference [Music] as we know the triceps consist of the long medial and lateral head the medial and lateral heads only pass over their elbow joint and thus are called single joint muscles the long head passes over both the elbow and shoulder joints and thus is called a two joint muscle due to this structural point the long head is stretched when placed overhead and this likely explains one of the findings of the mayo study that long head hypertrophy is significantly enhanced with overhead extensions versus push downs there's a growing body of research demonstrating achieving a stretch during an exercise is powerful for evoking muscle hypertrophy a previous study by the same researchers mayo and colleagues evaluated the hamstrings except for the biceps for more a short head which is a one joint muscle that only crosses over the knee all the other heads of the hamstrings are too jointed as they cross the knee and hip joints due to this structural point seated curls are going to stretch all of the two joint hamstring muscles more than lying leg curls and guess what the researchers found hypertrophy of all the two joint hamstring muscles were much greater with seated versus lying leg curl training while biceps for more short head hypertrophy were similar between both exercises research examining isometric training finds that training at a stretched muscle length produces notably more hypertrophy than training at shortened muscle lengths the range of motion literature tells us the same story partial range of motions that train the muscle in a shortened position produce less hypertrophy versus fuller ranges of motions that achieve a stretch of a muscle matter of fact a 2021 study out of brazil by pedrosa and colleagues actually found that partial range of motion leg extensions training the quads in a stretched position produced overall more hypertrophy versus a full range of motion though more research is needed to examine comparisons between stretched partial range of motion training and full range of motion training nevertheless it's crystal clear that science demonstrates that stretch is powerful for muscle hypertrophy returning back to the mayo triceps findings it unexpectedly also found overhead extensions evoked greater collective medial and lateral head growth versus push downs we know the medial and lateral heads are single joint and so are not stretched any more during overhead extensions than push downs so what explains this finding two speculations were provided in the paper firstly the researchers simulated models and found that during overhead extensions the long head operates on the descending limb of the force length curve for those who have no clue what this means it's simply saying the long head may not be able to produce much active contractile force during overhead extensions perhaps resulting in the nervous system evoking stronger force contributions from the lateral and medial head thus maybe this explains why the lateral and medial head also grew more with overhead extensions the second speculation was that overhead extensions due to the overhead arm positioning would restrict blood flow to the muscle more than push downs this would likely result in overhead extensions producing greater metabolic stress the build-up of metabolites something that's proposed to potentially drive hypertrophy however a limitation with this speculation is there are many cases where more metabolic stress isn't associated with more hypertrophy thus the role of metabolic stress in hypertrophy is questionable and not super clear currently based on the data we've overviewed it's likely some kind of overhead extension in your training is needed to max triceps hypertrophy for those who care more about efficiency you do not wish to do much exercise variation and or training volume and you're not overly concerned about meticulously maxing triceps gains overhead extensions alone can probably do this job yet for those wanting to do the utmost to develop the triceps i'm skeptical overhead extensions alone would be sufficient you see the male study examined volume of the overall triceps the long head and the combined lateral and medial heads volume is a great muscle growth measurement as it's three-dimensional and incorporates all regions however volume does not consider regional hypertrophy differences regional hypertrophy is the phenomenon where muscles do not grow evenly across its regions and numerous studies validate its existence different triceps exercises could preferentially develop different regions of the triceps meaning a combination of a few triceps exercises are needed to max overall regional gains in fact we have research alluding to this a study out of japan by kawakami and colleagues found after training dumbbell overhead extensions for 16 weeks the overall triceps mainly developed in the slightly upper regions a different study out of japan by wakahara and colleagues found after training dumbbell skull crushers for 12 weeks the overall triceps mainly developed in the middle regions thus the combination of overhead extensions with skull crushers is a good idea to regionally develop the triceps furthermore it's possible push downs themselves target slightly different triceps regions compared to overhead extensions and skull crushers so the inclusion of push sounds too might be beneficial but more research is needed to validate this [Music] stretch is powerful for muscle hypertrophy and the greatest stretch of the long head with overhead extensions versus push downs is a strong candidate to explain the greater long-head hypertrophy attained with overhead extensions fascinatingly the medial and lateral heads also collectively grew more with overhead extensions for mechanisms that are currently unknown ultimately overhead extensions are likely a must for maxing triceps development for those who purely care about efficiency simply training only overhead extensions will certainly deliver great gains for those more meticulous you probably want to add at least some kind of skull crusher with overhead extensions as evidence indicates these exercises may target slightly different regions it's possible push downs also target different regions but we don't have any concrete data demonstrating this so it's your call if you want to add pushdowns into [Music]"

    "transcript": "foreign to the house of hypertrophy 2022 is nearly over and I thought it would be a nice idea to overview some great muscle and strength papers published this year let's waste no time and dive in the last few years the research has provided great insight into how training muscles at stretched positions is great for hypertrophy 2022 is no different with further papers comparing range of motions different exercises and exploring stretching in between sets let's overview them a Brazilian study published very recently demonstrates how a partial range of motion Ash strikes the links could be superior for muscle hypertrophy these researchers had untrained women train their cars with this exercise for three sets of 15 to 20 reps to failure three times per week for eight weeks one group trained with a full range of motion another group with a partial range of motion with the calves at a stretched position and a third group with a partial range of motion with the calves at a shortened position medial and lateral gastrocnemius growth tended to be superior for the partial range of motion as stretched positions versus the two other conditions there was a previous study last year that comparably found with leg extensions using a partial range of motion that stretched positions was overall Superior for Quad hypertrophy to a full range of motion or a partial range of motion that shortened positions so partials at stretched positions may be superior for hypertrophy however it's worth considering these two studies were done on untrained women and that two studies itself isn't an abundance of evidence so I'm looking forward to further future research on stretched partials but I do think a person could experiment with stretched partials if they wish and see if they notice any enhanced gains another Japanese paper this year compared triceps hypertrophy between overhead extensions and pushdowns due to the long triceps head Anatomy this muscle would be stretched with overhead extensions and the researchers found the long hair triceps growth was greater with overhead extensions fascinatingly the overhead extensions also grew the combined medial and lateral heads more in theory these muscles wouldn't be stretched anymore with overhead extensions versus push Downs so it's not mechanistically clear why this occurred in any event this Japanese study was overall really awesome moving forward thus stretching in between sets help builds more muscle a recent review study out of the USA examined the literature they initially detail an array of potential Ways by which stretch could signal muscle growth we've actually detailed how stretch forces signals hypertrophy in a previous in-depth video however they also know how static stretching in humans doesn't seem to be great for hypertrophy although extreme static stretching could be for example this 2022 German study found that performing this calf stretch for one hour daily produced significant gastrocnemius growth when stretching between sets as the researchers notes ideally you'd want to get into the stretch immediately after the lowering phase of an exercise and loaded stretching could be ideally used here this is because during the lowering phase elements in your muscles that produce stretching forces are in a stiffer State something that could be beneficial for signaling muscle growth more so getting into the stretch straight after the lowering phase would theoretically leverage these stiffer stretching forces to Signal more hypertrophy indeed a study by Silva and colleagues found getting straight into a calf stretch for 30 seconds between calf press sets produce significantly greater gastrocnemius growth however this paper wasn't actually ever published it was only presented at some conference but another very recent study also found that getting straight into a calf stretch for 20 seconds between calf presses produce greater Soleus growth but it did not produce greater gastrocnemius growth with studies that do not have subjects get into a stretch straight after the lowering phase of an exercise they largely failed to find stretching between sets to be better but it does not seem to compromise growth either a USA study found in between bench press sets moving over to cable-fly machines to stretch the chest produce similar gains to just resting passively between sets a Japanese paper found that in between flywheel squats moving over to a table to stretch the quadriceps produce similar gains to just resting passively having said this another USA study did actually find that in between sets of a range of exercises moving to a 30 second stretch did enhance hypertrophy in previously untrained individuals as the researchers of this year's review describe in summary emerging evidence suggests that intercept stretch May enhance muscular adaptations its Effectiveness appears to be predicated on performing the stretch immediately after the final repetition of a set which conceivably takes advantage of the residual effects of previous eccentric actions I want to add my own limitations here they're still far from a ton of research on stretching between sets moreover the paper that found calf stretching enhanced Soleus growth only indicates slightly more Soleus growth not a ton in any case you could experiment with stretching between sets if you wish I'm looking forward to more data in this area foreign as you progress across your training career the amount of hypertrophy and strength you experience drops off however emerging data indicates training breaks could reset your responsiveness to training there's a protein called p70sxk involved in a signaling pathway that promotes muscle hypertrophy a great study from Germany this year found seven consecutive training sessions were enough to significantly reduce the activation of p70 s6k after training in other words it was less responsive however a 10-day training break was able to restore p70sxk's responsiveness to training in other words training bricks might reset the responsibility of your anabolic Pathways and perhaps this results in more muscle hypertrophy long term the research on training bricks is very much in its infancy and I have a video detailing some other research on training brakes at the very least I'd use this data to show individuals absolutely should not be worried whatsoever about training brakes the debate about how much muscle growth contributes to strength is always ongoing and a recent study examined correlations between bench press one right max strength and the range of measurements various measures of muscle hypertrophy did strongly correlate with bench press 1 right max strength the subjects of this study bench pressed in average 91 kilograms but even in more Elite power lifters lean mass strongly correlates with bench press squats and deadlift strength in fact a study last year found muscle hypertrophy measurements were the best predictors of bench press strength in power lifters more so than elbow or shoulder flexion strength and Technical factors now these studies are all correlations but I'd argue these findings make sense one main way hypertrophy occurs is by increasing the number of force generating units it has in parallel this directly increases the force that muscle can produce and presumably benefit strength if you've made it here I have a free ebook you might like The Ultimate Guide to bench pressing for strength and hypertrophy with more than 100 scientific references from technique to training variables to comparisons and other fascinating science we cover it all grab it through the link in the description or comments [Music]"

    "transcript": "welcome to the house of hypertrophy in the muscle and strength building worlds a good number of misconceptions exist I would argue there are some important misunderstandings with CNS fatigue that is central nervous system fatigue it is a term thrown about quite a bit for example you may hear someone say my CNS is fried but are the common beliefs surrounding CNS fatigue supported by the scientific literature is CNS fatigue always present in the days after training do heavier loads always produce more seen as fatigue than lighter loads is the deadlift more taxing on the CNS does training to failure always produce more CNS fatigue is hand grip strength truly a valid measure of CNS fatigue and do you always experience the same level of CNS fatigue after workouts let's Dive In foreign subjectively tied is what some feel CNS fatigue is strictly speaking this isn't a pinpoint accurate description of CNS fatigue CNS fatigue refers to a specific event and it is also quantifiable remember muscles generate Force thanks to the electrical signals they receive from their CNS that's the brain and spinal cord CNS fatigue specifically refers to reduced electrical drive from the CNS to the muscle which reduces the number of muscle fibers that are activated and all the firing rates of a group of muscle fibers in other words the muscle cannot produce as much force researchers can quantify CNS fatigue in different ways most commonly by looking at voluntary activation voluntary activation refers to how much of a muscle's force producing potential a person's nervous system can access after exercise if voluntary activation is reduced this means the nervous system has lost some ability to access the muscle's force producing potential and is believed to indicate CNS fatigue is present more details about voluntary activation can be found in the description nonetheless there is another way researchers May infer CNS fatigue CNS fatigue can reduce the force of muscles we haven't directly trained say you only trained your right bicep after if your left bicep has also lost some strength this may indirectly infer CNS fatigue is present before moving on to the next section it's just worth knowing CNS fatigue isn't the only thing that reduces muscle performance peripheral fatigue does too peripheral fatigue refers to changes inside of the muscle that lowers its Force [Music] some Studies have failed to observe CNS fatigue days after lifting such as these two studies which were done on trained individuals involving a range of compound exercise performed mainly for four sets each with heavier loads in the four to six rep range CNS fatigue wasn't present 24 or 48 hours after but we do have quite a few other studies finding CNS fatigue days after lifting such as these two studies involving training the back score with 10 sets in the 5 to 10 rep range they also involved trained individuals although one of the papers involved a subset of untrained folks too CNS fatigue was present for up to 48 to 72 hours after other studies involving higher volume maximal eccentric training which is where you maximally load the lowering portion of an exercise through specialized equipment produce CNS fatigue that persists for a few days after since training volume that is set numbers appear to be the thing that differed the most between the data finding CNS fatigue and not this data would suggest more volume is associated with greater CNS fatigue something I'm sure is unsurprising to many [Music] we've previously seen at the house of hypertrophy that reps between 6 and 35 can be similarly effective for building muscle provided reps are performed two or very close to failure but it's commonly thought heavier loads generate greater CNS fatigue but the research actually fails to support this this study found when training dumbbell curls there was no significant difference in the CNS fatigue produced immediately after training with either 5 10 or 20 repetitions two or very close to failure two other papers find with a leg extension with reps two are very close to failure CNS fatigue measured immediately afterward tended to be greater with a 40 load compared to an 80 load in fact it seems that the longer the contraction duration the more CNS fatigue immediately produced this study found more CNS fatigue immediately after holding a 20 strength contraction for 13 minutes compared to holding an 80 strength contraction for 30 seconds another study found with a hand and muscle holding a 30 strength contraction that lasted for around 400 seconds produced more CNS fatigue immediately after compared to holding 45 60 and 75 strength contractions that lasted for these durations longer duration aerobic training has also been documented to generate more CNS fatigue immediately after Savvy viewers may be thinking I've only presented the CNS fatigue measured immediately after the contraction but what about in the days after training when looking at fatigue overall so we're not looking at CNS fatigue just yet it seems lighter lows and thus higher reps are more fatiguing the results of this study find slightly worse recovery of muscle performance as you progress from around 4 to 12 reps moreover there was incrementally more damage as you progress to the higher reps another study finds when training a leg extension with reps to failure recovery in the days after was slower when training with a light 30 load compared to a heavier 80 load it does appear CNS fatigue contributes to the greater fatigue from lighter loads this study had subjects trained one of their legs with either a lighter 40 or heavier 80 load on the leg extension separated by a week reps were taken to failure and as expected recovery was slower after training with a 40 load importantly a decrease in strength of the opposite leg was seen immediately and after 24 hours after training with a 40 load suggesting CNS fatigue since we know CNS fatigue can reduce the force of muscles not directly trained when training with the 80 load there was no decrease in the opposite leg strength so lighter loads and thus higher reps produce more fatigue but does this really matter it depends on which angle you look at this if you're trying to minimize neuromuscular fatigue and maximize stimulus reps on the Lower Side better achieve this but the thing is your body can handle and adapt to fatigue if the fatigue from reps up to 35 was counterproductive for building muscle we'd expect it to compromise muscle growth but the fact research finds reps up to 35 produced Sim hypertrophy tells us the fatigue generated from lighter loads isn't enough to kill gains this even holds true in the number of sets you perform is in the moderate to high range for example this study from New York had trained subjects trained these exercises for three sets each three times per week for eight weeks this resulted in them performing around 18 weekly sets for the quads directly and 18 weekly sets for the biceps and triceps indirectly one group trained to each set to failure in the 8 to 12 rep range while another group trained each set to failure in the 25 to 35 rep range ultimately growth of the elper flexors triceps and quads were similar between both groups as we'll see later your body has the capacity to speed up recovery [Music] deadlifts are said to be one of the most fatiguing exercises does the research support this these researchers had 10 trained men train the deadlift and squat on different occasions for eight sets of two reps with a 95 One Rate Max load measures of CNS fatigue were similar between both exercises 5 and 30 minutes after training there are two important considerations CNS fatigue was Quantified by looking at voluntary activation of the quads this isn't an inherent problem since we know CNS fatigue can have a systemic effect but I think it would have been more ideal for the researchers to look at an overlapping muscle between the two movements such as the glute Max secondly CNS fatigue was just measured 5 and 30 minutes after the session what about in the days after fortunately another paper helps us out 12 trained men perform the deadlift bexquat and bench press on different occasions with each movement they performed four sets of reps to failure with an 80 one rep max load none of the measurements taken indicated the deadlift was more fatiguing than the other exercises measures of muscle swelling stiffness soreness performance and damage was quite comparable between all three exercises in the days after training now this study didn't strictly measure CNS fatigue but many people's assumption is the deadlift is overall more fatiguing and this study fails to support that having said this another study had 10 recreationally trained men perform these exercises including the deadlift for two sets each subjects repeated this exact workout 24 and 48 hours after to quantify their performance recovery the deadlift was largely the exercise that had the lowest recovery indicating this movement may be more fatiguing but it was far from being substantially or fatiguing so what do we make of all this data well two out of three fail to support the notion that deadlift is more fatiguing in my eyes the second study is probably one of the better designed ones since it involved quite well-trained lifters and examined a range of fatigue measurements not just one This research is certainly surprising because it's so commonly believed that deadlift is more fatiguing I think there could be a range of plausible reasons as to why the deadlift is perceived as being more fatiguing feel free to pause and read them if you like but here's the thing I don't believe we should fully discount the anecdotes just yet although the overall evidence currently fails to support the idea dead deadlifts are more fatiguing two studies aren't super strong proof so I think some further research should help clarify things for now I just thought it'd be interesting to share this current research and the possibility of the deadlift might not truly be more fatiguing [Music] training to failure undeniably produces overall more fatigue compared to not training to failure multiple studies established this for example a recent study found when trained individuals perform the bench press for six sets recovery was slower after training to failure compared to stopping around one or three reps away from failure it may be automatic to assume this means CNS fatigue is greater with failure training and indeed this was my default assumption fascinatingly there seems to be only one study looking at CNS fatigue from training to failure these researchers had trained men with at least one year of experience performed six sets on the back squat using a 10 repetition maximum load on one occasion all sets were performed to failure while on another occasion they only performed five reps per set muscle damage was higher after the failure training session but CNS fatigue both within the training session and then the days after was surprisingly similar between both the failure and non-failure training sessions thus this data suggests the greater fatigue from training to failure may not be due to more CNS fatigue but rather due to peripheral fatigue and Associated muscle damage granted this is only one study so consider it preliminary we shall see if future studies replicate it nonetheless I would like to discuss the idea of failure training being more overall fatiguing does it matter the overall literature clearly shows getting close to failure is needed to optimize the stimulus of a set generally stopping around zero to three reps away from failure seems to produce similar muscle growth to training to failure I know a recent meta-aggression made the rounds on social media with some influences saying their regression proves training to failure is superior for building muscle but we've previously seen this regression had limitations meaning it doesn't prove training to failure is superior indirect equations and estimates were used to infer how far from failure the non-failure training groups were and these were likely not super accurate high quality individual studies find similar hypertrophy between training into failure and stopping around three to zero reps from failure and arguably a more controlled meta-analysis found this relationship between proximity to failure and muscle growth considering all this information if the goal is to minimize fatigue while maximizing the stimulus not training to failure beta achieves this but similar to the discussion with lower versus higher reps the fatigue from training to failure isn't intrinsically a concern since we know training to failure largely does not provide worse muscle growth compared to stopping 0-3 reps from failure but there still are some considerations if you're performing additional cardiovascular training and or Sprint training preliminary data indicates muscle and strength adaptations may be better when not training to failure moreover although it's not consistently established in the literature older individuals may have a harder time recovering so non-failure training may be generally preferable finally if your outside lifestyle isn't conducive to optimize recovery perhaps you're under a lot of stress sleeping poorly or cutting non-failure training may be the best option in these conditions are there any practical methods you can use to detect if Cena's fatigue is present some say measuring your hand grip strength can do this but at least two studies find hand grip strength fails to correlate with CNS fatigue perhaps because the muscles of the hands are too small to be sensitive to CNS fatigue measuring your performance on explosive movements such as a vertical jump might be better why remember CNS fatigue involves reduced muscle fiber Recruitment and this will largely be a reduction in fast twitch muscle fiber recruitment since explosive movements are mainly powered by those fast twitch fibers a reduction in performance on these could reflect the presence of CNS fatigue as far as I know no Studies have properly assessed this the closest thing I could find is this study finding after a workout the reduction in vertical jump height did correlate with a reduction in back squat performance but not with other exercises the correlations were based on data between different people so future research is required to more precisely answer the question of whether for a given person if a greater vertical jump height reduction strongly correlates with CNS fatigue and the performance loss on various exercises what about your own feelings about how fatigued you are to my knowledge there's no data looking at the association between subjective fatigue and CNS fatigue but with overall fatigue it might actually be a decent indicator one study finds after lifting weights a strong correlation between how subjectively fatigued they felt and their squat performance another one finds objective fatigue has some correlation to the extent of muscle damage yet there are some other papers finding poorer associations between subjective fatigue and lifting performance so summarizing this section hand grip strength isn't strongly informative of CNS fatigue explosive movements could better infer CNS fatigue and subjective perception may not be a terrible indicator of overall neuromuscular fatigue but an interesting question is do you even need to worry about measuring fatigue all laboriously considering it foreign there's nothing wrong with tracking and being analytical about fatigue if you desire but I don't believe it's essential many people have made tremendous gains without meticulously tracking fatigue at the end of the day you'll know if you're consistently running into recovery programs through performance stagnation regression and perhaps unforeseen subjective feelings adjustments can then be made off of this also as hinted throughout recovery tends to Quicken as you accustom yourself to a training program thanks to a range of adaptations your body produces called the repeated bowel effect and the house of hypertrophy we've previously seen this fascinating study out of Greece that had untrained subjects train their quads with maximal eccentric early contractions on a specialized piece of equipment for 5 sets of 15 repetitions once a week for 10 weeks maximal eccentric contractions evoke substantial fatigue and damage the data demonstrates this after the training in week 1 substantial damage soreness stiffness and strength loss occurred for at least five days after the session however as the weeks progressed the magnitude of damage soon as stiffness and strength loss after training progressively reduced by the 10th a week virtually full strength recovery occurred within a day or two thus fatigue likely including CNS fatigue can be reduced having said all this some people have suggested that trained individuals do not see lower CNS fatigue based on this study which is one of the papers mentioned near the start of the video These researchers had young trained men middle-aged trained men and middle-aged untrained men perform 10 sets of 10 reps on the barbell back squat with a 60 one rep max load for all subjects CNS fatigue was present in the days after if we focus on a middle-aged subjects we can see the magnitude of CNS fatigue was fairly similar between both the trained and untrained subjects therefore some have used this as evidence that trained individuals do not experience faster CNS recovery however a key consideration of this study is somehow the untrained middle-aged men were pretty strong their backswatch strength wasn't far of the trained middle-aged men and their fat-free mess was actually greater moreover remember all subjects performed 10 sets of 10 on the back squats and chances are of the trained individuals were not consistently training with this program so being unaccustomed to the training probably highly contributed to CNS fatigue indeed we have research indicating after a second workout some measures of CNS fatigue recover faster on top of this we call the stay from Greece observed fatigue lasting for numerous days initially they didn't measure CNS fatigue directly but we've had previous studies finding CNS fatigue can persist onwards of three days after maximal eccentric training thus since the Greek study found subjects were virtually fully recovered within a day or two by the end of the study logically a reduction in CNS fatigue is in play here too also recall earlier we saw that two specific studies failed to find CNS fatigue in the days after training the subjects of these studies were quite trained and I think this probably played an important part in the notes finally there's this fascinating study that recruited 13 trained men with these average tenerate max strength levels and ffmi they trained this program every day for four days each set was performed with repetitions up to a 99.5 rpe meaning they would have been stopping around to one rep short of failure they were performing four hard sets for the chest and four hard sets for the quads each session across the four days bench press performance remained the same the same applied to back squads therefore these trained individuals were essentially recovering their performance within 24 hours between sessions the point isn't that you should do this precise training rather it's to demonstrate the recovery capacity that's possible to develop now it's worth mentioning individual differences do exist returning to the Greek study the researchers provided the individual data virtually all individuals aligned with their average results seeing much less fatigue from training across the 10 weeks yet there were seemingly around two to four individuals who although saw improvements across the 10 weeks still experienced fairly notable fatigue after training in the 10th week thus some individuals fail to develop the repeated bow effect as well as others another potentially interesting point is that if we return to the paper which had subjects trained this program daily for four days the researchers noted the strongest individuals whose bench press 10 rep max was 1.25 times their body weight failed to replicate their performance from the first day suggesting their recovery was slightly worse this may Point towards the notion that there's a threshold of strength level where if you pass it it does make recovery harder from training I'll be curious to see if future research corroborates this even so I think for the most part we can say recovery largely improves as you accustom yourself to a training program if you're searching for additional ideas about programming for muscle hypertrophy the alpha progression app can help it has an exceptionally flexible custom workout generator that uses trading variables based on meta-analities and reviews from the scientific literature specify your training experience the equipment you have and how often and how long you want to train for you can still individualize things further by editing things to your preference the app also provides neat graphs displaying your long-term progression and there's a database of 550 exercises the link in the comments and description allows you to try everything on the app entirely for free for two weeks and if you like it and go beyond the link gives you 20 off a subscription we don't just partner with anyone at the house of hypertrophy so rest assured the app is great [Music] let us recap the main points CNS fatigue refers to reduced electrical drive from the CNS the brain and spinal cord to the muscle resulting in reduced muscle Force production interestingly some Studies have failed to observe seen as fatigue in the days after lifting yet other Studies have found it and unsurprisingly higher volumes that's more sets per exercise per session seems to produce greater CNS fatigue contrary to popular belief lighter loads and thus higher reps actually appear to produce greater CNS fatigue both within the training session and the ensuing hours compared to heavier loads and thus lower reps the majority of the current evidence fails to support the notion that deadlift is more fatiguing compared to other exercises but more research is needed to more confidently draw conclusions of course training to failure produces overall more fatigue compared to not training to failure but preliminary data indicates this greater overall fatigue may not be due to Greater CNS fatigue rather muscle damage in so far as tracking CNS fatigue hand grip strength doesn't appear to be a valid indicator my speculation is that explosive movements such as vertical jump performance may be a better indicator of CNS fatigue but I don't think it's essential to be overly meticulous about tracking fatigue if you ever run into recovery problems it should become apparent in one way or another performance stagnation regression and or subjective perception your recovery durations tend to become faster as you accustom yourself to a training program this likely involves lower CNS fatigue how can we effectively develop the side delts feel free to check out our video on the topic"

    "title": "Lifting Weights Does NOT Increase Testosterone...or Does It?",
    "published_at": "2022-01-17T11:59:52Z",
    "transcript": "Testosterone is probably the most\u00a0\ndiscussed hormone in the fitness industry,\u00a0\u00a0 largely due to its role in hypertrophy. Firstly, it's worth\u00a0\nestablishing some basic details. Under normal conditions, It's very broadly\u00a0\nestimated around 70% of total testosterone\u00a0\u00a0 is strongly bound to SHGB (that is,\u00a0\nsex-hormone-binding globulin), 20-30%\u00a0\u00a0 weakly bound to albumin, and the remaining 1-2%\u00a0\nis bound to nothing, and called free testosterone. Testosterone strongly bound to SHBG cannot have\u00a0\nan active effect on tissues. Testosterone bound\u00a0\u00a0 to albumin, due to the binding being\u00a0\nweak, can actively impact tissues.\u00a0\u00a0 Free testosterone, of course, is\u00a0\nfreely capable of exerting effects too. When administered exogenously to evoke\u00a0\nsustained elevations above normal levels,\u00a0\u00a0 we know it can powerfully enhance hypertrophy\u00a0\nadaptations in response to lifting weights. However, what about the somewhat inverse of this? Does lifting weights increase testosterone? In a previous article, we saw that lifting weights\u00a0\ncan temporarily spike testosterone concentrations.\u00a0\u00a0 But In this particular video,\u00a0\nwe'll be focusing on if lifting\u00a0\u00a0 weights can chronically increase\u00a0\nyour resting testosterone levels. This seems like a straightforward question. Yet,\u00a0\u00a0 closer inspection would reveal an\u00a0\narray of factors worth considering. Are we talking previously untrained or trained\u00a0\nindividuals, young or older individuals?\u00a0 What are the baseline testosterone\u00a0\nlevels of the person in question?\u00a0 What were the training\u00a0\nvariables and exercises used?\u00a0 Finally, are we talking about total testosterone,\u00a0\nfree testosterone, or bioavailable testosterone\u00a0\u00a0 (note, bioavailable testosterone refers to\u00a0\nboth albumin-bound and free testosterone)? Accordingly, as we dissect the\u00a0\ncurrent existing literature,\u00a0\u00a0 we'll do our best to ensure\u00a0\nthese factors are considered. Let's dive in.\nTwo Meta-Analyses\u00a0 Firstly, a recent 2021 meta-analysis by Potter et\u00a0\u00a0 al. combined findings of 9\u00a0\nrandomized control trials,\u00a0\u00a0 all conducted on previously un resistance-trained\u00a0\nmen ranging from 18-75 years old. The normal total testosterone range\u00a0\nfor men roughly lies between 270ng/dl\u00a0\u00a0 to 1070 ng/dl, and the subject's average levels\u00a0\nin these 9 studies fell within this range. Most studies had subjects perform 2-3 full-body\u00a0\nworkouts a week, with mainly compound exercises\u00a0\u00a0 comprising the program, with movements like\u00a0\nthe leg press, bench press, and lat pulldown\u00a0\u00a0 commonly used. Largely 6-12 weekly sets were\u00a0\nperformed for the trained muscle groups, with\u00a0\u00a0 repetitions performed to or very close to failure\u00a0\nwith loads between 50% and 80% one-rep max. Below are the approximate results,\u00a0\nindicating lifting weights had\u00a0\u00a0 no significant effect on resting\u00a0\ntotal testosterone concentrations. A 2018 meta-analysis by Hayes and Elliot further\u00a0\nsupports this conclusion, with older men. 17 randomized and unrandomized control trials\u00a0\nconducted on previously un resistance-trained\u00a0\u00a0 men at or above the age of 60, with\u00a0\nthe large majority of subjects still\u00a0\u00a0 within the normal total, bioavailable, or\u00a0\nfree testosterone ranges, were combined. Like before, most studies included 2-3 full-body\u00a0\nworkouts per week, with mainly compound exercises\u00a0\u00a0 comprising the program, with movements like\u00a0\nthe leg press, bench press, and lat pulldown\u00a0\u00a0 commonly used. Largely 6-12 weekly sets were\u00a0\nperformed for the trained muscle groups, with\u00a0\u00a0 repetitions performed to or very close to failure\u00a0\nwith loads between 50% and 80% one-rep max. Below are the findings, indicating lifting\u00a0\nweights did not have a significant effect on free,\u00a0\u00a0 bioavailable, or total testosterone\u00a0\nresting concentrations. What About Other Individuals?\nSo, the two detailed meta-analyses indicate\u00a0\u00a0 in men of varying ages, lifting weights does\u00a0\nnot impact resting testosterone concentrations. However, it's worth reiterating all\u00a0\nthis data was derived from previously\u00a0\u00a0 untrained men who were largely\u00a0\nwithin normal testosterone ranges. What about trained men, or men with\u00a0\nlow total testosterone concentrations\u00a0\u00a0 (roughly defined as below 270ng/dl)? Could lifting weights impact resting\u00a0\nconcentrations in either of these demographics? Individuals With Below Normal Testosterone Levels\nExploring the low testosterone demographic first,\u00a0\u00a0 3 comparable randomized trials out of Denmark\u00a0\nrecruited men between 60-78 years old,\u00a0\u00a0 with low bioavailable testosterone concentrations\u00a0\u00a0 (the average levels were around 129ng/dl) and a\u00a0\nwaist circumference greater than 94 centimeters. These studies set out to examine the\u00a0\neffects of exogenous testosterone treatment\u00a0\u00a0 (in the form of gel) with resistance training.\u00a0\u00a0 However, they were groups that only\u00a0\nresistance-trained with a placebo gel. Subjects trained 2-3 times per week for 10 weeks. They trained leg presses,\u00a0\nknee extensions, leg curls,\u00a0\u00a0 chest presses, lat pulldowns, back extensions,\u00a0\u00a0 and crunches for 2-3 sets with reps very likely\u00a0\nto or close to failure with 6-10 rep-max loads. In all three studies, the placebo group\u00a0\nthat resistance-trained did not experience\u00a0\u00a0 increases in bioavailable testosterone. Indicating\u00a0\neven in older men with low testosterone levels,\u00a0\u00a0 lifting weights may have no effect on\u00a0\nresting testosterone concentrations. Trained Individuals\nAs for trained individuals,\u00a0\u00a0 a couple of studies provide insight. Schwanbeck et al. had 15 men with\u00a0\nan average of around 2.5 years of\u00a0\u00a0 training experience perform a free\u00a0\nweight or machine-only program. The respective group's programs are on-screen.\u00a0\u00a0 Each exercise was trained\u00a0\nfor 3-4 sets of 4-10 reps. This study assessed free testosterone, with\u00a0\nbaseline measures being in the normal range.\u00a0\u00a0 After the training period, neither group\u00a0\nexperienced any changes in resting concentrations. Mangine et al. had 33 men with 2 years of average\u00a0\ntraining experience perform a range of exercises. One group trained each exercise for 4 sets\u00a0\nof 3-5 reps with 90% one-rep max loads,\u00a0\u00a0 while another group used 4 sets of\u00a0\n10-12 reps with 70% one-rep max loads. Subjects were within the normal total\u00a0\ntestosterone ranges. After the study,\u00a0\u00a0 neither group experienced any changes in\u00a0\nresting total testosterone concentrations. Mccall et al. recruited men\u00a0\nwith prior training experience\u00a0\u00a0 (no further details were given) who were\u00a0\nwithin the normal total testosterone ranges. They trained 4 biceps\u00a0\nexercises and 4 other exercises\u00a0\u00a0 (again, no further details were given)\u00a0\nfor 3 sets with a 10-rep max load. After 12 training weeks, resting total\u00a0\ntestosterone concentrations were unchanged. Finally, Ostrowski et al. had 35 men\u00a0\nwith 1-4 years of training experience\u00a0\u00a0 train a range of exercises for sets\u00a0\nof 7-12 repetitions to failure. Some subjects trained each exercise for 1 set\u00a0\n(the low volume group), some 2 sets per exercise\u00a0\u00a0 (the moderate volume group), and the rest used\u00a0\n3 sets per exercise (the high volume group). Neither group experienced\u00a0\nstatistically significant\u00a0\u00a0 changes in total testosterone resting\u00a0\nconcentrations as a result of training. I should note the data of this\u00a0\nstudy was kind of all of the place,\u00a0\u00a0 as you can see with the numbers provided\u00a0\nbelow. The data was highly variable\u00a0\u00a0 (as indicated by the standard deviations),\u00a0\nmaking it difficult to decipher anything. Studies Finding an Increase\u00a0\nin Resting Testosterone Levels\u00a0 So, all the data assessed so far indicates\u00a0\nlifting weights has no impact on resting\u00a0\u00a0 testosterone concentrations. Yet, I'm\u00a0\naware of two studies contrasting with this. Izquierdo et al. had Spanish nation team basque\u00a0\nball players with resistance training experience,\u00a0\u00a0 and within the normal total testosterone ranges,\u00a0\u00a0 train the parallel squat and bench\u00a0\npress twice per week for 11 weeks. Subjects were either allocated to\u00a0\na failure or non-failure group. During the first 6 weeks, the\u00a0\nfailure group trained each\u00a0\u00a0 exercise with 3 sets of reps to\u00a0\nfailure with a 10 rep-max load,\u00a0\u00a0 while the non-failure group used 6\u00a0\nsets of 5 reps with a 10 rep max load. Throughout this period, neither group experienced\u00a0\u00a0 changes in resting total\u00a0\ntestosterone concentrations. During the next 5 weeks, the failure group trained\u00a0\neach movement with 3 sets of reps to failure with\u00a0\u00a0 a 6 rep-max load, while the non-failure group\u00a0\nused 6 sets of 3 reps with a 6 rep-max load. Throughout this period, the failure group's\u00a0\nresting total testosterone concentrations remained\u00a0\u00a0 unchanged, but the non-failure group's resting\u00a0\ntotal testosterone concentrations were increased. Thus, perhaps compound exercises with heavy\u00a0\nloads, but only performing a few repetitions,\u00a0\u00a0 alters total testosterone resting concentrations. However, it's difficult to verify this claim as\u00a0\nthere are no similar studies as far as I know.\u00a0\u00a0 The closest paper was the previously mentioned\u00a0\nMangine et al. study, which found in one\u00a0\u00a0 group of subjects training a range of compound\u00a0\nexercises for 3-5 reps with 90% one-rep max loads,\u00a0\u00a0 resting total testosterone\u00a0\nconcentrations remained unaltered. Still, differences between these two studies,\u00a0\u00a0 such as the precise training\u00a0\nvariables and participants exist. As for the second study, Kraemer et al.\u00a0\nhad 8 young men (with an average age of\u00a0\u00a0 30) and 9 older men (with an average age of\u00a0\n62), within the normal testosterone ranges,\u00a0\u00a0 train a range of exercises with the loads used\u00a0\nvarying across the three training days per week. Throughout 10 weeks of training, neither the\u00a0\nyoung nor older men experienced increases in\u00a0\u00a0 resting total testosterone concentrations.\u00a0\nBut, the young men did experience increases\u00a0\u00a0 in resting free testosterone concentrations,\u00a0\nthis was not the case for the older men. Despite this finding, a comparably designed\u00a0\nstudy by Petrella et al. conflicts. 13 young men ( between 20-35) and 13 older\u00a0\nmen (between 60-75) trained the leg extension,\u00a0\u00a0 leg press, and squat each for 3 sets of 8-12\u00a0\nrepetitions, three times per week for 16 weeks. Neither the young nor older\u00a0\nmen experienced an increase in\u00a0\u00a0 resting total or free testosterone concentrations. Though, it's still worth noting exercise\u00a0\nselection did differ between this study\u00a0\u00a0 and the one by Kraemer, so it's not clear\u00a0\nif this may explain the divergent outcomes. Summary\u00a0 In summary, the majority of evidence indicates in\u00a0\na wide range of individuals, lifting weights does\u00a0\u00a0 not appear to increase resting total, free,\u00a0\nor bioavailable testosterone concentrations. Yet, it's worth considering this data does\u00a0\nnot necessarily prove lifting weights never\u00a0\u00a0 increases resting testosterone concentrations. It remains plausible that\u00a0\ntraining variables could matter.\u00a0\u00a0 Virtually all of the data we assessed\u00a0\nhad subjects train with full-body splits,\u00a0\u00a0 but what about something like bro-splits.\u00a0\nMoreover, minimal data explore the effects\u00a0\u00a0 of training with loads above 80% one-rep max,\u00a0\nas well as different proximities from failure. Finally, virtually all of the data\u00a0\nassessed lasted 12 weeks or less.\u00a0\u00a0 What about many months or even years? For example, Hakkinen et al. found after\u00a0\nfollowing up on elite weightlifters for 2 years,\u00a0\u00a0 their resting total testosterone\u00a0\nconcentrations had elevated.\u00a0\u00a0 However, there are two problems with this data. Firstly, they were weightlifters, and as such\u00a0\nwould have been regularly training Olympic lifts,\u00a0\u00a0 which is not what most recreational or\u00a0\ncompetitive individuals after muscle\u00a0\u00a0 hypertrophy or typical strength gains would do.\u00a0\nIt's not clear how this would influence things. Secondly, although the researchers stated\u00a0\nthey were not taking anabolic steroids\u00a0\u00a0 before or during the 2 years, I'm a little\u00a0\nskeptical of this as they were established\u00a0\u00a0 champions or record holders in\u00a0\nFinland with impressive numbers."

    "published_at": "2024-09-15T14:00:56Z",
    "transcript": "welcome to the house of hypertrophy what are the best and not so great ways to train your side delts today we'll be using the current scientific literature to rank the most common side Del exercises at the house of hypertrophy we have a previous video on the side delts but this is a more updated video that will contain more research and discussion on other exercise variations let's dive straight in there's current no studies directly comparing sidel hypertrophy between different exercises but there are multiple studies using what we may call indirect measurements that allow us to estimate the possible effect of various exercises these indirect measurements are quite controversial throughout detailing This research and ranking the various exercises we will be simplifying things and not entirely describing the nuances and limitations of the research used this will make the spirit of scientific accuracy sad but don't worry near the end of the video I'll clear up the shortcomings of the data let's start with classic dumbbell lateral raises there are many different ways they can be performed but let's first dissect normal lateral raises which involve us performing shoulder abduction straight out to our sides up to around 90\u00b0 with the shoulder neutrally rotated the side out's main function is shoulder abduction here's a graph depicting its leverage throughout shoulder abduction let me explain what Leverage is as it's something that will be mentioned a few times in this video leverage in this case refers to a muscle's moment arm to figure this out we draw the line of action of a muscle and a parallel line through the center of the joint it moves then we calculate the perpendicular distance between the two this is the muscle's moment arm simply put muscles with larger moment arms have greater mechanical advantage and potential to generate joint torque there's evidence that the muscles with the best leverage throughout a movement are highly recruited by the nervous system since the Sid outs have great leverage for shoulder abduction it's no surprise normal lateral raises are going to be great for growing them but does this mean we should put them into s tier possibly not dumbbell lateral razes are most challenging when the arm is parallel to the ground there are many factors that theoretically contribute to what the hardest point in an exercise is but we can generally say nearly all three-way exercises tend to be hardest when the external moment arm is the longest this concept is pretty interesting and worth understanding more as it relates to some different dumbbell lateral raay variations we mention soon to calculate the external moment arm is comparable to a muscle's moment arm but in this case we draw the line of weight and a parallel line through the Joint Center then we calculate the perpendicular distance between them if we do this throughout the range of motion of these exercises we can see where the hardest point will approximately be a simple trick is to see where the moving segment m is parallel to the ground as that will be the point when the external moment arm is the longest is it bad that normal lateral raises are hardest with the arms parallel to the ground I wouldn't say it's bad but it may be unideal at this position the side dels are at moderately short lengths you might be aware that emerging research suggest challenging muscles at longer lengths May build overall more muscle for this reason these lateral raises may fall short of s tier so we'll drop it into a tier some say instead of Performing normal lateral razes straight out to your sides in what's known as The frontal plane performing them slightly in front in what we call the scapular plane could be superior however I'm not convinced this is true the relative differences in leverages between muscles for shoulder abduction in the frontal and scaper plane isn't all that different if anything there may be a bit more front delts in scap plane abduction there's also this study finding that side Del activity was not that different between shoulder abduction in the frontal and scaper planes the numbers slightly favor the frontal plane but as the author's note this small difference may not be meaningful plus the study didn't involve typical lateral raises for now go with your preference another thing I'm unconvinced about is achieving greater stability some say that seated lateral raises or leaning against the bench leads to Greater muscle fiber Recruitment and tension thanks to improved stability there is indeed research suggesting greater stability can enhance fiber Recruitment and tension but this research is not necessarily generalizable to what we care about for example this study varied stability levels on a leg extension by strapping down the legs and torso when looking at research more relatable greater stability isn't always better for example freeway exercises such as back squats are more unstable than Hack squats yet muscle growth seems to be similar additionally there's this study comparing seed to standing overhead presses and deltoid activity wasn't any better when seated of course if you like extra stability that's absolutely fine some find it easier to maintain their desire technique with more stability but it is still absolutely possible to have excellent technique with standing [Music] exercises instead of lateral raising with a shoulder neutrally rotated what if we lateral raise with the shoulders internally rotated as if we're emptying a can of soda or even lateral raising with the shoulders externally rotated as if we're maintaining a full can of soda this paper compared all these variations it was found that both the neutral and internally rotated positions were fairly similar for cidel activity while the externally rotated position was slightly worse interestingly front Del activity was greater with external rotation which makes sense as there's evidence externally rotating can increase the front Del's leverage for shoulder abduction reil activity was greater with internal rotation which might also make sense since internal rotation could increase the reel's leverage for shoulder abduction upper trap activity was also slightly greater with internal rotation which the author suggest is due to internal rotation elevating the scapular more these results are pretty intriguing as they fundamentally suggest external rotation increases front delt recruitment while somewhat decreasing side Del involvement when whereas although internally rotating does increase rear Dell activity and upper trap activity it was still pretty similar to normal lateral raises for SEL activity it's worth mentioning there is another study that just compared internally to externally rotated lateral razes in the scapular plane and it found side out activity was actually much better with the internal rotation so although the magnitudes differ this study further supports the idea leral razors with internal rotation may be better for the side delt than external rotation due to this data I'm going to go ahead and place lateral Rises with internal rotation at the same level as normal lateral raises while externally rotated lateral raises go into B tier now some of you might be thinking aren't lateral razors with internal rotation a recipe for shoulder injury I'll discuss this more later when we dissect the controversial upright row lateral raises can be performed with the elbows bent and the paper we just mentioned that compared these three exercises also involved lateral raises with the elbows bent to 90\u00b0 this variation produced much Lower Side delt activity but fairly decent front delt rear delt and upper trap activity honestly I am quite surprised by the much lower SEL activity and better front activity the author suggested the placement of the forearm in front may be related to the greater front Del activity regardless I would like to see more data on this and we also need to keep in mind these results are specific to 90\u00b0 of elbow flexion I suspect a slight Bend in the elbows probably has minimal to no detrimental effects anyhow these results lead me to place 90\u00b0 elbow Flex lateral raises into CTI but this is with some caution as more data is needed all of the lateral Rises discussed so far involved abducting up to 90\u00b0 but you can go beyond to achieve what we may call a super range of motion lateral raise some refer to these as L raises named after the Chinese weightlifter who contributed to popularizing this exercise although bodybuilders have historically performed this movement here's old footage of Tom plat sort of executing super range of motion lateral raises there are at least three considerations with these lateral raises firstly as implied earlier the evidence suggests that trading muscles at longer not shorter lengths is benefit ficial for hypertrophy so the extra shortened muscle positions in this movement may not stimulate extra growth secondly many naturally have to externally rotate around the 50 to 80\u00b0 abduction Mark to move beyond their head we've seen that external rotation during abduction May enhance frontel involvement while maybe reducing SEL involvement thirdly frontel involvement May further be enhanced since there's evidence abducting the shoulder Beyond 90\u00b0 results in the front deltoid matching and potentially surpassing the side delt in leverage and activity considering these factors super range of motion lateral razes may not be any better than normal lateral Rises if anything the external rotation and relatively greater contribution from the front delts May reduce the side Del stimulus I will say I'm skeptical that the reduction in side Del stimulus is much we after all still get neutrally rotated abduction at the initial portion just like normal lateral raises I think Super Range motion lateral Rises may also be better than pure externally rotated lateral raises as well so I'm going to break the rules and add in a minus tier and place super range of motion lateral razors into them you may be thinking why not Place externally rotated lateral razors into C tier and Super Range motion lateral raises into BP it's a subjective call on my part as my hesitation is that saying externally rotated elri razes are C tier makes them sound pretty bad but we've seen the difference between an external rotated lateral rate and normal lateral raise isn't necessarily that big so I'll keep the a minus tier we mentioned how dumbbell lateral Rises are most challenging when the side delts are moderately shortened but through changing our body position we can challenge the muscle at longer lengths if you lean against the wall the external moment arm is longest below 90\u00b0 of abduction where the muscle is less shortened if you lean against the bench with a lower incline the exercise is challenging at even earlier abduction angles if we get horizontal on a flat bench the exercise is challenging when our arms are right by our sides at a longer side Del length if we're assuming reaching and challenging the longest muscle length attainable is best this variation might be the best however I know some of you might not find this as comfortable or feasible compared to the other options also we strictly don't have evidence that reach the longest possible lengths is always better rather we just have data demonstrating shorter muscle lengths aren't as good as comparatively longer lengths for overall growth so for now I'm just going to generally consider these leaning and lying Dumbo lateral raises as belonging to S tier cable lateral raises also belong in s tier but there are some key considerations to figure out the external moment arm with cables we draw a line through the direction of the cable a parallel line through the joint Center and then we measure the perpendicular distance between the Joint Center and the line of the cable to know the external moment arm you can see how it varies throughout the range of motion a simple trick is to look for when the cable and the segment moving form a 90\u00b0 angle as that will be when the external moment arm is the longest higher setups in their hand High bring the hardest part to a more lengthened position into s TI they go what about machine lateral raises not all machines are identical but there are machines that provide great challenge at longer side Del lengths when the arms are near the sides for instance this Prime Fitness machine actually has a smart cam that you can adjust to change where the exercise is hardest unlike dumbbells and cables machines do not enable you to move the arm across the body but again as it's unclear if reaching the longest lengths is always essential as still Place machine ler raises into s tier before moving on to ranking compound exercises such as overhead presses and upright rows there is something worth clearing up some of you might be questioning the idea of training the sight outs at longer lengths why you might have heard that during the initial angles of abduction it's the supraspinatus one of the rotator cuff muscles that initiates and carries out the movement therefore although the side dels are at a longer length in these early angles it's not activated and we're instead highly training the supraspinatus this idea is stated in textbooks however as described in this study this is misleading the supinatus does not appear to be activated any earlier than the side delts moreover though it is true the supress spinatus has great leverage and displays great activity in early Abduction the SS are still far from having no leverage or activity in these stages so it's very possible training the side outs at longer lengths is still beneficial I'm actually glad to say that there seems to be a future study that will compare standard dumbbell to cable lateral rises though my colleagues and I are working on the first ever study on the side dots comparing the dumbbell side raise to the cable side raise and measuring side Delta hyy we'll of course be updating you with its findings and any other data that may emerge let us enter the land of speculation and detail something you might find intriguing as explored in our last video training muscles at longer length can build more muscle overall but the extra growth is not necessarily equal across all muscle regions I'm wondering if this could apply to the side delts too allow me to briefly explain we've detailed how normal Dumbo lateral Rayes since they're most challenging at moderately shorter lengths might not be as good as lateral raises that challenge the side delts better at longer lengths however when considering the research on training muscles at longer lengths in this scenario I think it's possible when comparing these two growth at the proximal region of the side delts closer to the muscle's origin is only slightly better with challenging the side dels at longer lengths or even maybe similar between both whereas growth at the distal part of the side dels the region further away from the origin is notably better with training the side outs at longer lengths now this is extremely and heavily speculative because we don't currently have any data on SEL growth some people do report feeling the distal region of the dealt notably more with lengthened challenged lateral raises if you felt this or if you intend to try out lengthened lateral raises it will be interesting to hear your experience another intriguing thing is that although we consider there to be three deltoid heads the front side and rear deltoids we can actually consider there to be seven segments something that seems to have been known as far back as 1734 based on an intricate analysis from Australia these are the general functions of each segment for Simplicity we will just continue to refer to the front side and rear delts two compound exercises that will involve the side dels are overhead presses and upright rows how effective are they starting with overhead presses there are numerous ways to execute this exercise I could actually have a full video dissecting And discussing the various overhead presses and their utility for hypertrophy let me know if you'd like to see that but for our purposes here we can can think of two types of overhead presses abduction dominant and flexion dominant overhead presses abduction dominant overhead presses tell us that shoulder abduction is occurring at the shoulder this happens when using a wider grip on a barbell or moving the dumbbells in this way we know the side out's main function is shoulder abduction does this mean the exercise belongs in a or S tier potentially not the start position typically involves around 30 to 40\u00b0 of abduction so we don't don't really attain long lengths overhead presses also involve external rotation if you put your hands in an overhead press position and then straighten the elbow you'll see that your thumbs and biceps are both pointing up we've seen that external rotation has the potential to enhance front Del activity and maybe reduce sidel involvement overhead pesses are highly challenging at and above 90\u00b0 of shoulder abduction recall that at these higher angles the front Del May match and surpass SEL activity having described all of this some of you might be aware there was this study that fascinatingly found abduction dominant overhead presses elicited similar sidel activity to normal dumbbell lateral raises however there was another study that failed to find this and when considering the other data on external rotation and leverages above 90\u00b0 of abduction I'm not convinced overhead presses are equal to normal lateral raises I also don't think they're equal to Super range of motion lat raises either since unlike overhead presses super range of motion lateral raises can still involve a good chunk of abduction with a neutrally rotated shoulder thus I'll Place abduction dominant overhead presses into B tier some might be questioning it being placed alongside externally rotated lateral raises as you might be thinking the extra triceps involvement with overhead presses makes it worse but we have a few studies demonstrating that compound exercises that involve more muscle mass aren't always worse than more isolated exercises for a muscle for example squats highly stimulate the quads and adductor magnet but were found to be as good for growing the glute Max to hip thrusts in one study leg extensions are an isolated quad exercise but are not necessarily better than growing the vastest parts of the quads compared to squats or leg presses things could differ between exercises and muscles but for now I'm not sold on the idea that the extra triceps involvement with overhead presses reduces the deltoid stimulus as for flexion dominant overhead presses these involve shoulder flexion as the dominant motion this happens when using a narrower grip or moving the dumbbells in this way the side dels have leverage for shoulder flexion but it is likely the front delts have much better leverage and there's evidence SEL activity isn't as strong during shoulder flexion compared to shoulder abduction accordingly I'm actually going to go ahead and place Flex dominant overhead presses into deter finally the controversial upright row I'll address this controversy shortly but when analyzing them they actually have some great things going on besides the elbow flexion and scapular motion these involve shoulder abduction with internal rotation we've seen how shoulder abduction with internal rotation actually seems to be quite effective for the side dels being more effective than using external rotation and may be similarly effective to neutral rotation indeed there is also this one study finding higher cidel activity with upright rows compared to abduction dominant overhead presses for these reasons you might suggest upright row should be in a tier however there was this other study that found upright rows weren't quite as effective for sidel activity to normal dumbbell lateral raises but the subjects were women with chronic neck pain perhaps something about the upright row reduces the side out stimulus such as the involvement of the biceps or traps of course we did just detail how the involvement of extra muscle mass doesn't always reduce the stimulus to a muscle but things could be different with the upright row grip width could also play a role as well as this paper found wider grips to be more effective for cidal activity but the methodology of this paper had a slight problem so there's still some ambiguity I would love to see more analyses on the upright row but considering the uncertainty and that there's no other data I'm going to make the call ho and place them into a minus tier which I know a lot of you may find surprising as for its controversy it's believe that upright row due to combining shoulder abduction with internal rotation causes shoulder impingement however I believe the fear surrounding upright rows is not justified let's summarize why here's the upper right of the body with a humorous a chromian and structures in between such as the supress spinatus tendon impingement typically refers to compression of tissues in this space this is called a subacromial space it's believed that abducting your shoulder with internal rotation and narrows the subacromial space and compresses and damages the tissues there but we have multiple areas of the literature that seriously questions this I would like to give credit to E3 rehab who have two tremendous videos on the literature behind shoulder impingement I'll link to the videos in the description but here's the brief summary we'd expect the upper supraspinatus to display more damage from depression by the acromium but it does not we'd expect people with a hook shaped acromium to experience greater problems but they don't we'd expect in those with subacromial pain smaller subacromial distances would link to pain but it does not we'd expect increasing the subacromial space through surgery that shaves down certain structures would help but it does not outperform Placebo surgeries some say given tests that are used to test for impingement involve arm elevation with internal rot rotation then arm elevation with internal rotation must be dangerous but these tests have poor specificity and may have little diagnostic value furthermore there's evidence that internal rotation might actually increase or have no effect on a Chromo humoral distances it's sometimes suggested to perform upright rows to no higher than 90\u00b0 of abduction to make it safer yet we have some evidence suggesting the smallest of chromal humoral distances happen between 40 to 75\u00b0 not always above 90\u00b0 so if impingement was the enemy all lateral raises would be dangerous but they're not there are pushes to move away from using the term impingement and instead just use generic terms such as subacromial pain of course if you find upright rows or lateral razors with internal rotation uncomfortable and painful you don't have to perform them there are many other options on the table you may be tempted to think that experiencing pain proves these exercises are dangerous but the issue is pain is multifactorial there are likely cases out there of people reporting pain from every single exercise in existence but that doesn't mean they're all dangerous as with most anecdotes you can find the flip side with others reporting upright rows help their shoulders so here's the final rankings we put normal lat Rises into a tier but there are two options that might Elevate this exercise into or at least is close to S tier status here's the first option we know they're most challenging when your shoulders are abducted to 90\u00b0 but once you can no longer raise your arms to this level don't stop keep trying to abduct as much as you can this will gradually result in your range of motion being shorter and shorter but this will successfully mean you're highly challenging the side delt at relatively longer lengths research on the cares found this style of training resulted in better muscle growth we've explored that in an earlier video this technique can also be done with a super range of motion lateral raises the second option is instead of raising up to 90\u00b0 you just perform partial reps at the bottom with a heavier weight this will also result in you highly challenging the side delts at relatively longer lengths these are called lengthen partials we've explored the research on them in earlier videos but the preliminary evidence on them suggests they could be very effective for muscle growth feel free to try out either method we use the combination of research on other muscle groups leverage and activity to guide our rankings this isn't Flawless let's summon the spirit of scientific accuracy and make clear what's Limited we use the research on other muscle groups to suggest that challenging the side delts at longer lengths could be beneficial we're going to need direct research on the side delts to be sure we heavily relied on both the leverage and activity data to infer what muscles may experience the best hyper y from an exercise firstly activity is a bit vague but these studies use surface electromyography to record a muscle's electrical activity which is simply the electrical events that happen at a muscle when it receives a signal these electrical events are what precede and cause the muscle fiber to generate active forces there are various lines of evidence showing a relationship between electrical activity and muscle hypertrophy there are also examples where although there's no direct studies I feel pretty confident in how hypothesizing the electrical activity data will relate to muscle hypertrophy but on the flip side there are examples where the electrical activity data does not predict muscle growth when considering this data it seems that the electrical activity data May better relate to muscle growth when we're comparing exercises that are more similar and less reliable when we're comparing exercises that are quite different so the research we saw comparing lateral raises with different rotations may be fairly good whereas it's more questionable and remains to be determined if the electrical activity data we saw comparing overhead presses to upright rows or lateral raises is reliable as for the leverage data various lines of evidence find a relationship between leverage and electrical activity and similarly it might be that there are certain scenarios where it does relate to muscle hypertrophy and other scenarios where it does not I actually do feel fairly confident that most of the hypotheses made in this video from The Leverage data May truly relate to hypertrophy but we'll see a future research can verify or falsify this so don't consider these rankings as definitely true rather consider them as my best guess based on the available scientific literature it's entirely possible something is wrong and we'll of course update you if future research suggests

    "transcript": "In this video, we aim to figure\u00a0\nout if you're missing out on more\u00a0\u00a0 muscle growth by NOT changing\u00a0\nyour exercises every session. Accommodation is considered\u00a0\na general law of biology. As per the science and\u00a0\npractice of strength training,\u00a0\u00a0 the response of a biological object to\u00a0\na constant stimulus decreases over time. Applying this to resistance training,\u00a0\u00a0 training with the exact same routine will\u00a0\nincrementally produce fewer and fewer gains. Now, regardless of how you train, the amount of\u00a0\ngains you can experience diminishes over time. The amount of gains you experience in your\u00a0\nfirst two years of consistent training\u00a0\u00a0 is going to be greater than the gains\u00a0\nexperienced in the subsequent two years. For example, Kraemer et al. evaluated\u00a0\naround 140 studies and established this\u00a0\u00a0 relationship between training\u00a0\nexperience and strength gains.\u00a0\u00a0 The longer you've been training, the\u00a0\nless strength gains you experience. Similar trends likely exist for building muscle. Nevertheless, the law of accommodation still\u00a0\nsuggests your body becomes non-response\u00a0\u00a0 quicker when training with the\u00a0\nexact same routine long-term. In an attempt to counter this accommodation,\u00a0\u00a0 one extreme response is to change the\u00a0\nexercises you perform every single session. This is known as muscle confusion\u00a0\nin the bodybuilding world. It's hypothesized changing exercises every session\u00a0\nexposes your muscles to consistent novel stimuli,\u00a0\u00a0 thus limiting any accommodation\u00a0\nthat may diminish muscle growth. Though this sounds nice in theory,\u00a0\ndoes it play out in reality? Does changing exercises every\u00a0\nsession enhance muscle hypertrophy? A Spanish study by Baz-Valle et al. is the\u00a0\nonly study I'm aware of examining this. The researchers recruited 19 men with\u00a0\nat least 2 years of training experience,\u00a0\u00a0 who back squatted an average of 123kg\u00a0\nand bench pressed an average of 94kg. The subjects were assigned to\u00a0\neither a fixed or variation group. Both groups performed two upper body and two\u00a0\nlower-body training sessions per week for 8 weeks. The fixed group performed the same 6 upper\u00a0\nbody exercises on their upper body days,\u00a0\u00a0 and the same 6 lower body\u00a0\nexercises on their lower body days. The variation group used a phone\u00a0\napp consisting of 80 different\u00a0\u00a0 exercises to randomly generate\u00a0\nwhat exercises they trained with.\u00a0\u00a0 On the upper body days, the phone app\u00a0\ngenerated 3 pulling and 3 pushing exercises.\u00a0\u00a0 On the lower body days, the phone app generated\u00a0\n3 anterior chain and 3 posterior chain exercises. Of course, this likely meant the\u00a0\nvariation group was changing exercises\u00a0\u00a0 every session and probably not that\u00a0\nfrequently performing the same exercise. Both groups, on all their exercises, performed\u00a0\n3 sets of 6 to 12 repetitions to failure. Before and after the study, thickness of\u00a0\nthe rectus femoris, vastus intermedius,\u00a0\u00a0 and vastus lateralis was measured at approximately\u00a0\n50% of the thigh bone length via ultrasound. it was found increases in thickness\u00a0\nof all three of the muscles were not\u00a0\u00a0 statistically different between\u00a0\nthe fixed and variation groups. Now, some of the percentages\u00a0\nseem to favor the fixed group,\u00a0\u00a0 especially the rectus femoris percentage gains. Did the small sample sizes of the\u00a0\nstudy compromise the ability to\u00a0\u00a0 detect this percentage change as statistically\u00a0\nsignificant, something we call a type 2 error? Or maybe it was that small sample sizes\u00a0\nintroduced large variation. For instance,\u00a0\u00a0 the subjects in the fixed group might\u00a0\nhave just so happened to have better\u00a0\u00a0 average rectus femoris muscle-building genetics. In any event, this study fails to\u00a0\nqualify as evidence that changing\u00a0\u00a0 exercises every session\u00a0\nenhances muscle hypertrophy. The researchers found through a\u00a0\nquestionnaire handed to the subjects,\u00a0\u00a0 the variation group saw increased motivation\u00a0\nlevels to train throughout the study,\u00a0\u00a0 whereas the fixed group's\u00a0\nmotivation levels slightly declined. As a result, if the study does truly suggest\u00a0\nthere's no difference between fixed and variation\u00a0\u00a0 training (there were no type 2 errors), then\u00a0\nthis is evidence changing exercises every\u00a0\u00a0 session may be a viable way to enhance motivation\u00a0\nlevels while not compromising muscle growth. Despite this study's findings,\u00a0\nI think it's worth touching on\u00a0\u00a0 three potential considerations with\u00a0\nchanging exercises every session. Firstly, many exercises (particularly\u00a0\ncompound exercises) are skills. Regular practice of an exercise is required to\u00a0\nachieve smoother and more efficient movement,\u00a0\u00a0 something that would ensure we're stimulating\u00a0\nthe intended muscles most effectively. Changing exercises every session can\u00a0\nprevent or significantly delay exercise\u00a0\u00a0 skill acquisition. This may be more so a problem\u00a0\nfor individuals with minimal training experience. Secondly, changing exercises every\u00a0\nsession might require longer recovery\u00a0\u00a0 durations than training with fixed\u00a0\nexercises, at least in the long term. Allow me to explain. The amount of muscle damage present is one factor\u00a0\u00a0 that determines whether you're\u00a0\nrecovered between sessions. When you first expose yourself to a novel training\u00a0\nroutine, the amount of muscle damage produced\u00a0\u00a0 afterward is quite high. But as you continue to\u00a0\nexpose your body to the same training routine\u00a0\u00a0 week after week, the amount of muscle damage\u00a0\nproduced afterward incrementally decreases. This is thanks to a range of adaptations within\u00a0\nthe muscles called the repeated bout effect. The repeated bout effect is going\u00a0\nto be greater when performing the\u00a0\u00a0 same weekly exercises in your training routine. Most people have experienced this. When\u00a0\nperforming the same weekly training routine,\u00a0\u00a0 the amount of soreness you experience gradually\u00a0\ndiminishes over many weeks of training,\u00a0\u00a0 and you're overall recovery\u00a0\ncapacities become better. However, If you're changing the\u00a0\nexercises you perform every session,\u00a0\u00a0 the repeated bout effect likely occurs to a lower\u00a0\nextent. It's likely your recovery durations are\u00a0\u00a0 going to always be longer compared to\u00a0\ntraining with the same weekly routine. Now, in the Baz-Valle et al. study, evidently\u00a0\nrecovery was not a problem for the variation\u00a0\u00a0 group, as the variation and fixed group's gains\u00a0\nwere not statistically different from one another. But it's worth noting the study\u00a0\nused an upper/lower split,\u00a0\u00a0 in which the same muscle\u00a0\nwas trained 72 hours apart. However, what if something like\u00a0\na full-body split was used,\u00a0\u00a0 in which the same muscle is mostly\u00a0\ntrained 48 hours or quicker apart?\u00a0\u00a0 Would the variation group appropriately\u00a0\nbe able to recover long-term? It's difficult to say without future research. Another point worth adding is there's evidence\u00a0\ngradually increasing the number of weekly sets\u00a0\u00a0 you perform for a muscle group might be\u00a0\nan effective way to get past plateaus.\u00a0\u00a0 We overviewed this evidence in\u00a0\nour ultimate guide to sets video. Of course, increasing set numbers requires you can\u00a0\ntolerate and recover from this increased volume.\u00a0\u00a0 This might be harder to do when\u00a0\nchanging exercises every session. The third consideration with changing exercises\u00a0\nevery session relates to tracking progression. When performing the same weekly exercises,\u00a0\nso long as you're able to progressively\u00a0\u00a0 overload them in some form (either via\u00a0\nincreasing load or repetition numbers),\u00a0\u00a0 you have proof you're progressing. Furthermore, if you're not progressing with your\u00a0\nfixed exercise selection in the way you expect,\u00a0\u00a0 this can be an indicator something's wrong,\u00a0\u00a0 and it allows you to re-assess your\u00a0\ntraining plan and make adjustments. In other words, fixed exercise selection\u00a0\ncan help you individualize and optimize\u00a0\u00a0 your training routine in the long\u00a0\nterm via more meticulous tracking. When changing exercises every session,\u00a0\nyou can simply perform repetitions to\u00a0\u00a0 or very close to failure on them, which\u00a0\nensures you've provoked a good stimulus.\u00a0\u00a0 However, the fact is it's very difficult to\u00a0\ntell if you're making progress week to week.\u00a0\u00a0 If you hit a plateau, it's going\u00a0\nto be difficult to establish this. We currently have one study by\u00a0\nBaz-Valle et al. finding changing\u00a0\u00a0 exercises every session was comparable for\u00a0\nmuscle growth to training with fixed exercises. Despite this, I think there are some potential\u00a0\nissues with changing exercises every session. Firstly, for those with minimal training\u00a0\nexperience, changing exercises every session\u00a0\u00a0 can prevent or at least significantly delay the\u00a0\ndevelopment of form and skill with exercises. Secondly, over the long-term, changing exercises\u00a0\nevery sesion probably requires longer recovery\u00a0\u00a0 durations than training with the same exercises,\u00a0\nthis might make it unpractical when training\u00a0\u00a0 with full-body splits that require you\u00a0\nto recover within 48 hours or less.\u00a0\u00a0 Moreover, it may also make it challenging\u00a0\nto increase volume in the long term,\u00a0\u00a0 and increasing volume may be\u00a0\nhelpful for getting past plateaus. Finally, changing exercises every\u00a0\nsession makes it difficult to track\u00a0\u00a0 progression and very challenging to\u00a0\nestablish if you've hit a plateau."

    "transcript": "welcome to the house of hypertrophy in your quest to unlock the next level of your physique you'll come across certain popular ideas from the bodybuilding realm some have been dismantled by the scientific literature do you still believe them it's possible as they are repeated again and again believing them has the potential to not only hold back your results but even your training enjoyments by the end we will have separated facts from fiction in five key areas and you'll have some knowledge to help you along your muscle building Journey the pump is a temporary increase in muscle size achieved from lifting some think of it as a preview of upcoming solidified gains during intense muscular contractions a flow of events involving increased blood volume and fluid explains the pump some find immense pleasure in the pump a satisfying to me as com is some say maxing the pump maximizes gains in fact popular bodybuilding coach hany Rambo devised the fs7 program including components of higher sets and shorter rest to maximize the pump the belief being this stretches out the fascia to make room for growth multiple highlevel bodybuilders have trained with this method luckily this 2023 paper had trained individuals perform an FST inspired program for the B BPS and triceps the volume was super high and the rest between set short one group actually stretched between some of the sets while another rested passively the result overall arm hypertrophy in both groups was minimal with multiple non-statistically significant gains some even slightly lost size possibly as the higher volumes led to excessive damage that oriented the protein synthesis response to repair rather than growth now as detailed in some other videos at the house of hypertrophy higher volumes can produce respectable hypertrophy but there's good reason to believe the pump's relation to hypertrophy is not strong when researchers have phological induced reactive hyperemia protein synthesis isn't improved multiple training strategies also enhance the pump but not your gains higher reps evoke a greater pump but tend to be similar to lower reps although Super High Reps can produce a tremendous pump but inferior gains drop sets involve performing multiple bouts of reps def failure with progressively lighter loads they will produce an incredible pump but seem to largely be similar to normal sets a constant tension technique avoids locking out the joints and elicits a great pump but the majority of the research finds them to be similarly effective to a normal technique so so what does this mean for you don't worry about maxing the pump think of it as a byproduct of your training not the goal this is not to say you can't chase the pump many of the techniques that produce a greater pump do not compromise gains so feel free to enjoy that pump if you [Music] like time under tension refers to the duration of one of your sets a longer time under tension or reaching a desired Target is often recommended in this case we find that the time under tension that's best for building muscle is around 40 to 60 seconds long take those 15 reps a lot slower than normal to increase the time under tension the popular Mike Mena even recommended a slow 4sec lifting and 4-second lowering Tempo tension has been identified as likely the primary initiator of muscle hypertrophy so you may logically deduce time under tension is important but what does the scientific literature say a recent recent review finds that provided your training hard and getting two or near failure slower tempos which involve higher time under tension largely produce similar muscle Hy pery to comparatively faster tempos on top of this we've already noted how provided you training hard and getting two on their failure the research finds a wide range of rep numbers are similarly effective for stimulating gains most of these studies use a 1 to two second lifting and lowering tempo although reps naturally slow down as you near failure either way time under tension is widely different across this range but gains are similar so what's going on time under tension shouldn't be mistaken for mechanical tension the tension we care about is optimized by training hard getting to or close to failure forces the body to recruit all the fibers we can and expose them to tension this kicks off events in all these fibers that conclude in growth and yes this means both lower and higher reps can similarly involve high tension when people PR long time under tension a lot of that initial time is very far from failure accordingly what we may call time under high tension which is what matters ends up being similar what all this means for you is it's absolutely not essential to prolong or reach a specific time under tension threshold you can do it if you like since it's not inherently detrimental but don't let it stray you away from the main aim achieving time under high tension which is largely no more complicated than getting two or n failure in that 6 to 35 rep range this part somewhat links to the pump a shorter rest time between sets invariably enhances the pump additionally it's been known since the '90s that shter rest between sets transient ly enhances the elevation of anabolic hormones like growth hormone bodybuilders notoriously use shorter rest between sets this 1987 paper established a subset of bodybuilders rested 10 to 90 seconds between sets and this more recent 2013 analysis found after surveying 127 competitive bodybuilders the majority rested one to 2 minutes between sets despite this we have well-designed papers finding that resting 2 5 to 3 minutes between sets actually produces greater hypertrophy than resting for less time what's going on well transient anabolic hormonal elevations do not appear to be strongly related to the hyper process in general it's possible that longer rest more effectively dissipates fatigue that would otherwise limit your ability to expose your fibers to tension having said all this there are not worthy considerations the majority of the mentioned research to use programs heavily including compound exercises with isolation exercises it's possible shorter rests are fine moreover if you are using shorter rests performing extra sets could compensate for example this paper found each session with a leg press around four to five sets with a minute of rest between sets ultimately produced similar gains to three sets with 3 minutes of rest between sets anyhow the key takeaway is despite the common practice of bodybuilders shorter rest between sets are not Superior so if you need to take your time between sets particularly between compound exercise sets rest assured you're likely helping not hurting your gains lifting weight causes micro tears in your muscles your body then repairs the damage and enlarges the tissue this is probably the sing single most frequent explanation for how muscle growth happens muscle size increases as a result of the damaged protein fibers the resulting cycle of damage and repair eventually makes muscles bigger and stronger causing micro tears in the muscle fibers the body naturally repairs this damage by Ming the torn fibers the result is a muscle that's larger and stronger than before a consequence of this is many may feel muscle soreness is essential and a valid proxy to know gains will occur although it's interesting to know there are multiple potential causes of s damage might not just be the only thing going on nonetheless what does the literature say about damage and hypertrophy there are a few cases in the literature where researchers find that a program with greater average damage just ends up producing similar muscle hypertrophy to a program with lower average damage furthermore your body adapts and reduces the damage you see from training over time but significant growth still happens finally although there are speculated pathways through which damage causes growth there are strong counterarguments to them none of this is to say damage plays no role in hypertrophy although it's possible researchers end up discovering it has no role regardless what we do know is it's not the primary stimulus for growth as of right now tension is the best categorized mechanism behind hypotrophy so the real thing that needs to be torn apart is the notion that micro tears are the prim initiator of [Music] hypertrophy the term muscle confusion is thrown about a bit Arnold seems to call this the shocking principle the idea is that your muscles can become stale and to combat this we need to surprise the muscle by introducing new workout variables or unusual exercises what does the current scientific research say this paper recruited trained subjects one condition performed the same program across 8 weeks while another condition switched in and out different training variables across every session of the 8 weeks the result hypy was similar between both groups this second paper had some trained subjects perform the same program across 8 weeks while other trained subjects let a phone app generate what exercises were to be trained for each muscle every session the result Hy pery was largely similar between both groups to be fair sensible training variation over the very long term could be beneficial but we don't know right now even so it's clear frequent training variation in the time frame studied fails to enhance gains for those who've long believed muscle confusion is fallacious you may be surprised it largely wasn't worse but perhaps it's not too surprising as I hope this video has portrayed one of the most crucial things is to train a muscle hard to expose it to tension there's more than one way to do this having said this I still believe there are benefits to not training in an unpredictable and excessively varied manner at the end of the day I think following a consistent well-designed program is a good idea for most people amidst all the noise it certainly can be frustrating and even timec consuming to craft an effective program that gets

    "transcript": "Dude, I love full body workouts,\u00a0\nthey're amazing for hypertrophy. Nonsense,\u00a0\u00a0 everyone knows full body workouts are for newbs.\u00a0\nBro-splits are where the real gains are at, bro. Ha! Bro-splits are for\u00a0\njuice heads, you juice head. I like push/pull/legs. In this video, we're going extremely\u00a0\ndeep into the science comparing\u00a0\u00a0 different training frequencies\u00a0\nand splits for muscle hypertrophy. Briefly, full-body workouts, needless to\u00a0\nsay, involve training all muscle groups\u00a0\u00a0 in one session. Anywhere from 2 to 5 full-body\u00a0\ntraining sessions are commonly performed per week. Bro-splits isolate muscle groups\u00a0\non different days of the week.\u00a0\u00a0 Muscle groups are typically trained with\u00a0\na frequency of once or twice a week here. Upper/lower splits train your upper and\u00a0\nlower body muscles on separate days.\u00a0\u00a0 Commonly, 2 upper and lower body\u00a0\nsessions are performed weekly,\u00a0\u00a0 resulting in you training muscle\u00a0\ngroups at a twice per week frequency. Though performing 3 upper and lower body\u00a0\nsessions each week is also possible,\u00a0\u00a0 this results in you training your muscle\u00a0\ngroups with a three times per week frequency. Finally, push/pull/legs train your pushing,\u00a0\npulling, and leg muscles on separate days.\u00a0\u00a0 Such a schedule means muscle groups are\u00a0\nhit with a frequency of twice per week. Before diving into the science, let us\u00a0\noverview some history of training splits. If you do not care about the history,\u00a0\nfeel free to skip to the timepoint shown\u00a0\u00a0 on screen where we begin examining\u00a0\nthe training frequency research. Traveling back to the 1900s to 1950s,\u00a0\u00a0 surprisingly, full-body\u00a0\ntraining seemed to be the norm. It appears Eugen Sandow, often called \u201cthe\u00a0\nfather of bodybuilding\u201d, and other legends\u00a0\u00a0 within the sport, like Reg Park (an idol of\u00a0\nArnold), trained with full-body routines. For example, I stumbled across a newspaper\u00a0\narticle written by Reg Park himself,\u00a0\u00a0 detailing his training preparation\u00a0\nfor the 1958 Mr. Universe competition. Part of this prep consisted of\u00a0\n3 full-body weekly workouts. By the 1950s-60s and onwards, however, the rise\u00a0\nof bro-splits was ignited for a couple of reasons. Firstly, it appears the Weider brothers,\u00a0\nbusinessmen with their own supplements,\u00a0\u00a0 magazines, and bodybuilding competitions,\u00a0\nare credited with popularising bro-splits\u00a0\u00a0 through their magazine's writings. Partly,\u00a0\nit seems the Weider brother's promotion of\u00a0\u00a0 bro splits was to help distinguish themselves\u00a0\nfrom other businessmen in the fitness world. Secondly, while evidence exists of occasional\u00a0\nbodybuilding competitions before the 1930s,\u00a0\u00a0 it was in the decades after bodybuilding\u00a0\ncompetitions become more regular and prominent.\u00a0\u00a0 As an article by BarBend puts it \u201cIf\u00a0\nno bodybuilding competitions exist,\u00a0\u00a0 focusing on your biceps peaks\u00a0\nseems somewhat pointless.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0 Thus, the rise of regular and prominent\u00a0\nbodybuilding competitions likely also\u00a0\u00a0 contributed to bro-splits becoming more favorably\u00a0\nlooked upon by bodybuilding enthusiasts. Thirdly and finally, during what\u2019s now sometimes\u00a0\ncalled the \u201cgolden era of bodybuilding\u201d,\u00a0\u00a0 legendary figures like Arnold and Frank Zane\u00a0\nwere known to train and promote bro splits. In Arnold\u2019s encyclopedia of\u00a0\nbodybuilding, published in 1985,\u00a0\u00a0 bro-split routines were detailed. Back to today, the popularity of bro-splits\u00a0\nseems to remain in the bodybuilding sphere. A 2022 study by Hackett et al. had 235 competitive\u00a0\nbodybuilders complete an online survey,\u00a0\u00a0 and found 85.5% of them used split routines. It may be worth also noting 53.6% of all surveyed\u00a0\nbodybuilders used performance-enhancing drugs. With regards to upper/lower\u00a0\nsplits and push/pull/leg splits,\u00a0\u00a0 I was unfortunately unable to find\u00a0\nany resources detailing their history. Nevertheless, let us transition\u00a0\nto examining what the research\u00a0\u00a0 has to say on the optimal training\u00a0\nfrequency for muscle hypertrophy. It's very important to note all the\u00a0\nresearch to be explored has assessed\u00a0\u00a0 how different training frequencies\u00a0\nimpact muscle growth while all other\u00a0\u00a0 weekly training variables (including weekly\u00a0\nsets per muscle group) are kept the same. For example, researchers may get one group\u00a0\nto train their muscle groups once per week\u00a0\u00a0 and compare this to another group of subjects\u00a0\ntraining their muscle groups three times per week. Both of these groups ultimately perform\u00a0\nthe same weekly sets on the same exercises\u00a0\u00a0 and thus achieve the same weekly\u00a0\nset numbers per muscle group. Keeping all other weekly training variables\u00a0\nthe same ensures they do not confound our\u00a0\u00a0 findings, as we're trying to isolate the\u00a0\neffect of training frequencies and splits. This is important, as the number of\u00a0\nweekly sets per muscle group performed can\u00a0\u00a0 impact the amount of hypertrophy produced. Nevertheless, some individuals believe in\u00a0\nthe real world, higher training frequencies\u00a0\u00a0 are a practical way to increase the number\u00a0\nof weekly sets performed per muscle group.\u00a0\u00a0 This is a fair point, and it's something\u00a0\nwe'll address a little later on. With that out the way, let's\u00a0\nget on to the literature. In 2016, a meta-analysis by Schoenfeld\u00a0\net al. combined the results of all the\u00a0\u00a0 existing studies at that time\u00a0\npoint on training frequency. It was found with all other weekly training\u00a0\nvariables equal, training a muscle group twice\u00a0\u00a0 per week was better than once a week. Due\u00a0\nto limited data, the researchers couldn't\u00a0\u00a0 speculate on if training a muscle group three\u00a0\nor more times per week provided more benefit. To this day, many people seem to run\u00a0\nwith this data saying bro-splits are\u00a0\u00a0 scientifically inferior, as bro-splits typically\u00a0\ninvolve training a muscle group once a per week. Full-body workouts, upper/lower splits, and\u00a0\npush/pull/legs splits were thought to be superior\u00a0\u00a0 as all these involve training a muscle group\u00a0\nat a frequency of two or more times per week. You might have come across numerous\u00a0\nInstagram posts expressing these very ideas. Yet, there are major problems here.\u00a0\u00a0 This analysis was conducted 6 years\u00a0\nago and only involved 7 studies. Fortunately, Schoenfeld et al. conducted\u00a0\nan updated meta-analysis in 2019.\u00a0\u00a0 This is currently the most up to data official\u00a0\u00a0 meta-analysis examining training\u00a0\nfrequency and muscle hypertrophy. 13 studies were included in\u00a0\nthe analysis this time around. It was found with all other weekly\u00a0\ntraining variables constant,\u00a0\u00a0 training frequency did not affect muscle growth.\u00a0\u00a0 That is, no particular training frequency\u00a0\nwas superior for muscle hypertrophy. An important point is out\u00a0\nof the 13 studies included,\u00a0\u00a0 11 had subjects train with a total of 12\u00a0\nweekly sets per muscle group or fewer. Thus, the most accurate conclusion from this\u00a0\nanalysis is when training with a total of 12 or\u00a0\u00a0 fewer weekly sets per muscle group, no particular\u00a0\ntraining frequency or split seems to be superior. Bro splits, full-body workouts, upper/lower\u00a0\nsplits, and push/pull/legs splits are all viable. Let's briefly examine a few studies included\u00a0\nin the analysis underscoring this point. Gomes et al. recruited 23 trained men with\u00a0\nan average bench press one-rep max of 103kg\u00a0\u00a0 and an average squat one-rep max of 132kg. One group used bro-splits that trained muscle\u00a0\ngroups at a frequency of once per week. A second group used full-body\u00a0\nworkouts that trained muscle\u00a0\u00a0 groups at a frequency of five times per week. Both groups accumulated 10 weekly\u00a0\nsets for each trained muscle group. Although, with the triceps and biceps, if you\u00a0\ncount compound exercises in addition to the\u00a0\u00a0 isolation exercises, both these muscles\u00a0\nwere trained with 15 weekly sets each. Nevertheless, after 8 weeks of training, increases\u00a0\nin lean mass were similar between both groups. Another study by Ochi et al.\u00a0\nrecruited untrained subjects\u00a0\u00a0 and had them train the leg extension only. One group performed 6 sets on one day per week.\u00a0\u00a0 Another group performed 2\u00a0\nsets across 3 days per week. After 11 weeks of training,\u00a0\u00a0 increases in quadriceps thickness\u00a0\nwere similar between both groups. Therefore, this study potentially\u00a0\nsuggests with low weekly set numbers,\u00a0\u00a0 training a muscle once a week (as done with\u00a0\nbro-splits) may be similarly effective to\u00a0\u00a0 training a muscle three times per week\u00a0\n(as done with full-body workouts). Regarding upper/lower and push/pull/legs\u00a0\nsplits, we know these typically train a\u00a0\u00a0 muscle at a frequency of twice per week. Again,\u00a0\nwith 12 or fewer weekly sets per muscle group,\u00a0\u00a0 there is likely nothing superior or\u00a0\ninferior with a twice per week frequency. As an example, Yue et al. recruited 18 trained men\u00a0\nwith an average bench press one-rep max of 77kg\u00a0\u00a0 and an average squat one-rep max of 103kg. One group trained their muscle groups\u00a0\nwith a frequency of once per week\u00a0\u00a0 (except the triceps and biceps which\u00a0\nwere technically trained twice per week),\u00a0\u00a0 while another group trained their muscle\u00a0\ngroups with a frequency of twice per week\u00a0\u00a0 (except the biceps and triceps which were\u00a0\ntechnically trained four times per week). Both groups trained all muscle\u00a0\ngroups with 4-12 weekly sets.\u00a0\u00a0 However, if you count compound exercise sets\u00a0\ntoward triceps and biceps weekly set numbers,\u00a0\u00a0 the biceps were trained with 16 weekly sets while\u00a0\nthe triceps were trained with 24 weekly sets. After 6 weeks of training, both\u00a0\ngroups did not statistically\u00a0\u00a0 differ in vastus medialis and\u00a0\nelbow flexor thickness gains. So, it seems when performing 12\u00a0\nweekly sets per muscle group or fewer,\u00a0\u00a0 all training splits and frequencies appear viable\u00a0\nand similarly effective for building muscle. The burning question is what about when training\u00a0\nwith more than 12 weekly sets per muscle group? Does training frequency matter in this situation? Theoretically, there could be a limit to the\u00a0\nnumber of effective sets you can perform for a\u00a0\u00a0 muscle group per session. Thus, when training a\u00a0\nmuscle group with a fair number of weekly sets,\u00a0\u00a0 using a training frequency greater\u00a0\nthan once per week may be required Indeed, two studies published in 2020 by Barbalho\u00a0\net al. provided potential evidence for this. Both studies were designed the same,\u00a0\u00a0 but one study was done on trained\u00a0\nmen while the other on trained women. Subjects only trained their muscle\u00a0\ngroups at a frequency of once per week. One group trained with 5\u00a0\nweekly sets per muscle group,\u00a0\u00a0 the second with 10 weekly sets, the third with 15\u00a0\nweekly sets, and the fourth with 20 weekly sets. As subjects trained muscle groups\u00a0\nwith a frequency of once per week,\u00a0\u00a0 the number of weekly sets performed\u00a0\nfor a muscle group was equivalent\u00a0\u00a0 to the number of sets performed\u00a0\nfor a muscle group per session. Overall, 5 to 10 sets were sufficient\u00a0\nfor increasing muscle size. In fact,\u00a0\u00a0 the data of the study shows slightly worse muscle\u00a0\nsize increases when training with 15 to 20 sets. Hence, this data potentially indicates\u00a0\non a per session basis (as remember,\u00a0\u00a0 the study used a frequency of once per\u00a0\nweek), performing between 5 to 10 sets\u00a0\u00a0 per muscle group might be the limit to the amount\u00a0\nof productive volume you can perform per session. If you want to perform more than\u00a0\n5-10 weekly sets for a muscle group,\u00a0\u00a0 distributing the weekly sets across a\u00a0\nhigher frequency of days may be necessary. However, we have a problem. These two studies by Barbalho et\u00a0\nal. have since been retracted,\u00a0\u00a0 probably because the data presented\u00a0\nin the study was not legitimate. It's been established many studies\u00a0\nconducted by Barbalho et al. contain\u00a0\u00a0 atypical and improbable data. So, these Barbalho studies cannot\u00a0\nhelp our quest to establish the\u00a0\u00a0 optimal training frequency\u00a0\nwith higher weekly volumes. Fortunately, we do have other valid data. Recall in the Schoenfeld et al. 2019\u00a0\nmeta-analysis, 11 of the 13 included\u00a0\u00a0 studies in the analysis had subjects train\u00a0\nwith 12 or fewer weekly sets per muscle group. Meaning 2 studies had subjects train with\u00a0\nmore than 12 weekly sets per muscle group. Moreover, since 2019, 3 additional studies\u00a0\nhave been published comparing different\u00a0\u00a0 training frequencies when subjects train with\u00a0\nmore than 12 weekly sets per muscle group. So in total, we currently have 5 studies. Allow us to overview them. Evangelista et al. recruited untrained men with\u00a0\u00a0 an average 60kg bench press one-rep\u00a0\nmax and an average 87kg back squat.\u00a0\u00a0 These numbers, particularly the squat numbers,\u00a0\nare quite impressive for untrained individuals. Anyway, a bro-split routine group trained their\u00a0\nmuscle groups at a twice per week frequency,\u00a0\u00a0 while a full-body group trained muscle\u00a0\ngroups at a four times per week frequency. Both groups accumulated 16\u00a0\nweekly sets per muscle group However, if we include compound exercise sets\u00a0\ntowards the weekly set biceps and triceps counts,\u00a0\u00a0 the triceps were trained with\u00a0\na whooping 40-48 weekly sets,\u00a0\u00a0 while the biceps were trained with 32 weekly sets. Now, although both groups performed the same\u00a0\nweekly set numbers for their muscle groups\u00a0\u00a0 (except for the triceps), exercise selection\u00a0\nslightly differed between the bro split and\u00a0\u00a0 full-body groups. The bro split group\u00a0\nused a little more exercise variety. Nonetheless, after 8 weeks of training,\u00a0\nincreases in quadriceps, triceps,\u00a0\u00a0 and biceps thickness were similar between\u00a0\nboth the bro-split and full-body groups. Suggesting even with higher weekly volumes,\u00a0\u00a0 bro-splits may be comparable\u00a0\nto full body workouts. Brigatto et al. also suggest training frequency\u00a0\nmay not matter much with higher weekly volumes. These researchers recruited trained men whose\u00a0\naverage bench press one-rep max was 94kg\u00a0\u00a0 and squat one-rep max was 125kg. Two groups trained with a split routine. One group\u00a0\ntrained their muscle groups with a frequency of\u00a0\u00a0 once per week while the second group trained their\u00a0\nmuscle groups with a frequency of twice per week. Both groups accumulated 16 weekly sets per muscle\u00a0\ngroup. Though, if we counted compound exercises\u00a0\u00a0 toward biceps and triceps weekly set counts, both\u00a0\nthese muscles were trained with 24 weekly sets. After 8 weeks of training, increases\u00a0\nin triceps, biceps, vastus lateralis,\u00a0\u00a0 and anterior quadriceps thickness\u00a0\nwere similar between both groups. Suggesting with higher weekly volumes,\u00a0\u00a0 a frequency of once per week may\u00a0\nbe similar to a twice per week. Thus, combining this Brigatto study with\u00a0\nthe Evangelista study, they potentially\u00a0\u00a0 indicate training splits and frequency may\u00a0\nnot matter with higher weekly volumes either. However, the remaining three studies\u00a0\ndo not support this conclusion. Zaroni et al. recruited men with an\u00a0\naverage bench press one-rep max of 99kg\u00a0\u00a0 and an average squat one-rep max of 109kg. A bro-split group trained their muscle groups at\u00a0\na once per week frequency (though the triceps and\u00a0\u00a0 biceps would have been trained twice per\u00a0\nweek if we consider compound exercises). A full body trained their muscle group\u00a0\nat a frequency of five times per week. Both groups accumulated 15 weekly sets for all\u00a0\nmuscle groups. But for the biceps and triceps,\u00a0\u00a0 if we count compound exercises, both these\u00a0\nmuscles were trained with 30 weekly sets. After 8 weeks of training,\u00a0\nincreases in triceps, biceps,\u00a0\u00a0 and vastus lateralis thickness were superior for\u00a0\nthe full-body group versus the bro-split group. Indicating with higher weekly volumes, full-body\u00a0\ntraining may be superior to bro-splits. Yet, another study by Bartolomei et al.\u00a0\nsomewhat directly conflicts with this study. These researchers recruited trained\u00a0\nmen with an average bench press one-rep\u00a0\u00a0 max of 96kg and an average\u00a0\nsquat one-rep max of 108kg. A bro-split group trained their muscle\u00a0\ngroups at a frequency of once per week.\u00a0\u00a0 Though the triceps, considering compound\u00a0\nexercises, would have been trained twice per week. A full-body group trained their muscle group\u00a0\nat a frequency of three to four times per week. Both groups accumulated 15 weekly sets for the\u00a0\nchest and 20 weekly sets for their quadriceps,\u00a0\u00a0 while the trapezius was trained\u00a0\nwith around 25 indirect weekly sets. After 10 weeks of training,\u00a0\u00a0 increases in thickness of the chest\u00a0\nwere similar between both groups. But,\u00a0\u00a0 increases in thickness of the vastus lateralis and\u00a0\ntrapezius were superior for the bro-split group. Suggesting bro-splits overall to be superior to\u00a0\nfull body training with higher weekly volumes,\u00a0\u00a0 thus somewhat conflicting\u00a0\nwith the Zaroni et al. study. Making things even more confusing, we\u00a0\nhave the final study by Lasevicius et al. These researchers recruited trained men with\u00a0\nan average bench press one-rep max of 79kg\u00a0\u00a0 and an average back squat one-rep max of 161kg. An upper/lower split group trained their muscle\u00a0\ngroups with a frequency of twice per week. A full-body group trained their muscle groups\u00a0\nwith a frequency of three times per week. Both groups accumulated 36\u00a0\nweekly sets for the quadriceps,\u00a0\u00a0 and 12 weekly sets for the triceps and biceps.\u00a0\nHowever, if we counted compound exercise sets\u00a0\u00a0 towards triceps and biceps weekly sets, both of\u00a0\nthese muscles were trained with 24 weekly sets. After 10 weeks of training, increases in thickness\u00a0\nof the rectus femoris, vastus lateralis, biceps,\u00a0\u00a0 and triceps were superior for the upper/lower\u00a0\nsplit group versus the full-body group. Suggesting with high weekly volumes, a\u00a0\nfrequency of twice per week (as achieved\u00a0\u00a0 with upper/lower splits) is more beneficial\u00a0\nthan a frequency of three times per week\u00a0\u00a0 (as achieved with full-body workouts). When combining all of these 5 studies, it's\u00a0\nutterly confusing as the findings are conflicting. 2 studies suggest training frequency did not\u00a0\nimpact hypertrophy, 1 suggests full-body workouts\u00a0\u00a0 are superior to bro-splits, another suggests\u00a0\nbro-splits are superior to full body workouts,\u00a0\u00a0 and the final study indicates upper-lower\u00a0\nsplits are better than full-body workouts. Needless to say, the 5 studies\u00a0\nwere far from identical.\u00a0\u00a0 The precise training details\u00a0\nbetween the studies differed,\u00a0\u00a0 this could go some way toward explaining\u00a0\nthe conflicting results between studies. At this time, it's going to be\u00a0\nimpossible for us to figure this out. Even so, individual differences could also go\u00a0\nsome way to explaining the conflicting data,\u00a0\u00a0 and this is a very important point. There's reason to believe different individuals\u00a0\u00a0 can respond best to different\u00a0\ntraining frequencies or splits. One paper by Damas et al. supports this. 19 untrained men were recruited and had one of\u00a0\ntheir legs assigned to a high-frequency condition\u00a0\u00a0 and their other leg assigned\u00a0\nto a low-frequency condition. Both legs were trained on the\u00a0\nunilateral leg extension with\u00a0\u00a0 each session consisting of 3 sets\u00a0\nof 9-12 repetitions to failure. With the high-frequency leg,\u00a0\nsubjects did this 5 times per week.\u00a0\u00a0 With the low-frequency leg, subjects\u00a0\ndid the session 2 or 3 times per week. This design also meant volume was not equated.\u00a0\u00a0 The high-frequency condition would have\u00a0\naccumulated 15 weekly sets for the quadriceps,\u00a0\u00a0 while the low-frequency condition would have\u00a0\naccumulated 6 to 9 weekly sets for the quadriceps. Before and after the 8 weeks of training,\u00a0\u00a0 vastus lateralis cross-sectional\u00a0\narea was measured for both legs. 6 subjects experienced the best vastus lateralis\u00a0\ncross-sectional area increases with their\u00a0\u00a0 high-frequency condition leg, 7 experienced the\u00a0\nhighest vastus lateralis cross-sectional area\u00a0\u00a0 increases with their low-frequency condition\u00a0\nleg, and the remaining 6 saw similar vastus\u00a0\u00a0 lateralis cross-sectional area increases\u00a0\nbetween both the high and low-frequency legs. Based on this, it seems some individuals may grow\u00a0\nmore with higher frequency training, others with\u00a0\u00a0 lower frequency training, and some may display no\u00a0\ndifference between higher and lower frequencies. Again, the number of weekly sets\u00a0\nwas not equated in this study,\u00a0\u00a0 so this confounds the conclusion just made. Nevertheless, I think it's quite\u00a0\nlikely different training frequencies\u00a0\u00a0 and splits may work best\u00a0\nfor different individuals. Moreover, these individual differences may\u00a0\nbe more important when discussing higher\u00a0\u00a0 volumes (namely when people perform more\u00a0\nthan 12 weekly sets per muscle group). If true, this may explain why the research is more\u00a0\nconsistent in finding when performing 12 or fewer\u00a0\u00a0 weekly sets per muscle group, training frequency\u00a0\nand splits have no impact on muscle growth. And it also explains why when performing\u00a0\nmore than 12 weekly sets per muscle group,\u00a0\u00a0 the findings of the 5 studies\u00a0\nare largely conflicting. With the 5 studies examining the influence\u00a0\nof different training frequencies when\u00a0\u00a0 training with more than 12 weekly sets per\u00a0\nmuscle group, a vital consideration exists. Most of the studies had subjects use\u00a0\nshort rest interval durations between\u00a0\u00a0 sets (1 to 1.5 minutes) in their sessions. Except for the Bartolomei study, which\u00a0\nhad subjects rest 2 minutes between sets,\u00a0\u00a0 which might potentially be just\u00a0\nabout a long rest interval. Nevertheless, why is the fact most of the\u00a0\nstudies used short rest intervals important? It's because short rest intervals make each\u00a0\nset less effective for building muscle. A couple of studies demonstrate with all\u00a0\nother training variables equal, resting\u00a0\u00a0 2.5-3 minutes between sets produces more muscle\u00a0\nhypertrophy than resting for 1.5 minutes or less. Now, the studies finding this largely used\u00a0\ncompound exercises, and it is likely this\u00a0\u00a0 conclusion (2.5-3 minutes of rest between sets is\u00a0\nsuperior) applies to compound exercises only. Even\u00a0\u00a0 so, we know the 5 studies overviewed\u00a0\nearlier used numerous compound exercises. When using short rest intervals\u00a0\nbetween compound exercise sets\u00a0\u00a0 (1.5 minutes or less), you likely have to perform\u00a0\nextra sets to receive similar muscle hypertrophy. A study by Longo et al. demonstrated this. When performing 3 sets of\u00a0\nrepetitions to failure per session,\u00a0\u00a0 resting for 3 minutes between\u00a0\nsets produced greater increases\u00a0\u00a0 in quadriceps cross-sectional area\u00a0\nversus resting for 1 minute between sets. But, when performing 4 to 5 sets of repetitions\u00a0\nto failure with 1-minute rest between sets,\u00a0\u00a0 muscle growth was similar to performing 3 sets of\u00a0\u00a0 repetitions to failure with 3\u00a0\nminutes of rest between sets. How does this information\u00a0\ntie into training frequency? Earlier we stated there could be a\u00a0\nlimit to the effective number of sets\u00a0\u00a0 you can perform for a muscle group per session. If true, the limit would likely be LOWER\u00a0\nwhen using long rest intervals between sets.\u00a0\u00a0 This is because long rest intervals\u00a0\nbetween sets make each set more effective. The limit would probably be HIGHER when\u00a0\nusing short rest intervals between sets,\u00a0\u00a0 as short rest intervals between sets make\u00a0\neach set less effective for building muscle. As most of the 5 studies\u00a0\nused short rest intervals,\u00a0\u00a0 maybe this explains why many of them found\u00a0\nbro-splits or lower frequencies to be viable. As the limit to the number of effective sets for\u00a0\u00a0 a muscle group per session would be\u00a0\nhigher with shorter rest intervals,\u00a0\u00a0 perhaps none of the subjects training with bro\u00a0\nsplits or lower frequencies exceeded this limit. If the studies used longer rest intervals instead,\u00a0\u00a0 more of them might find bro-splits or\u00a0\nlower frequencies to be suboptimal. The subjects' training with bro splits or\u00a0\nlower frequencies might exceed the limit\u00a0\u00a0 to the number of effective sets that can be\u00a0\nperformed for a muscle group per session,\u00a0\u00a0 as this limit would be lower\u00a0\nwhen using long rest intervals. To rephrase all this, if the studies exploring\u00a0\nhow different training frequencies compare\u00a0\u00a0 when training with more than 12 weekly sets\u00a0\nper muscle group used longer rest intervals\u00a0\u00a0 (2.5-3 minutes), they may find lower frequencies\u00a0\nto be inferior as subjects would exceed the limit\u00a0\u00a0 to the number of effective sets that can be\u00a0\nperformed for a muscle group each session. Of course, this is very much speculation. But, is there any research that could\u00a0\nhelp verify anything we've just said? There is indeed some potential data. A study by Ogasawara et al. subjected the\u00a0\ngastrocnemius of rats to sets of 10 electrically\u00a0\u00a0 induced muscle contractions, using 3 minutes\u00a0\nof rest between sets (a long rest interval). They found muscle protein synthesis progressively\u00a0\nincreased up to performing 10 sets of this per\u00a0\u00a0 session. But, muscle protein synthesis was\u00a0\nless when performing 20 sets per session. Suggesting anywhere from 10\u00a0\nto 20 sets may be the limit to\u00a0\u00a0 the number of effective sets that can be\u00a0\nperformed for a muscle group per session. Of course, limitations of this\u00a0\ndata are rats were studied and\u00a0\u00a0 muscle protein synthesis measurements\u00a0\nwere taken, not actual muscle growth. Another study by Damas et al., conducted on\u00a0\nhumans, found little difference in myofibrillar\u00a0\u00a0 protein synthesis between training with 8 and\u00a0\n12 sets for the quadriceps in one session. 2 minutes of rest between sets was used, which\u00a0\nis probably just about a long rest interval. Therefore, this study suggests there's\u00a0\nlittle benefit to performing more\u00a0\u00a0 than 8 sets for a muscle group per\u00a0\nsession with longer rest intervals. Again though, this data is limited as\u00a0\nit only explored protein synthesis,\u00a0\u00a0 not actual muscle growth. Finally, an analysis by James Kreiger\u00a0\nexamined the current research on set\u00a0\u00a0 numbers and found when resting 2 or\u00a0\nmore minutes between sets, muscle\u00a0\u00a0 growth tended to plateau beyond performing\u00a0\n6-8 sets for a muscle group per session. However, a limitation is this analysis included\u00a0\nstudies done on trained and untrained individuals,\u00a0\u00a0 and much of the studies done\u00a0\non untrained individuals did\u00a0\u00a0 not exceed 6 sets for a muscle group per session. So much of the data points on the\u00a0\nleft from untrained individuals may\u00a0\u00a0 bias the curve as untrained individuals\u00a0\nhave greater muscle growth capacity. Furthermore, it's possible weekly set\u00a0\nnumbers could also confound this analysis.\u00a0\u00a0 Much of the datapoints to the right\u00a0\nof the graph come from studies having\u00a0\u00a0 subjects perform a high number of\u00a0\ntotal weekly sets for a muscle group. Thus, the lower muscle growth in this area could\u00a0\nbe a result of performing too many weekly sets\u00a0\u00a0 (and perhaps under recovering) rather than\u00a0\u00a0 performing too many sets on\u00a0\nan individual session basis. Even so, when combining the Ogasawara\u00a0\net al. study, the Damas et al., study,\u00a0\u00a0 and the analysis by James Kreiger, 6-10 sets for\u00a0\na muscle group per session might be the limit. But again, these data have\u00a0\ntheir respective limitations.\u00a0\u00a0 Future research is unquestionably\u00a0\nrequired to examine things further. As a final counterpoint, recall the Bartolomei et\u00a0\nal. study had subjects rest 2 minutes between sets\u00a0\u00a0 (which may just about be a long rest interval),\u00a0\u00a0 yet this study found bro-splits were\u00a0\noverall superior to full body workouts. In fact, the bro-split group was performing\u00a0\n20 sets for the quadriceps in one session. Thus, this study might oppose\u00a0\nthe suggestions we've made,\u00a0\u00a0 perhaps there's no practical limit to\u00a0\nthe number of effective sets that can be\u00a0\u00a0 performed for muscle group per session.\u00a0\nBut this is only a single study too. Making things crystal clear so far, we've\u00a0\nestablished when training with 12 or fewer\u00a0\u00a0 weekly sets per muscle group, training frequency\u00a0\ndoes not seem to impact muscle hypertrophy. When training with more than 12 weekly sets\u00a0\nper muscle group, data conflicts on the optimal\u00a0\u00a0 training frequency. Individual differences\u00a0\ncould explain these conflicting findings. Yet, a limitation with this data is short\u00a0\nrest intervals were used. If they used\u00a0\u00a0 longer rest intervals, lower frequencies could\u00a0\nbe suboptimal, but this is currently speculative. Moving on, we know all the training frequency\u00a0\nresearch explored so far kept all other weekly\u00a0\u00a0 training variables constant, including the number\u00a0\nof weekly sets performed for a muscle group. This was simply because we want to isolate\u00a0\nthe effects of training frequency and not have\u00a0\u00a0 other training variables confound stuff. But away from the lab and in the real\u00a0\nworld, increasing training frequency\u00a0\u00a0 can be a tool to help increase the number of\u00a0\nweekly sets you perform for a muscle group. For example, a person might be\u00a0\nperforming 2 full-body workouts per week,\u00a0\u00a0 so each muscle group is trained\u00a0\nat a twice per week frequency. Then, to further increase the number of\u00a0\nweekly sets performed for their muscle groups,\u00a0\u00a0 they add a third full-body workout per week. Now, why would a person even\u00a0\nwant to increase the number\u00a0\u00a0 of weekly sets performed for a muscle group? Some evidence suggests modestly increasing\u00a0\nthe number of weekly sets performed for a\u00a0\u00a0 muscle group in trained individuals\u00a0\ncan accelerate muscle hypertrophy. Aube et al. found in men with at\u00a0\nleast 3 years of training experience,\u00a0\u00a0 there was no statistical difference in mid and\u00a0\nanterior thigh growth between performing 12,\u00a0\u00a0 18, or 24 weekly sets for the quadriceps. However, when the researchers split all\u00a0\nsubjects into either a low responder,\u00a0\u00a0 high responder, or moderate responder\u00a0\ngroup, something interesting was found. Remember, the subjects of this study had at least\u00a0\u00a0 3 years of training experience and were\u00a0\ntraining before the study took place. It seems that those that grew their mid anterior\u00a0\nthigh the most in the high responder group had\u00a0\u00a0 increased their weekly sets by the greatest number\u00a0\nrelative to what they were doing before the study. In other words, increasing the weekly sets\u00a0\nperformed for a muscle group seems to be\u00a0\u00a0 an effective way to accelerate muscle\u00a0\nhypertrophy for these trained folks. Another study by Scarpelli et al. recruited\u00a0\ntrained men and had them train the unilateral\u00a0\u00a0 leg extension and unilateral leg\u00a0\npress twice per week for 8 weeks. With one leg, each subject individually performed\u00a0\u00a0 20% more weekly sets for their quadriceps\u00a0\nthan what they were doing before the study. With their other leg, all subjects performed\u00a0\u00a0 a prescribed number of weekly sets for\u00a0\nthe quadriceps, this was 22 weekly sets. It was found vastus lateralis growth was greater\u00a0\nfor the leg performing 20% more weekly sets. Put differently, a progressive\u00a0\nincrease in weekly sets\u00a0\u00a0 (20%) seems to be beneficial for muscle growth. An interesting point is for\u00a0\n8 out of the 16 subjects,\u00a0\u00a0 the prescribed number of weekly sets (22\u00a0\nweekly sets) was actually more than 20% of\u00a0\u00a0 the weekly sets they had been performing\u00a0\nfor their quadriceps before the study\u00a0\u00a0 (it ranged from being 30% to 120% more\u00a0\nweekly sets than usual for these subjects). Yet, results still favored the leg that performed\u00a0\n20% more weekly sets. This finding emphasizes\u00a0\u00a0 that larger jumps (30-120%) in weekly sets\u00a0\nare not necessarily better than more modest\u00a0\u00a0 (20%) increases in weekly\u00a0\nsets for muscle hypertrophy. In summary, modestly increasing the number\u00a0\nof weekly sets you perform for a muscle group\u00a0\u00a0 seems to be an effective way to accelerate\u00a0\nmuscle hypertrophy in trained individuals. Increasing training frequency can be a tool\u00a0\nto help increase your weekly set numbers. When training with 12 or fewer\u00a0\nweekly sets per muscle group,\u00a0\u00a0 training frequency does not seem\u00a0\nto impact muscle hypertrophy. When training with more than 12 weekly sets\u00a0\nper muscle group, data conflicts on the optimal\u00a0\u00a0 training frequency. Individual differences\u00a0\ncould explain these conflicting findings. Yet, a limitation with this data is short rest\u00a0\nintervals (1-1.5 minutes) were mainly used.\u00a0\u00a0 If they used longer rest\u00a0\nintervals (2.5 to 3 minutes),\u00a0\u00a0 lower frequencies could be suboptimal,\u00a0\nbut this is currently speculative. Finally, outside of the lab and in the real world,\u00a0\u00a0 increasing training frequency can probably\u00a0\nbe an effective tool to increase weekly set\u00a0\u00a0 numbers for a muscle group. This is notable as\u00a0\nsome evidence indicates in trained individuals,\u00a0\u00a0 modestly increasing weekly set numbers\u00a0\ncan accelerate muscle hypertrophy."

    "transcript": "One of the more popular gym goals folks have\nis to increase their arm size. Training the biceps is undoubtedly an important\ncomponent of this. However, it should be noted the triceps are\nroughly 2.5 times larger than the biceps. Therefore, triceps training should not be\nunderestimated when it comes to increasing arm size. The triceps consist of three muscles: the\nlong head, lateral head, and medial head. In some individuals, a fourth head has been\nobserved. However, given it's considered rare and I'm\nunaware of research about this head relating to muscle growth, we'll ignore it. Both the medial and lateral head originates\nfrom the back of the humerus. The humerus refers to the upper arm bone. The precise location for the lateral head\nis just above an area called the radial groove, while the location for the medial head is\njust below the radial groove. Conversely, the long head originates from\nthe scapula. The scapula refers to the shoulder blades. The precise location is at an area called\nthe infraglenoid tubercle. All three muscles insert into around the same\nlocation, the ulna. The ulna is one of the forearm bones. The precise location is at an area called\nthe olecranon process. Two studies indicate the long head is the\nlargest muscle of the triceps. With regards to the lateral and medial head,\none of the studies indicates the lateral head is larger than the medial head, whereas the\nother study indicates the opposite of this. Of course, individual differences likely exist. The size of the medial and lateral head may\nbe more individualized. As all three heads cross the elbow joint,\nthey all play a role during elbow movement. Specifically, all three heads actively extend\nthe elbow. Also, remember, the long head originates at\nthe scapula and therefore crosses the shoulder joint. Therefore, as it crosses the shoulder and\nelbow joints, it is called a two-joint muscle. Contrastingly, the medial and lateral\nhead, which only cross the elbow joint. Resulting in them being only one-joint muscles. As the long head crosses the shoulder joint,\nit also appears to play an active role in shoulder extension and shoulder adduction. That said, evidence indicates the long head's\ncontribution to shoulder extension is small. The same thing may also apply to shoulder\nadduction. Therefore, exercises involving\nonly shoulder extension or shoulder adduction probably do not substantially stimulate the\nlong head. Moving on, combining the results from a few\npapers, the triceps overall appears to be comprised of more fast-twitch muscle fibers\nthan slow-twitch fibers. Slow-twitch fibers are highly resistant to\nfatigue but produce low amounts of power, while fast-twitch fibers produce are less\nresistant to fatigue but produce high amounts of power. As the triceps appears to be made up of more\nfast-twitch fibers, I've come across recommendations that you should use low reps and heavy weight\nto optimize triceps hypertrophy. However, the current evidence would not support\nthis recommendation. Schoenfeld et al. split 18 men with an average\nof 3 and a half years of training experience into a low load or high load group. Both groups trained the same 7 exercises for\n3 sets with 90 seconds of rest between sets, three times per week for 8 weeks. In this study, the bench press and overhead\npress were the two exercises that trained the triceps. The high load group trained each exercise\nwith a load that allowed them to perform 8-12 reps to failure (the point at which no more\nrepetitions can be performed) each set. The low load group trained each exercise with\na load that allowed them to perform 25-35 reps to failure each set. Thickness of the triceps, measured at 60%\nof the upper arm length, was similar between the high load and light load group. Some of you may be thinking that using an\n8-12 rep load isn't heavy enough. Fortunately, there is another paper by Schoenfeld\net al. looking at heavier loads. 19 men with an average of 4 and a half years\nof experience were split into a heavy or moderate group. Both groups trained the same 7 exercises for\n3 sets each with 2 minutes of rest between sets, 3 times per week for 8 weeks. Like the last study, the bench press and overhead\npress were the two exercises that trained the triceps. The heavy group used a load that allowed them\nto perform 2 to 4 to failure each set. The moderate group used a load that allowed\nthem to perform 8-12 reps to failure each set. Increases in triceps thickness, measured at\n60% of the upper arm length, seemed to slightly favor the moderate group. Therefore, 8-12 rep loads may be slightly\nbetter for triceps hypertrophy than 2-4 rep loads. As a side note, the overall research seems\nto indicate reps between 5 and 35 produce similar hypertrophy, provided those reps are\nperformed to or very close to failure. This very likely applies to the triceps Now, the fiber type numbers shown just a moment\nago combined results from numerous studies looking at different heads or regions of the\ntriceps. I was able to find one human study by Elder\net al. assessing the fiber type composition of each triceps head. Both the lateral and long heads appear to\nbe more fast-twitch than slow-twitch. However, the medial head appears to be more\nslow-twitch than fast-twitch. Of course, this is only one study. Moreover, fiber type composition does vary\nbetween individuals. Nevertheless, if the medial head is on average\nmore slow-twitch than fast-twitch, this might suggest the medial head may be slightly harder\nto grow than the long and lateral heads. This is because fast-twitch muscle fibers\nseem to have a greater capacity for hypertrophy than slow-twitch fibers. Interestingly, Wakahara et al. did find that\nafter training the dumbbell triceps skull crusher for 12 weeks, increases in triceps\ncross-sectional area were fairly minimal at the lower regions. The lower regions primarily consisted of the\nmedial head. The authors speculated the minimal hypertrophy\nin this distal region was because the medial head is comprised of fewer fast-twitch fibers. Let us now evaluate if the research provides\nus with details on the role of each triceps head during elbow extension, as well as elbow\nextension actions at various shoulder angles. Remember, the long head crosses the shoulder\njoint. Therefore, it's reasonable to assume that\nmanipulating shoulder angle may change the contribution of each triceps head to elbow\nextension. During elbow extension, all the way back in\n1867, a researcher by the name of Duchenne suggested the medial and lateral head produce\nsimilar force, while the long head contributed less. Since then, as you'd imagine, a lot more research\nhas been published on the role of each triceps head during elbow extension. Unfortunately, the research is completely\nconflicting. Some papers agree with Duchenne, while others\ncompletely conflict. Moreover, a few papers also indicate all three\nheads produce the same relative force during elbow extension. So, unfortunately, the research is far from\nclear on the contribution of each triceps head to elbow extension. As for the impact of shoulder angle on the\ncontribution of each triceps head to elbow extension, a study by Kholinne et al. examined\nthis. They found when performing elbow extension\nat 0 degrees of shoulder flexion, the medial and lateral head produce equal but less force\nthan the long head. During elbow extension at 90 degrees of shoulder\nflexion, the lateral and long head produced equal but less force than the medial head. During elbow extension at 180 degrees of shoulder\nflexion, the medial head produced more force than the lateral head. The lateral head also produced more force\nthan the long head. However, a study by Davidson et al. found\nthat the three triceps heads were all similarly relatively activated during elbow extension\nat 0 degrees and 180 degrees of shoulder flexion. In total, the research, unfortunately, cannot\nprovide us with strong evidence about the role of each triceps head during elbow extension,\nas well as during elbow extension at various shoulder angles. Now, there is evidence different individuals\ndisplay different activation and activation patterns of the triceps during the same tasks. These individual differences, to some degree,\nmay explain the overall conflicting evidence. Other factors such as differences in equipment\nand methodology may also go some way to explaining the discrepancies. Nonetheless, despite the research being unable\nto inform us of the contribution of each triceps head to various movements, there is other\nresearch, mainly long-term research, that can provide us with solid information on how\nwe may maximize triceps hypertrophy. Firstly, how effective are compound exercises\nfor triceps development? Compound exercises involve motion at two joints\nor more, resulting in multiple muscles being trained. Generally, there are two types of compound\nexercises that target the triceps: horizontal presses and vertical presses. Horizontal presses include exercises like\nthe bench press, push-ups, and a machine chest press. Vertical presses include exercises like the\noverhead press, handstand push-ups, and machine shoulder press. Exploring horizontal presses first, an interesting\nstudy by Brandao et al. assessed how effective the bench press is at inducing triceps hypertrophy. A group of untrained men trained the barbell\nbench press with a 2x-shoulder-width grip. They performed 3 to 5 sets to failure with\nan 80% one-rep max load and 3 minutes of rest between sets, twice per week for 10 weeks. They experienced pretty good growth of the\nlateral head, fairly decent growth of the medial head, but very little growth of the\nlong head. By the way, for all three muscles, cross-sectional\narea measurements were taken at 50-60% of the upper arm length. Therefore, it appears horizontal presses,\nlike the bench press, maybe particularly poor at developing the long head. Adding further support to this, Wakahara et\nal. found that during a dumbbell bench press performed with a neutral hand position, activation\nof the long head, measured by T2 weighted imaging, was less than that of the medial\nand lateral heads. Biomechanically, the finding that the long\nhead is poorly trained with horizontal presses makes sense. Remember, as the long head crosses the shoulder\njoint, it is actively involved in shoulder extension. During the lowering phase of horizontal pressing\nexercises, where shoulder extension occurs, the long head shortens. As a result, it cannot actively contract and\ncontribute to force production in the lifting phase of the movement. As for vertical presses, I was unfortunately\nunable to find any long-term studies or reliable activation studies exploring the impact of\nvertical presses on the triceps. That said, as there isn't really any shoulder\nextension during the lowering phase of the movement, the long head is probably going\nto be involved in the elbow extension that occurs during vertical presses. Furthermore, I can't think of any reason as\nto why the lateral and medial head would not be involved to a good degree too. However, I do not say this with 100% confidence\nsimply due to the absence of research. Nevertheless, overall, although compound exercises\nare likely going to produce meaningful triceps hypertrophy, I believe the evidence would\nappear to suggest that to maximize and accelerate triceps hypertrophy, the inclusion of isolation\nexercises would be necessary. Isolation exercises involve motion at one\njoint, resulting in one muscle group being primarily trained. One of the reasons I believe isolation exercises\nmay be necessary is because evidence indicates that within a muscle, there may be subpopulations\nof muscle fibers that have different functional roles. Put differently, there could be different\nregions and groups of muscle fibers in the triceps that are activated more or less during\ndifferent movements. For instance, an extremely interesting study\nby Zuylen et al. identified 3 different subpopulations of muscle fibers within the triceps. One subpopulation of fibers was activated\nduring elbow extension, supination, or pronation of the hand, another subpopulation activated\nduring elbow extension or supination of the hand, not pronation, while the last subpopulation\nactivated during elbow extension only. Now, this study only looked at the activation\nof a few groups of muscle fibers from all three heads during elbow extension, supination,\nor pronation of the hand, as well as various combinations of these movements. Extrapolating from this study, I think it's\nquite possible that within the triceps, there exist different subpopulations of muscle fibers\nthat may be more or less activated during elbow extension at varying shoulder angles. If true, this would indicate that performing\ntriceps exercises with different shoulder angles could be beneficial for stimulating\nthese subpopulations of fibers and therefore ensuring more balanced hypertrophy across\nthe triceps. Furthermore, I think it's possible that during\ndifferent stages of elbow extension, there also exist different subpopulations of muscle\nfibers that may be more or less activated. If true, this would suggest using different\ntriceps exercises that require maximal force production at different stages of elbow extension\ncould be beneficial for stimulating these subpopulations of fibers and therefore ensuring\nmore balanced hypertrophy across the triceps. As an example, triceps pushdowns are most\nchallenging closer to elbow lockout, where the triceps are close to being fully shortened. Conversely, triceps skullcrushers appear\nto be most challenging when the triceps are more stretched. Therefore, these two exercises may stimulate\ndifferent regions of the triceps more so than others, making them complimentary in a training program. If you were to only train your triceps with\ncompound exercises, I think it's highly likely you would be understimulating some subpopulation\nof muscle fibers. For that reason, performing a few isolation\ntriceps exercises on top of your compound exercises would probably be ultimately better\nfor ensuring greater overall triceps development. Furthermore, using a few different isolation\nexercises, rather than only one isolation exercise, is probably favorable. A recent study by Costa et al. demonstrates\nthese concepts nicely. 22 detrained men, who had not trained in the\n6 months before the study, were allocated into a non-varied or varied group. We'll only be focusing on the exercises and\nmeasurements done on the triceps, they did assess other muscles, I'll leave the link\nto the study in the description. Also, I do plan to cover other areas of this\nstudy in future videos. Both groups trained 3 times per week for 8\nweeks. All exercises were trained with 3 sets of\n8-12 reps with 90-120 seconds of rest between sets. The non-varied group, each session, performed\nthe barbell bench press and triceps extension. The varied group, on day 1 of each week, also\nperformed the barbell bench press and triceps extension. But on day 2, they performed the incline bench\npress and cable seated triceps extension, and on day 3, the decline bench press and\ntriceps kickback pulley. Thickness of the overall triceps was measured\nat 50%, 60%, and 70% of the upper arm length. Increases at all regions, particularly the\n60% and 70% regions, appear to favor the varied group. Therefore, this study would seem to suggest\nthat a variety of exercises, including a variety of triceps isolation exercises, enhances overall\ntriceps development. There does exist some additional research\nregarding triceps isolation exercises that may be helpful. Returning to the Brandao et al. study earlier,\nthey also had a group of untrained men perform triceps skull crushers for 3 to 5 sets to\nfailure with an 80% one-rep max load and 3 minutes of rest between sets, twice per week\nfor 10 weeks. Significant increases in cross-sectional area\nfor the medial and long head were experienced. But interestingly, there was hardly any growth\nof the lateral head. For all these muscles, cross-sectional area\nwas measured at 50 to 60% of the upper arm length. Another study by Wakahara et al. supports\nthese results. They found during dumbbell tricep skull crushers,\nactivation of the lateral head, measured by T2 weighted imaging, was lower than medial\nand long head activation. Unfortunately, I was unable to find any reliable\nevidence explaining why the lateral head may not be stimulated during triceps skull crushers. Anyway, remember earlier we mentioned the\nBrandao et al. study demonstrates the barbell bench press produces pretty good lateral head\ngrowth. Something I haven't mentioned yet is the Brandao\net al. study also had two other groups that trained both the barbell bench press and triceps\nskullcrushers. One of these groups, in each session, performed\nthe barbell bench press first followed by the triceps skullcrushers. Whereas the other group, in each session,\nperformed the triceps skull crusher first followed by the barbell bench press. As a note, both groups trained each exercise\nfor 3 to 5 sets to failure with an 80% one-rep max load and 3 minutes of rest between sets,\ntwice per week for 10 weeks. Both groups experienced significant cross-sectional\nincreases for all three heads. This study nicely demonstrates how the addition\nof isolation exercises can be beneficial for overall triceps development. However, all measurements were only taken\nat 50-60% of the upper arm length. As discussed and demonstrated by the Costa\net al. study, it's likely a good idea to perform a variety of triceps isolation exercises to\nensure more balanced growth across the triceps. The final study I came across exploring triceps\nisolation exercises compared cable overhead extensions to cable pushdowns for long head\nhypertrophy. 9 untrained women had one arm assigned to\ntrain cable overhead extensions and their other arm assigned to train cable pushdowns. The cable pushdowns started with the elbow\nat 90\u00b0 and ended at 170\u00b0. The cable overhead extensions started at 30\u00b0\nand ended at 110\u00b0 of the elbow. They trained each exercise for 6 sets of 6\nreps to failure with 2 minutes of rest between sets, twice per week for 6 weeks. Increases in long head thickness, measured\nat 50% and 60% of the upper arm length, were statistically similar between both conditions. However, the results appear to do seem to\nfavor the arm that trained with cable overhead extensions. There were only 9 subjects. Overhead extensions could produce more long\nhead growth, but this study was just underpowered. But at this same time, the percentages supporting\nthe overhead extensions could simply be a result of random variation. If the long head is best trained with overhead\nelbow extension exercises, this would indeed match conventional bodybuilding wisdom. However, I think more research would be needed\nto confirm this. Wrapping up the conversation on exercise selection,\nas a general rule of thumb, performing 2-3 isolation tricep exercises (like what was\nused in the Costa et al. study) in addition to your compound exercises is probably a sensible\nway to ensure sufficient overall triceps development. As discussed, performing exercises that involve\nelbow extension at varying shoulder angles could be beneficial. For instance, you may include an overhead\nextension, triceps skull crusher, and press down in your program. Performing a variety of exercises will typically\nresult in you having a variety of triceps exercises that involve maximal forces at different\ndegrees of elbow extension. As we mentioned earlier, this is may be beneficial,\nas exercises that involve maximal forces at different stages of elbow extension could\ntarget some regions of the triceps more than others. Moving on, should you be training the triceps\nwith higher or lower volumes? Volume here refers to the number of weekly\nsets you perform for the triceps. Also, in the following research, each set\nhad subjects perform their repetitions to or very close to failure. With the research on volume, it's important\nto distinguish between studies that used short or long rest intervals between sets. This is because as discussed in our complete\nguide to rest intervals, the research indicates with the same number of sets performed, longer\nrest intervals (around 2.5-3 minutes) produces greater hypertrophy than shorter durations,\nat least with compound exercises. However, it seems that performing more sets\nwith shorter rest intervals can produce similar hypertrophy to fewer sets with longer rest\nintervals. Therefore, it makes to analyze studies that\nused shorter rest intervals and longer rest intervals separately. Overall, when using shorter rest intervals,\nmore weekly sets for the triceps appear to be better. Schoenfeld et al. found that when trained\nsubjects used 90 seconds of rest between sets, performing 30 weekly sets for the triceps\nwas superior to performing 18 weekly sets and 6 weekly sets. I should mention all of these sets were from\ncompound exercises only, half of the sets for each group were from the bench press and\nthe other half from the overhead press. Also, each group distributed their sets across\n3 days each week and training lasted 8 weeks. Brigatto et al. similarly found that when\ntrained subjects used 60 seconds of rest between sets, performing 32 weekly sets for the triceps\nwas superior to 24 weekly sets or 16 weekly sets. For each group, half of their sets were from\ncompound exercises while the other half were from isolation exercises. Each group distributed their sets across 2\ndays each week and training lasted 8 weeks. Lastly, Radaelli et al. found that when subjects\nwith previous calisthenics experience used 90-120 seconds of rest between sets, performing\n45 weekly sets for the triceps was superior to 27 weekly sets or 9 weekly sets. For each group 2/3 of their sets were from\ncompound exercises, while 1/3 were from isolation exercises. Each group distributed their sets across 3\ndays each week and training lasted 6 months. So overall, when using shorter rest intervals,\nbetween 30-45 weekly sets for the triceps appears to be superior to fewer sets. Now, 30-45 weekly sets with short rest intervals\nis a substantial amount of work. I question how sustainable this kind of work\ncan be in the long term. The Schoenfeld and Brigatto studies only lasted\n8 weeks, but the Radaelli study did last 6 months. I think it'd be useful to see more studies\nlike the Radaelli study to determine if this kind of work is truly sustainable long term. Nevertheless, the best advice I can give is\nthat if you prefer to use shorter rest intervals, try out this kind of volume and figure out\nhow well it may work for you. If you feel your recovery and performance\nbegin to decline, adding in occasional training blocks where you utilize lower weekly sets\nfor recovery may be a useful strategy. Another important consideration is all of\nthese studies were conducted on trained individuals. The Schoenfeld and Brigatto studies had subjects\nwith at least 1 year of training experience, while the Radaelli study had subjects with\nprevious calisthenics training experience, though they did not state the duration of\ntheir experience. Trained individuals experience blunted anabolic\nresponses to training, less muscle damage, and faster recovery of performance. This all indicates trained individuals would\nbenefit from higher weekly sets versus untrained individuals. Therefore, I think it's highly likely untrained\nindividuals would experience sufficient triceps growth using fewer than 30-45 weekly sets\nwith shorter rest intervals. Perhaps 15-20 may be sufficient. Hopefully future research can confirm this. Moving on to longer rest intervals, Ostrowski\net al. found that when trained subjects rested for 3 minutes between sets, there was no difference\nbetween performing 14 weekly sets for the triceps or 28 weekly sets, but both were more\neffective than performing 7 weekly sets. For each group, half of their sets came from\ncompound exercises while the other half were from isolation exercises. Also, each group distributed their sets over\n2 days each week and training lasted 10 weeks. Therefore, it seems with longer rest intervals,\n14 weekly sets for the triceps may be sufficient, performing more seems to provide no further\nbenefit. However, there is a potential limitation with\nthis study. Subjects distributed their weekly sets across\n2 days a week. The 28 weekly set group were performing 16\nsets in one session and 12 sets in their second session each week. This is quite a bit of volume in each training\nsession. Theoretically, there may be a limit to the\nnumber of effective sets you can perform per session. Two of the short rest interval studies we\nassessed a moment ago, finding more hypertrophy with more sets, had subjects distribute their\nvolume across 3 days each week. Therefore, with the Ostrowski study, the 28\nweekly set group could have experienced more hypertrophy if subjects trained three or more\ndays each week. But this is speculative. As far as I'm aware, this is the only paper\nto have assessed the impacts of weekly sets on triceps hypertrophy with longer rest intervals. Now, the research using short rest intervals\nindicates up to 30-45 weekly sets for the triceps is superior. When using longer rest intervals, it would\nmake sense that fewer weekly sets should be sufficient for hypertrophy. As mentioned, with the same number of sets,\nlonger rest intervals produce more hypertrophy. So in essence, using longer rest intervals\nmakes each set more effective. As a result, generally, I think performing\nanywhere from 14 to 28 weekly sets may be fine if you're using long rest intervals. For people with numerous years of training\nexperience, weekly sets on the higher end may be beneficial. Untrained individuals would probably experience\na sufficient stimulus towards the lower end. As some of you probably noticed, in all of\nthe mentioned studies, we treated compound exercises and isolation exercises equally. That is, one set on the bench press was counted\nas one set for the triceps, and one set of an isolation tricep exercise was also counted\nas one set for the triceps. However, some individuals consider one set\nof compound exercises, like the bench press, to only contribute to maybe 0.5 sets for the\ntriceps. This assumes that compound exercises are slightly\nless stimulatory than isolation exercises for certain muscles. But, as we detailed in the exercise selection\nportion of the video, if you combine a few triceps isolation exercises with your compound\nexercises, as is recommended, all of your exercises are not going to be identical stimuli\nfor the triceps. In essence, each exercise, regardless of if\nit's compound or isolation, serves a slightly different purpose for overall triceps hypertrophy. Therefore, much of your weekly sets for the\ntriceps are not identical stimuli. Given this, I think it's much simpler to just\naccept this but continue to count each set of an exercise that trains the triceps, regardless\nof whether it's compound or isolation, as one set. As they did in the research we assessed. Now, let us explore if you should be training\nyour triceps with a low frequency or high frequency. In this case, frequency refers to the number\nof days per week you train your triceps. In other words, it tells us how many days\na week you distribute your weekly triceps sets across. Interestingly, there is some evidence suggesting\nthe triceps may take longer to recover than other muscle groups. Indeed, I have seen some individuals recommend\nthat the triceps be trained less frequently due to this evidence. However, the details are important. The evidence I'm referring to is a study by\nChen et al. They had 9 untrained men perform a training\nsession in which they trained a variety of muscle groups, including the triceps, with\na variety of eccentric contractions. The triceps exercise is on screen. For each exercise, they performed 5 sets of\n10 eccentric reps. Meaning they only performed the lowering phase\nof each exercise, not the concentric lifting phase. Eccentric contractions are more damaging and\nrequire longer recovery durations than concentric contractions. So overall, this training session was pretty\ntaxing. The maximal force they could produce with\neach muscle group and the degree of muscle soreness was measured 2 days before the training\nsession, immediately before the session, immediately after the session, and 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 days\nafter the session. The triceps experienced greater decreases\nin force production and more soreness compared to quite a few other muscle groups. Therefore, this study indicates that when\nyou first begin training, the triceps may take longer to recover compared to many other\nmuscle groups. Despite this, it's very important to understand\nthe body does produce a range of adaptations following training sessions that result in\nyou experiencing less muscle damage and faster recovery. In the research, this is called the repeated\nbout effect. The Chen et al. study, 2 weeks after the initial\ntraining session, had the subjects perform the exact same training protocol again. This time around, all muscle groups experienced\nless decrease in force production and muscle soreness in the following days after the session. Now, the triceps still experienced greater\nforce loss and soreness compared to some other muscle groups. But, it's very likely that if you train the\ntriceps consistently for a few weeks, the body will produce a range of adaptations that\nsignificantly speed up the recovery process. A study by Akgai et al. demonstrates this. They assigned 23 untrained men into a training\nor control group. The control group did nothing. The training group trained dumbbell triceps\nskull crushers for 5 sets of 8 reps with an 80% one-rep max load with 90 seconds of rest\nbetween sets, 3 times per week for 6 weeks. Before and after the study, the shear modulus\nof the triceps was measured for both groups. Shear modulus measures the hardness of a muscle. In essence, the harder the muscle, the more\nmuscle damage probably present. After the study, there was no difference between\nthe training group and the control group in the shear modulus of the triceps. Moreover, there was no difference in shear\nmodulus between the before and after measurements for both groups. Therefore, it seems the training group was\nnot experiencing any damage to the triceps by week 6. The same research group had previously found\nthat one day after performing triceps skull crushers there was an increase in the shear\nmodulus of the triceps, suggesting muscle damage. All this information nicely demonstrates the\nrepeated bout effect. Although initially, the triceps may take longer\nto recover compared to other muscle groups, over time, thanks to the adaptations produced\nby the body, this would not matter. The triceps will likely have the ability to\nrecover significantly faster. This same information very likely applies\nto any other muscle group too. I say all this to say that the triceps can\nlikely ultimately be trained with higher frequencies without recovery being an issue. Having that said, let us now actually evaluate\nthe long-term research exploring the triceps response to lower and higher frequencies. Brigatto et al. found that in men with an\naverage of 4 and a half years of training experience performing 16 weekly sets for the\ntriceps, there was no difference in triceps growth between training once per week or twice\nper week. As a note, half of their weekly sets were\nfrom compound exercises, and the other half from isolation exercises. They rested 2 minutes between sets. Somewhat similarly, Saric et al. found in\nmen with at least 6 months of training experience performing 12 weekly sets for the triceps,\nthere was no difference in triceps growth between training three times per week or 6\ntimes per week. All 12 sets were from isolation exercises. They rested 60-90 seconds between sets. Collectively, these two studies suggest that\nthe number of times you train the triceps per week is irrelevant for hypertrophy. However, there are studies that oppose this. Lasevicius et al. found in men with an average\nof 3 years of training experience performing 24 weekly sets for the triceps, triceps growth\nfavored training twice per week versus three times per week. Half of their weekly sets were from compound\nexercises and the other half from isolation exercises. They rested 90 seconds between sets. Contrastingly, Schoenfeld et al. found that\nwhen men with an average of 4 and a half years of training experience performed 15 weekly\nsets for the triceps, training three times per week was superior to training twice per\nweek. 9 weekly sets from compound exercises and\nthe remaining 6 from isolation exercises. They used 60-90 second rest intervals between\nsets. Another study by Zaroni et al. found that\nin men with an average of 6 and a half years of training experience performing 30 weekly\nsets for the triceps, distributing this volume over 5 days a week was superior to training\ntwice per week. Half of their weekly sets were from compound\nexercises and the other half from isolation exercises. They rested 60 seconds between sets. Combining the overall evidence, it's completely\nunclear what training frequency may be optimal for triceps growth. Ultimately, more research is needed here. Also, all of these studies used short rest\nintervals. I'm not aware of any research using long rest\nintervals that evaluated the impacts of different training frequencies on triceps growth. Now, part of conflicting evidence may just\nbe down to individual differences. Training variables like training frequency\nas well as volume may be quite individualized. That is to say, different individuals may\nrespond best to different training frequencies and volumes. A paper by Damas et al. nicely demonstrates\nthis. They had 19 untrained men train one of their\nlegs with a high frequency and volume protocol and their other leg with a low frequency and\nvolume protocol. The high frequency and volume leg trained\nthe unilateral leg extension for 3 sets of 9-12 to failure 5 times per week. The low frequency and volume leg also trained\nthe unilateral leg extension for 3 sets of 9-12 to failure each session, but they trained\ntwo or three times per week. As each subject trained both protocols, one\nleg performed one protocol and their other leg the other protocol, we can determine whether\nan individual is more responsive to a particular protocol. For increases in vastus lateralis cross-sectional\narea increases, 6 subjects experienced the greatest increases with the high frequency\nand volume protocol, 7 subjects experienced the greatest increases with the low frequency\nand volume protocol, while the remaining 6 subjects responded similarly to both protocols. As we can see, different individuals may respond\nbetter to different frequencies and volumes. Therefore, in the long term, you may wish\nto experiment with various training frequencies or volumes and figure out if there is any\ndiscernable difference between them for you. The last section of this video that I thought\nwould be an interesting addition is whether aiming to induce hypoxia with your triceps\nexercises could enhance triceps hypertrophy. In our scenario, hypoxia refers to using some\nmethod of depriving the muscle of oxygen. If this makes little sense to you, don't worry,\nit will make more sense to you as we look at the research. A study by Goto et al. was the paper that\ninspired me to add this section. 44 men with at least 1 year of training experience\nwere assigned to a partial range of motion or full range of motion group. Both groups trained the triceps skull crusher\nfor 3 sets of 8 reps, three times per week for 8 weeks. The full range of motion group began with\ntheir elbows in full extension, lowering the weight to their maximal elbow flexion angle\nand then extending back to full extension. The partial range of motion group began with\ntheir elbows flexed to 45 degrees, lowering the weight to 90 degrees of elbow flexion,\nand then extending back to 45 degrees of elbow flexion. This technique would have induced significantly\nmore hypoxia than the full range of motion group, as the constant contractions would\nlikely compress capillaries resulting in restricted blood flow to the triceps. Increases in triceps cross-sectional area,\nmeasured at 60% of the upper arm length, was significantly greater for the partial range\nof motion group. For the partial range of motion group, the\nresearchers also measured the degree of hypoxia experienced by the subjects after performing\nthe partial range of motion skull crushers. Something extremely interesting was that the\nresearchers found a correlation between the degree of hypoxia experienced by subjects\nand their increase in triceps cross-sectional area. Put differently, the subjects in the partial\nrange of motion group that experienced the highest degree of hypoxia also experienced\nthe greatest increases in triceps cross-sectional area. Another study by Fink et al. also somewhat\nagrees with this study. 16 untrained men were split into a drop set\nor normal set group. Both groups trained the triceps pushdown,\ntwice per week for 8 weeks. The normal set group performed three sets\nto failure with a 12 rep-max load and 90 seconds of rest between sets. The drop set group performed a single set\nto failure with a 12 rep-max load, immediately decreasing the load by 20% each time failure\nwas reached 3 times in a row. Due to the numerous continuous contractions,\nit's likely the drop set group would have been experiencing greater hypoxia than the\nnormal set group. Increases in triceps cross-sectional area,\nmeasured at 60% of the upper arm length, favor the drop set group. At the time of recording, I believe this is\nthe only study finding drop set training produces greater hypertrophy than normal sets. All of the other studies, which were conducted\non either the biceps or quadriceps, found no difference between the two. This raises an interesting question: could\nthere be something special about the triceps that makes them more responsive to hypoxia? Unfortunately, I'm unaware of any evidence\nthat can support this claim. Additionally, there are other lines of evidence\nthat indicate hypoxia does not augment triceps growth. Tanimoto et al. had subjects train 8 weeks\nwith either the normal chest press or the chest press without locking out their elbows,\nwhich likely would have produced greater triceps hypoxia than normal chest press reps. However, both exercises produced similar increases\nin triceps thickness. Furthermore, two papers indicate adding blood\nflow restriction bands to the upper arms during the bench press, which would likely produce\ngreater hypoxia than non-blood flow restriction training, produced similar increases in triceps\ncross-sectional area compared to normal bench press training without blood flow restriction. So overall, it's not clear if partial range\nof motion skull crushers or drop set training formats truly produce greater triceps hypertrophy. More research is needed. Although, I don't see any real downside to\nincluding some drop set training or partial range of motion constant tension training\nfor the triceps. So I think it may be perfectly fine to do\nso. We've gone through a lot of information and\nresearch on how one could go about maximizing triceps hypertrophy, let us summarize the\nkey points. 1) Performing 2-3 triceps isolation exercises\non top of your compound exercises should not only ensure each triceps head is trained sufficiently\nbut different regions within each triceps head are also sufficiently targeted. 2) As for rep ranges, the research suggests\nthat provided you perform your repetitions to or very close to failure, reps between\n5 and 35 should produce similar triceps hypertrophy. 3) With regards to volume, if you use shorter\nrests between sets (around 2 minutes less), 30-45 weekly sets seem to produce greater\ntriceps growth than fewer sets. But I question how sustainable this kind of\nwork can be long term, maybe adding in training blocks with lower weekly sets may be necessary\nhere. Now, this recommendation is derived from research\non trained individuals, untrained individuals can likely achieve sufficient adaptations\nwith fewer weekly sets. If you use longer rest rests between sets\n(3 minutes or more), there isn't a good deal of research. As a broad recommendation, anywhere from 14\nto 28 weekly sets may work well. Untrained individuals may experience optimal\nadaptations on the lower end, whereas more trained individuals may benefit from the higher\nend. 4) Regarding training frequency, the research\nis completely conflicting. Some studies indicate no difference between\nvarious frequencies, others suggest a benefit to higher frequencies and even one indicates\na benefit to lower frequencies. In part, individual differences could explain\nthe conflicting evidence. Some individuals may respond best to certain\nfrequencies. So you may wish to individually experiment\nor simply chose a frequency that fits your schedule. Bear in mind, individual differences apply\nto the discussion on volume as well. So you may wish to individually experiment\nwith lower or higher volumes or simply go with whatever fits your schedule. 5) Finally, you could perform one of your\nisolation triceps exercises with a constant tension technique, or with drop sets, as some\nevidence indicates this enhances triceps hypertrophy. Though there is research somewhat opposing\nthis, so it's perfectly fine to not do this."

    "published_at": "2024-10-21T14:00:01Z",
    "transcript": "[Music] welcome to the house of hypertrophy does this text from the early 2000s reveal the truth about forearm growth it says and quite controversially might I add the forearms are involved in all exercises where you must grasp a bar with the hands there is no need for direct forarm work it's been said that I have the best forarms in the business and I never did any direct forarm work who said this none other than Mike mener there's no doubt people before and after him share this opinion but would you say it's correct undeniably the forearms receive a stimulus from multiple exercises already in most programs and will grow from this but it's likely to truly maximize and accelerate your forearm gains direct forearm training is needed why the literature indicates achieving High muscle fiber Recruitment and tension is required to optimize growth this is done by ensuring the forearms are the limiting factor and we're training the exercise hard enough to get to or close to failure direct forarm training achieves this with other exercises your forearms aren't typically the limiting factor if they are you're likely compromising the stimulus to the muscles these exercises typically aimed to develop so feel free to use straps if needed so what are the best ways to train the forearms we've ranked what may be the best Forum exercises by extrapolating from the current scientific literature before diving in some might be questioning me disagreeing with Mena but remember Mena is just one person with aite genetic ICS and although he seemingly went without direct Forum training as Arnold mentions in his book other individuals with impressive forarms such as Dave Draper and Chuck cypes did a lot of forearm training let's dive in I very quickly need to mention that we have a previous video on the forearms but this will be a shorter video that condenses the key details with rankings I'll actually mention an exercise and details that I didn't before I've actually changed my mind on something so there are 20 muscles belonging to the forearm that can be divided into the anterior and posterior compartments of the forearm the anterior compartment is larger and rist Coes effectively train most of this compartment making them likely an essential movement to maximize forarm size there are many risk variations but starting with normal standing wrist Coes we can see the wrist moves from a neutral to flex position while fingers remain flexed on the bar is this good or bad well a decent chunk of evidence suggests that compared to training muscles at shorter muscle lengths training at longer muscle lengths builds more muscle some might be wondering wasn't there a recent study funded by Jeff nippard suggesting longer muscle length does not build more muscle in trained individuals we've dissected the study recently but the key is this study compared to half reps while the muscle is at a longer length to a 4in motion both still reach the same maximum long muscle lengths and when looking at other research it's still possible that compared to exercises that predominantly move through short muscle lengths moving through longer lengths still builds more muscle we'll be sure to update you with future research but for now it seems worthwhile to factor into our analysis okay all these flex and muscles are going to be at longer length when the wrist is in an extended position a position which normal standing rist HS do not reach additionally two of the flexor muscles the flexor digitorum superficialis and profundus can also Flex the fingers so for them we must factor in both wrist and finger positions to know their length they're going to be at longer lengths when the fingers are extended so since the fingers remain flexed on the load they're at fairly shorter lengths therefore normal standing wrist Coes train the flex and muscles at shorter lengths I don't want to make it seem like this is terrible because we still do see measurable hypertrophy with shorter length training it's just possibly not optimal we'll place them into C tier we can modify this exercise to potentially make it better by using fat grip attachments these increase the diameter of the bar and place our fingers into a relatively more extended position this will result in the flexor digitorum superficialis and profundus being at somewhat longer lengths but since our wrist remains traveling from neutral to flexed it likely won't affect the stimulus to the other flexed muscles anyhow this this partial Improvement means I'll place them into B tier alternatively instead of using fat grips you could just allow your fingers to extend during the lowering portion as the load rolls down and then Flex during the lifting of the weight this similarly results in the flex of Digit arm superficialis and profundus reaching longer lengths again with no real effect on the other Flex muscles there are some differences between the fat grips and finger motion variations such as how the finger motion variation attains great to finger extension but using fat grips allows the fingers to stay at that relatively more extended position throughout the full movement there are technical Arguments for either side but I currently believe it's unclear which could be superior based on the current literature so I've chosen to place both in the same tier Risco can be performed with a forearm horizontally across a surface this variation successfully reaches an extended wrist position and thereby lengthens all the flexing muscles well I'll place them in into a tier these can also be modified to possibly be even better using fat grips to place our fingers into a relatively more extended Position will further lengthen the flexor digitorum superficialis and profundus to near maximum alternatively you can extend your fingers during the lowering portion which likewise further lengthens the flexid digitorum superficialis and profundus to their maximum again there are differences between using fat grips and the finger motion variation but since it's not clear what could be superior I've chosen to place both into s tier with these wrist Coes that have your arm horizontal across the surface it's possible to use a slightly inclined surface how does this change things most dumbbell and barbell exercises are most challenging when the segment we're moving is parallel to the floor when wrist curling on a flat surface this happens when the wrist is approximately neutral while when wrist curling on an incline surface this happens at a relatively more extended position where some may hypothesize makes it better for hypertrophy yet I am skeptical that the difference if any exists would be that large and I would like to see future research on this for now I just consider these two inclined variations as belonging into s tier if you like you could think of these as possibly High tier and the others as possibly low tier but do so with [Music] caution the posterior compartment of the forearm is smaller but it's likely still worth training to truly maximize form size many of these muscles are highly involved during wrist extension the extensive muscles are going to be at longer lengths when the wrist is flexed normal standing wrist extensions move from neutral to Extended positions so train the muscles at moderate to Shorter lengths again this isn't terrible it will certainly build muscle but it may just not be the best I'll place it into a tier wrist extensions with the arm horizontally across a surface reach a flex position so we'll place these into s tier an inclin surface can be used which similar to the discussion with wrist Coes places Peak tension at a relatively more lengthened position but as I would like to see more data I'll place them alongside the other variation in s TI with all these wrist extensions in this case the fingers being flexed around the bar is perfectly fine some of the extensive muscles are at longer lengths with finger flexion if you apply fat grips you would partially shorten them which may not be [Music] favorable the bracher radialis is a fairly large for our muscle it's part of the posterior compartment but isn't involved in wrist extension rather it's highly involved in elbow flexion this happens in all horizontal pools vertical pools and coals this section will focus on coals it's widely thought in instead of a supered grip using a neutral or pronated grip on coals results in Greater Brach your radialis activation quite surprisingly however multiple studies fail to find this and instead find similar activation or even slightly better activation with a supered grip I would like to see a study directly assessing Brach your radialis growth after training with different grips but for now I can't conclude that a certain grip position is better as for whether a specific exercise could be Superior there's this fascinating abstract that was presented at a conference recently it compared incline to preacher Co and notes that Brach your radialis hypertrophy was better with the preacher curl that's not to say incline curls were bad the difference between the two exercises seem to have only been significantly different at the 60% region so clearly incline curls produced very measurable gains it's not clear why the preacher Cur was better and once this study is officially published in full text I'll likely have a video on it but it's plausible it's because preacher Coes are harder at earlier elbow flexion ankles where the break your radialis is at a longer length if true cable Co set up to provide Peak tension at earlier elbow flexion angles may also join preacher Coes in s tier while other curling exercises that are harder at later elbow flexion angles like normal curls may join incline curls in a tier for the break your radialis some of you may be wondering about other exercises such as wrist rollers and rice bucket training I've decided not to detail them here I've described why and my thoughts on them in the pinned Comon as for static holds farmer walks hangs and grippers these train finger flexion and will train the muscles that are involved in this however we know these muscles are already highly trained with wrist HS therefore I don't consider them essential but we have analyzed and ranked the different ways to train finger reflection in our more thorough free forearm guide video likewise pronation superation training and Radial nner deviation training are probably not essential since many muscles involved in these are highly trained with risk holes or extensions again more detailed discussion can be found in our forearm guide video finally in the spirit of scientific accuracy it is essential to make it clear that these rankings are based on extrapolating the research on training other muscles at longer lengths we don't have studies directly measuring forearm hypertrophy yet so please don't consider these

    "transcript": "the barbell bench press is probably the most popular upper body exercise in this exercise the muscles of the chest are considered a prime mover but how good is the bench press at developing the chest could you perform only the barbell bench press for the rest of your training career an experience close to or even maximal chest growth in this video we aim to answer this as best as possible through evaluating the current research first it's useful to establish what we mean by the muscles of the chest and what movements best recruit this musculature from there we can analyze the movements that occur in the barbell bench press with the hope of deciding if this exercise is indeed ideal for engaging the chest muscles that connect the thorax to the shoulder and upper arm are the chest muscles this includes the pectoralis major pectoralis minor subclavius muscle and the serratus anterior we will only be discussing the pectoralis major this muscle covers the large bulk of the chest and all the research we will evaluate has specifically addressed this muscle besides i think when most discuss the chest muscles they are referring to the pectoralis major the pectoralis major as with all muscles in the body creates movement via its attachments to bones when a muscle dynamically contracts the attachments remaining stationary are called the origin while attachments that move are called the insertion the pectoralis major has a range of origins the medial clavicle sternum ribs the cartilage of those ribs and the apnerosis of the external oblique all the muscle fibers of the pectoralis major insert into generally the same location the lateral side of the upper arm so this is the insertion it is common to split up a muscle based on muscle fibers sharing the same origin location with the pectoralis major there is no universal agreement on these divisions some consider the pectoralis major to have three heads a clavicular head consisting of fibers originating from the medial clavicle a sternal head consisting of fibers originating from the sternum and a coastal head consisting of fibers originating from the ribs their costal cartilages and the apnearosis of the external oblique the clavicular head is often called the upper chest the sternal head of the middle chest and the costal head the lower chest however others consider the pectoralis major to have only two heads a clavicular head consisting of fibers originating from the medial clavicle and a sternocostal head consisting of fibers originating from the sternum ribs coastal cartilages and the aponeurosis of the external oblique in further support of this division the clavicular and sternocostal head have distinct nerve supplies remember the reason muscle fibers contract is because they receive signals from nerve cells the clavicular head fibers generally receive signals from the lateral pectoral nerve the sternocostal head generally receives signals from the medial pectoral nerve so what movements engage the pectoralis major during horizontal flexion the pectoralis major and anterior deltoid are heavily involved from around 0 to 10 degrees of horizontal flexion the anterior deltoid has slightly better leverage than the pectoralis major but from 10 degrees up to 140 degrees of horizontal flexion the pectoralis major has the greatest leverage during shoulder flexion the sternal head but substantially more so the clavicular head is involved interestingly at high shoulder flexion angles the costal head seems to play a role in shoulder extension i should note although the clavicular head is going to be involved in shoulder flexion to a good degree the anterior deltoid has the greatest leverage throughout this motion meaning it is probably going to be more activated during shoulder adduction the sterno and costal heads appear to be moderately involved but the latissimus dorsi and teres major are likely activated substantially more during this motion conversely the clavicular head appears to be involved a small amount in shoulder abduction from 40 degrees of shoulder abduction and onwards however the anterior deltoid and especially lateral deltoid are likely activated substantially more during this motion therefore shoulder adduction or shoulder abduction exercises are probably not ideal for the pectoralis major finally the pectoralis major as a whole appears to be highly involved in internal rotation do any of these movements occur during the bench press it turns out all of these movements but shoulder adduction or abduction occur to a good degree in the barbell bench press the degree of horizontal flexion is determined by the grip width used as grip width remains unchanged throughout a barbell bench press so does the degree of horizontal flexion if you perform the exercise with your wrist elbows and shoulders aligned before the descent phase 90 degrees of horizontal flexion is used some research indicates the pectoralis major has its greatest leverage at roughly 40 to 50 degrees of horizontal flexion roughly this probably equals anywhere from a 1.5 times to a two-time shoulder-width grip for most people theoretically this grip width may be optimal for pectoralis major development viewing the barbell bench press from the side a correct descent results in the somewhat diagonal line once the barbell is at its lowest position the distance between your shoulders and the barbell indicates how much shoulder flexion must occur during the ascent phase the longer this distance the more shoulder flexion required as a note descending the barbell to the mid-chest of lower chest region works well for most remember the anterior adulthood has greater leverage throughout shoulder flexion than the pectoralis major so for pectoralis major development we would not be aiming to maximize the degree of shoulder flexion when initiating the ascent phase of the barbell bench press aiming to flare your elbows out is likely advantageous this will likely allow the pectoralis major to produce more force through a more efficient pull on the upper arm also the triceps produce the lateral force in the barbell bench press flaring your elbows allows greater lateral force and therefore a stronger triceps contraction for most flaring your elbows will naturally cause internal rotation so the main functions of the pectoras major indeed seem to occur to some capacity in the barbell bench press indicating the bench press may be an excellent movement for developing this muscle let us now evaluate research assessing just how well the barbell benefits does at growing the pectoralis major starting things off a study by akagi and colleagues 18 men with at least one year of training experience had their smith machine bench press one rep max measured as well as the cross-sectional area of their pectoralis major at multiple regions the largest cross-sectional area value obtained for an individual was used for analysis a significant correlation was found between smith machine bench press warner at max and pectoralis major cross-sectional area now this study used a smith machine but generally the stronger you are on the barbell bench press the stronger you would probably be on the smith machine bench press therefore this study implies the stronger you get on the barbell bench press the greater hypertrophy the pectoralis major would experience however this was only a correlation study it fails to tell us if training the bench press as your only chest exercise would be sufficient to linearly increase pectoralis major size also this study does not inform us of how well the bench press develops different regions of the pectoralis major fortunately we have research that can help us here brandow and colleagues had a group of untrained men trained the barbell bench press for three to five sets to failure which is the point at which no more repetitions can be performed with an eighty percent water and maximum load and three minutes of rest between sets twice per week for ten weeks a two time shoulder width grip was used the cross-sectional area of the pectoralis major measured at the t3 t4 thoracic region increased by 9.1 percent on average and 9.1 percent increase in cross-sectional area after 10 weeks of training corresponds to an average of 0.13 increase per day is this a lot or hardly anything a review study by worm bomb and colleagues can help us here through assessing numerous studies they measured the average increase in cross-sectional area per day for the quadriceps and elbow flexor muscles after a period of training based on these numerous studies the quadriceps on average experienced a 0.11 percent increase in cross-sectional area per day when trained with roughly six sets per session three times per week the elbow flexors on average experience a 0.2 increase in cross-sectional area per day when trained with roughly five sets per session three times per week also these numbers are average from studies that mainly involved untrained subjects so the barbell bench press in the brandow and colleague study did not do a terrible job the 0.13 increase in pectoralis major cross-sectional area per day was above the 0.11 percent increase for the quadriceps but below the 0.2 increase for the elbow flexors interestingly one bomb and colleague suggested the reason that elbow flexors experience a greater rate of hypertrophy versus the quadriceps was because the quadriceps are generally involved more in day-to-day tasks meaning they are somewhat trained thereby slightly limiting its capacity to grow further the pectoralis major is probably more similar to the elbow flexors in that they aren't as heavily used day to day compared to the quadriceps considering this one could argue that brandow and colleague's results were sub-optimal given the 0.13 increase in pectoralis major cross-sectional area was it less than the 0.2 increase in elbow flexor cross-sectional area but it's important to note that 0.2 increase in elbow flexor cross-sectional area per day was from studies that averaged five sets per session three times per week the brandau and colleague study averaged only four sets on the bench press twice per week these differences somewhat limit our ability to compare the numbers fairly nonetheless let's move on to other research yasuda and colleagues had a group of untrained men performing the barbell bench press for three sets of ten reps with a seventy five percent one rep max load and three minutes of rest between sets three times per week for six weeks grip width was not specified bench press warner at max was retested on the third week enabling the readjustment of training load cross-sectional area at the belly of the pectoralis major had increased by 17.6 on average corresponding to a 0.42 increase in cross-sectional area per day slightly more than double the 0.2 elbow flexor increase therefore this study suggests the barbell bench press is an excellent exercise for the pectoralis major ogre saguaro and colleagues has seven untrained men training the barbell bench press for three sets of 10 reps with a 75 percent warner max load and 2 to 3 minutes of rest between sets three times per week for 24 weeks a two time shoulder width grip was used bench press warner at max was measured every three weeks allowing the readjustment of training load thickness of the pectoralis major was measured at the third and fourth costal cartilages every week throughout the 24 weeks increases in thickness and bench press warner at max steadily increased throughout the 24 weeks we can see that as one red max increased on the bench press so did pectoralis major thickness by the 24th week the subjects had experienced an average 43 increase in pectoralis major thickness corresponding to a 0.26 increase in thickness per day like the yasuda and colleague study this is above the average elbow flexor increase however thickness and cross-sectional area are not the same measurements so this comparison might not be sensible here even so most would probably agree this study implies the bench press is quite effective for pectoralis major growth so brandau and colleagues suggest the bench press is fairly decent at growing the pectoralis major while yesuda and colleagues and ogre sawara and colleagues indicate that bench press may be excellent at growing the pectoralis major these three studies assessed pectoralis major growth in only one region which was more or less the sternal head what about other regions of the pectoralis major davis and colleagues had a group of trained men and women with an average of five years training experience performing the barbell bench press for four sets of five reps with an 85 percent one-rep max load and five minutes of rest between sets twice per week for eight weeks grip width was not specified bench press warner max was retested every two weeks enabling the re-adjustment of training load thickness of the pectoralis major was measured in three regions between the spaces of ribs 2 and 3 so the upper region between the spaces of ribs 3 and 4 the middle region and between the spaces of ribs 4 and 5 the lower region the upper region can be considered the clavicular head the middle region the sternal head and the lower region the coastal head on average the upper region experienced a 7.44 increase in thickness corresponding to 0.13 per day the middle region experienced a 10.06 percent increase in thickness corresponding to 0.18 per day the lower region experienced a 7.45 increase in thickness corresponding to 0.13 per day all these values are below the zero point two percent elbow flexor increase however this measurement was muscle thickness so again this comparison may not be sensible but probably more importantly the subjects in the davis and colic study had an average of five years training experience the elbow flexor data was from studies mainly involving untrained subjects with this in mind the results of this study seem pretty good comparing increases between regions of the pectoris major there were not really any extreme differences average increases were more or less similar between the upper and lower region though they were both less in comparison to the middle region another study by ogre sawara and colleagues had a group of untrained men perform the barbell bench press for three sets of ten reps with a 75 one rep max load and two to three minutes or rest between sets three times per week for 24 weeks a two time shoulder width grip was used bench press warner at max was retested every three weeks enabling the readjustment of training loads cross-sectional area of the pectoralis major was measured at 25 percent the upper region 50 percent the middle region and 75 the lower region of the pectoralis major length on average the upper region experienced a 36.3 increase in cross-sectional area corresponding to a 0.22 percent increase per day the middle region experienced a 37.3 increase in cross-sectional area also corresponding to roughly a 0.22 increase per day the lower region experienced a 40 increase in cross-sectional area corresponding to a 0.24 increase per day the subjects of this study were untrained the measurement used was also cross-sectional area allowing a more fairer comparison with the elbow flexor increase provided by the wernborn and colic study for all three regions increases per day were slightly greater than the 0.2 elbow flexor increase moreover increases across the three regions were more or less the same suggesting the bench press targets these areas now equally from the research evaluating measures of pectoralis major growth at one region the sternal region for all papers randall and colleagues suggest the bench press is fairly decent while yasuda and colleagues and ogre sawara and colleagues indicate the bench press is excellent davis and colleagues and a different paper by ogre sawara and colleagues further support the idea that bench press may be excellent at growing the sternal head regarding the clavicular and coastal portions davis and colleagues suggest that although the clavicular and coastal heads may experience similar and respectable growth it is slightly less than sternal head growth conversely ogre sawara and colleagues suggest all three regions experience comparable rates of hypertrophy differences between the studies such as the subject's training experience could explain these discrepancies so is the bench press enough for pectoralis major hypertrophy all in all the research does appear to suggest the barbell benchmarks may be close to ideal for developing the sternal region for the clavicular and coastal regions though the research suggests meaningful growth will occur in these regions from bench pressing whether this amount of growth is comparable to the sternal region is a little less clear ogre sawara and colleagues suggest it could be whereas davis and kulik suggest it might not be there are some noteworthy limitations of the current evidence firstly all of the studies evaluated here lasted 24 weeks or less four of these were also conducted on untrained individuals in the longer term it's possible training only the barbell bench press for your pectoralis major could result in trading plateaus altering your training variables which could include more exercise variation could be effective for getting past stagnations in this way other pectoralis major exercises could be useful secondly no study had another group perform the barbell bench press in combination with other pectoralis major exercises for comparison in other words it remains possible that if we had two groups one performing only the barbell bench press and another performing the barbell bench press with other pectoralis major exercises with both groups performing the same number of weekly sets for the pectoralis major to avoid confounding effects of volume the group performing the barbell bench press with other exercises could experience greater overall pectoralis major hypertrophy without research on these two areas i believe we cannot truly conclude if the barbell bench press is enough for pectoralis major hypertrophy from theoretical as well as some experimental evidence there are some exercises that could complement the barbell bench press [Music] one positive thing about the barbell bench press not mentioned yet is it stretches the pectoralis major under load this is noteworthy as when the pectoralis major is stretched research indicates its sarcomeres which are the contractile units of a muscle are stretched sufficiently to produce passive tension this applies to the clavicular sternal and costal heads passive tension from the sarcomeres in combination with the high amounts of force produced by the sarcomeres termed active tension during the lower portion of the bench press means a great deal of overall mechanical tension mechanical tension is currently the best categorized driver of muscle growth in the research however there are exercises that achieve a greater stretch of the pectoralis major than the bench press such as the seated machine chest fly dumbbell flies would also count here however i think a seated chest fly gives you more stability and control over the motion maybe making the exercise safer cable chest fly variations would also work well exercises such as these could complement the barbell bench press by providing stretch mediated hypertrophy the barbell bench press would otherwise not have now flies more so dumbbell flies have a reputation for being injurious if you have any shoulder issues or develop any shoulder issues it's probably safer to avoid this movement [Music] for the clavicular head although the research suggests meaningful growth will occur in this region from bench pressing whether this is comparable to the sternal region is a little less clear anecdotally it's common to hear the upper chest being a problem area for many people in response to this the incline bench press is often recommended the inclined barbell bench press begins with greater shoulder flexion meaning compared to a flat barbell bench press greater degrees of shoulder flexion would occur throughout a full range of motion inclined bench press remember the clavicular head along with the anterior deltoid is heavily involved in shoulder flexion interestingly though electromyography research is conflicting in this area laver and colleagues found similar activation of the clavicular head between a 30 degree and 45 degree incline barbell bench press both of which displayed greater activation than the 0 degree and 15 degree decline barbell bench press throughout the majority of the concentric phase similarly coratella and colleagues found greater clavicular head activation with a 45 degree incline barbell bench press compared to a zero degree and 15 degree decline bench press rodriguez radio and colleagues compared clavicular head activation between a zero degree 15 degree 30 degree 45 degree and 60 degree incline barbell bench press activation was greatest with a 30 degree incline while both 45 degree and 60 degree inclines produced slightly less activation than a zero degree inclined bench press however stefan and armstrong found no difference in clavicular head activation between a 30 degree incline barbell bench press and a 15 degree decline barbell bench press likewise sato bakken and colleagues found similar clavicular head activation between the 25 degree incline zero degree incline and a 25 degree decline barbell bench press electromyography does have noteworthy limitations and so we probably shouldn't get too caught up in this data there is one longitudinal study that may help us here chavez and colleagues split 47 untrained men into one of three groups a flat bench press group an inclined bench press group or a combination of both group all three groups trained once per week for eight weeks the flat bench press group trained the flat smith machine bench press for four sets to failure with an eight to twelve wet max load each session the inclined bench press group also did this but with a 44 degree incline smith machine bench press the combination of both group trained each of those two exercises for two sets to failure with an 8 to 12 rep max load each session increases in sternal and costal thickness were similar between all three groups however increases in clavicular head thickness were greater for the incline bench press group therefore this study suggests that at least four sets per session on the incline smith machine bench press produces the greatest increases in clavicular thickness remember two sets from the combination of both group was not enough now the smith machine was used mechanics between the smith machine and barbell bench press are not identical nevertheless maybe this study indicates a 44 degree incline barbell bench press may provide greater clavicular head growth than a flat barbell bench press ultimately if at some point during your training career you feel your upper chest is underdeveloped you may wish to experiment with the incline barbell bench press at various angles aside from the incline barbell bench press there are other exercises that could potentially be good for the clavicular head such as an incline dumbbell bench press low cable chest fly and a decline push up [Music] like the clavicular head though the research suggests meaningful growth will occur in the coastal head from bench pressing whether this is comparable to the sternal head is a little less clear a decline barbell bench press is often recommended for the lower chest however lever and colleagues and coratella and colleagues found similar custom head activation between a flat barbell bench press and a 15 degree decline barbell bench press sata baking and colleagues also found similar sterno costal head activation between a 25 degree decline barbell bench press and a flat barbell bench press again electromyography has limitations so we should approach these results with caution on top of this we unfortunately do not have any longitudinal research here an exercise that theoretically may be good for developing the coastal head is a dumbbell or barbell pullover recall the coastal head at high angles of shoulder flexion is involved in shoulder extension during the eccentric phase of a pullover the shoulders are flexed to a high angle during the concentric phase shoulder extension occurs this motion may do a good job at recruiting the costal head the barbell pullover has been shown to highly activate the pectoralis major in three studies however these three studies did assess activation at the sternal or clavicular head so he cannot necessarily be certain of the costal head regardless i think most people should be able to feel a large portion of the pectoralis major being trained during a pullover through analyzing the functions of the pectoralis major the motions that occur during the barbell bench press and the longitudinal research the bench press does appear to be an excellent exercise for pectoralis major hypertrophy meaningful growth of the clavicular sternal and coastal heads of the pectoralis major will probably occur through barbell bench pressing but the limitations of the current research limit our ability to truly answer the video's primary question no paper has assessed the impacts on pectoralis major hypertrophy after training the barbell bench press for longer than 24 weeks also no paper has compared barbell bench press training only to bench pressing in combination with other pectoralis major exercises at the very least pectoralis major growth would likely not be harmed with the inclusion of exercises such as the ones mentioned if anything they could very much enhance overall pectoralis major growth furthermore exercise variation in the long term would probably make training more enjoyable for most people [Music] [Music]"

    "title": "Stronger and Bigger Muscles (Myofibrillar Packing/Hypertrophy)",
    "published_at": "2021-08-16T14:28:25Z",
    "transcript": "One of the primary ways muscles seem to grow\u00a0\u00a0 is via an increase in the cross-sectional\u00a0\narea of their muscle fibers. There are 3 underlying ways a muscle fiber\u00a0\ncan increase in cross-sectional area:\u00a0\u00a0 myofibrillar hypertrophy, sarcoplasmic\u00a0\nhypertrophy, and myofibrillar packing. As we have done previously,\u00a0\u00a0 when overviewing the evidence on these 3\u00a0\nunderlying ways of muscle fiber growth,\u00a0\u00a0 there is a good deal of evidence finding both\u00a0\nmyofibrillar hypertrophy and myofibrillar packing. In this video,\u00a0\u00a0 we'll be going into some depth on the science\u00a0\nof myofibrillar hypertrophy and packing. As a brief review, and for those who haven't seen\u00a0\nthe previous videos, let us first establish what\u00a0\u00a0 myofibrillar hypertrophy, myofibrillar packing,\u00a0\nas well as sarcoplasmic hypertrophy, are. Muscles are organized in hierarchical layers. Within the whole muscle are\u00a0\nfascicles, within fascicles\u00a0\u00a0 are muscle fibers, and within\u00a0\nmuscle fibers are myofibrils. Myofibrils are where the magic\u00a0\nof muscle contraction happens,\u00a0\u00a0 they consist of an array of sarcomeres. Sarcomeres are what generate muscle force. Specifically, when something called the myosin\u00a0\nhead extends from the myosin filament and pulls\u00a0\u00a0 on something called the actin filament\u00a0\ntowards the M-line, force is generated. To review the 3 underlying\u00a0\nways of muscle fiber growth,\u00a0\u00a0 we need to return to the muscle fiber level. As noted, muscle fibers contain myofibrils, which\u00a0\nare what generate force via their sarcomeres. Everything else within the muscle\u00a0\nfiber can be considered the sarcoplasm. The sarcoplasm largely consists of water but\u00a0\nalso contains other components, such as glycogen,\u00a0\u00a0 sarcoplasmic proteins, and\u00a0\nnon-contractile organelles. Myofibrillar hypertrophy is where the\u00a0\nmyofibrils and sarcoplasm grow at the same pace,\u00a0\u00a0 meaning the relative space taken up by the\u00a0\nmyofibrils and sarcoplasm remains the same. Sarcoplasmic hypertrophy is where the sarcoplasm\u00a0\ngrows at a greater pace than the myofibrils,\u00a0\u00a0 meaning the relative space taken up\u00a0\nby the sarcoplasm becomes greater. Myofibrillar packing is where the myofibrils\u00a0\ngrow at a greater pace than the sarcoplasm,\u00a0\u00a0 meaning the relative space taken up\u00a0\nby the myofibrils becomes greater. As we can see, central to both myofibrillar\u00a0\nhypertrophy and myofibrillar packing\u00a0\u00a0 is the growth of the myofibrils, and this\u00a0\nis what we'll be exploring in this video. Specifically, how do myofibrils grow, and can\u00a0\nyou train for a certain type of myofibril growth? Myofibrils can grow in three different ways:\u00a0\u00a0 by increasing in length, increasing in\u00a0\ncross-sectional area, or increasing in number. Let us first explore how\u00a0\nmyofibrils may increase in length. Firstly, for those who've seen the 1st\u00a0\nvideo of this muscle growth series,\u00a0\u00a0 we described how an increase in myofibril length\u00a0\u00a0 ultimately can lead to an increase\u00a0\nin whole muscle cross-sectional area. Let us quickly review what was said. There is a good deal of evidence that\u00a0\u00a0 resistance training can increase\u00a0\nthe length of fascicles in humans. Provided fascicles run the\u00a0\nlength of a whole muscle,\u00a0\u00a0 an increase in their length would\u00a0\nincrease whole muscle length. However, given whole muscles are attached\u00a0\nto bones, and these attachment locations do\u00a0\u00a0 not change, we never visually witness\u00a0\nan increase in whole muscle length. Rather, due to the fixed attachment locations,\u00a0\u00a0 the longer muscle would bulge outwards, and\u00a0\nthis is an increase in cross-sectional area. Now, this increase in whole muscle length is\u00a0\ncaused by an increase in fascicle length. But,\u00a0\u00a0 what causes an increase in\u00a0\nfascicle length in the first place? Well, given muscle fibers\u00a0\nare found within fascicles,\u00a0\u00a0 an increase in muscle fiber length\u00a0\nseems the most likely explanation. At the muscle fiber level, we know myofibrils\u00a0\nare present, and as we'll get on to in a second,\u00a0\u00a0 myofibrils likely increase in length. Along with this increase in myofibril\u00a0\nlength, although I believe there's\u00a0\u00a0 no concrete evidence on it, presumably\u00a0\nthe sarcoplasm would expand lengthwise\u00a0\u00a0 to support this myofibril length increase, thereby\u00a0\ncementing an increase in muscle fiber length. Given the myofibrils and\u00a0\nsarcoplasm grow lengthwise\u00a0\u00a0 at the same pace, it could technically\u00a0\nbe considered myofibrillar hypertrophy,\u00a0\u00a0 hence why I've included an increase\u00a0\nin myofibril length in this video. Anyway, returning our focus\u00a0\non the myofibril component,\u00a0\u00a0 how would myofibrils increase in length? As we know, myofibrils consist\u00a0\nof an array of sarcomeres. In theory, myofibrils could increase in length via\u00a0\nincreasing the length of pre-existing sarcomeres,\u00a0\u00a0 or by increasing the number\u00a0\nof sarcomeres in series. When overviewing the animal research,\u00a0\nthe overwhelming evidence suggests\u00a0\u00a0 that increasing the number\u00a0\nof sarcomeres in series,\u00a0\u00a0 not an increase in pre-existing sarcomere length,\u00a0\noccurs with an increase in myofibril length. Note, I did say animal studies. Unfortunately,\u00a0\u00a0 I don't believe there are any studies exploring\u00a0\nchanges at the myofibril level in humans. Largely, this is likely due to methodological and\u00a0\npractical constraints of assessing ultrastructural\u00a0\u00a0 changes with human subjects, hence we\u00a0\nare relying on non-human animal studies. This is a limitation that should be\u00a0\nconsidered throughout this video. But, the finding that increasing\u00a0\nthe number of sarcomeres in series\u00a0\u00a0 is likely what creates an increase\u00a0\nin myofibril length makes sense. If you were to chronically increase\u00a0\nthe length of pre-existing sarcomeres,\u00a0\u00a0 especially to a high degree, their ability\u00a0\nto produce force is most likely compromised,\u00a0\u00a0 and so this mechanism seems unlikely. Now, an interesting question is if an increase\u00a0\nin the number of sarcomeres in series occurs,\u00a0\u00a0 where is the sarcomere added\u00a0\nalong the length of the myofibril? Some animal studies support the notion\u00a0\nthat the sarcomeres are simply added\u00a0\u00a0 to the ends of pre-existing myofibrils. However,\u00a0\u00a0 other animal studies suggest that new sarcomeres\u00a0\nare inserted between pre-existing sarcomeres. Therefore, the research is\u00a0\nunfortunately not currently clear. Another interesting question is whether you\u00a0\u00a0 can specifically train to increase\u00a0\nthe number of sarcomeres in series. It turns out that there may indeed\u00a0\nbe specific ways of training\u00a0\u00a0 that predominantly induce this type of growth. Returning to the animal studies that found an\u00a0\nincrease in the number of sarcomeres in series,\u00a0\u00a0 nearly all of the studies stimulated\u00a0\nthe muscle at a long length. Using various equipment, they either placed the\u00a0\nmuscle at a stretched position for a set duration\u00a0\u00a0 or had the animals perform eccentric contractions.\u00a0\u00a0 Eccentric contractions are where the\u00a0\nmuscle produces force while lengthening. Now, the idea of simply placing\u00a0\na muscle in a stretched position\u00a0\u00a0 for a set duration is likely not directly\u00a0\napplicable to humans, as these studies either used\u00a0\u00a0 extreme stretching training sessions or had the\u00a0\nanimals stretch for numerous days or weeks on end. However, the idea of training a muscle at a\u00a0\nlong length, including eccentric training,\u00a0\u00a0 may very well apply to humans. For instance, McMahon et al. found that compared\u00a0\nto training a range of lower body exercises\u00a0\u00a0 with a partial range of motion that worked the\u00a0\nmuscles at a short length (specifically from 0\u00a0\u00a0 to 40 degrees of knee flexion), training\u00a0\nwith a fuller range of motion (from 0 to\u00a0\u00a0 90 degrees of knee flexion) produced greater\u00a0\nincreases in vastus lateralis fascicle length. As we've established, presumably\u00a0\nthis increase in fascicle length\u00a0\u00a0 ultimately reflects an increase in\u00a0\nthe number of sarcomeres in series. Another study by McMahon et al. found that\u00a0\nwith knee extensions, using a partial range\u00a0\u00a0 of motion that trained the quadriceps at long\u00a0\nlengths (from 40 to 90 degrees of knee flexion)\u00a0\u00a0 resulted in greater increases in vastus lateralis\u00a0\nfascicle length compared to a partial range\u00a0\u00a0 of motion that trained the quadriceps at short\u00a0\nlengths (from 0 to 50 degrees of knee flexion). Therefore, a full range of motion, or\u00a0\na partial range of motion that trains\u00a0\u00a0 the muscle at long lengths, seems to\u00a0\nbe good at increasing fascicle length\u00a0\u00a0 (and therefore presumably increasing\u00a0\nthe number of sarcomeres in series). However, eccentric overload\u00a0\ntraining may be even better. For those unaware, your muscles are significantly\u00a0\nstronger during the lowering phases of an exercise\u00a0\u00a0 (in which your muscles are contracting\u00a0\neccentrically). Eccentric overload refers to\u00a0\u00a0 using some method that enables you to lift heavier\u00a0\nloads on the lowering phase of an exercise,\u00a0\u00a0 thereby overloading the\u00a0\neccentric muscular contractions. Reeves et al. found that compared to performing\u00a0\nleg presses and knee extensions normally,\u00a0\u00a0 performing them with overloaded\u00a0\neccentric repetitions only,\u00a0\u00a0 produced greater increases in\u00a0\nvastus lateralis fascicle length. A few other studies also find\u00a0\nthat eccentric-only training\u00a0\u00a0 is highly effective at increasing fascicle length. Therefore, if you have access\u00a0\nto equipment or techniques\u00a0\u00a0 that allow you to perform eccentric overloaded\u00a0\nreps, this could be a highly effective way to\u00a0\u00a0 preferentially stimulate an increase\u00a0\nin the number of sarcomeres in series. But, quite interestingly, there is some\u00a0\nevidence suggesting that your ability to\u00a0\u00a0 increase the number of sarcomeres in series\u00a0\nmay be restricted to a certain timeframe. Baroni et al. recruited untrained subjects and had\u00a0\nthem train eccentric overloaded knee extensions\u00a0\u00a0 for 12 weeks. Vastus lateralis and rectus femoris\u00a0\nfascicle length increased up until week 8,\u00a0\u00a0 with no further increases observed thereafter. Similarly, Blazeich et al.\u00a0\nrecruited untrained subjects\u00a0\u00a0 and had them train knee extensions for 10\u00a0\nweeks. Vastus lateralis fascicle length\u00a0\u00a0 increased up until the 5th week, with no\u00a0\nfurther increases observed thereafter. Therefore, perhaps your ability to increase\u00a0\nfascicle length (and therefore presumably increase\u00a0\u00a0 the number of sarcomeres in series) may be limited\u00a0\nto the first few weeks or months of training. However, these are only two studies. Future\u00a0\nresearch is undoubtedly still required, and\u00a0\u00a0 questions still remain, for instance, in highly\u00a0\ntrained individuals who have never performed\u00a0\u00a0 eccentric overloaded training, could\u00a0\nthey still experience an increase in\u00a0\u00a0 the number of sarcomeres in series\u00a0\nvia eccentric overloaded training? All of the mentioned eccentric overload studies\u00a0\nwere only conducted on untrained subjects. Let us now move away from how\u00a0\nmyofibrils may increase in length,\u00a0\u00a0 and progress on to how myofibrils may\u00a0\nincrease in cross-sectional area or number. Firstly, it seems most likely that\u00a0\nmyofibrils increase in cross-sectional area\u00a0\u00a0 via increasing sarcomeres in parallel. This\u00a0\nsuggests sarcomeres are built and added above or\u00a0\u00a0 below pre-existing sarcomeres, thereby increasing\u00a0\nthe cross-sectional area of the myofibril. As for an increase in myofibril number, this\u00a0\nsuggests that either completely new myofibrils\u00a0\u00a0 are manufactured and added to muscle fibers,\u00a0\nor pre-existing myofibrils split into two. So, what is the evidence for either of these? It's very well established in human studies that\u00a0\nmuscle fibers increase in cross-sectional area\u00a0\u00a0 in response to resistance training. And as detailed last video, there is a\u00a0\ngood deal of evidence this fiber growth\u00a0\u00a0 can be achieved by myofibrillar\u00a0\nhypertrophy or myofibrillar packing. As we know, both of these involve\u00a0\nsignificant myofibril growth. This growth of the myofibrils could be\u00a0\nachieved by an increase in cross-sectional\u00a0\u00a0 area of the individual myofibrils, or by\u00a0\nan increase in the number of myofibrils. However, which one actually takes place? Unfortunately, I don't believe there\u00a0\nare any human studies exploring this. Again, this is likely due to methodological\u00a0\nand practical constraints of assessing\u00a0\u00a0 ultrastructural changes within human subjects,\u00a0\nhence we are relying on animal studies. Surprisingly, even with animal studies, there\u00a0\nappears to be very little research in this area. By my count, there seem to be only\u00a0\n2 relevant collections of research. Ashmore and Summers conducted a few\u00a0\nexperiments exploring the effects\u00a0\u00a0 of overloading the muscles of chickens,\u00a0\nvia stretching their wings for 1 week. They found this procedure induced a 55%\u00a0\nincrease in muscle fiber cross-sectional area,\u00a0\u00a0 and in a different experiment, an increase\u00a0\nin the diameter of myofibrils by 36%.\u00a0\u00a0 Moreover, 45% of the myofibrils\u00a0\ndisplayed signs of splitting. Therefore, this study suggests with an\u00a0\nincrease in muscle fiber cross-sectional area,\u00a0\u00a0 myofibrils increase in diameter (which\u00a0\nimplies an increase in cross-sectional area,\u00a0\u00a0 presumably through an increase\u00a0\nin sarcomeres in parallel)\u00a0\u00a0 AND pre-existing myofibrils may also split, as\u00a0\nnumerous myofibrils displayed signs of this. Research by Goldspink further\u00a0\nsupport these findings. Goldspink found that in mice of various ages,\u00a0\nthere was a positive relationship between\u00a0\u00a0 the diameter of individual myofibrils\u00a0\nand muscle fiber cross-sectional area. As a larger myofibril diameter suggests\u00a0\na larger myofibril cross-sectional area,\u00a0\u00a0 this data supports the notion that myofibrils\u00a0\u00a0 may increase in cross-sectional area as muscle\u00a0\nfibers increase in cross-sectional area. However, Goldspink also found\u00a0\na similar positive relationship\u00a0\u00a0 between the number of myofibrils in a muscle\u00a0\nfiber and the muscle fiber's cross-sectional area. Therefore, it seems that myofibrils\u00a0\u00a0 may also increase in number as the muscle\u00a0\nfiber increases in cross-sectional area. Further work by Goldspink indicated\u00a0\nthat the increase in myofibril number\u00a0\u00a0 was likely due to the splitting\u00a0\nof pre-existing myofibrils. Specifically, and quite fascinatingly,\u00a0\nGoldspink put forth the idea\u00a0\u00a0 that individual myofibrils may increase in\u00a0\ncross-sectional area (via an increase in\u00a0\u00a0 sarcomeres in parallel) up to a certain critical\u00a0\nsize. Thereafter, this myofibril splits into two. Supporting this was that Goldspink\u00a0\u00a0 observed splitting in myofibrils roughly twice\u00a0\nthe size of myofibrils that were not splitting. To add some more detail, at the myofibril\u00a0\nlevel, Goldspink's research supports the idea\u00a0\u00a0 that myofibrils would split longitudinally,\u00a0\nvia a break at the Z-discs of sarcomeres. So collectively the studies by Ashmore, Summers,\u00a0\nand Goldspink suggest that with an increase in\u00a0\u00a0 muscle fiber cross-sectional area, an increase in\u00a0\nthe cross-sectional area of individual myofibrils\u00a0\u00a0 (likely via an increase in sarcomere\u00a0\nin parallel), as well as an increase in\u00a0\u00a0 myofibril number ( likely via splitting\u00a0\nof pre-existing myofibrils), occurs. At the moment, there appears to be no research\u00a0\u00a0 suggesting completely new myofibrils can\u00a0\nbe created and added to muscle fibers. Let us move on to the intriguing question\u00a0\nof whether you can train specifically\u00a0\u00a0 for an increase in myofibril\u00a0\ncross-sectional area or number. Given the current evidence suggests an increase\u00a0\nin myofibril cross-sectional area and number\u00a0\u00a0 may both occur and may be linked (as\u00a0\nsuggested by Goldsprink's research),\u00a0\u00a0 we'll consider them as one. Overall, opposed to the research on\u00a0\nhow you may increase myofibril length,\u00a0\u00a0 the current research does not\u00a0\nseem to provide any clear details\u00a0\u00a0 behind how you may specifically target an increase\u00a0\nin myofibril cross-sectional area or number. Despite this, we still could draw\u00a0\nsome potential conclusions indirectly. As we saw in the 2nd video\u00a0\nof this muscle growth series,\u00a0\u00a0 there's a good deal of evidence supporting\u00a0\nthe notion that an increase in muscle fiber\u00a0\u00a0 cross-sectional area is achieved via\u00a0\nmyofibrillar hypertrophy or packing,\u00a0\u00a0 suggesting a significant increase in\u00a0\nmyofibril cross-sectional area and/or number. The large majority of the studies finding this\u00a0\u00a0 used moderate loadings, moderate\u00a0\nfrequencies, and low to moderate volumes. The definitions for each of\u00a0\nthese can be seen on screen. Therefore, one could suggest that\u00a0\ntraining with these variables\u00a0\u00a0 may optimize an increase in myofibril\u00a0\ncross-sectional area and/or number. However, I should mention the majority\u00a0\nof studies that found sarcoplasmic\u00a0\u00a0 hypertrophy (that is, greater growth of\u00a0\nthe sarcoplasm compared to the myofibrils)\u00a0\u00a0 also used moderate loads and moderate frequencies. Thus, these variables may not be tied to\u00a0\nmyofibrillar hypertrophy or myofibrillar packing. On the other hand, though, the majority of\u00a0\nthe studies finding sarcoplasmic hypertrophy\u00a0\u00a0 used higher volumes. From this, we can perhaps deduce\u00a0\u00a0 using low to moderate volumes produces\u00a0\nmyofibrillar hypertrophy or packing. and of course, both of these involve\u00a0\nsignificant growth of the myofibrils. Now, it's important to emphasize\u00a0\nthese suggestions are tentative,\u00a0\u00a0 there are potential limitations with them. One noteworthy point is that there's\u00a0\ncurrently a lack of research exploring\u00a0\u00a0 the exclusive use of heavy or light loads on\u00a0\nthe 3 underlying ways of muscle fiber growth. Therefore, it remains possible\u00a0\nthat either heavy or light loads\u00a0\u00a0 could preferentially elicit\u00a0\nmyofibrillar hypertrophy or packing. All in all, future research would be needed\u00a0\nto provide greater clarity in this area. Next video, we'll be taking a closer look\u00a0\ninto sarcoplasmic hypertrophy, which is where,\u00a0\u00a0 at the muscle fiber level, the sarcoplasm\u00a0\ngrows at a greater pace than the myofibrils. We'll go into more details about how you may train\u00a0\nfor sarcoplasmic hypertrophy, what specifically\u00a0\u00a0 may drive sarcoplasm growth, the potential\u00a0\nhypotheses as to why sarcoplasmic hypertrophy\u00a0\u00a0 may occur, as well as the potential role anabolic\u00a0\nsteroids may play in sarcoplasmic hypertrophy."

    "transcript": "With the same exercise, performing it\u00a0\none way can produce drastically more\u00a0\u00a0 muscle hypertrophy than performing it another way. This is because the current data demonstrate\u00a0\nthat the length you train a muscle\u00a0\u00a0 at can profoundly influence the\u00a0\namount of hypertrophy produced. In this video, we'll explore this current data,\u00a0\ndiscuss some notable considerations, and then\u00a0\u00a0 figure out how you could leverage this literature\u00a0\nto enhance hypertrophy with your exercises. Allow us to first examine a recent study\u00a0\nby Sato et al., demonstrating how biceps\u00a0\u00a0 hypertrophy can powerfully be enhanced\u00a0\nby training at a certain muscle length. Part 1: Sato et al. Sato et al. recruited 32 individuals who had\u00a0\nnot been training at least in the last 6 months\u00a0\u00a0 and assigned them to either a long\u00a0\nlength, short length, or control group. We won't mention the control group from hereafter.\u00a0\nThey did not train and expectedly made no gains. Both the long length and short length groups\u00a0\u00a0 trained the dumbbell preacher\u00a0\ncurl twice per week for 5 weeks. The long length group trained the exercise\u00a0\nfrom 0 to 50 degrees of elbow flexion.\u00a0\u00a0 This trained the biceps at a long\u00a0\nlength. That is, a stretched position. The short length group trained the exercise\u00a0\nfrom 80 to 130 degrees of elbow flexion. This\u00a0\u00a0 trained the biceps at a short length.\u00a0\nThat is, a more contracted position. Now, many of you are probably thinking what about\u00a0\na full range of motion group? Unfortunately,\u00a0\u00a0 the researchers did not have a full range of\u00a0\nmotion group. But we'll return to this point soon. Both groups, each session, performed 3 sets of 10\u00a0\nrepetitions with 3 minutes of rest between sets. What about loads? What loads\u00a0\ndid the subjects train with? The way the researchers prescribed loads\u00a0\nwas slightly unique and not typical. For the long length group, before\u00a0\nthe study, they measured the amount\u00a0\u00a0 of maximal isometric force they could\u00a0\nproduce at 50 degrees of elbow flexion. This value was then used to determine\u00a0\nwhat dumbbell load they trained with,\u00a0\u00a0 and it varied throughout the total\u00a0\n10 training sessions they completed. In the first session, the long length group\u00a0\ntrained with a dumbbell load equating to 30%\u00a0\u00a0 of their maximal isometric force\u00a0\nat 50 degrees of elbow flexion.\u00a0\u00a0 This progressed to 100% by\u00a0\nthe 10th and final session. For the short length group, opposingly,\u00a0\nthe researchers measured the amount of\u00a0\u00a0 maximal isometric force they could produce at\u00a0\n90 degrees of elbow flexion before the study. This value was then used to determine\u00a0\nwhat dumbbell load they trained with.\u00a0\u00a0 Like the long length group, they trained\u00a0\nwith 30% of the maximal isometric force\u00a0\u00a0 in the first session, and this progressed to\u00a0\n100% by the 10th and final training session. Before and after the study, elbow\u00a0\nflexor thickness was measured at 50%,\u00a0\u00a0 60%, and 70% of the approximate upper arm length. Additionally, the average of these three locations\u00a0\u00a0 was taken to obtain a single average\u00a0\nelbow flexor thickness measurement. I should note the elbow flexors in this case\u00a0\u00a0 not only includes the biceps\u00a0\nmuscle, but also the brachialis. What the researchers found was that increases\u00a0\nin elbow flexor thickness at 50% and 60% of\u00a0\u00a0 the upper arm length were similar between\u00a0\nboth groups. But, increases in elbow flexor\u00a0\u00a0 thickness at 70% of the upper arm length\u00a0\nwere greater for the long length group. Averaging these three elbow\u00a0\nflexor thickness regions,\u00a0\u00a0 the long length group saw significantly greater\u00a0\nincreases versus the short length group.\u00a0\u00a0 Gains were approximately 3x\u00a0\ngreater for the long length group. Part 2: What about Full ROM? Now, a question everyone probably\u00a0\nhas is how would have this partial\u00a0\u00a0 range of motion at long lengths\u00a0\ncompared to a full range of motion? We can't be certain simply as the Sato et al.\u00a0\nstudy never had a full range of motion group.\u00a0\u00a0 But, does any other research help us out? Most of the studies looking at a\u00a0\nfull range of motion have compared\u00a0\u00a0 it to only a partial range of\u00a0\nmotion at short muscle lengths,\u00a0\u00a0 and they have found a full range of motion\u00a0\nis superior for overall hypertrophy. However, notice how I said most of the studies.\u00a0\nThere is indeed one study by Pedrosa et al.\u00a0\u00a0 evaluating how a partial range of motion at long\u00a0\nmuscle lengths compares to a full range of motion,\u00a0\u00a0 and it suggests a partial range of motion\u00a0\nat long muscle lengths could be superior. This group of researchers had previously untrained\u00a0\u00a0 women train the leg extension with\u00a0\none of four different programs. A long length group trained the leg extension\u00a0\nfrom 100 to 65 degrees of knee flexion,\u00a0\u00a0 which trains the quadriceps at a long length. A short length group trained the leg extension\u00a0\nfrom 65 to 30 degrees of knee flexion,\u00a0\u00a0 which trains the quadriceps at a short length. A full range of motion group trained the leg\u00a0\nextension from 100 to 30 degrees of knee flexion. Finally, a varied group alternated\u00a0\nback and forth between training the\u00a0\u00a0 long length and short length\u00a0\nleg extension every session. Before and after the study, cross-sectional\u00a0\narea of the vastus lateralis and rectus\u00a0\u00a0 femoris was each measured at 40%, 50%, 60%,\u00a0\nand 70% of the approximate thigh bone length. Overall, the long length group saw the greatest\u00a0\ngains, with the varied group being a close second. More precisely, at 40% of the thigh bone\u00a0\nlength, increases in rectus femoris and\u00a0\u00a0 vastus lateralis cross-sectional area were\u00a0\nstatistically similar between all groups. But at 50% of the thigh bone length, increases\u00a0\nfor the rectus femoris and vastus lateralis\u00a0\u00a0 were similar between the long length and varied\u00a0\ngroup but both greater than the other two groups. At 60% of the thigh bone length, increases for\u00a0\nthe rectus femoris and vastus lateralis were\u00a0\u00a0 similar between the long length and varied\u00a0\ngroup but greater than the two other groups. Finally, at 70% of the thigh bone length,\u00a0\nincreases for the rectus femoris and\u00a0\u00a0 vastus lateralis were greatest for the long\u00a0\nlength group compared to all other groups. Therefore, this study qualifies as evidence that\u00a0\na partial range of motion at long muscle lengths\u00a0\u00a0 might be more powerful than a full range of\u00a0\nmotion for stimulating muscle hypertrophy. Part 3: Other data I think it's worth the viewer being aware there\u00a0\nis a fair bit of other evidence demonstrating\u00a0\u00a0 that training a muscle at a long length\u00a0\nevokes more hypertrophy than short lengths. An analysis by Oranchuk et al. combined\u00a0\nthe results of 9 studies looking at how\u00a0\u00a0 hypertrophy is impacted by training isometrically\u00a0\nat long muscle lengths or short muscle lengths. Overall, hypertrophy was greater\u00a0\nwhen training at long muscle lengths. Another study by McMahon et al. had a long length\u00a0\u00a0 group train leg extensions from\u00a0\n90 to 40 degrees of knee flexion,\u00a0\u00a0 and a short length group training leg\u00a0\nextensions from 50 to 0 degrees of knee flexion. Increases in cross-sectional area of the vastus\u00a0\nlateralis at 25% and 50% of the approximate thigh\u00a0\u00a0 bone length were not statistically different\u00a0\nbetween the long and short length groups.\u00a0\u00a0 But, increases in cross-sectional area of the\u00a0\nvastus lateralis at 75% of the approximate\u00a0\u00a0 thigh bone length were significantly\u00a0\ngreater for the long length group. Finally, Maoe et al. either had subjects\u00a0\ntrain the lying leg curl or seated leg curl,\u00a0\u00a0 with both executed from 0 to\u00a0\n90 degrees of knee flexion\u00a0\u00a0 (which is more or less a full range\u00a0\nof motion for both movements). Now, as 3 of the 4 hamstring muscles cross\u00a0\nboth the hip and knee joints, seated leg curls\u00a0\u00a0 (due to the hip flexion it involves) would stretch\u00a0\nthese muscles much more than lying leg curls. The other hamstring muscles (the biceps\u00a0\nfemoris short head) only cross the hip\u00a0\u00a0 joint and thus is likely at a similar length\u00a0\nbetween the lying and seated leg curls. It was found that volume increases in the 3\u00a0\nhamstring muscles that cross the hip and knee\u00a0\u00a0 joint were significantly greater after training\u00a0\nthe seated leg curl versus the lying leg curls. The other hamstring muscle,\u00a0\nthe biceps femoris short head,\u00a0\u00a0 experienced similar volume increases between\u00a0\ntraining the lying and seated leg curls. This study demonstrates that even with\u00a0\nthe same overall joint range of motion,\u00a0\u00a0 selecting an exercise that can achieve\u00a0\na greater stretch of a muscle can\u00a0\u00a0 evoke significantly more muscle hypertrophy. Part 4: Regional Hypertrophy Differences Before discussing some considerations of the\u00a0\ndata we've overviewed, and then the potential\u00a0\u00a0 takeaways, it's worth noting much of the\u00a0\ndata we've overviewed shows there are notable\u00a0\u00a0 differences in regional hypertrophy between\u00a0\ntraining at long and short muscle lengths. The studies by Sato, Pedrosa, and McMahon\u00a0\nindicate that growth of the upper or\u00a0\u00a0 middle portions of a muscle is fairly similar\u00a0\nbetween training at a long and short length,\u00a0\u00a0 or slightly greater when\u00a0\ntraining at a long length. However, in the more lower regions of a muscle,\u00a0\u00a0 training at a long length produces substantially\u00a0\nmore growth than training at a short length. Part 5: Some Considerations It's worth noting in all the data we've overviewed\u00a0\nassessing differences between training at a long,\u00a0\u00a0 short, or with a full range of motion, the biceps,\u00a0\nquadriceps, and hamstring muscles were evaluated. I think it's likely for muscles\u00a0\nbelonging to the arms and legs,\u00a0\u00a0 and perhaps even the chest, training at\u00a0\na long length would produce significantly\u00a0\u00a0 more hypertrophy than training at a short length. However, for some muscles, such as some\u00a0\nback muscles, and the trap muscles,\u00a0\u00a0 not only is it probably difficult to find suitable\u00a0\nexercises to train these muscles at a long length,\u00a0\u00a0 but would training at a long length\u00a0\neven be superior for these muscles? For example, I have a hard time believing\u00a0\npartial rowing of any kind in the lower\u00a0\u00a0 position would produce more growth than full\u00a0\nrange of motion rows where you can contract\u00a0\u00a0 and squeeze the back muscles. Moreover, would\u00a0\npartial shrugs in the lower portion produce\u00a0\u00a0 more hypertrophy than full range of motion\u00a0\nshrugs where you can squeeze the traps. The point here is I feel it\u2019s\u00a0\ncompletely possible some muscles,\u00a0\u00a0 like the back and traps, might not necessarily\u00a0\nbenefit from being trained at a long length. But,\u00a0\u00a0 I could completely be wrong. Hopefully\u00a0\nfuture research examines this further. Part 6: Takeaway For many muscles, specifically those belonging\u00a0\nto the limbs and probably the chest as well,\u00a0\u00a0 I think it's very likely training at long\u00a0\nmuscle lengths is going to be superior for\u00a0\u00a0 overall hypertrophy compared to\u00a0\ntraining at short muscle lengths. Furthermore, it's quite possible using a\u00a0\npartial range of motion at long lengths\u00a0\u00a0 produces more hypertrophy overall than\u00a0\ntraining with a full range of motion.\u00a0\u00a0 But, this conclusion is only\u00a0\nderived from a single study. As a result, I don't believe we can confidently\u00a0\nconclude training a partial range of motion at\u00a0\u00a0 long lengths is 100% of the time going to be\u00a0\nmore hypertrophic than a full range of motion.\u00a0\u00a0 More research is going to need\u00a0\nto be conducted in this area. Based on your interpretations of the data,\u00a0\u00a0 you might actually wish to experiment with\u00a0\npartial range of motion at long lengths.\u00a0\u00a0 It's clear to see this type of partial range\u00a0\nof motion will produce robust hypertrophy. At the very least though, with many of your\u00a0\nexercises that train the muscles of the limb\u00a0\u00a0 (and perhaps the chest muscle too),\u00a0\nfocusing on exercises and ranges of\u00a0\u00a0 motions that can meaningfully load the muscle\u00a0\nin a stretched position is likely a great idea. For example, as per the Maeo et\u00a0\nal. study overviewed earlier,\u00a0\u00a0 seated leg curls are going to\u00a0\nbe better than lying leg curls. With squatting exercises, trying to\u00a0\ngo as deep as you comfortably can\u00a0\u00a0 is likely going to be better for\u00a0\noverall lower body hypertrophy. With deadlift exercises, if you'd like to\u00a0\nachieve the most hamstring growth from them,\u00a0\u00a0 ensuring you do not excessively bend the\u00a0\nknees and choosing a variation that allows\u00a0\u00a0 you to achieve significant hip flexion (such as\u00a0\nstiff-legged deadlifts) is likely a good idea. Of course, as noted, I think it's\u00a0\ncompletely possible some muscles\u00a0\u00a0 (like some of the back muscles and maybe the\u00a0\ntraps) might not necessarily grow more with\u00a0\u00a0 training at long lengths. But again, future\u00a0\nresearch is needed to falsify or verify this."

    "transcript": "welcome to the house of hypertrophy what happens if instead of training with the same number of sets every week you gradually increase your sets across weeks does it enhance muscle hypertrophy or is it just overdoing it and hurting your gains a brand new study is the first ever to compare performing the same number of sets every week to progressing set numbers across weeks it's caused quite a controversy online and you will see why shortly let us critically analyze this paper and then fit it into the overall scientific research to derive potential takeaways 31 trained men were recruited all subjects trained the back squat leg press and leg extension twice per week for 12 weeks they trained with six to eight reps in the first session per week and 10 to 12 reps in the second session per week all sets were performed to two reps away from failure except the last set on each exercise which was performed to failure Progressive overload by increasing load was done throughout the study to ensure subjects kept reaching these proximities to failure in the rep ranges in the first week all subjects performed 22 weekly sets for the quads split between the exercises a fixed group continued to perform 22 weekly sets for the quads for the remainder of the study a full set group added four sets for the quads every two weeks resulting in them performing 42 weekly sets for the quads split across the exercises in the final week a six set group added six sets for the quads every 2 weeks resulting in them performing 52 weekly sets for the quads split across the exercises in the final week all subjects rested at least 2 minutes between sets during the training sessions caloric and macronutrient intake was not significantly different between the three groups and all of them consumed more than 1.6 g of protein per kilogram of body weight hypertrophy was evaluated by measuring vastest lateralis cross-sectional area and thickness before and after the study and the four and six8 groups tended to see greater gains than the fix set group When comparing the four and six set groups the averages tend to favor the six set group however the confidence interval was wider for the six set group and overlaps a fair bit with the fouret group particularly with a cross-sectional area measurement what on Earth does this mean indirectly this implies there was more variation in how well the subjects in the six set group grew compared to the other groups so we can't say with complete certainty that the six set group was superior to the fouret group the researchers also evaluated back squat one R max strength and increases were also Superior in the four and six set groups versus the fixed group in this case When comparing the four and six set groups the confidence intervals present a more convincing picture of the six set group seeing greater gains in the future at the house of hypertrophy we'll have more videos surrounding strength gains as well as similarities and differences between training for strength and size the results of this new study are highly fascinating gradually increasing sets to seriously High numbers led to Greater gains and these were the average sets used as you can imagine the use of these seriously High volumes is the center of its controversy but before discussing this study more it is important we know what the rest of the scientific research surrounding set says we actually detailed this in our last video but for those who didn't watch it and as a refresher for those who did let's speed through the key points there have been three studies also finding that very high set numbers of up to 30 to 45 weekly sets per musle group produced greater muscle hypertrophy however an important consideration is all three had subjects use short rest intervals between sets in training sessions why does this matter contrary to traditional belief short rest might make each set less effective for building muscle such that you have to perform more sets this study demonstrates this finding when performing three sets on the leg press per session resting for 3 minutes between sets produced greater CAD gains than resting for 1 minute between sets but when performing five sets per session with 1 minute of rest between sets quad Gaines were similar to the three sets with 3 minutes of rest therefore it's possible if these three studies use longer rests not as many sets may be needed to optimize gains indeed in three studies that have used longer rest between sets in training sessions all of them found hyper fee was optimized in the 12 to 18 weekly sets per muscle group range with no clear benefit to performing more than 18 weekly sets per muscle these are the average results from the studies we have research indicating individual differences can exist some people may grow more from lower or higher set numbers and some may see similar gains between both now that we understand some of the key points from the scientific literature let us more critically review this new study and detail what its potential takeaways could [Music] be as noted there's controversy surrounding the seriously High volumes used in this study some individuals are simply discarding this data entirely since they can't believe it and or it does not fit with their bias all in all though I feel it's crucial to view this data as analytically as possible there's no question that the four and six set groups were performing super high volumes even the fix set group was performing more than most people typically do but there are some things we must not forget this protocol was just done for the quads not other muscle groups most sets were not performed to failure recall they left two repetitions in the tank and only went to failure on the final set of each exercise when defining failure the researchers detail two options one option is what I would consider true muscular failure and the other option was more so voluntary failure and not true muscular failure so some subjects may not have always been reaching true muscular failure on the final set either moreover as some of you are probably thinking it's even quite possible subjects were inaccurate in estimating two reps in the tank though we have research showing trained individuals can be fairly accurate in predicting their proximity to failure this isn't always the case in accuracy tends to be worse with lower body exercises having said this subjects did train and progress in the 6 to 12 rep range and it's a whole lot easier to train closer to failure with this rep range compared to higher reps finally recool subjects also rested at least 2 minutes between sets which is a longer rest interval this would make the training easier to handle and presumably allow them to push harder on each set compared to using shorter rests none of this is to say what the four and six set groups did was remotely close to easy it would have still been challenging for them in fact the authors noted some subjects reported excessive perceived fatigue in the final weeks which is where the four and six set groups were going Beyond 40 weekly sets for the quads so I don't believe we can safely and literally recommend everyone to exceed 40 weekly sets besides the duration of your training sessions like the present study would be very long too nonetheless I think there are some more General ways in which this study fits into the rest of of the research strictly speaking we don't actually know if the greater gains for the four and 68 groups were because they performed more average sets or because it was the act of them progressively increasing the number of sets they performed by weekly of course both could have contributed simultaneously but if the average sets were contributing this is the first evidence that when using longer rests performing more than 20 weekly sets for a muscle could be beneficial for some trained individuals this doesn't mean every single trained person should start performing more than 20 weekly sets per muscle group remember we still have three other studies failing to find a benefit to more than 20 weekly sets with longer wrists for now I would just use this study as potential evidence that it may be justifiable for some well-trained individuals to experiment in the territory of Performing more than 20 weekly sets for a muscle of course it may be most feasible to do this with just a few muscle groups perhaps ones that you feel to be lagging if the act of progressively increasing the number of sets performed a by by weekly was contributing to the greater gains then this is the first evidence this could be a beneficial strategy if we use some more practical numbers perhaps gradually progressing from 10 to 20 weekly sets per muscle group across a training block could be superior to just performing a fixed number of 15 weekly sets per Master group intriguingly this method was detailed in the paper by Mike isrel a few years back after working up to 20 weekly sets you could then deload and then do it all over again or bump up the number slightly in the next training block but I believe more studies are needed to validate this method and provide deeper insights but I think it can be fine for someone to experiment with this methodology if they desire if

quality as detailed in our previous video the data indicates provided longer rest between sets are used the 12 to 18 weekly set range optimized gains with no clear benefit to performing more sets however this new study is a fascinating addition to the literature finding that compared to performing a fixed number of 22 weekly sets for the quads adding sets bi-weekly to very high weekly set quad numbers tended to produce greater muscle growth these findings might indicate for some well-trained individuals it could be justifiable to experiment in the territory of Performing more than 20 weekly sets for a muscle perhaps most feasibly with a few select muscle groups this new study might also suggest that progressively increasing the number of sets across a weeks could be a beneficial strategy so it's something that you could experiment with if you like it's still worth recognizing that individual differences likely exist we have data suggesting some people may grow more from lower or higher volumes or even similarly between both so there truly is no one siiz fits all approach consider all the research as potential training suggestions and starting points and then you can adjust as

    "title": "Training to Failure Is a MUST for Hypertrophy (Or Is It?)",
    "published_at": "2021-11-08T12:02:49Z",
    "transcript": "Failure is defined as the inability to perform\u00a0\nanother full repetition of an exercise. How close an individual gets to failure\u00a0\nwith their repetitions is probably one\u00a0\u00a0 of the more hotly debated training variables. Some propose achieving failure is\u00a0\ncritical for muscle hypertrophy,\u00a0\u00a0 as it ensures maximal muscle fiber\u00a0\nrecruitment and force production. In this video, we'll assess the soundness\u00a0\nof this claim via the current training\u00a0\u00a0 to failure literature as well as the\u00a0\nmechanistic research on muscle hypertrophy. Kicking things off, 4 well-designed\u00a0\npapers have compared training to\u00a0\u00a0 failure to stopping a couple of reps\u00a0\nshy of failure for muscle hypertrophy. Let's briefly overview them. A 2018 Brazillian study by Lacerda et al. had 10\u00a0\npreviously untrained men train the unilateral leg\u00a0\u00a0 extension for 3-4 sets with a 55-60% one-rep\u00a0\nmax load, 2-3 times per week for 14 weeks. With one leg, subjects performed their\u00a0\nrepetitions to failure every set. With their other leg, they ended up stopping\u00a0\n2 reps away from failure in the first set in\u00a0\u00a0 a session, 1 rep away from failure in the second\u00a0\nset, and 0 reps away from failure in the last set. By the end of the study, increases in rectus\u00a0\nfemoris and vastus lateralis cross-sectional area\u00a0\u00a0 were similar between both legs,\u00a0\nsuggesting stopping 2-0 reps away\u00a0\u00a0 from failure is as effective as\u00a0\ntraining to failure for growth. The second study by Nobrega et\u00a0\nal., conducted in Brazil in 2017,\u00a0\u00a0 allocated each leg of 32 previously untrained men\u00a0\ninto one of four conditions: a high load failure,\u00a0\u00a0 high load non-failure, low load failure,\u00a0\nand low load non-failure condition. All four conditions involved training the\u00a0\nunilateral leg extension for 3 sets per session,\u00a0\u00a0 twice per week for 12 weeks. The high load failure condition\u00a0\ninvolved performing repetitions\u00a0\u00a0 to failure every set with an 80% one-rep max load. The high load non-failure condition, also with\u00a0\nan 80% one-rep max load, involved performing\u00a0\u00a0 repetitions to just before they felt they were\u00a0\ngoing to fail. Based on the data provided,\u00a0\u00a0 it's likely this ended up being 1 to 3\u00a0\nrepetitions away from failure per set. The low load failure condition\u00a0\ninvolved performing repetitions\u00a0\u00a0 to failure every set with a 30% one-rep max load. The low load nonfailure condition,\u00a0\nwith a 30% one-rep max load,\u00a0\u00a0 involved performing repetitions to just\u00a0\nbefore they felt they were going to fail.\u00a0\u00a0 Again, this likely ended up being 1 to\u00a0\n3 repetitions away from failure per set. By the end of the study, increases in vastus\u00a0\nlateralis cross-sectional area were similar\u00a0\u00a0 between all four conditions, indicating regardless\u00a0\nif an 80% or 30% one-rep max load is used,\u00a0\u00a0 stopping 3 to 1 reps away from failure is no less\u00a0\neffective than training to failure for growth. As a separate point, it's worth noting this\u00a0\nNobrega study nicely demonstrates a point we've\u00a0\u00a0 covered in other videos, that loads as light as\u00a0\n30% one-rep max can build muscle very effectively. Moving on to the third paper, a 2015\u00a0\nAustralian study by Sampson & Groeller\u00a0\u00a0 had 28 previously untrained men\u00a0\nperform a bicep curling-like exercise\u00a0\u00a0 for 4 sets with an 85% one-rep max\u00a0\nload, three times per week for 12 weeks. One group of subjects performed all their\u00a0\nsets with repetitions to failure with a\u00a0\u00a0 2-second lifting and 2-second lowering speed.\u00a0\nThis group ended up averaging 6 reps per set. A second group performed only\u00a0\n4 repetitions per set with a\u00a0\u00a0 2-second lowering and maximal lifting\u00a0\nspeed. Based on the numbers provided,\u00a0\u00a0 this group would have been an average of\u00a0\n2 repetitions away from failure each set. A third group also performed\u00a0\nonly 4 repetitions per set,\u00a0\u00a0 but they used a maximal lowering\u00a0\nand maximal lifting speed.\u00a0\u00a0 This group would have also been an average\u00a0\nof 2 repetitions away from failure each set. Although not major, there are some\u00a0\nslight limitations with this study. As you likely noticed, the three different\u00a0\ngroups used different repetition speeds,\u00a0\u00a0 which is potentially confounding. However,\u00a0\nas described in our time under tension video,\u00a0\u00a0 individual repetition speeds between 0.5-8 seconds\u00a0\nappear similarly effective for muscle growth,\u00a0\u00a0 so the use of different repetition speeds in\u00a0\nthis study is probably not a major concern. Also, groups two and three, who both stopped\u00a0\nroughly 2 reps away from failure each set,\u00a0\u00a0 actually performed an additional one\u00a0\nset of repetitions to failure each week.\u00a0\u00a0 However, I doubt this would\u00a0\nsignificantly impact the outcomes. Anyway, by the end of the study, increases in\u00a0\nelbow flexor cross-sectional area (consisting\u00a0\u00a0 of the biceps and brachialis) were\u00a0\nsimilar between all three groups,\u00a0\u00a0 suggesting stopping 2 reps away from failure can\u00a0\nbe comparably effective to training to failure. As a small summary thus far, these three\u00a0\nstudies overviewed indicate stopping 3\u00a0\u00a0 or fewer repetitions from failure can be\u00a0\nequivalently effective for building muscle\u00a0\u00a0 versus training to failure. However, all three of these studies were\u00a0\nconducted on previously untrained individuals.\u00a0\u00a0 One could suggest these results should be expected\u00a0\nin untrained individuals, as they would be highly\u00a0\u00a0 responsive regardless of how close they get to\u00a0\nfailure with their repetitions on an exercise.\u00a0\u00a0 They may suggest that different results\u00a0\nmay arise in trained individuals. Fortunately, the fourth paper, a 2020 Brazillian\u00a0\nstudy by Santanielo et al. was conducted on 14 men\u00a0\u00a0 with an average of 5.1 years of\u00a0\ntraining experience. They had an\u00a0\u00a0 average body weight of 74.4kg and could leg\u00a0\npress an average of 237.5kg before the study. Subjects trained both the unilateral\u00a0\nleg press and unilateral leg extension,\u00a0\u00a0 twice per week for 10 weeks. A great thing about this study was the\u00a0\nresearcher's individualized set numbers.\u00a0\u00a0 More precisely, the researchers noted how many\u00a0\nsets per week the subjects performed for the\u00a0\u00a0 quadriceps before the study, and then the subjects\u00a0\nperformed 20% more for the study's duration. For example, if a subject performed 15 weekly\u00a0\nsets for the quadriceps before the study,\u00a0\u00a0 they performed 18 weekly sets (a 20%\u00a0\nincrease) for the quadriceps in this study.\u00a0\u00a0 These 18 weekly sets were equally divided\u00a0\nbetween the leg press and leg extension. With one leg, subjects performed\u00a0\nevery set with repetitions to failure. With their other leg, they performed every\u00a0\nset with repetitions to a point before\u00a0\u00a0 failure. The data provided suggest\u00a0\nthey mostly ended up stopping their\u00a0\u00a0 sets around 3 to 1 repetitions away from failure. By the end of the study, increases in vastus\u00a0\nlateralis cross-sectional area were similar\u00a0\u00a0 between both legs, suggesting stopping 3\u00a0\nto 1 repetitions away from failure is still\u00a0\u00a0 similarly effective to training\u00a0\nto failure in trained individuals. So, considering the totality of the current\u00a0\nliterature, it appears in previously untrained\u00a0\u00a0 and trained individuals, training to failure\u00a0\nis not a must. Stopping 3 to 1 repetitions\u00a0\u00a0 away from failure appears equivalently\u00a0\ncapable of eliciting muscle hypertrophy. Indeed, these results make sense mechanistically. Mechanical tension is currently the\u00a0\nbest-categorized stimulus for muscle hypertrophy,\u00a0\u00a0 and it's quite likely stopping 3\u00a0\nto 1 repetitions away from failure\u00a0\u00a0 elicits sufficient mechanical tension levels. Let me explain. Mechanical tension is equal to the\u00a0\nforce generated by muscle fibers. Components within muscle\u00a0\nfibers, called mechanosensors,\u00a0\u00a0 detect forces produced by the muscle fiber and\u00a0\ntransduces these forces into a signaling cascade\u00a0\u00a0 that results in muscle protein synthesis (which\u00a0\nare the proteins that make our muscles bigger). It's worth exploring the concept of\u00a0\nmotor units to further understand\u00a0\u00a0 overall mechanical tension and why\u00a0\ntraining to failure may not be necessary. A motor unit refers to a single motor neuron\u00a0\nand the multiple muscle fibers it innervates.\u00a0\u00a0 When the single motor neuron sends an electrical\u00a0\nsignal through to the muscle fibers it innervates,\u00a0\u00a0 those muscle fibers produce force. Within a whole muscle, a variety of motor\u00a0\nunits with different characteristics exist. In general, these characteristics\u00a0\nlikely lie across a spectrum,\u00a0\u00a0 with low threshold motor units on one end, and\u00a0\nhigh threshold motor units on the other end. Typically, a low-threshold motor unit consists of\u00a0\na small motor neuron that innervates slow-twitch\u00a0\u00a0 muscle fibers that produce low amounts of force\u00a0\nbut are highly fatigue resistant. Due to this,\u00a0\u00a0 low-threshold motor units are described as\u00a0\nhighly fatigue resistant but low force-producing. A high-threshold motor unit generally consists of\u00a0\na large motor neuron that innervates fast-twitch\u00a0\u00a0 muscle fibers that produce high amounts of\u00a0\nforce but are highly fatigable. Therefore,\u00a0\u00a0 high-threshold motor units are described\u00a0\nas high-force producing but very fatigable. For maximizing overall mechanical tension (and\u00a0\nthus the stimulus for overall muscle growth),\u00a0\u00a0 we'd want to recruit as many motor\u00a0\nunits as possible during an exercise\u00a0\u00a0 (from the low-threshold motor units all the\u00a0\nway up to the high-threshold motor units). Furthermore, we'd likely want the individual\u00a0\nmotor units to produce at least decent degrees\u00a0\u00a0 of their respective force capacities for a fair\u00a0\nduration. The precise details of this will differ\u00a0\u00a0 depending on the motor unit in question. Remember,\u00a0\nlow-threshold motor units have overall low-force\u00a0\u00a0 producing capacities but can sustain these forces\u00a0\nfor a long time. Conversely, high-threshold motor\u00a0\u00a0 units have overall high-force producing capacities\u00a0\nbut cannot sustain these forces for very long. Here's the main points: Firstly, It's not clear when you\u00a0\nreach maximal motor unit recruitment,\u00a0\u00a0 and the motor unit literature indicates\u00a0\nthis can differ between muscles. However, the literature indicates this is\u00a0\nlikely achieved a fair while before failure. For instance, one study suggests maximal\u00a0\nmotor unit recruitment for the shoulder\u00a0\u00a0 and trap muscles may be obtained\u00a0\n3-5 repetitions before failure. Secondly, by the time you've reached failure,\u00a0\u00a0 it's quite likely many motor units\u00a0\n(particularly the high-threshold motor units)\u00a0\u00a0 are past producing their highest\u00a0\nforces and are instead just fatiguing. Remember, it's tension (analogous to force)\u00a0\u00a0 that's categorized as a prime stimulus for muscle\u00a0\nhypertrophy. The idea that more motor unit fatigue\u00a0\u00a0 is beneficial for muscle hypertrophy is\u00a0\nnot supported by the current literature. A motor unit modeling study by Potvin and\u00a0\nFuglevand demonstrates our points nicely. Their model included 7 different motor\u00a0\nunits, ordered in terms of thresholds. Motor unit 1 was the lowest threshold motor unit,\u00a0\u00a0 while motor unit 120 was the\u00a0\nhighest threshold motor unit. The graph on-screen depicts the\u00a0\ncontribution of each motor unit to a 50%\u00a0\u00a0 maximal isometric contraction held until failure.\u00a0\nThe total contraction lasted 100 seconds. Except for motor unit 120, all of the other motor\u00a0\u00a0 units were recruited from\u00a0\nthe onset of contraction. Motor units 1, 20, 40, and 60 produced steady low\u00a0\nforces throughout the full contraction duration.\u00a0\u00a0 This makes sense, these would be\u00a0\nconsidered the low-threshold motor units\u00a0\u00a0 (which produce low forces but\u00a0\nare highly fatigue resistant). Motor unit 80, a higher-threshold motor\u00a0\nunit, produced its most force for the\u00a0\u00a0 set at the start of the contraction,\u00a0\nwhere it thereafter gradually fatigued. Motor unit 100, a higher-threshold motor\u00a0\nunit, continued to increase its force\u00a0\u00a0 contribution up until the 65-second\u00a0\nmark, and thereafter began to fatigue. Motor unit 120, the highest-threshold motor\u00a0\nunit, was recruited at the 70-ish second mark,\u00a0\u00a0 and steeply increased its force contribution\u00a0\nup until the 95-ish second mark,\u00a0\u00a0 where it then steeply fatigued. This data demonstrates motor unit recruitment,\u00a0\u00a0 as well as the maintenance of at least decent\u00a0\namounts of respective force production from\u00a0\u00a0 the individual motor units, is achieved\u00a0\nbefore failure. At the point of failure,\u00a0\u00a0 no additional motor units nor enhancements\u00a0\nin individual motor units force occurred. This probably explains why\u00a0\ntraining 3 to 1 repetitions\u00a0\u00a0 away from failure is sufficient for muscle growth. I should restate this data was from\u00a0\nmodeling isometric contractions. Recruitment patterns and strategies\u00a0\nlikely differ between isometric\u00a0\u00a0 and the isotonic contractions that\u00a0\noccur during your typical exercises. However, I'm unaware of any reason to\u00a0\nbelieve that the main point (that failure\u00a0\u00a0 offers no additional motor unit recruitment or\u00a0\nenhancements in individual motor units force)\u00a0\u00a0 would not also be the same\u00a0\nwith isotonic contractions. In summary, the current literature,\u00a0\nas well as mechanistic rationale,\u00a0\u00a0 likely indicate stopping 3 to\u00a0\n1 repetitions away from failure\u00a0\u00a0 is similarly effective to training\u00a0\nto failure for muscle hypertrophy. Now, some may be thinking in the real world,\u00a0\u00a0 away from the laboratory in which\u00a0\nresearchers can verify proximity to failure,\u00a0\u00a0 an individual may not actually be able to\u00a0\naccurately estimate how close to failure they are. For example, an individual may think they've\u00a0\nstopped 3 repetitions away from failure,\u00a0\u00a0 but in actuality, they may have been 5 or\u00a0\neven more repetitions away from failure. This is a very solid point. In the next video,\u00a0\nwe'll explore some interesting recent research\u00a0\u00a0 that can help an individual become more accurate\u00a0\nat predicting how far from failure they are. In the video after that,\u00a0\u00a0 we'll be exploring something that many may have\u00a0\nbeen thinking about throughout this video. That\u00a0\u00a0 is, could stopping more than 3 repetitions away\u00a0\nfrom failure still optimize muscle hypertrophy? Specifically, there's some really\u00a0\nintriguing velocity-based research\u00a0\u00a0 that potentially indicates,\u00a0\nunder certain conditions,\u00a0\u00a0 training farther than 3 repetitions away\u00a0\nfrom failure could optimize hypertrophy."

    "transcript": "foreign [Music] we introduced a 2017 review study out of the USA that made bold statements about how long it takes for muscle growth to Plateau they suggest growth of the upper and lower body muscles plateaus within three months with trained individuals unlikely to see further appreciable muscle growth we noted how the experiments used to support these controversial conclusions had limitations none of them mentioned and thus likely optimized nutritional factors such as calorie and protein intake two things crucial for long-term muscle growth and all of them although applying Progressive overload had subjects train each muscle with only one exercise involved no rep range variation and no change in the number of sets performed these are limitations as some exercise variety per muscle group may be beneficial for sustaining long-term gains and growing more regions across a muscle moreover some evidence suggests training with a variety of rep ranges could lead to more long-term muscle growth finally increasing set numbers seems to be an effective way to potentiate muscle growth and get past plateaus in trained individuals however I still saw a few people in the comments dejected that there's evidence muscle growth may show Plateau signs within three months with some even saying this is why Peds are useful needless to say this is not what I wanted people to take away I was trying to demonstrate that by optimizing your training sustained long-term natural muscle growth is absolutely possible nonetheless I've searched the literature even further and would like to share a few of my findings that I believe can be highly useful and informative for those wishing to develop their physiques moreover all the upcoming data should make you rest assured natural muscle growth can progress for a long time we'll be touching on factors such as body recomposition sleep individualization and the power of the mind this is going to be a fun one let's get into it

guarantee Link in the description thank you to Atlas VPN for supporting the house of hypertrophy back to the video [Music] the previous video I noted alongside protein intake eating more calories to put you in a surplus leads to Greater muscle growth in previously untrained and trained folks the importance of a caloric Surplus when maximizing muscle growth becomes greater than more trained you get for one reason or another many folks may not like a surplus due to the associated fat gain fortunately the literature demonstrates that trained individuals can still experience good muscle mass gains with little to no fat accrual provided protein intake is in the recommended range of 1.6 to 2.2 grams per kilogram of body weight a 2006 study out of Australia recruited trained men who bench pressed an average 84 kilograms and backscorth in an average 80 kilograms in other words they Skip Leg Day subjects trained this program for 10 weeks subjects did not increase their calories versus before the study and were likely not in a surplus one group of subjects supplemented with whey protein while another group supplemented with casein both groups ultimately consumed around 2 to 2.2 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight daily the way supplement group saw a concurrent increase in lean mass with decreases in fat Mass while the casein group saw smaller increases in lean mass with little change in fat Mass this study seemingly indicates whey protein is superior to casein yet I should note another study found both to be similar thus the differences in this study could just be related to the small sample sizes in any event I mentioned this data to demonstrate that trained individuals can still experience a good increase in lean mass with little changes or even decreases in fat Mass a 2015 study out of the USA recruited 32 trained men who squatted 120 kilograms benched 102 kilograms and deadlifted 158 kilograms these subjects didn't seem to Skip Leg Day subjects trained this program for four weeks with one group supplementing some mixed ingredient supplement while another group took a placebo unfortunately calorie and protein intakes were not mentioned but both a supplement and placebo group saw increases in lean mass with little changes in fat Mass the placebo group actually tended to lose fat so again this study demonstrates that trained individuals can see good increases in lean mass with little changes or decreases in fat Mass a 2018 study out of the USA recruited 28 trained men who squatted 138 kilograms benched 103 kilograms and deadlifted 163 kilograms all subjects perform the same number of sets per week on their exercises but one group trained their exercises with a frequency of three times per week while another group trained their exercises with a frequency of 6 times per week calorie and protein intakes were unfortunately not mentioned but both groups similarly increased fat-free Mass the greater gains for the six times group were non-significant while fat decreased in the three times group with minimal changes in the six times group finally a 2019 study Act of Brazil recruited 23 trained men who bench pressed 103 kilograms and squatted 132 kilograms one group trained with a bro split style routine while another group trained with a full body routine the number of sets performed on each exercise per week was the same between groups subjects were consuming what appeared to be maintenance calories and they consumed around 1.9 grams of protein per kilogram of body weight daily ultimately both groups similarly increase lean mass fat Mass was not mentioned but given subjects were eating around maintenance fat Mass gains are unlikely so these studies collectively demonstrate that trained individuals are capable of increasing lean mass with little to no fat changes provided protein intake is sufficient moreover as alluded to by some of the data body recomposition that is increasing muscle while losing fat is also possible in trained individuals there's ample literature indicating body recomposition can occur in trained individuals to set this up you may do the following firstly a caloric deficit is your surest bet to ensure fat loss but too much of a deficit will impair lean mass gains a recent 2021 meta-analysis indicates a 500 calorie deficit maybe the point where lean must gain cease when resistance training so a deficit smaller than 500 calories is recommended secondly ensuring adequate protein intake in the range of 1.6 to 2.2 grams per kilogram of body weight is likely required of course the more and more trained you get the more difficult it is to attain body recomposition but so long as you're not super Advanced and really close to your genetic ceiling the literature overviewed convincingly demonstrates that trained individuals can see gains in muscle mass with little change or decreases in fat Mass as a final point for the section recall that the review study mentioned at the start of the video indicated trained individuals are unlikely to see further appreciable gains yet all the data we've overviewed in this section strongly opposed this the trained individuals saw appreciable adaptations [Music] in the studies that review study used to support the idea muscle growth plateaus in three months none of them mentioned sleep the fact is sleep matters for adaptations it may be even more important for adaptations if you're eating at a maintenance or a deficit a 2018 study out of the USA recruited 36 individuals classed as obese and had them reduce their caloric intake by 29 to 43 percent Group 1 slept as normal sleeping around six to seven hours per night group two slept one hour less than usual for five days a week this ended up in them sleeping five to six hours per night while during the other two days of the week they slept however long they wanted this ended up being seven to eight hours of sleep after eight weeks both groups lost similar body mass however group one who slept normally lost way more fat mass than muscle mass while group 2 lost way more muscle mass than fat Mass now neither group lifted weights and the subjects were untrained obese individuals but still this study powerfully demonstrates how just one hour of sleep restriction for five days a week negatively impacts body composition changes other research demonstrate sleep restriction lowers muscle protein synthesis increases cortisol a catabolic hormone and lowest testosterone an anabolic hormone so ensuring you attain a sufficient quantity and quality of sleep is important for promoting long-term muscle and fat tissue alterations [Music] something I wish I did in the previous video was present research showing trained individuals still respond well to training there's ample evidence finding this and this research directly opposes that review studies hypothesis that trained individuals will not experience further appreciable adaptations now we've already overviewed some of the research with the literature finding that trained individuals still experience good lean mass gains even without a caloric Surplus but I think it's useful to look at some more and some of these upcoming studies will provide further useful information this 2019 study out of Brazil recruited 20 trained men with an average 94 kilogram bench press and an average 125 kilogram back squat one group trained their muscles once a week while another twice a week the number of exercise sets performed each week was the same between groups ultimately both groups saw comparable and notable increases in triceps biceps vastus lateralis and anterior quadriceps growth the percentage gains range from 5 to 11 in thickness which is still notable and non-trivial gains a 2015 study out of New York recruited 18 men with an average bench press of around 101 kilograms and a back score of 121 kilograms subjects trained these exercises for three sets per session Thrice per week for eight weeks Group 1 trained with 8 to 12 reps to failure per set and the second group with 25 to 35 reps to failure ultimately both groups saw comparable and notable increases in biceps triceps and quadriceps for Morris growth the percentages range from five to nine percent in thickness another 2016 study out of New York recruited 13 men with an average 93 kilogram bench press and an average 118 kilogram back squat subjects trained these exercises for three sets of 8-12 reps to failure per session Thrice per week for eight weeks one group rested three minutes between sets a second group rested one minute between sets ultimately both group saw gains and biceps triceps anterior quadriceps and vastus lateralis but the gains were greater for the group resting for three minutes this finding is consistent with the rest of the literature with compound exercises specifically compound exercises were mainly trained in the study 2.5 to 3 minutes of rest tends to produce greater muscle growth versus shorter Restorations this finding emphasizes how optimizing variables can meaningfully promote greater growth in trained individuals another notable variable is individualizing your exercise selection not everyone has the same anatomy and preferences and this can matter for muscle growth we covered this in a previous video but it's worth briefly overviewing this interesting study again 17 men who back squatted an average 140 kilograms and bench pressed an average 110 kilograms were recruited subjects were assigned to a fixed or auto-regulated group the fixed group was given this program to train weekly the auto regulated group was free to select what exercises they wanted to train per Master group each session from a wide list all other training variables were the same between groups by the end of the nine-week study duration lean body mass gains were greater for the auto regulated group presumably at least some of this result is due to trained individuals having a good understanding of what exercises work best for them leading to better muscle adaptations so individualizing your exercise selection can be important [Music] a seriously underrated aspect of progressing in anything including muscle and strength is your mindset there's compelling research demonstrating the power your mind can have on your gains I have a whole video on the research behind this feel free to check that out but to give you an idea this study included power lifters who benched an average 189 kilograms squatted an average 257 kilograms and deadlifted an average 260 kilograms so these subjects were very very strong prior to testing one rep Maxes again on these exercises the researchers gave the power lifters immediate acting steroids however the subjects were unaware it was not steroids at all rather just a mere Placebo pill after taking the fake steroids all subjects hit personal records the subject's wondering Maxes were an average 9.5 kilograms higher on the bench press 12.2 kilograms higher on the squat and 10.9 kilograms higher on the deadlift versus Baseline fascinatingly the authors noted these performance increases represented a change from being nationally ranked to being internationally ranked for all subjects these results demonstrate the potency of the Mind the subjects did not consume steroids it was a placebo meaning that added strength gains came from within the subjects they held that capacity within them again feel free to check out our whole video on the mind but due to all this I think it's essential for individuals to stay optimistic on their muscle and strength building Journey it's likely detrimental to have the mindset you're going to Plateau or you can't progress much further for the majority of the people watching this this is probably not true anyway I think it's best to establish a mindset believing you have more potential than you previously believed with all the added information in this video I hope everyone rested assured that muscle growth can very much continue well in the long term we've gone through numerous areas of the literature demonstrating that trained individuals still experience notable muscle growth and this evidence disproves that review studies conclusions that trained individuals will not see further appreciable growth we've touched on how even in the absence of a caloric Surplus trained individuals can still see notable lean mass gains we also noted the importance of sleep for muscle and fat Mass alterations finally don't underestimate the power of your mind [Music]"

    "published_at": "2022-08-01T11:00:00Z",
    "transcript": "[Music] [Applause] time under tension is widely held to be a fundamental muscle building principle it's simply how long your set lasts it's commonly said extending your time under tension can convert additional muscle hypertrophy where some also suggesting 30 to 60 seconds is the optimal time under tension range for maxing hypertrophy in this video we'll examine the scientific evidence supporting time under tension but we'll also examine the scientific rebuttals to this we'll try and establish whether minimum and maximum time under tension thresholds exist and whether there could be any benefit to only slowing down the lowering phase of an exercise let's dive in [Music] muscle hypertrophy is a result of myofibrillar protein synthesis the creation of the proteins that make our muscles bigger exceeding the rate of myofibrillar protein breakdown the destruction of those same proteins a study out of canada by birds and colleagues indicates a longer time under tension increases myofibrillar protein synthesis more they established when training three sets on the leg extension with a thirty percent one rep max load increases in myofibrillar protein synthesis 24 to 30 hours post training were greater after using a 6 second lifting and 6 second lowering tempo versus a 1 second lifting and 1 second lowering tempo of course time under tension per set were substantially more with a 6 second lifting and lowering tempo three studies out of japan find long-term muscle growth is enhanced with slower repetition speeds that prolong time under tension for example one of the studies by water navy and colleagues had untrained men perform three sets on the leg extension and le curl quadriceps and hamstrings growth was superior after training with a 3 second lifting and 3 second lowering tempo compared to using a 1 second lifting and 1 second lowering tempo furthermore a recent study out of brazil established when equating time under tension between two different rep tempos muscle growth ends up being similar one group performs sets of 12 reps with each rep lasting three seconds in duration while a second group performed sets of six reps with each rep lasting six seconds time under tension per set were 36 seconds for both groups growth of the chest and triceps was similar between both groups so the data overviewed so far collectively suggest time under tension may be integral for muscle hypertrophy but they have notable limitations with the brazil study that equated time under tension between two different rep tempos their results cannot truly suggest time under tension is integral as no comparisons with other time under tension durations were made a 36 second time under tension was the only duration utilized in this paper with the canadian bird and quality study finding greater my fibular protein synthesis with a longer time under tension they did not equate proximity to failure the six second lifting and lowering condition involved performing repetitions to failure the one second lifting and lowering condition did not perform repetitions anywhere close to failure they simply matched the number of reps performed by the six second lifting and lowering condition similarly the three studies out of japan finding greater hypertrophy with slower rep tempos that create longer time under tensions also did not equate proximity to failure as an illustration of this we noted water navy and colleagues found greater cord and hamstrings growth after training with a 3 second lifting and lowering tempo versus a 1 second lifting and lowering tempo however both of these conditions involve performing three sets of eight reps with a fifty percent one rep max load on the leg extension and leg curl with these training variables using the three second lifting and lowering tempo is going to induce much greater fatigue and get you closer to muscular failure versus utilizing a one second lifting and lowering tempo all of this begs the question what happens when we get subjects that perform reps to or close to failure does a longer time under tension or a time under tension in the 30 to 60 second range still end up producing more hypertrophy the answer is no a study out of brazil by lasso rada and colleagues had subjects trained the unilateral leg extension for three to four sets of repetitions to failure with a fifty to sixty percent one rep max load leg one trained with a one second lifting and one second lowering tempo while leg two trained with a three second lowering and three second lifting tempo this produced different time under tension values and leg one involved a couple of sets performed below the 30 second threshold that sometimes proposed to be essential for gains yet growth of the rectus femoris and vastus lateralis ended up being similar between legs one and two another study out of brazil by chavez and colleagues echoes these findings subjects trained the unilateral leg extension for three sets of reps to failure with a 70 or one rep max load some subjects trained one leg with a two second lifting and two second lowering tempo while their other leg used a self-selected tempo that ended up involving an average 0.9 second lifting and 0.9 second lowering tempo time under tension would have been greater for the two second lifting and lowering leg yet gains in vastus lateralis sides were similar between both legs we also have a 2016 meta analysis by schoenfeld and colleagues which combined the findings of four other studies and established when reps were performed to or close to failure individual rep tempos from the range of 0.5 to 8 seconds were comparably effective for evoking muscle growth if we need even more evidence the research on heavy vs light loads provides this numerous studies now indicate so long as reps are performed to or close to failure loads between 30 and 80 percent of one rep max are similarly effective for muscle hypertrophy with thirty percent one rep max loads individuals very generally tend to perform up to thirty to forty reps while with a heavier eighty percent or one rep max load individuals very generally tend to perform between 7 to 12 reps thus the time under tension would be much greater with loads on the lighter side of the spectrum yet they do not evoke any more hypertrophy than heavier loads matter of fact some research indicates loads heavier than eighty percent or warner and max may also be able to evoke substantial hypertrophy but most of these studies did have subjects at extra sets when training with heavier than eighty percent of one red max loads for example schoenfeld and colleagues compared seven sets of three reps per exercise to three sets of 10 reps per exercise both conditions involved reps in close proximity to failure and hypertrophy ended up being similar between both groups the author of this study noted in an instagram post the seven sets of three reps group attained around a measly nine seconds of time under tension per set presumably the time and detention in the groups of the other studies performing five or fewer reps would have been similar thus we have some evidence indicating time under tension values as low as 9 seconds can still be substantially effective for hypertrophy provided overall training volume is sufficient [Music] it's clear to see a wide range of time under tension values are comparable for evoking muscle hypertrophy but there likely exist min and max thresholds as just alluded to we have some evidence indicating time under tension values as low as 9 seconds can still be substantially effective for hypertrophy provided overall training volume is sufficient but what about max thresholds firstly we know endurance exercise such as running cycling or swimming for very long distances involve extreme amounts of time under tension yet they produce minimal muscle hypertrophy but in a more traditional lifting weight scenario a study by shawnka and colleagues provides a potential insight previously untrained women trained the leg press squat and leg extension each for three sets a session a normal group trained with 80 to 85 percent of one rep max loads using a one to two second lifting and one to two second lowering tempo while a super slow group trained with a forty to sixty percent warner max loading using a 10 second lifting and four second lowering tempo the researchers noted both groups trained in close proximity to failure but slow twitch and fast twitch fiber growth from the vastus lateralis muscle ended up being greater for the normal group based on some calculations the super slow group likely attained a time under tension per set between 84 and 140 seconds so somewhere around here could be the max time under tension threshold for optimal gains but we undoubtedly still need more research to evaluate this [Music] what about exclusively slowing and prolonging time under tension in the lowering eccentric phase of an exercise unfortunately the research is unclear and conflicting in this area two studies have found with a preacher curl and using a one second lifting tempo using a 4 second lowering tempo tended to be better for biceps gains versus using a 1 second lowering tempo a limitation is the differences in both these studies were not statistically significant indicating it's not clear if the differences between groups reflect a true difference or are just the result of random variation between groups a study out of japan found with a back squat and using a two second lifting tempo thigh size gains were similar between using a 2 second lowering and 4 second lowering tempo another study out of brazil found with leg extensions and using a 1 second lifting tempo rectus femoris and vastus lateralis gains were similar between using a 2 second low ring and 4 second lowering tempo but vastus medialis gains were greater for the 4 second lowering versus 2 second lowering tempo muddying things even further a study out of the usa found with leg extensions and using a one second lifting tempo gains in anterior thigh at one region were similar between using a one second lowering and two second lowering tempo but gains at another region of the anterior thigh were actually greater for the faster one second lowering tempo all in all more research is needed to elucidate the effects of manipulating the lowering phase [Music] duration so long as you're performing reps to or close to failure a wide range of time under tension values are similarly effective for muscle hypertrophy provided overall training volume is sufficient time under tension values as low as 9 seconds can be viable for evoking significant muscle growth while a time under tension beyond 84 seconds might be sub optimal for gains finally more research is needed to evaluate if there's any benefit to slowing the lowering phase of an exercise exclusively as the current data in this area is unclear and conflicting [Music]"

    "title": "The Science of What INCREASING Testosterone Does to Muscle &amp; Strength",
    "published_at": "2023-02-20T12:00:23Z",
    "transcript": "[Music] previously at the house of hypertrophy we demonstrated that testosterone is simply not the primary determinant of muscle hypertrophy across people people with higher testosterone levels do not consistently see more muscle growth than people with lower testosterone levels it is very possible for someone with lower testosterone levels to build more muscle than a different person with higher testosterone levels quite a few people completely misunderstood this previous video some said the fact people inject testosterone proof testosterone matters for hypertrophy and that the video is wrong this is stupid disappointed in this video who would question the effects of testosterone cope others said when they increase their testosterone their muscle and strength improved don't care what your study says however absolutely nothing mentioned in the video disagrees with what they said they are providing counter arguments to an argument I didn't actually make the first minor point is the data in the video examined testosterone levels within the normal range something mentioned in the first few seconds of the video plus it was evident the data involves subjects with normal levels but the more critical point is the data in the video examined the between people relationship between testosterone and muscle hypertrophy not within person effects of testosterone I made this point in the video itself as some folks seemingly missed it let me briefly explain it further consider this question do people with higher testosterone levels always grow more than people with lower testosterone levels the between people data answers this question and the answer is no as mentioned it is very possible for someone with lower testosterone levels to build more muscle than a different person with higher test testosterone levels the reason for this is numerous factors regulate a person's muscle hypertrophy imagine one person's testosterone levels are 400 nanograms per deciliter but all the other Regulators of hypertrophy are quote unquote to maximized for them imagine a different person with testosterone levels of 900 nanograms per deciliter but all the other Regulators of hypertrophy are quote unquote minimized for them the person with 900 nanograms per deciliter of testosterone won't build more muscle in fact the person with 400 nanograms per deciliter might build more muscle but now consider this question does increasing the testosterone levels of a single person increase their muscle this is a different question no longer are we dealing with differences in the other Regulators of hypertrophy between people therefore the between people data does not answer this precise question again I made this point in the video and I said the next video the one you're watching now will answer the question does increasing the testosterone levels of a single person increase their muscle and strength let's Dive In increasing a person's testosterone levels predominantly does not increase the muscle and strength they build directly from training rather it primarily does something else let me explain the seemingly ludicrous statement this famous paper assigned to men with normal testosterone levels into one or four groups one group lifted weights naturally a second group lifted weights while injecting 600 milligrams of testosterone enanthate weekly elevating their testosterone to suprophysiological levels a third group also injected 600 milligrams of testosterone per week but they did no weight training a fourth group did not train nor inject testosterone we don't need to worry about this group here are the quadriceps cross-sectional area triceps cross-sectional area bench press strength and squat strength gains for each group for the muscle measurements gains were Superior in the weights plus testosterone group followed by the testosterone only group and then the weights only group for the strength strength measures gains were Superior for the weights plus testosterone group followed by the weights only group and then the testosterone only group some may be thinking hang on a minute the weights plus testosterone groups are the largest gains so doesn't this prove testosterone increase the gains directly from training no we need to look at the numbers closer take the quadriceps cross-sectional area measurements the testosterone only groups saw a 6.7 increase while the weights only group saw a 5.4 increase adding them together we get 12.1 percent which is close to the 13.7 increase seen by the weights plus testosterone group thus increasing testosterone didn't really enhance their gains directly from training in other words there wasn't really much of a synergistic effect instead increasing testosterone produces gains independent from training increasing what we can call your Baseline muscle and strength these Baseline muscle and strength gains are just added to whatever gains you experience from training therefore we can say testosterone has an additive effect on muscle and strength not really a synergistic effect we see the same thing with the triceps cross-sectional area and strength measurements the gains were largely additive between testosterone and weights now this is only one paper do other studies support this idea this study recruited older men with testosterone levels in the low normal end and assigned them into one or four groups one group lifted weights naturally a second group lifted weights while injecting 100 milligrams of testosterone enanthae weekly elevating their testosterone to 656 nanograms per deciliter a third group also injected 100 milligrams of testosterone per week elevating their levels to 595 nanograms per deciliter but they did no weight training a fourth group did not train nor inject testosterone we don't need to worry about this group now although the group supplementing with 100 milligrams of testosterone enanthate per week had these average normal levels these levels were measured seven days after injections this matters because injections can produce temporary Peaks and testosterone levels for a few days after the injection which would have subsided after seven days for example this data set here shows with 100 milligrams of testosterone and Anthony levels can rise to 1 200 nanograms per deciliter for one to two days and then lower down to 800 nanograms per deciliter by the seventh day so be aware there would have been time periods where testosterone levels were above the ones reported and probably net or within Supra physiological ranges the same logic applies to the previous study we just mentioned the testosterone levels were reported seven days after injections and although these levels were super physiological there would have been times where levels were even higher back to the study at hand the lower body was only trained and after 10 weeks leglin Mass gains were Superior in the weights plus testosterone group followed by the testosterone only group and then the weights only group the testosterone only groups or a 1.07 kilogram increase in leglin Mass while the weights only group saw a 0.49 kilogram increase adding them together we get 1.56 kilograms which is close enough to the 1.41 kilogram increase seen by the weights Plus testosterone group so increasing testosterone didn't improve gains directly from training rather it increases your Baseline muscle which gets added to the gains you'd always get from training as a small note lean body mass includes things on top of muscle mass so be mindful that these values may not entirely reflect muscle mass changes leg press strength gains were largest in the weights plus testosterone group followed by similar gains between the weights only and testosterone only group interestingly the game seen by the weights plus testosterone group was slightly less than additive in this case nonetheless this data still supports that I did testosterone isn't improving your strength gains directly from training a third study recruited older men with testosterone levels on the low end of the normal range and assign them into one or four groups one group lifted weights naturally a second group lifted weights while applying a testosterone cream daily resulting in slight testosterone elevations to 458 nanograms per decided a third group also applied a testosterone cream daily resulting in slight testosterone elevations to 405 nanograms per deciliter but they did no weight training a fourth group did not weight train nor apply a testosterone gel we don't need to worry about this group since a daily cream was used by the groups increasing their testosterone we don't need to be worried about significant temporary Peaks lean body mass increased by 1.4 Kilograms for the weights plus testosterone group and 0.7 kilograms each for the testosterone only in weights only group demonstrating the effects of testosterone were additive not synergistic to that of weight training strength was measured on a range of exercises some demonstrate additive effects of testosterone on weight training While others did not this might indicate testosterone may not consistently influence strength [Music] in the previous section we saw this study which involves subjects elevating their testosterone levels to suprophysiological amounts this large increase in testosterone produced significant effects on Baseline muscle and strength a lot of you would have noticed the muscle gains produced by being supplied with testosterone and not training were greater versus weight training naturally although this wasn't the case with strength gains testosterone only still produce notable Baseline gains so large changes in testosterone powerfully increase your Baseline muscle and strength something supported by a fair number of other studies for example this study recruited men with very low testosterone levels due to various conditions and treated them with 100 milligrams of testosterone enanthate per week for 10 weeks average testosterone levels increased up to 767 nanograms per deciliter by week 10. but again the researchers didn't measure the peak level so be aware there would have been times when testosterone levels were greater than this their fat-free Mass increased by 5 kilograms triceps cross-sectional area by 12 their quadriceps cross-sectional area by eight percent their bench press strength by 22 percent and their Squatch strength by a massive 45 percent no resistance training was involved in this study so large changes in testosterone can elicit massive gains speaking about significant gains if you're ever going to make significant progress consistency

extreme increase in testosterone around 100 nanograms per deciliter or less since daily creams were used in this study we don't need to be worried about significant temporary Peaks this less extreme testosterone increase produced trivial effects and strength since weights only produce much greater increases than the testosterone Administration only as for lean mess interestingly testosterone Administration only was as effective as weight training only for gains however the lean mass increase was only 0.7 kilograms which is certainly something but it also isn't that massive also although the weights only saw the same 0.7 kilogram lean mass increase the effectiveness of the weight training in this specific study for muscle gains is questionable circuit training with short risk was used and it isn't clear how close the failure subjects got in other studies using more traditional weight training programs involving subjects going too on their failure it's not uncommon see trained individuals gaining over one kilogram of lean mass in six weeks as a reminder lean body mass is not necessarily exclusively reflective of muscle mass changes so just be mindful of that throughout this section nonetheless this study indicates less extreme changes in testosterone can still increase Baseline muscle and strength but the effects are expectedly far from large additional studies support this this study recruited healthy men with testosterone in the normal range and supplied them with 100 milligrams of testosterone enanthate per week fortunately these researchers measured the peak levels from the injections and it was 1196 nanograms per deciliter measured 24 hours after the injection level seven days after this was 735 nanograms per deciliter no resistance training was involved in this study no strength measures were assessed but their lean mass increased by 1.3 kilograms after 8 weeks a fair but not massive change also remember Peak levels of testosterone did reach 1196 nanograms per deciliter so technically the increase in testosterone in this study may not fall under the category of less extreme increases another study recruited healthy men with testosterone in the normal range and then suppressed natural testosterone production with gocerellin all while subjects either received a placebo gel 1.25 gram 2.5 gram 5 gram or 10 grams of testosterone gel daily the graph shows the average testosterone levels each group had throughout the treatment the first four groups either decreased or saw similar testosterone levels to Baseline while the fifth group saw an increase in testosterone to an average of 805 nanograms per deciliter the subject in this fifth group increased their thigh muscle area and leg press strength while subjects in the other four groups did not consistently see this since this study used daily gel application we don't really have to worry about Peak levels so around a 300 nanogram deciliter increase in testosterone Australian benefited Baseline muscle and strength but the gains were small in the range of two to four percent now all of the studies in this section still use non-natural ways to produce these less extreme testosterone increases can you increase testosterone through natural means the answer is of course yes but there are certainly nuances the most supported ways appear to be through managing body fat levels correcting nutritional deficiencies nailing down sleep and avoiding excessive chronic stress let me know if you're interested enough in this and I can make a video on the literature surrounding optimizing natural testosterone levels I can also analyze testosterone boosting supplements to determine if they are truly able to do as they claim understandably folks wish to optimize their testosterone levels but I should just mention you shouldn't be under the illusion natural increases in testosterone levels have a large impact on Baseline muscle and strength as shown the effects are fairly small [Music] combining this information with the previous video when you compare between people those with higher testosterone levels do not necessarily see more gains than those with lower testosterone levels but within a single person increasing their testosterone levels increases their muscle and strength it predominantly does so not by improving your gains directly from training rather it just increases your Baseline muscle and strength remember that the biggest gains in Baseline muscle and strength are seen with large changes in testosterone which for most people can probably only be attained by non-natural means less extreme increases in testosterone which might be possible naturally in certain cases still benefit Baseline muscle and strength but the gains are much smaller [Music] so increasing your testosterone can increase your Baseline muscle and strength so its logical decreasing your testosterone can decrease your Baseline muscle and strength recall in this study the first four groups either decreased or saw similar testosterone levels to Baseline while the fifth group saw an increase in testosterone to an average of 805 nanograms per deciliter the groups that decrease their testosterone the most sort of loss in thigh muscle area and leg press strength we also have other studies demonstrating this concept this study recruited healthy men with testosterone levels of around 535 nanograms per deciliter and suppress their levels to 31 nanograms per deciliter 10 weeks later their fat-free Mass decreased by 2.1 kilograms if you decrease your testosterone levels notably while training muscle and strength do not improve as much illustrating this is this paper which recruited men with Baseline testosterone levels of around 600 130 to 660 nanograms per deciliter all subjects trained three times per week for eight weeks one group of subjects maintain their normal testosterone levels while another group suppressed their testosterone levels down to 57 to 31 nanograms per deciliter through gosserellin lean mass and isometric strength gains were lower in the group that lowered their testosterone levels at face value these results May lead you to believe having higher testosterone levels increases your gains directly from training and that lower testosterone produces lower gains directly from training but given all the information supplied in this video we know this would likely be an inaccurate takeaway rather it's likely the suppression of testosterone lowered Baseline muscle and strength causing the appearance of lower overall gains if this study had a group that only lowered their testosterone and did no weight training we would likely be able to mathematically see the subtractive effects of lowering testosterone on muscle and strength now although I noted isometric strength gains were lower in the subjects reducing their testosterone leg press and bench press strength gains were actually similar between both groups this may further support the idea of less consistent effects of testosterone on strength foreign [Music] testosterone predominantly increases Baseline muscle and strength yet I do want to mention that our theoretical path through its super physiological testosterone levels May improve muscle and strength directly from training I.E it could have a synergistic effect firstly it is likely super physiological testosterone levels improve your work capacity and ability to recover between training sessions therefore those with super physiological testosterone levels might be able to handle recover and thereby benefit from greater training volume resultantly this is an indirect path through its suprophysiological testosterone technically improves gains from training yet I'm unsure if this point is universally applicable suprophysiological levels or not there's reason to believe not all people benefit from higher volumes of training the reasons for this might be due to things like ribosome biogenesis capacity something I plan to discuss in a book I'm working on secondly elevations the super physiological levels potently increased the number of myonuclei muscle fibers contain in the long term this means you might see more gains from training let me explain muscle fibers contain numerous myonuclei these myonuclei are crucial for directing the formation of the proteins that ultimately make muscle fibers bigger however each myonucleus is believed to oversee a certain amount of space within muscle fibers term the myonuclei domain but there is a limit to the amount of space each myonucleus can oversee so as muscle fibers increase in size the myonuclei domain increases until its limit and from this point further fiber growth cannot occur an increase in my nuclei numbers would be required to enable further fibrocise increases no increases in myonuclei numbers simply from lifting weights naturally can and often do occur but it's likely super physiological testosterone produces a lot more of an increase in myonuclear numbers than can naturally be obtained Pro probably meaning your capacity for increasing muscle fiber sizes in the long term directly from training is greater you may experience fewer plateaus it is not as clear if less extreme testosterone increases I.E not intercept for physiological zones have any meaningful benefit on your ability to recover and your myonuclei numbers my speculation is it might not but future research is required to validate this foreign between people those with higher testosterone levels do not necessarily see more gains than those with lower testosterone levels but within a single person increasing their testosterone levels increases their muscle and strength it predominantly does so not by improving your gains directly from training rather it just increases your Baseline muscle and strength decreasing a person's testosterone levels decreases their Baseline muscle and strength remember that the biggest gains in Baseline muscle and strength are seen with large changes in testosterone which for most people can probably only be attained by non-natural means less extreme increases in testosterone which might be possible naturally in certain cases still benefit muscle and strength but the gains are much smaller having said all this it's worth understanding there are potential paths through its super physiological testosterone levels specifically could improve the gain seen from training over the long term in the next video we're exploring what some suggest to be a hidden key within muscles dictating hypertrophy Androgen receptors finally I have a free Ultimate Guide to bench pressing ebook that covers these areas feel free to get it in the link in the comments and

    "published_at": "2023-03-13T11:59:59Z",
    "transcript": "[Music] welcome to the house of hypertrophy is it a stretch to say that stretching between sets can enhance muscle and strength adaptations a recent study has added to the overall literature examining this let's overview this study and then we'll fit it into the rest of the literature [Music] 22 trained individuals were recruited and assigned into either stretching or normal group all subjects train two biceps focus and two triceps Focus sessions per week for a total of eight weeks the program involved very high volumes including 28 weekly sets for each the biceps and triceps from isolation exercises and if we included the compound exercises it totals up to 46 weekly sets for each the biceps and triceps the program was designed to replicate fst-7 a method created by bodybuilding coach Harney rambot fascia refers to the thin sheets of connective tissue that surrounds organs such as muscle tissue and it's hypothesized people with thicker fascia might have a harder time building muscle the core of fsd7 training involves performing seven sets of an exercise with short rest between them to maximize the pump which is claimed to stretch out the fascia and thereby benefit muscle hypertrophy to be clear fst-7 itself doesn't directly involve stretching between sets rather the claim is the pump is what stretches the muscle From the Inside Out by volumizing it on bodybuilding.com's YouTube channel there are actually a few popular videos documenting some fst-7 workouts so part of this study will actually provide an insight into the potential effectiveness of this training system now I should mention fst-7 typically involves performing 7 sets on a certain exercise only at the end of the workout this particular study actually involved seven sets at the start and end so it's not identical to fsd7 so bear this in mind nevertheless all subjects rested 45 seconds between sets in accordance with fst-7 recommendations and two minutes of rest between exercises were given the normal group simply rested passively between all the sets the stretching group for the first and last exercises in a training session stretch the train muscle so the biceps were stretched on the biceps Focus days and the triceps on the triceps Focus stays the stretches were held for the full duration of the 45 second rest interval at a 70 to 90 percent pain and discomfort level both groups took every set to concentric muscular failure within the 10 to 12 rep range loads were adjusted each set in attempt to maintain subjects training within this rep range per set throughout the training period total calorie protein carbohydrate and fat intake were comparable between groups ultimately total training volume was lower in the stretching group versus the normal group since sets and Reps were the same between both groups we can deduce this means the stretching group lifted lower loads across their sets this makes sense since static stretching can lower muscle Force production the stretching group likely would have had to reduce the loads across their sets to a greater extent to stay within the 10 to 12 rep range causing them to accumulate lower total trading volume versus the normal group despite this lower total trading volume one rep max strength gains on the biceps Co and triceps skull crusher increased comparably between both groups hypertrophy was measured through thickness of the middle biceps region lower brachialis region long head triceps upper region and long hair triceps lower region here are the hypertrophy results showing their average increases for both groups with a 95 confidence interval and the individual data points shown behind essentially there was no difference between both groups except as a long head triceps lower region where average gains actually favored the stretching group however as the researchers mentioned we should be cautious of this finding in my view the individual data underneath doesn't present a convincing picture of stretching between sets producing definitively more hypertrophy at this region many individuals saw similar gains with a few outliers on either side which likely drove the average differences between groups overall there were some pretty lackluster hypertual results for various subjects most subjects lost size in their low causing the average for both groups to reflect a decrease in size for this region various subjects also lost size in other muscle regions concluding the new study stretching between sets largely failed to enhance muscle or strength adaptations we know fsd7 training was replicated in this study using very high volumes and short rests between sets and for various subjects it's evident this style of training produced poor hypertrophy outcomes presumably the excessively High volumes had something to do with these lacklust hypertrophy outcomes including the loss of size at various regions in fact subjects were performing on average 9 to 11 more isolation weekly sets for each of the biceps and triceps versus what they did before the study this abrupt increase in volume for many subjects was probably too much for their body to handle as the researchers describe it could have caused excessive damage in the working muscle that oriented protein synthesis to repair rather than typertrophy to be fair to fsd7 we mentioned this particular study involved seven sets on the first and final exercises of a training session whereas fst-7 normally just involves seven sets on the final exercise it remains possible if the study followed fsd7 normally the results of the study would have been different now this is not to say the study's program was unanimously terrible for everyone since there were some individuals in the study seeing pretty good hypertrophy demonstrating how training can be quite individualized another potential conclusion from this study relates to the pump subjects likely achieved an incredible pump from this style of training remember is claims fsd7 stretches fascia by weight of the pump yet it's crucial I mention I'm unaware of any evidence supporting this notion moreover as we've examined previously at the house of hypertrophy there's minimal evidence suggesting the pump directly or powerfully stimulates hypertrophy and I feel this particular study indirectly further supports this idea since various subjects experience the lackluster hypertrophy no there are numerous ways you can go about structuring a program designed for hypertrophy strength or even endurance with so many options it can be overwhelming but Alpha progression is a phenomenal app that can simplify this process for you the app can generate a high quality program specify your training experience what equipment you

here's a table for all the studies examining the effects of stretching between sets on hypertrophy and strength the first ever study on stretching between sets for hypertrophy did find a muscle I poetry benefit in untrained subjects and one other Study last year found a slight hypertrophy of benefit in one muscle but two other studies and now this new study opposed this one of the studies also found a benefit to stretching between sets for isometric but not leg press strength but this is only one study finding some kind of strength benefit to stretching between sets therefore since the majority of the literature fails to find a benefit we can't say stretching between sets is a validated method to enhance gains now there are different of ways you can stretch between sets from the duration you hold the stretch the pain levels you endure from the stretch and how you transition to the stretch most of the studies are Divergent in these areas making it difficult to pinpoint if a precise method of stretching between sets could be superior I'm wondering if how you transition to the stretch could matter for hypertrophy specifically the majority of the studies in the table involve subjects Upon finishing their final repetitions of a set moving over to perform a stretch however the study last year finding a benefit to stretching between sets for Soleus growth involves subjects immediately transitioning into a weighted stretch after the final repetition of a set this type of stretching between sets could benefit hypertrophy because during the lowering phase of an exercise the elements within muscles that produce stretching forces are in a stiffer State compared to if you just stretched passively and so immediately transitioning into a stretch after the lowering phase theoretically takes advantage of his stiffer stretching forces which could better signal hypertrophy in fact there's another study which I did not include in the table suggesting this type of stretching between sets to be superior it's a study by Silva and colleagues which reports to have found that immediately transitioning into a calf stretch after calf press repetitions benefited gastrocnemius hypertrophy however the reason I did not include this study in the table is because it's not published the results of the study were merely presented at a conference nevertheless it's possible this type of stretching between sets could benefit High poetry more than moving over to perform a static stretch yet more research is needed to verify this and it's worth mentioning in the published Study last year finding a benefit to this type of stretching between sets it only benefited the soleus muscle and the benefit was quite small moreover the gastrocnemius didn't grow more with this type of stretching between sets which conflicts with an unpublished silver study since that reports a greater growth in the gastrocnemius let us not stretch out this video any further and proceed to our summary [Music] with the addition of this new study the majority of the published research fails to find stretching between sets enhances hypertrophy or strength but none of them finds compromised hypertrophy or strength either with stretching between sets the studies are Divergent in the precise ways through which they had subject stretch between sets so it remains possible a particular way to stretch between sets could be superior I'm wondering if immediately transitioning into a stretch after the lowering phase could benefit hypertrophy but there's limited evidence that can properly validate this for the time being finally I have a free Ultimate Guide to bench pressing ebook that covers these areas feel free to get it in the link in the comments

    "title": "Alternating Rep Ranges IMPROVES Muscle Growth?! (18 Studies)",
    "published_at": "2021-03-08T12:44:43Z",
    "transcript": "In the last few videos, we've been going\u00a0\ninto detail with rep ranges. We've evaluated\u00a0\u00a0 if one rep max training can be effective for\u00a0\nbuilding muscle, if reps between 2 and 4  can maximize hypertrophy, and what load may be\u00a0\ntoo light to maximize hypertrophy. I've created\u00a0\u00a0 a rep range playlist from where you can find\u00a0\nthese videos. In this video, we'll explore if\u00a0\u00a0 performing different rep ranges in your training\u00a0\nprogram can help build more muscle compared to\u00a0\u00a0 using only one rep range. Theoretically, different\u00a0\nrep ranges could target different muscle fibers.\u00a0\u00a0 Muscles are generally made up of slow twitch and\u00a0\nfast twitch fibers. Given, slow twitch muscle fibers\u00a0\u00a0 are highly resistant to fatigue and produce low\u00a0\namounts of power, it's suggested higher repetitions\u00a0\u00a0 would grow these fibers more than lower\u00a0\nrepetitions. Conversely, given fast twitch muscle\u00a0\u00a0 fibers are less fatigue resistant but produce\u00a0\nhigher amounts of power, lower repetitions could\u00a0\u00a0 grow these fibers more than higher repetitions.\u00a0\nHowever, when repetitions are performed to\u00a0\u00a0 or very close to failure, the point at which\u00a0\nyou can't perform any more repetitions, the evidence does not support this. A meta-analysis by\u00a0\nJozo Grgic combined the results of 5 studies\u00a0\u00a0 looking at this area. In these 5 studies, the\u00a0\nhigher repetition groups used loads ranging from\u00a0\u00a0 30% to 50% of their one\u00a0\nrep max on an exercise. rResulting in around 20\u00a0\u00a0 to 40 repetitions to failure each set. The lower\u00a0\nrepetition groups used the loads ranging from 75\u00a0\u00a0 % to 90% of their one rep max on an exercise.\u00a0\nResulting in around 3 to 10 repetitions to\u00a0\u00a0 failure each set. Combining the results of the 5\nstudies, growth of slow twitch muscle fibers was\u00a0\u00a0 similar between the higher repetition and lower\u00a0\nrepetition groups. Likewise, growth of fast twitch muscle fibers were similar between the higher\u00a0\nrepetition and lower repetition groups. Now, in this\u00a0\u00a0 meta-analysis, the 95% confidence intervals were\u00a0\nwide. Essentially, meaning we should approach these\u00a0\u00a0 results with some caution. More research in the\u00a0\nfuture will still be helpful. Nevertheless, the idea\u00a0\u00a0 that higher and lower reps do a similar job at\u00a0\ngrowing slow twitch and fast twitch muscle fibers,\u00a0\u00a0 provided those reps are performed to or very\u00a0\nclose to failure, would make sense. Muscle fibers\u00a0\u00a0 are recruited in a progressive sequence. During\u00a0\nlow effort tasks, slow twtich muscle fibers are\u00a0\u00a0 recruited. But as your effort increases, faster\u00a0\ntwitch muscle fibers are gradually recruited.\u00a0\u00a0 When using heavier loads and therefore lower\u00a0\nrepetitions, many slow twitch and fast twitch\u00a0\u00a0 fibers are going to be initially recruited, as your\u00a0\neffort is high straight away. As you near failure,\u00a0\u00a0 more fast twitch fibers are probably recruited\u00a0\nto some degree as well. When using lighter loads\u00a0\u00a0 and therefore higher repetitions, the reps\u00a0\nare going to be fairly low effort initially.\u00a0\u00a0 But as you continue and get closer and closer to\u00a0\nfailure, your effort increases. As a result, research\u00a0\u00a0 indicates you ultimately end up with many slow\u00a0\ntwitch and fast twitch muscle fibers recruited,\u00a0\u00a0 probably similar to what you achieve with heavier\u00a0\nloads. So, the current evidence leans towards\u00a0\u00a0 the idea that higher or lower repetitions\u00a0\ndo not stimulate different muscle fibers.\u00a0\u00a0 However, another potential reason behind why\u00a0\nyou may want to use different rep ranges\u00a0\u00a0 relates to the activation of proteins. At the\u00a0\ncellular level, muscle protein synthesis, so the\u00a0\u00a0 creation of the proteins that make our muscles\u00a0\nbigger, can be traced back to the interaction of\u00a0\u00a0 proteins in a chain like reaction. Lifting weights\u00a0\nkicks off this interaction of proteins. Due to the\u00a0\u00a0 differences in metabolic and mechanical stress\u00a0\nbetween different rep ranges, they could activate\u00a0\u00a0 different proteins. Therefore, using different\u00a0\nrep ranges could be beneficial. Some research\u00a0\u00a0 has indeed found that low and high reps result\u00a0\nin the activation of different proteins. However,\u00a0\u00a0 there is also research finding this not to be the\u00a0\ncase. So it's not completely clear. Nonetheless, let\u00a0\u00a0 us now move on to the actual research exploring\u00a0\nif using different rep ranges builds more muscle\u00a0\u00a0 versus using only one rep range. Schoenfeld and\u00a0\ncolleagues split 19 men with an average of four\u00a0\u00a0 and a half years of training experience into a\u00a0\nconstant or varied group. Both groups train 3 times per week, on non-consecutive days, for 8\u00a0\nweeks. Each session, they trained the bench press,\u00a0\u00a0 overhead press, lat pull down, cable row, back squat, leg press and leg extension for 3 sets each\u00a0\u00a0 and 2 minutes of rest between sets. The constant\u00a0\ngroup for each exercise used a load that allowed\u00a0\u00a0 them to perform 8 to 12 reps to failure\u00a0\neach set. The varied group, on day 1 of each week,\u00a0\u00a0 used a load allowing them to perform 2 to 4\nreps to failure each exercise set. On day 2 of\u00a0\u00a0 each week, a load allowing them to perform 8\nto 12 reps to failure each exercise set, and\u00a0\u00a0 on day 3 of each week, a load allowing them to\u00a0\nperform 20 to 30 reps to failure each exercise set.\u00a0\u00a0 Increases in elbow flexor, triceps brachii, and\u00a0\nvastus lateralis thickness, measured by ultrasound,\u00a0\u00a0 were statistically similar between both\u00a0\ngroups. That said, increases in elbow flexor\u00a0\u00a0 and triceps brachii thickness do appear to favor\u00a0\nthe varied group. I managed to find an article by\u00a0\u00a0 James Krieger, one of the authors of this study,\u00a0\nexploring this more. Looking at the individual\u00a0\u00a0 data for the triceps, there is one clear outlier in\u00a0\nthe varied group. After removing this outlier, the\u00a0\u00a0 results still favor the varied group. Looking\u00a0\nat the individual data for the biceps, after\u00a0\u00a0 removing one outlier from the constant group, \u00a0\nthe results are pretty similar. Looking at the\u00a0\u00a0 individual data for the vastus lateralis, the\u00a0\nresults are similar. So, except for the triceps,\u00a0\u00a0 the varied and constant group experienced similar\u00a0\ngains. It seems likely that the tricep results\u00a0\u00a0 were a result of random variation, as it was not\u00a0\nstatistically significant. Remember, there were only\u00a0\u00a0 19 trained subjects in this study, differences in\u00a0\ngenetics and degree of training experience could\u00a0\u00a0 explain these findings. As a result, this paper\u00a0\noverall suggests using different rep ranges does\u00a0\u00a0 not improve muscle growth. Moving on, De souza and\u00a0\ncolleagues spit 26 untrained men into a constant,\u00a0\u00a0 linear, or daily undulating group. All groups trained\u00a0\nthe smith machine squat and leg extension, 2 per week for 6 weeks. The constant group trained\u00a0\nto each exercise with 8 reps to failure, the\u00a0\u00a0 linear group trained each exercise with 12 reps\u00a0\nto failure for the first 4 week,  and then 8 reps to failure for the last two weeks. The daily\u00a0\nundulating group, for the first 4 weeks, used 12\u00a0\u00a0 reps to failure for each exercise on Monday, and 8\u00a0\nreps to failure on Thursday. For the last 2 weeks,\u00a0\u00a0 they used 10 reps to failure for each exercise on\u00a0\nMonday and 6 reps to failure on Thursday. Increases\u00a0\u00a0 in quadriceps cross-sectional area, measured by\u00a0\nMRI, was similar between all three groups, further\u00a0\u00a0 indicating using different rep ranges is not more\u00a0\neffective than using a constant rep range. Fink\u00a0\u00a0 and colleagues assigned each arm of 21 untrained\u00a0\nmen into a high load, light load, or mix condition.\u00a0\u00a0 All subjects trained the unilateral dumbbell biceps\u00a0\ncurl, 3 times per week, on non-consecutive days,\u00a0\u00a0 for 8 weeks. The high load condition involved\u00a0\n3 sets to failure with an 80% one\u00a0\u00a0 rep max load every session and 2 minutes of rest\u00a0\nbetween sets. Resulting in around 7 to 3 reps per set. The light load condition involved\u00a0\n3 sets to failure with a 30%\u00a0\u00a0 one rep max load every session and 2 minutes\u00a0\nof rest between sets, resulting in around 40 to\u00a0\u00a0 10 reps per set. The mixed condition, throughout\u00a0\nthe 8 weeks, alternated between 2 weeks\u00a0\u00a0 of training with a high load condition, and then\u00a0\n2 weeks of training with a light load condition.\u00a0\u00a0 Increases in elbow flexor cross-sectional area, measured by MRI, were similar between all three\u00a0\u00a0 conditions. Again, suggesting using different rep\u00a0\nranges/loads does not improve muscle growth.\u00a0\u00a0 There are a few other studies comparing the use of\u00a0\ndifferent rep ranges to using a constant rep range.\u00a0\u00a0 However, the issue with these studies is they used\u00a0\nbody composition or circumference measurements.\u00a0\u00a0 These measurements are less sensitive and accurate\u00a0\ncompared to using MRI or ultrasound. Remember,\u00a0\u00a0 the three studies we just looked at used MRI \nor ultrasound. Having said that, the majority\u00a0\u00a0 of these studies still found no difference in\u00a0\nbody composition or circumference measurements\u00a0\u00a0 between using different rep ranges or using\u00a0\na constant rep range. Adding further support\u00a0\u00a0 to the idea using different rep ranges does not\u00a0\nimprove muscle growth. But, two studies did observe\u00a0\u00a0 improved body composition or circumference size\u00a0\nwhen using different rep ranges. Interestingly,\u00a0\u00a0 1 of the studies by Kraemer and colleagues\u00a0\nlasted 9 months. They split 27 untrained women\u00a0\u00a0 into either a constant or varied group. Both groups\u00a0\ntrained 3 times per week for 9 months.\u00a0\u00a0 The constant group performed 8 to\u00a0\n10 reps to failure for all exercises.\u00a0\u00a0 The varied group performed 4 to 6 reps to\u00a0\nfailure for each exercise on day 1 of each week,\u00a0\u00a0 8 to 10 reps to failure on day 2 of each week, and\u00a0\n12 to 15 reps to failure on day 3 of each week.\u00a0\u00a0 Increases in fat free mass, measured by skin fold\u00a0\ncalipers, were significantly greater for the varied\u00a0\u00a0 group. Again, this measurement is not as sensitive\u00a0\nor reliable compared to MRI or ultrasound\u00a0\u00a0 measurements. So we should approach this with\u00a0\nsome caution. But, if the varied group did truly\u00a0\u00a0 experience greater muscle growth, I think there are\u00a0\ntwo potential takeaways. The subjects were women,\u00a0\u00a0 all of the other studies assessed in this video\u00a0\nwere conducted on men. Perhaps using different rep\u00a0\u00a0 ranges improves muscle growth for women, but not\u00a0\nmen. mMore research would be needed to figure this\u00a0\u00a0 out. Secondly, this study lasted 9 months. All of\u00a0\nthe other studies assessed in this video lasted 12\u00a0\u00a0 weeks or less. In the short term, there could be no\u00a0\ndifference between using different rep ranges or\u00a0\u00a0 a constant rep range. But in the longer term, maybe\u00a0\nusing different rep ranges ultimately causes more\u00a0\u00a0 muscle growth. This is an interesting idea. Maybe\u00a0\nusing a constant rep range every session in the\u00a0\u00a0 long term has some sort of desensitizing effect,\u00a0\nmeaning the use of different rep ranges could\u00a0\u00a0 be superior for avoiding this problem. However, this\u00a0\nis just a hypothesis. Given we don't have any other\u00a0\u00a0 research lasting many months, it's difficult to\u00a0\nsay. Hopefully future research adds to this area.\u00a0\u00a0 To conclude, the current evidence leans towards\u00a0\nthe idea that both higher and lower reps produce\u00a0\u00a0 similar slow and fast twitch muscle fiber\u00a0\nhypertrophy, indicating using different rep\u00a0\u00a0 ranges would not be advantageous in this aspect.\u00a0\nMoreover, the overall current research suggests\u00a0\u00a0 that in the short term, using different rep ranges\u00a0\ndoes not improve muscle growth compared to using a\u00a0\u00a0 constant rep range. It remains possible that in\u00a0\nthe long term, using different rep ranges could\u00a0\u00a0 improve muscle growth. Practically, no research has\u00a0\nfound using different rep ranges to be inferior\u00a0\u00a0 to using a constant rep range, so using\u00a0\ndifferent rep ranges is perfectly fine.\u00a0\u00a0 For some, this could make training less monotonous\u00a0\nand more enjoyable. And as discussed, maybe using\u00a0\u00a0 different rep ranges in the longer term\u00a0\nis superior. But, future research is needed.\u00a0\u00a0 If any more research comes out,\u00a0\nI do plan to make updated videos :)"

    "title": "The Most EFFECTIVE Biceps Exercise (Not What You Think)",
    "published_at": "2023-05-07T17:11:02Z",
    "transcript": "foreign [Music] curling exercises can be great for building the biceps for the simple fact they can all involve elbow flexion and supination but let's say you wanted to push me could a certain type of coal be slightly more effective than the wrist maybe I'm wondering if a curling exercise while the shoulders are extended such as drawing an incline curl or face away cable curl might be the single most favorable biceps exercise why am I wondering this due to the origins of the biceps placing the shoulder into extension stretches the biceps particularly the long head since this passes directly over the shoulder joints in recent years the power of achieving a stretch of a muscle during an exercise is becoming apparent though it's worth knowing that the scientific origins of stretch playing a role in hypertrophy stretches back to the 1970s a range of studies conducted on animals found that when having them stretch various muscles with extreme intensity for a long duration muscle hypertrophy occurred even Elite bodybuilders seemingly recognize is the importance of stretch Arnold mentions in his book that incline dumbbell curse are a great exercise alluding to the stretch of being an important factor today we have three areas of the scientific literature in humans showing the power of achieving a stretch during an exercise [Music] the isometric training research is the first for those unaware isometric training is where you hold a muscle in a static position and we have three studies that demonstrate isometric training as a stretch to muscle position produces more hypertrophy than isometric training at a shortened muscle position an important consideration with this data is all three of the studies looked at the quadriceps muscle so we can't be certain the same applies to the biceps however the second area of the scientific research comparing different range of motions potentially indicates that biceps do respond to stretch [Music] foreign studies won by Sato and the other by Pedrosa have compared performing a preacher Co with a partial range of motion at the initial position to a partial range of motion at the final position you can lift heavier loads with a partial range of motion in the final position and this was adjusted for in both studies now preacher curls don't optimally stretch the biceps since this exercise is performed in shoulder flexion even so the subjects in both studies that trained with a partial range of motion at the initial position would have been stretching the biceps more than the subjects training with a partial range of motion at the final position if the biceps do not benefit from being exposed to a stretch we'd expect similar hypertrophy between both groups but the Sato study found elbow flexor growth across three regions tended to be superior for the partial range of motion at the initial position when we average growth across the three regions it's evident elbow flexor growth was Superior with a partial at the initial position as for the Pedrosa study elbow flexor growth was measured at the 50 and 70 upper arm regions and at the 50 region thickness gains were actually similar between both groups but at the 70 region gains were Superior for the partial at the initial position if we add both regions we can see growth favored the partial at the initial position an interesting consideration is that both studies found considerably more gains at the 70 region for the partial at the initial position this phenomenon of stretched exercises growing this region of a muscle substantially have also been found with a quadriceps muscle group we do actually have another study comparing different range of motions with a biceps exercise that further suggests that biceps May grow more when exposed to stretch this is a 2011 study by Pinto which also had subjects trained to preacher coal one group of subjects trained with a full range of motion while another group of subjects trained with a partial range of motion in the middle position increases in elbow flexor growth at around the 60 upper arm length favored the full range of motion group considering the findings of the Sato and Pedrosa studies I think these results are probably in large part since the full range of motion group achieved greatest stretch of the biceps an important consideration with all this range of motion data is although it indicates the stretched part of a preacher curl is great for building muscle it of course cannot prove an even greater stretch achieved for the curls and shoulder extension would be even better for biceps hypertrophy nonetheless the third area of scientific literature comes from data on the triceps [Music] the triceps generally consist of the long medial and lateral heads all three heads pass over their elbow joints but the long head specifically passes over the shoulder joint as well and when you place the shoulder into flexion the long head of the triceps is going to be stretched this is quite similar to the biceps Long Head we know this passes over the shoulder joint too and will be stretched during shoulder extension an overhead extension is a triceps exercise that will train the long head of the triceps in a stretched position since this exercise is performed with the shoulders flexed and here's the key point a great Study last year by Mao compared overhead extensions to push downs and found that overhead extensions produced greater long triceps head volume increases fascinatingly the overhead extensions also produced greater combined medial and lateral head volume increases as well a finding that was unexpected but nicely demonstrates a point many people tend to forget that there are likely still things we do not fully know about muscle hypertrophy of course we'll dissect this study by Mal plus other relevant research in our Ultimate Guide to developing the triceps that should be released in the upcoming weeks foreign these three areas of the scientific literature collectively aren't Crystal Clear proofs curls would show the extension are the single most hypertrophic exercise but I think they're sufficient for us to hypothesize it could be despite these three areas of the scientific literature there's a chance you may have come across people suggesting the biceps should not grow more when exposed to stretch their belief seems to stem from research looking at the length tension relationship of the biceps sarcomas I don't believe this research is strong enough to Warrant a full explanation of it in this video so for those interested in the full dissection of it my views can be found at the link on screen essentially I simply do not believe we can look at one area of the scientific literature that has an array of potential limitations and make definitive conclusions about whether the biceps grow more in response to stretch or not especially considering when other areas of the scientific literature as we analyzed provide solid grounds to speculate the biceps May indeed grow more in response to stretch I will point out for the same reasons people speculated the triceps should not grow more in response to stretch that is they believe to length tension relationship studies on the triceps sarcomas meant the triceps shouldn't grow more when exposed to stretch but as we saw with a mouse study released last year the triceps Longhead grew more in response to stretch nevertheless you can be sure that if any future research emerges about how the biceps May respond to stretching based exercises we'll have a video on the house of hypertrophy to update you all for those interested in guidance or ideas about programming for hypertrophy you may be interested in our partner Alpha progression a tremendous app that includes a custom workout generator the training variables deployed are grounded in various meta-analyzes and systematic reviews from the scientific literature plus there's great flexibility you can fact in what equipment you have so if you only have dumbbells no problem how long you want your workouts to be how often you want to train furthermore the workouts are still editable to your liking allowing you to individualize things as you see fit the app also has other great features it provides neat graphs that can display your long-term progression and there's a database with over 550 exercises with excellent video and text tutorials behind each the link in the comments and description gives you everything on the app for two weeks completely free and if you like it and go beyond the link gives you 20 off a subscription we don't just partner up with anybody at the house of hypertrophy so you can rest assured the app is seriously quality [Music] as an additional part to this section we know incline curls and cable face away curves are two ways you could train the biceps in a great stretched position but are there any differences between either of them that makes one better than the other some suggest cable face weight cars are better as they provide more consistent biceps Force production throughout the range of motion versus incline curves however I'm skeptical this matters that much for hypertrophy if training a muscle with consistent Force production throughout a range of motion was crucial for muscle hypertrophy variable resistance should build more muscle for those unaware variable resistance is typically achieved with machines that vary the resistance throughout the range of motion resulting in the muscle being challenged in there equally throughout it four Studies have examined the effectiveness of training with variable resistance compared to using normal resistance and all of them find similar muscle hypertrophy between the two two of these involve the biceps training one of them was this 2018 paper which compared variable to normal resist since machine preacher curls and found similar arm circumference gains between the two the second one was this 1995 study which again compared variable to normal resistance Preacher machine curls and observed similar biceps cross-sectional area gains between the two since these two studies only use the preacher curl it's not a guarantee that these findings apply to curling with a shoulder extended but I do think it could be the case that regardless of the resistance profile of an exercise taking your repetitions to or at least near failure sufficiently stimulates the biceps therefore I'm currently not sold on the idea that cable face away curves would truly be superior to inclined dumbbell curls so for now I'd say an individual should select whichever they prefer what you just watched was a clip from our free Ultimate Guide to biceps hypertrophy feel free to check out the full video here or you may wish to check out another one of the House of hypertrophy's videos"

    "title": "The Best Exercise for Muscle Hypertrophy (What Science Says)",
    "published_at": "2022-01-10T12:00:55Z",
    "transcript": "It's far from uncommon to run\u00a0\nacross content claiming to\u00a0\u00a0 detail the best exercises or best\u00a0\nworkout programs for hypertrophy. For example, you might have heard certain\u00a0\ncompound exercises such as back squats or\u00a0\u00a0 conventional deadlifts being described as\u00a0\nthe most effective for building muscle.\u00a0\u00a0 Other times, they are called\u00a0\nthe \"king of all exercises\". However, I want to describe why I think when\u00a0\noverviewing the current exercise selection\u00a0\u00a0 literature, as well as the literature on\u00a0\nmuscle hypertrophy stimuli, the concept of\u00a0\u00a0 there being the best exercise, or the best couple\u00a0\nof exercises, for hypertrophy makes little sense. For one, there does not appear to be an\u00a0\noptimal exercise modality for hypertrophy. A recent meta-analysis by\u00a0\nHeidel et al. established\u00a0\u00a0 free weights and machine exercises were\u00a0\ncomparably effective for hypertrophy. Adding some extra detail, one study by Schwanbeck\u00a0\net al. compared an exclusive free weight program\u00a0\u00a0 (consisting of exercises such as back squats\u00a0\nand e-z bar curls) to an exclusive machine\u00a0\u00a0 program (consisting of exercises such as smith\u00a0\nmachine back squats and machine biceps curls). After 8 weeks of training, increases in thickness\u00a0\u00a0 of the biceps and quadriceps were\u00a0\nsimilar between both programs. Bodyweight exercises are\u00a0\nlikely no less effective too. Kikuchi and Nakazato found that\u00a0\nbodyweight push-up variations and a 40%\u00a0\u00a0 one-rep max flat barbell bench press\u00a0\nevoked similar pectorlais major and\u00a0\u00a0 triceps thickness increases\u00a0\nafter 8 training weeks. Note, a 40% one-rep max load is perfectly fine\u00a0\nfor muscle hypertrophy, Quite a bit of evidence\u00a0\u00a0 indicates loads between 30% and 85% one-rep max\u00a0\nproduce similar growth, provided repetitions are\u00a0\u00a0 performed to volition failure (which was\u00a0\ndone in the Kikuchi and Nakazato study). Moreover, though notable limitations with\u00a0\nmuscle excitation studies exist, a number of\u00a0\u00a0 them find when push-ups are load equated to bench\u00a0\npresses (either via comparing light load bench\u00a0\u00a0 pressing to bodyweight push-ups, or via comparing\u00a0\nweighted push-ups to heavier load bench pressing),\u00a0\u00a0 both exercises similarly generate excitation\u00a0\nof pectoralis major, triceps, and front delts. The findings of these various\u00a0\nstudies make sense. Let me explain. The current literature on the\u00a0\nstimuli of muscle hypertrophy\u00a0\u00a0 indicates mechanical tension may be\u00a0\nthe primary hypertrophy stimulus. Mechanical tension is equal to the force generated\u00a0\nby muscle fibers. Components within muscle fibers,\u00a0\u00a0 called \"mechanosensors\" can detect the\u00a0\nforce produced by a muscle fiber and\u00a0\u00a0 thereafter transduce these forces into a signaling\u00a0\ncascade the results in muscle fiber hypertrophy. Following on from this, to\u00a0\nmaximize a muscle's growth,\u00a0\u00a0 we'd want to recruit as many muscle\u00a0\nfibers as possible and have them\u00a0\u00a0 sustain at least decent amounts of their\u00a0\nrespective forces for a fair duration. The key point here is this\u00a0\ncan be accomplished with\u00a0\u00a0 any exercise modality. Your body possesses no\u00a0\nmechanism to know if free weights, machines,\u00a0\u00a0 or body weight is being utilized to stimulate\u00a0\nmuscle fiber recruitment and force generation. So long as you perform between roughly 5 and\u00a0\n35 repetitions (and those repetitions are\u00a0\u00a0 performed with 3 or fewer reps in reserve) with\u00a0\na free weight, machine, or bodyweight exercise,\u00a0\u00a0 the aforementioned conditions are likely\u00a0\nachieved. That is, the working muscles in\u00a0\u00a0 the exercise likely experience maximal muscle\u00a0\nfiber recruitment, and the individual muscle\u00a0\u00a0 fibers likely sustain at least decent amounts\u00a0\nof their respective forces for a fair duration. Before moving on, there is another component\u00a0\nto mechanical tension worth touching on.\u00a0\u00a0 This is passive tension. When muscle fibers are sufficiently stretched,\u00a0\u00a0 a component within it called titin\u00a0\nproduces passive tension while elongating. A rubber band can help you conceptualize\u00a0\npassive tension. When stretching a rubber band,\u00a0\u00a0 it produces tension (analogous to force) to try\u00a0\nand resist stretch. Titin operates comparably. Mechnosensors, potentially within titin\u00a0\nitself, can detect this passive force\u00a0\u00a0 and transduce it into a signaling cascade\u00a0\nthat produces muscle fiber hypertrophy. Generally, exercises that involve a\u00a0\ngood stretch of the working muscle\u00a0\u00a0 or muscles can involve high\u00a0\namounts of passive tension. Numerous free weight, machine, and\u00a0\nbodyweight exercises can involve a\u00a0\u00a0 good stretch of the working muscle or muscles.\u00a0\nFor example, a barbell back squat, hack squat,\u00a0\u00a0 or pistol squat all accomplish a good stretch\u00a0\nof the quadriceps and gluteus maximus. Another reason why the concept of the best\u00a0\nexercise or exercises makes little sense is\u00a0\u00a0 for optimizing growth across many regions of a\u00a0\nmuscle, exercise variety is likely important. Costa et al. allocated 22 detrained men\u00a0\u00a0 (they had not trained in the previous 6\u00a0\nmonths) into a non-varied or varied group. Both groups trained for 8 weeks.\u00a0\nThe non-varied group performed\u00a0\u00a0 the exact same exercises for their\u00a0\nmuscle groups three times per week. The non-varied group, across the 3 days, performed\u00a0\ndifferent exercises for their muscle groups. Both groups trained each exercise\u00a0\nwith 3 sets of 8-12 repetitions,\u00a0\u00a0 using 90-120 seconds of rest between sets. Before and after the study, thickness\u00a0\nof the upper, middle, and lower regions\u00a0\u00a0 of the rectus femoris, vastus lateralis,\u00a0\nelbow flexors, and triceps were measured. Overall, although increases in thickness\u00a0\nwere similar between both groups at a\u00a0\u00a0 couple of regions, increases at other\u00a0\nregions favored the varied group. Accordingly, this data demonstrates performing\u00a0\naround 3 different exercises per muscle group\u00a0\u00a0 each week results in greater growth\u00a0\nacross more regions of a muscle. This is logical. Typically,\u00a0\ndifferent regions of a muscle,\u00a0\u00a0 or the different muscles in a muscle\u00a0\ngroup, do not function in complete unison. Rather, the different regions of a muscle,\u00a0\nor the different muscles in a muscle group,\u00a0\u00a0 are activated to different degrees during\u00a0\nmovements that contrast in some way. For example, Nunes et al. established performing\u00a0\ncalf presses with the feet rotated outwards\u00a0\u00a0 results in preferential growth of the medial\u00a0\ngastrocnemius, while calf presses with the\u00a0\u00a0 feet rotated inwards evoked preferential\u00a0\ngrowth of the lateral gastrocnemius. As for example on the muscle group level, although\u00a0\nback squats seem to do a great job at stimulating\u00a0\u00a0 the vasti muscles of the quadriceps (that is, the\u00a0\nvastus medialis, intermedius, and lateralis), they\u00a0\u00a0 fail to meaningfully target the rectus femoris.\u00a0\nYet, leg extensions or reverse nordic curls (which\u00a0\u00a0 involve more isolated knee motion with little hip\u00a0\nmotion) preferentially grow the rectus femoris. On the account of all this, by training a\u00a0\ncertain muscle group with a few different\u00a0\u00a0 exercises that vary in some way (either\u00a0\nvia the angle used, joint positioning,\u00a0\u00a0 or hand orientation), you most likely\u00a0\nend up growing more regions of a muscle. Therefore, saying there's a single best\u00a0\nexercise for a muscle misses the notion\u00a0\u00a0 different exercises collectively contribute\u00a0\ntowards more uniformly growing a muscle. The final reason I think is worth discussing\u00a0\non why the concept of the best exercise or\u00a0\u00a0 exercises makes little sense\u00a0\nrelates to individual differences. With the same exercise,\u00a0\u00a0 not all individuals recruit and stimulate\u00a0\nthe same musculature to the same degree. Stronska et al.'s data indicate the relative\u00a0\nrecruitment of the pectoralis major,\u00a0\u00a0 triceps, and anterior deltoid differed between\u00a0\nindividuals on the bench press. Some individuals\u00a0\u00a0 preferentially recruited the pectoralis major,\u00a0\nsome the anterior deltoid, and others the triceps. Likewise, Boyer et al. observed during\u00a0\nnordic curls and stiff-legged deadlifts,\u00a0\u00a0 recruitment of the various hamstring\u00a0\nmuscles differed amongst individuals. These findings highlight the notion that just\u00a0\nbecause one individual grew a certain way with\u00a0\u00a0 one exercise, this does not necessarily\u00a0\nguarantee the same will occur for you. As a final point, I should emphasize\u00a0\nthat by no means am I saying every\u00a0\u00a0 single exercise in existence\u00a0\nis optimal for building muscle. Unquestionably there exist factors that\u00a0\nwould result in certain exercises being\u00a0\u00a0 more favorable for hypertrophy. It's just\u00a0\nthat even with these factors in mind,\u00a0\u00a0 a whole host of exercises are still\u00a0\nhighly effective for hypertrophy. Even so, let us briefly overview\u00a0\nfactors that could make an\u00a0\u00a0 exercise more or less effective for hypertrophy. If the muscle you're attempting to train\u00a0\nis not the limiting factor in an exercise,\u00a0\u00a0 chances are it's a suboptimal movement. Take a bosu ball pistol squat. Your\u00a0\nbalance and stability are probably\u00a0\u00a0 going to limit your performance more than\u00a0\nforce production from the main muscles.\u00a0\u00a0 Consequently, a whole host of other\u00a0\nexercises that provide a more stable\u00a0\u00a0 environment are more optimal, be it back\u00a0\nsquats, hack squats, or assisted pistol squats. Another factor relates to achieving a stretch.\u00a0\nThe current evidence is increasingly leaning\u00a0\u00a0 towards the idea that exercises that achieve a\u00a0\ngood stretch of the working muscle or muscles\u00a0\u00a0 may be a more powerful hypertrophy stimulus versus\u00a0\u00a0 exercises that only train the\u00a0\nmuscle in a shortened length. There are an array of exercises for\u00a0\neach muscle that involve good stretches. Finally, personal preferences for one\u00a0\nreason or another may be important too.\u00a0\u00a0 If certain exercises, either due to\u00a0\nyour natural anatomy or injury history,\u00a0\u00a0 are uncomfortable or painful, chances are\u00a0\nyou're better off performing other movements. In a different scenario, if you're someone who\u00a0\nutilizes the mind-muscle connection, and you find\u00a0\u00a0 you're able to best achieve this with an exercise\u00a0\nlike the dumbbell curl as opposed to barbell curl,\u00a0\u00a0 hypertrophy outcomes could potentially\u00a0\nbe better with the dumbbell variation. That brings us to the end of the video. As always,\u00a0\u00a0 thank you for watching, I hope you found the\u00a0\nvideo interesting and informative in some way!"
