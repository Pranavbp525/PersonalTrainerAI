**1. Introduction**

This project aims to develop a Personal Fitness AI Agent that acts as a virtual personal trainer, leveraging Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), memory, and tool use to provide tailored workout plans and track user progress. The AI Agent will interact with users through a chatbot interface, create personalized workout routines, integrate with the Hevy workout logging app via its API, and adapt routines based on user feedback and progress data. This project seeks to innovate beyond existing fitness apps that rely on static rule-based methods by offering a dynamic, AI-driven, and highly personalized training experience.

**2. Dataset Information**

**2.1 Dataset Introduction:**

The core dataset for this project consists of fitness and workout information that will be used to inform the RAG component of the AI Agent. This dataset is crucial for providing the AI with the knowledge base needed to generate effective and scientifically-backed workout routines. The primary source initially will be free content from Renaissance Periodization, including articles, blogs, and guides that detail various workout plans and exercises. Subsequently, the dataset will be expanded to include peer-reviewed publications from reputable sports and exercise science journals, such as:

**3. Data Planning and Splits**

*   **Loading:**
    *   Web scraping tools (e.g., Beautiful Soup, Scrapy) will be used to extract data from Renaissance Periodization's website and SportRxiv.
    *   PubMed API or web scraping will be used to collect abstracts and metadata from research journals.
    *   Full-text PDFs of relevant research papers will be downloaded where available.
*   **Preprocessing:**
    *   Text data will be cleaned (remove HTML tags, special characters, etc.).
    *   Summarization models (e.g., using libraries like Hugging Face Transformers) will be employed to condense lengthy research papers while retaining key information.
    *   Data may be converted into a structured format (e.g., JSON) for easier processing by the RAG model.
    *   Exercise data may be extracted and organized into a database or structured files.
*   **Managing data:**
    *   A version control system (Git) will be used to track changes to the dataset.
    *   Data will be stored in a well-organized file structure within a database.
    *   Consider using a database (e.g., SQLite, PostgreSQL) for managing structured data.
*   **Splits:**
    *   The dataset will not be split in the traditional sense (train/validation/test) as it is used for retrieval, not for training a traditional ML model.
    *   However, we might create different subsets of the data for different purposes (e.g., a subset specifically for chest exercises, a subset for beginners).

**6. Current Approach Flow Chart and Bottleneck Detection**

**Current Approach (Traditional Fitness Apps):**

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User Inputs Basic Info] --> B{Static Rules Engine};
    B -- Limited Personalization --> C[Pre-defined Workout Plan];
    C --> D{User Follows Plan};
    D -- Manual Tracking --> E[Workout Log];
    E -- Limited Feedback --> D;
```

**Bottlenecks:**

*   **Limited Personalization:** Static rules engines can't account for the nuances of individual needs and preferences.
*   **Manual Tracking:** Users need to manually log their workouts, which can be tedious and prone to errors.
*   **Limited Feedback:** Apps provide minimal feedback or adaptation based on user progress.

**Proposed Approach (AI Agent):**

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User Inputs Info & Preferences] --> B{AI Agent};
    B -- Queries --> C[RAG Model & Knowledge Base];
    C -- Retrieves Relevant Info --> B;
    B -- Generates --> D[Personalized Workout Routine];
    D --> E[Chatbot Interface];
    E -- User Interaction & Feedback --> B;
    E -- Export --> F[Hevy App];
    F -- User Logs Workouts --> G[Hevy API];
    G -- Imports Logs --> H{AI Agent};
    H -- Analyzes Progress --> I[Progress Report & Recommendations];
    I --> J[User Notification/Email];
    J --> E;
    H -- Adapts --> D;
```

**Potential Bottlenecks:**

*   **RAG Model Accuracy:** The quality of workout recommendations depends heavily on the accuracy and comprehensiveness of the RAG model and its knowledge base.
*   **Hevy API Limitations:** The Hevy API might have limitations on the frequency of data access or the types of data that can be exchanged.
*   **User Engagement:** Users might not consistently log their workouts or provide feedback, hindering the AI's ability to adapt.
*   **Scalability:** Handling a large number of users and their data could pose challenges for the system's infrastructure.

**Improvements:**

*   Continuous improvement of the RAG model through ongoing training and data updates.
*   Optimization of API interactions to minimize latency and ensure smooth data flow.
*   Implementation of user-friendly features to encourage consistent logging and feedback.
*   Designing a scalable architecture to handle increasing user loads.
