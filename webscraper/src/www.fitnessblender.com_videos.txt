SALE EXTENDED - Our New Year's Sale Has Been Extended Because...
SALE EXTENDED - We have way too much great stuff going on that we could not help but to extend the sale to give more people the opportunity to join FB Plus!
Our current program
FB Kickstart: 30 Day Team Strength and Cardio
has really drawn the crowds and we are just now half way through so it’s not too late to join FB Plus and to get started on the 30-day team strength and cardio program. But that’s just this month.
Check out a few things we have planned for the coming weeks exclusively on FB Plus.
Endurance Challenge Workout
- Many of you have been asking for a longer workout that would test your endurance. February 2nd, Tasha is bringing the heat with a near 70-minute strength and cardio workout with supersets and endurance intervals.
FB Low Impact, Round 3
- We are ready with the next installment of our Low Impact series with six low impact workouts per week for four full weeks from our team of creators. Stay tuned for more info about when this program will drop.
Barre and Build with Erica
- Get ready for something different with Erica’s new 10-Day Challenge Trainer Series combining barre training and traditional strength training! Erica encourages everyone interested to check out her
5-Day Barre Basics Series
first.
If you have not already taken advantage of our new year sale you now have more time.
Sale extended through Friday, January 31st (11:59 PM PST).
New Subscribers (20% Off)
Join FB Plus with a
Subscription
and enjoy all that Fitness Blender has to offer. Choose our lowest cost
annual subscription
for $63.99 or a
monthly subscription
for $7.19/month for 3 months, then $8.99/monthly after that, cancel any time (auto-renew card on file, starts the day of purchase).
Pass Holders (20% Off)
Stock up on timed
Plus Passes
of 1-day, 1-month, 3-months, and more. Buy and stack as many passes as you like or purchase our NEW 1-Year Pass for those of you who
want the flexibility of a pass instead of a subscription
(one-time payment vs auto-renew, activate any time, not a subscription).
Current Subscribers (20% Off)
Take advantage of our sale today and have the discounted card in your Wallet for when your subscription comes up for renewal.
If you are currently on a recurring monthly or annual subscription, make sure you are logged-in to your current FB Plus account then click
Buy Now
to go to the store page where you will see the discounted subscriber gift card at the very top.
As a reminder, select "For Myself" (not "As a Gift") when you purchase, and save in your FB Wallet to use when your current subscription comes up for renewal instead of your credit card on file.
Check out our FAQs if you need a reminder about
how to apply wallet bucks to an existing subscription
.
And if you have already taken advantage of the sale then consider helping out someone in the Community with our new
Pay it Forward
program.
Thank you for being part of Fitness Blender.

Overview
Do you love strength training but also equally enjoy your cardio sessions? Why not mix the two training modalities in one workout? Experience the best of both worlds during this 30-day program designed to provide you with a solid foundation for movement and great jumping off point for your future training goals!
Who is this program for?
Many of us have training goals that contain markers of improvement for both strength and cardio performance, and there are many reasons for which we might want to maximize our time in-training by combining the two focuses in one workout. Whether you’re short on time for training, still trying to figure out which type(s) of training works best for your goals and needs, or simply just prefer multi-modality training, including strength and cardio in one session has appeal and applicability to nearly all of us. This program is a great option for anyone looking to:
improve overall fitness while establishing a habit of consistent movement
efficiently tackle the goal of creating a healthy lifestyle (both mentally and physically) with potential body composition changes
experience variety in their training regimen, perhaps before the start of an upcoming phase of training with specific goals
fine-tune their movement preferences to determine what training could look like in an upcoming training cycle
enjoy movement!
What to expect
?
Expect different mixes of strength and cardio training during most of the workouts, with the ratio, sequencing, and formatting of the two training types changing each week of the program. Each week also contains a mid-week low impact cardio/core routine, with some weeks also including additional mobility or active recovery work.
Program Roadmap:
Week #1: Half Strength + Half Cardio Segments
Week #2: Sandwich: Strength / Cardio / Strength
Week #3: Sandwich: Cardio / Strength / Cardio
Week #4: Strength + Cardio Mixed Segments
Workout duration and intensity will gradually increase each week, but always remember to make your workout experiences work for you! Experiment with the natural “push and pull” of challenging yourself – you don’t have to max out your efforts during every workout or opt for all the exercise progressions. Think incremental progress versus trying to master everything in 4 short weeks, knowing that you can repeat this program in the future. A few days of less intense, restorative movement and/or rest are strongly recommended before future repeats of the program (or whatever your next training cycle brings) to give your mind and body some recovery time.
Equipment
:
A range of light to moderately heavy weights relative to what you would use for upper and lower body strength exercises are recommended to fully take advantage of the many benefits of this program. This range of weight selections is relative to the exerciser! Your current level of fitness and training goals will help dictate your weight choices.
A mat will also be helpful for any on-floor exercises.
Your
FB Team
trainers for this program are Tasha, Erica, Brian, Patrice, Nicole, and Kayla. We all hope this program kickstarts a newfound or renewed enjoyment for moving your body and inspires some new training goals. Take it one day at a time, clap for yourselves, and celebrate the positive mental/physical shifts that come your way!

Frequently Asked Questions
Why aren’t Programs and Challenges free since the videos are free?
Our professionally-created Programs and Challenges target specific goals and/or training styles to provide the type of guidance you would receive from a personal trainer, at a fraction of the cost. In addition, Workout Program and Workout Challenge sales make it possible for us to keep producing free videos and to continue adding free features and content to the Fitness Blender website.
If I purchase using the "Buy Program" option, do I get access to FB Plus features?
If you are not currently an FB Plus Member, the "Buy Program" option includes a free FB Plus Pass. You will have access to the program indefinitely, regardless of your access to FB Plus, but if your Pass expires before you complete your program, you can buy additional Passes or a Membership at any time without affecting your progress. Learn more about
FB Plus Passes
.
What do I get with if I purchase the "Buy Pass" option?
With a FB Plus Pass, you get full access to FB Plus content and features for a set number of days (including the selected program or challenge) and can purchase additional FB Plus Passes to add more days as necessary. Learn more about
FB Plus Passes
.
Can I download a Program or Challenge?
Workout Programs and Workout Challenges work in conjunction with our online calendar; they are not downloadable or available to other calendar apps or platforms.
Can I use my older eBook or PDF program with the new calendar?
If you own an old eBook/PDF program, thank you for being such a long-time customer. Unfortunately, these older programs do not crossover to the new calendar.
What is the return policy?
Calendar-based Workout Programs and Workout Challenges have a 5 day return/refund policy. Meal Plans are a non-refundable purchase.
Where can I get help with my new Program, Challenge, or Meal Plan?
The community here at fitnessblender.com is a great place to start. Many of our members know the site inside and out, and can help with many site-usage or technical questions. If you need more detailed help, fill out our

FAQs
Create, Save, and Repeat
Personal Routines
Routines allow you to build your own workout plans that you can save and schedule on the calendar. With access to our entire workout library, you can create Routines personalized for your individual fitness level, exercise preferences, and personal goals.
Easy to Use for Beginners,
Advanced Enough for Pros
Whether you want to save time scheduling your favorite morning warm-up each week, or you want to create a comprehensive fitness plan, building Routines couldn’t be easier. Adding workouts from your favorites list is a great place to start, or you can leverage filters, tags, and the content-aware Routine details to build highly customized Routines with targeted criteria.
Custom Workouts
Routines wouldn't be complete without the ability to add your own workouts. If you take a daily walk, follow other workouts online, or want to include other types of activity in your schedule, simply create your custom workout and add it to your routine like any video from Fitness Blender.
Routines Features
Features
Active
Access to the entire library of free and Plus-only workouts for an almost endless variety of routine combinations.
check_circle
1, 2, 4, and 8-week options for short, convenient routines, or robust, longer-term exercise plans.
check_circle
Live content-aware routine details that help you focus your routines on specific criteria as you build.
check_circle
Draft mode that allows you to edit all at once or build over time, and launch when you’re ready.
check_circle
Draft selector so you aren’t locked into building just one routine at a time.
check_circle
Multiple day selector so you don’t have to add workouts to only one day at a time.
check_circle
Visual styling options to customize the look of each routine in your list.
check_circle
Include your non-Fitness Blender activity by adding custom workouts to your routines.

Frequently Asked Questions
Can I share my routine with other members?
Not right now, this is a feature we are exploring. Let us know if this is something you’d like us to prioritize.
How do I edit all the details of my routine?
You can directly edit basic information like the title, description, and length of your Routine. Our content-aware algorithm automatically generates the rest of the details like daily duration, days per week, etc. to simplify the process of building a Routine. To change the details of your routine, you’ll need to edit or select workouts that match the criteria you’re trying to achieve.
Can I edit my routine once it is live?
You can edit basic information like the title, description, etc. by selecting the edit button in the top right of the title card. But you won’t be able to change the workouts or sequence of a routine after you’ve launched it, so be sure you’re happy with your Routine before you hit that Save and Launch button.

Our Story
Fitness Blender was created by a husband
          and wife team of personal trainers who felt that there was a lack of
          reliable health and fitness information on the web. They were frustrated
          that too many people in the fitness industry were more focused on monetary
          gain or outward appearance than on good, achievable, long-term health.
          Now, more than 10 years later, Kelli and Daniel Segars, are still focused
          on their original goals and approach for the company:
Make health and fitness attainable, affordable, and approachable—for as many people as possible.
Endorse eating unprocessed, whole foods, and working out for a strong, healthy body.
Encourage a personal, mindful approach to eating and exercise.
Promote the fact that overall wellness looks different for each individual.

Frequently Asked Questions
Why aren’t Programs and Challenges free since the videos are free?
Our professionally-created Programs and Challenges target specific goals and/or training styles to provide the type of guidance you would receive from a personal trainer, at a fraction of the cost. In addition, Workout Program and Workout Challenge sales make it possible for us to keep producing free videos and to continue adding free features and content to the Fitness Blender website.
If I purchase using the "Buy Program" option, do I get access to FB Plus features?
If you are not currently an FB Plus Member, the "Buy Program" option includes a free FB Plus Pass. You will have access to the program indefinitely, regardless of your access to FB Plus, but if your Pass expires before you complete your program, you can buy additional Passes or a Membership at any time without affecting your progress. Learn more about
FB Plus Passes
.
What do I get with if I purchase the "Buy Pass" option?
With a FB Plus Pass, you get full access to FB Plus content and features for a set number of days (including the selected program or challenge) and can purchase additional FB Plus Passes to add more days as necessary. Learn more about
FB Plus Passes
.
Can I download a Program or Challenge?
Workout Programs and Workout Challenges work in conjunction with our online calendar; they are not downloadable or available to other calendar apps or platforms.
Can I use my older eBook or PDF program with the new calendar?
If you own an old eBook/PDF program, thank you for being such a long-time customer. Unfortunately, these older programs do not crossover to the new calendar.
What is the return policy?
Calendar-based Workout Programs and Workout Challenges have a 5 day return/refund policy. Meal Plans are a non-refundable purchase.
Where can I get help with my new Program, Challenge, or Meal Plan?
The community here at fitnessblender.com is a great place to start. Many of our members know the site inside and out, and can help with many site-usage or technical questions. If you need more detailed help, fill out our
Contact Us form

FAQs
Create, Save, and Repeat
Personal Routines
Routines allow you to build your own workout plans that you can save and schedule on the calendar. With access to our entire workout library, you can create Routines personalized for your individual fitness level, exercise preferences, and personal goals.
Easy to Use for Beginners,
Advanced Enough for Pros
Whether you want to save time scheduling your favorite morning warm-up each week, or you want to create a comprehensive fitness plan, building Routines couldn’t be easier. Adding workouts from your favorites list is a great place to start, or you can leverage filters, tags, and the content-aware Routine details to build highly customized Routines with targeted criteria.
Custom Workouts
Routines wouldn't be complete without the ability to add your own workouts. If you take a daily walk, follow other workouts online, or want to include other types of activity in your schedule, simply create your custom workout and add it to your routine like any video from Fitness Blender.
Routines Features
Features
Active
Access to the entire library of free and Plus-only workouts for an almost endless variety of routine combinations.

Frequently Asked Questions
Can I share my routine with other members?
Not right now, this is a feature we are exploring. Let us know if this is something you’d like us to prioritize.
How do I edit all the details of my routine?
You can directly edit basic information like the title, description, and length of your Routine. Our content-aware algorithm automatically generates the rest of the details like daily duration, days per week, etc. to simplify the process of building a Routine. To change the details of your routine, you’ll need to edit or select workouts that match the criteria you’re trying to achieve.
Can I edit my routine once it is live?
You can edit basic information like the title, description, etc. by selecting the edit button in the top right of the title card. But you won’t be able to change the workouts or sequence of a routine after you’ve launched it, so be sure you’re happy with your Routine before you hit that Save and Launch button.

Created by Trainers
Fitness Blender was founded by a husband and wife team of personal trainers
        who thought fitness should be accessible to everyone, regardless of their income. They also
        felt like there was a lack of reliable health and fitness information on the web, and too
        many people in the industry were more focused on monetary gain or appearance than they were
        on good health. In 2010 they launched Fitness Blender with the goal of providing
        research-backed fitness content with the intent of keeping the core platform free for everyone.

Our Story
Fitness Blender was created by a husband
          and wife team of personal trainers who felt that there was a lack of
          reliable health and fitness information on the web. They were frustrated
          that too many people in the fitness industry were more focused on monetary
          gain or outward appearance than on good, achievable, long-term health.
          Now, more than 10 years later, Kelli and Daniel Segars, are still focused
          on their original goals and approach for the company:
Make health and fitness attainable, affordable, and approachable—for as many people as possible.
Endorse eating unprocessed, whole foods, and working out for a strong, healthy body.
Encourage a personal, mindful approach to eating and exercise.
Promote the fact that overall wellness looks different for each individual.

Frequently Asked Questions
Why aren’t Programs and Challenges free since the videos are free?
Our professionally-created Programs and Challenges target specific goals and/or training styles to provide the type of guidance you would receive from a personal trainer, at a fraction of the cost. In addition, Workout Program and Workout Challenge sales make it possible for us to keep producing free videos and to continue adding free features and content to the Fitness Blender website.
If I purchase using the "Buy Program" option, do I get access to FB Plus features?
If you are not currently an FB Plus Member, the "Buy Program" option includes a free FB Plus Pass. You will have access to the program indefinitely, regardless of your access to FB Plus, but if your Pass expires before you complete your program, you can buy additional Passes or a Membership at any time without affecting your progress. Learn more about
FB Plus Passes
.
What do I get with if I purchase the "Buy Pass" option?
With a FB Plus Pass, you get full access to FB Plus content and features for a set number of days (including the selected program or challenge) and can purchase additional FB Plus Passes to add more days as necessary. Learn more about
FB Plus Passes
.
Can I download a Program or Challenge?
Workout Programs and Workout Challenges work in conjunction with our online calendar; they are not downloadable or available to other calendar apps or platforms.
Can I use my older eBook or PDF program with the new calendar?
If you own an old eBook/PDF program, thank you for being such a long-time customer. Unfortunately, these older programs do not crossover to the new calendar.
What is the return policy?
Calendar-based Workout Programs and Workout Challenges have a 5 day return/refund policy. Meal Plans are a non-refundable purchase.
Where can I get help with my new Program, Challenge, or Meal Plan?
The community here at fitnessblender.com is a great place to start. Many of our members know the site inside and out, and can help with many site-usage or technical questions. If you need more detailed help, fill out our

Create, Save, and Repeat
Personal Routines
Routines allow you to build your own workout plans that you can save and schedule on the calendar. With access to our entire workout library, you can create Routines personalized for your individual fitness level, exercise preferences, and personal goals.
Easy to Use for Beginners,
Advanced Enough for Pros
Whether you want to save time scheduling your favorite morning warm-up each week, or you want to create a comprehensive fitness plan, building Routines couldn’t be easier. Adding workouts from your favorites list is a great place to start, or you can leverage filters, tags, and the content-aware Routine details to build highly customized Routines with targeted criteria.
Custom Workouts
Routines wouldn't be complete without the ability to add your own workouts. If you take a daily walk, follow other workouts online, or want to include other types of activity in your schedule, simply create your custom workout and add it to your routine like any video from Fitness Blender.
Routines Features
Features
Active
Access to the entire library of free and Plus-only workouts for an almost endless variety of routine combinations.

1, 2, 4, and 8-week options for short, convenient routines, or robust, longer-term exercise plans.

Live content-aware routine details that help you focus your routines on specific criteria as you build.

Draft mode that allows you to edit all at once or build over time, and launch when you’re ready.

Draft selector so you aren’t locked into building just one routine at a time.
check_circle
Multiple day selector so you don’t have to add workouts to only one day at a time.

Visual styling options to customize the look of each routine in your list.

Frequently Asked Questions
Can I share my routine with other members?
Not right now, this is a feature we are exploring. Let us know if this is something you’d like us to prioritize.
How do I edit all the details of my routine?
You can directly edit basic information like the title, description, and length of your Routine. Our content-aware algorithm automatically generates the rest of the details like daily duration, days per week, etc. to simplify the process of building a Routine. To change the details of your routine, you’ll need to edit or select workouts that match the criteria you’re trying to achieve.
Can I edit my routine once it is live?
You can edit basic information like the title, description, etc. by selecting the edit button in the top right of the title card. But you won’t be able to change the workouts or sequence of a routine after you’ve launched it, so be sure you’re happy with your Routine before you hit that Save and Launch button.

Created by Trainers
Fitness Blender was founded by a husband and wife team of personal trainers
        who thought fitness should be accessible to everyone, regardless of their income. They also
        felt like there was a lack of reliable health and fitness information on the web, and too
        many people in the industry were more focused on monetary gain or appearance than they were
        on good health. In 2010 they launched Fitness Blender with the goal of providing
        research-backed fitness content with the intent of keeping the core platform free for everyone.

Our Story
Fitness Blender was created by a husband
          and wife team of personal trainers who felt that there was a lack of
          reliable health and fitness information on the web. They were frustrated
          that too many people in the fitness industry were more focused on monetary
          gain or outward appearance than on good, achievable, long-term health.
          Now, more than 10 years later, Kelli and Daniel Segars, are still focused
          on their original goals and approach for the company:
Make health and fitness attainable, affordable, and approachable—for as many people as possible.
Endorse eating unprocessed, whole foods, and working out for a strong, healthy body.
Encourage a personal, mindful approach to eating and exercise.
Promote the fact that overall wellness looks different for each individual.

FB
Plus
for Groups
FB Plus is a premium online platform that includes a
wide range of features
designed to help members stay motivated and engaged with their personal fitness journeys. When included in a group wellness program, FB Plus is a highly-effective tool for helping your group increase their functional fitness, leading to general health improvements, positive self-image, and an overall boost to energy and motivation. And 24/7 access to our unparalleled on-demand workout library, without the hassle of joining a class and starting at a specific time, means your group can use this benefit at home and on their time.
Reduce Barriers
to Exercise
Fitness Blender was purpose-built to reduce barriers to staying active. For most workouts, all you need is an internet connection, a smartphone or computer, and as little as 5 minutes of free time. Our members have found some
interesting places to exercise
, proving that you can stay fit at home, at the office, in a hotel room, or even aboard a research vessel in the Antarctic — true story.
Promote Wellness
and Healthy Eating
Exercising is only part of the equation. Fitness Blender also provides articles on
fitness
,
general health
, and
weight loss
to promote education and awareness as a key component to any wellness program. And to fuel their fitness journeys, our members have access to a wide range of
professionally-developed healthy recipes
that cover many different dietary preferences, cooking levels, and cuisines.
Engage and Motivate for Long-Term Results
Fitness is a life-long commitment, one that many people find hard to maintain. FB Plus provides a unique combination of professional training, guided challenges, motivational tools, and a supportive community that help our members maintain an extraordinary level of engagement. The Fitness Blender Ambassador program further increases engagement by adding another level of motivation through personal communication and encouragement from within your own group.
Monthly Utilization
On average, FB Plus members use their membership three and a half times more than people with a monthly gym membership make it to the gym.
Usage of Activity Tracking
When members use the built-in scheduling and tracking tools, it not only helps them stay engaged, it also translates to real world insight into your group's performance.
Challenge Participation
Taking the guesswork out of what to do next makes the professionally-developed monthly FB Plus Challenges a highly utilized perk for group plans.
Get Group-Level
Activity Insights
The goal of any wellness program is to see positive results, but tracking usage can be difficult, let alone getting any details about your group's actual activity. The FB Plus group wellness platform changes all of that with unprecedented insight into group-level data while keeping individual member information private.
Brands that Trust Us
Group Options
We partner with insurance providers, EAP providers, and other wellness providers to tailor affordable and effective packages. Going it alone? We also work with small, medium, and large-scale global businesses to craft programs that are easy to get started and are focused on the health and productivity of your workforce.
Engagement Models
Fully Paid Seats
Offer FB Plus user accounts at no cost to your group, and at a fraction of the cost for a typical gym membership or subsidized membership.
Partially Paid Seats
Cover part of the cost of your group's accounts to offer them FB Plus at a discounted rate. Choose this option to extend your budget or keep costs low.
Self-Paid Seats
Provide your users with a group plan, but allow them to pay for their own accounts. This is a great option paired with health and wellness stipends, fitness incentives, or HSAs.
Self-Paid Referrals
If you don't need group features but want to promote FB Plus to your audience, we offer high volume discounts to provide your audience additional value at no cost to you.
Alternative Options
Content Licensing
If you would like to provide Fitness Blender's wellness content on your own platform, we have a variety of options for content licensing.
Contact Us About Licensing
Enterprise Engagements
With over 24 million users around the world and 1.1 billion video views resulting in over 400 million hours of watch time and engagement data we are poised to work with you at enterprise scale.

Frequently Asked Questions
Do I qualify for the FB Plus one week free trial?
New auto-renew users who have never accessed FB Plus before qualify for a one week free trial (credit card required on sign up).  Users with a previous FB Plus membership will not be eligible for the trial period.  You can cancel at anytime during the trial and your card will not be charged.  If you'd like to keep using FB Plus, you don’t need to do a thing and your first payment will happen automatically on the trial end date.
FB Plus Passes do not include a free trial.
Is FB Plus a mobile app?
FB Plus is not a separate mobile app, it extends and adds functionality, content, and features to our mobile-friendly website. However, you can use the website like an app by
saving it to the home screen
of your smartphone or tablet.
Does FB Plus impact my free membership or programs/meal plans I already own?
FB Plus doesn't replace your free membership, programs, or meal plans. In fact, it adds to your experience! You can keep using Fitness Blender the way you always have with no new cost. Or, with FB Plus, you can supplement all the content you already use or own with extra functionality and features.
Does this mean free membership won't get new updates and content?
Not at all. Our free membership is still the core of our business and reason for being, so new workouts, healthy living content, recipes, and website features are always in development.
Do I have to sign up with a contract?
No way! You can sign up for one month at a time, or you can choose discounted monthly or yearly options with auto-renewal. Cancel at any time with just one click from your FB Plus account page.
What if I cancel before my next billing period?
FB Plus allows you to buy a month or year of time in advance. If you cancel your account, you will still have access to all the features until the end of your billing cycle. If you signed up with recurring payments, your account won't automatically renew.
Do I have to become a FB Plus member to continue using Fitness Blender?
No. You will be able to access Fitness Blender as you always have. With your free membership, you will still have access to all of the great content and functionality you are used to.
Will there still be new workout videos that are free? How often?
Yes, Fitness Blender will continue to put out new content on a regular basis. However, with other content and website features to work on too, we won't post as frequently as before.
Will I still have access to Workout Programs that I have previously purchased?
Absolutely, once you have purchased a Workout Program, it is yours to keep and can be reused anytime, with no expiration date.
Is FB Plus a subscription?
We wanted to make FB Plus as flexible as possible, so you can use it as a monthly or yearly subscription, or sign-up for with a FB Plus Pass for a set number of days — it's up to you.
Can I access FB Plus without a subscription?
Yes.  You can purchase a FB Plus Pass from the
store
as a one-time purchase. With a FB Plus Pass, you get full access to FB Plus content and features for a set number of days and can purchase additional FB Plus Passes to add more days as necessary.
When does the FB Plus Pass start?
Access to FB Plus features and content will begin when you activate the FB Plus Pass from your
FB Wallet
.
What are the differences between the new player and viewing on YouTube? Will I still be able to watch videos on my TV? Will I be able to download videos?
The player is different than YouTube, but you will still be able to watch videos on your TV.  Please see the
system requirements
for supported devices and casting options.  Chromecast and Airplay are supported if the browser or device natively supports it.  Videos cannot be downloaded at this time.
How often will new features for FB Plus be released?
We don't have an exact timeline, but the new features we already have planned will keep us busy for quite some time. You can expect the first “new” features for FB Plus to be released within weeks of launch.
Will FB Plus be prioritized over “regular” Fitness Blender?
No! Our primary goal is to remain true to our long-standing mission to make health and fitness attainable, affordable, and approachable. We want as many people as possible to have access to reliable fitness content.
Do I get access to all Workout Programs and Meal Plans if I sign up for FB Plus?
Yes, you get access to all programs, challenges and meal plans as they are released.

Desktop:
On desktop computers, the Sign In button can be found by mousing over My Fitness on the right hand side of the menu bar.
Why do I have multiple accounts?
Google, Facebook, Apple, and Blender accounts are separate by default. If you created a Blender login by filling out the form on the registration page and then the next time you logged in by clicking the Facebook or Google button on the Login page, then you created a second account. If you have accidentally done this, see
How do I merge accounts
.
How do I merge accounts?
Google, Facebook, Apple, and Blender accounts are separate by default. If you accidentally created multiple accounts, you can merge them together by adding the social login of the other account. All of your purchases, favorites and workout history will be added to this account. And, you will still be able to login via either method.
If you created a Blender login, start by logging into that account (if you have only social logins, you can login to either account). Once logged on, go to
Login Information
. On that page, under Social Logins click “Add” next to the Facebook or Google icon.
How do I remove social logins?
From the
Login Information
page, select the "Remove" link below the Google, Facebook, or Apple social login. This will remove it from your account.
What if I forgot my password?
On the login page there is a “Forget?” link in the password field.  Click this to go to the
Forgot Password page
. Here, fill out your email address and click “Send Email”.  You will then be sent an email entitled “Fitness Blender Password Reset”. In that email click the “Change Password” button. This will take you to a Change Password page where you can change your password.  You will need to enter your username which is included in bold in the email. Once you have filled out your new password and saved it, you will be rerouted to the Account: Login Information page, where you can log in with your new password.
Note: if you created the account with Facebook or Google, this will not work. Instead you must login through Facebook or Google.
If I created my Fitness Blender account through Facebook, how can I keep it if I want to delete my Facebook account?
It is possible to keep your Fitness Blender account that you created through Facebook if you would like to delete your Facebook account.  To do so, follow these steps:
1) Logout, and create a new Blender account from the
Join
page.
2) After creating the new account, go to
My Fitness: Account: Login Information
.
3) Merge your existing Facebook account into this account by clicking the Add link next to the Facebook icon (instructions for merging accounts
here
).  Once this is complete all your information from the Facebook account will be accessible from this account.
4) Optional: you can remove the Facebook login option by clicking the Remove link next to the Facebook icon.
Where is the My Fitness Menu?

Scheduled Instances
of the program. From here, you can remove, reschedule and complete programs.
Or, you may also mark a program complete from the Workout Complete Pop-Up.

Click here
to find out if you accidently created a second account.
Click here
to find out how to merge the two accounts together.  If this doesn’t solve your problem, please
contact support
.
Why does it say “Sorry, we could not add this program to your calendar.” when attempting to Add to Calendar?
You will get this message if you try and schedule an instance of a program that overlaps with another instance of that same program.  For example if you schedule FB Blend  from January 1-13,  and then try and schedule it again starting on Jan 10, it will give you an error message and display “You have already scheduled FB Blend in this timeframe.”   Instead, try scheduling after Jan 13.  Or reschedule the first instance to the dates you want (
click here
to learn more about rescheduling).  Or, remove the scheduled instance (
click here
to learn how to remove a program) and then add it back.

Can I download videos to watch offline?
Fitness Blender uses YouTube to show all videos with free memberships.  If you join
YouTube Premium
, one of the features is the ability to download videos to watch offline.   It also offers Ad-free videos and a free Google Play Music subscription.
Note:  This is a service provided by YouTube and is not part of Fitness Blender.
How can I remove the ads from the videos?
You can join
FB Plus
a to remove ads from the site and videos with our ads free player.
Can I cast to my SmartTV with the YouTube Player?
Please see the YouTube player
questions and support page
to
learn more about casting
. This service is provided by YouTube and not Fitness Blender.
Why do the Videos say "Video Unavailable" when I try and view them?
If you are trying to view a Fitness Blender Video, and see a message
"Video Unavailable  This video is restricted.  Try signing in with a Google Apps account",
the WiFi network you are trying to view the video from has restricted access to YouTube videos at the "strict" level.  Often times schools and businesses do this.  To view the video, switch to another WiFi network or use a mobile connection.
Technically, a "YouTube-Restrict:Strict" Header is being sent with the request to YouTube and many Fitness Blender videos are blocked at this level.  There is a lower level "YouTube-Restrict:Moderate" Header which should be able to view Fitness Blender videos.  Every once in a while YouTube accidently restricts Fitness Blender videos at the moderate level.  Please
contact support
if you have been able to view videos on your WiFi network but all of a sudden the same videos are giving you this error.
Why do the Videos say "Sign in to confirm your not a bot" when I try and view them?
If you are trying to view a Fitness Blender Video using the YouTube Player, you may see a message
"Sign in to confirm your not a bot"
if you are logged out on YouTube.com. Sometimes Google / YouTube will show this message if they suspect bot activity or adblockers. To resolve this, you can try the following:
If you are using a VPN, try selecting an alternative region or disable the VPN, then reload the page to see if the VPN is causing the issue.
If you have browser plugins or extensions, try adding fitnessblender.com to the safelist or temporarily disable each extension to see if they are causing the issue.
Try logging in to YouTube.com directly or your Google Account.
You can watch directly on YouTube by clicking the three dot menu and select “view on YouTube” to see if you get the same issue.
Do you have a mobile app?
Fitness Blender does not currently have a mobile app.  We did have one for a while, but unfortunately
we decided to discontinue it
.
Instead, the website has a mobile friendly design.  It is also possible to add the Fitness Blender website to your homescreen on iOS and Android.

Can you recommend a program or workout for me?

Fitness Blender Community
for suggestions.

8. Important Information about Children
The Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act
(“
COPPA
”) requires that online service providers obtain parental (or legal guardian) consent before they collect personally identifiable information (PII) online from children who are under 13. Company’s Site does not target children, and is not intended to be used by children without involvement and approval of a parent or guardian. Therefore, we only knowingly collect personal information through the Services from a child under 13 where that parent or guardian (or a student’s school, district, and/or teacher has agreed to obtain parental/guardian consent for that child) to use the Services and disclose personal information to us, for the use and benefit of the learning environment. If you are a child or student under 13, please do not send any personal information about yourself to us if your parent, guardian, school, district, and/or teacher has not provided this prior consent to us, and please do not send any personal information other than what we request from you in connection with the Site. If we learn we have collected personal information from a child or student under 13 without parental/guardian consent being obtained or if we learn a child under 13 has provided us personal information beyond what we request from them for the Site, we will take steps to verify and delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that a child under 13 may have provided us personal information in violation of this paragraph, please contact us at
service@fitnessblender.com
.
Parents and legal guardians, if your child is under the age of 13, consent may need to be given in order for such child to register a User Account with the Site and/or use certain features of the Site. You are responsible for understanding how the Site you use, subscribe to, make available, and/or distribute on behalf of yourself or other users may collect and use information of users of Company’s Site. If you are the parent or legal guardian of a child who has created a User Account with us and you did not provide your consent, you can email us at
service@fitnessblender.com
to have that child’s User Account deleted.
If you are a school, district, company, or educator, you represent and warrant that you are solely responsible for complying with COPPA, meaning that you must obtain advance written consent from all parents or legal guardians whose children under 13 will be accessing the Site. You are responsible for understanding how the Services you use, subscribe to, make available, and/or distribute on behalf of yourself or other users may collect and use information of users of Company’s Site. When obtaining consent, you must also appropriately provide parents and legal guardians with our
Privacy Policy
. You must keep all consents on file and provide them to us if we request them.
If you are an educator, you represent and warrant that you have permission and authorization from your school, company, and/or district to use the Site as part of your curriculum, and for purposes of COPPA compliance, you represent and warrant that you are entering into these Terms on behalf of your school, company, and/or district. Upon termination of a teacher or other staff member’s employment with any school, company, and/or district, such individual must return and cease using all login details and student access they have in their possession.

If you are enjoined or otherwise prohibited from using the Site or a portion thereof based on an allegation that the Site violates any third-party intellectual property right (including a Claim), or if we reasonably determine that such prohibition is likely, then we will, at our sole expense and option: (a) obtain for you the right to use the allegedly infringing portions of the Site; (b) modify the allegedly infringing portions of the Site so as to render them non-infringing without substantially diminishing or impairing their functionality; or (c) replace the allegedly infringing portions of the Site with non-infringing items of substantially similar functionality.

However, we will have no obligation for any infringement or misappropriation to the extent that it arises out of or is based upon use of the Services in combination with other products or Services if such infringement or misappropriation would not have arisen but for such combination; any aspects of the Site that are provided to comply with designs, requirements, or specifications required by or provided by you, if the alleged infringement or misappropriation would not have arisen but for the compliance with such designs, requirements, or specifications; use of the Site by you for purposes not intended or outside the scope of the license granted to you; your failure to use the Site in accordance with written instructions provided by us, if the infringement or misappropriation would not have occurred but for such failure; or any modification of the Site not made or authorized in writing by us where such infringement or misappropriation would not have occurred absent such modification.

Company takes seriously the issues surrounding privacy concerns, and is committed to respecting the privacy of our users and their data. This Privacy Policy explains how Personal Information (as defined below) may be collected, used, and disclosed by Company with your access and use of this Site and in connection with the health and fitness content, information, services, and products Company provides via the Site (“

1. What Is Personal Information?
“
Personal Information
” means information that you voluntarily submit to us and that specifically identifies an individual (such as a name, address, telephone number, mobile number, or email address) or information about that individual that is directly linked to personally identifiable information (PII). Personal Information can also include information about any transactions, both free and paid, that you enter into on the Site, and information about you that is available on the internet, such as from social media, web companies, or publicly-available information that we acquire from service providers. Personal Information does not include “aggregate” information, which is data we collect that cannot be used to identify an individual, pseudonymous data, encoded or anonymized information, and/or aggregated data we collect or create about a group or category of services, features, or users, which does not contain personally identifying information. Our Privacy Policy does not restrict or limit our collection and use of aggregate information.
2. What Personal Information Do We Collect?
We collect certain information you voluntarily provide to us, including, without limitation, the information you enter if you create an account or profile, send us an email, enter into a subscription agreement or end user license agreement with us, request user support, or submit or post content to the Site.
We may automatically collect certain information when you use the Site including, without limitation, your Internet Protocol ("
IP
") address, your operating system, the browser type, the address of a referring site, and your activity on the Site. We may also collect information from mobile phone users in a similar manner to optimize the mobile experience. Beyond mobile phone numbers, we may collect mobile screen resolution, device make and manufacturer, and may also collect the device’s unique identifier (in the iPhone’s case, a UDID), and, with your permission, your location. We treat this information as Personal Information if we combine it with or link it to any of the identifying information mentioned above. Otherwise, it is used in the aggregate only.
We may also receive Personal Information from third parties about their users, and may combine this information with other Personal Information we maintain about you. If we do so, this Privacy Policy will govern the combined information.
We may also receive Personal Information from users about third parties, and may process this information with other Personal Information we maintain about you for purposes of fulfilling user requests or providing Services. However, such information is not otherwise stored by us, is not re-used in connection with other user accounts, and is not sold to third parties.
The Site may now or in the future allow users to send messages to each other. These messages may be stored for retrieval at later times in order to facilitate user communication.
The Site may now or in the future allow users to make transactions. Data will be securely stored when a transaction is made, including the date and type of purchase made, your credit card number, expiration date, billing address, and CVV or security code number.
Even after you remove information from your profile or delete your account or cease use of our Services, copies of that information may remain viewable elsewhere to the extent it has been shared with others, it was otherwise distributed pursuant to your privacy settings, or it was copied or stored by other users. If you post any of your information to a public area of the Site, please be aware that it is no longer “Personal Information” for purposes of this Policy, and we or anyone else may use such information without restriction. If you provide access to personal or other information, including your email address or name, to other users through the application of any of our privacy controls or other Service or Site settings, you hereby acknowledge and agree that Company has no control over nor liability for how others may collect, use, or disclose such information.
3. What Aggregated and Non-Personal Information Do We Collect?
We may use standard Internet technology, such as web beacons and other similar technologies, to track your use of the Site. We also may include web beacons in promotional email messages or newsletters to determine whether messages have been opened and acted upon. The information we obtain in this manner enables us to customize the Services we offer visitors to our Site to deliver targeted advertisements and to measure the overall effectiveness of our online advertising, content, programming, or other activities.
When you visit the Site, we may assign your computer one or more cookies to facilitate access to the Site and to personalize your online experience. View the Site
Cookie Policy
, which is hereby incorporated into this Privacy Policy and the Terms.
4. Children
We do not knowingly collect Personal Information from children under the age of 13 unless we have obtained parental consent. If we learn that we have collected Personal Information from a child under the age of 13, we will delete that data from our systems unless we have obtained parental consent. Please see our
Terms
for more information.
5. How Do We Use the Personal Information We Collect?
In General. We may use information that we collect about you to:
Deliver the products and Services that you have requested;
Manage your account and provide you with customer support;
Perform research and analysis about your use of, or interest in, our products, Services, or content, or products, services, or content offered by others;
Communicate with you by email, postal mail, telephone, and/or mobile devices about products or services that may be of interest to you either from us or other third parties;
Tailor your user experience;
Develop and display third-party content and advertising tailored to your interests on the Site and other sites;
Enforce our
Terms
;
Manage our business; and
Perform functions as otherwise described to you at the time of collection.
Financial Information. We may use financial information or payment method information to process payment for any purchases, subscriptions, or sales made on or through the Site or in connection with our Services, to protect against or identify possible fraudulent transactions, and otherwise as needed to manage our business. Specifically:
Purchases. If you purchase products or pay for Services via the Site, the transaction will be handled by our service vendor responsible for processing your payment. This vendor has its own privacy policy and those terms will apply to you. Please be sure to review them at the links provided during payment processing. Our vendor’s policies are also considered a part of this Privacy Policy and part of your agreement with us.
Credit Card Information. We will require your payment or credit card information in order for our payment vendor to process purchases. This includes your name, payment or credit card number, expiration date, billing address, and authentication codes or related information as needed to authorize the charge and complete the transaction. Credit card data is transferred over a Secured Sockets Layer (“
SSL
”) line if you are using an SSL-enabled browser such as Microsoft Internet Explorer, Firefox, Safari, or Google Chrome. We also use SSL on other select pages where you enter Personal Information. This ensures that the Personal Information is encrypted as it travels over the Internet. This secure mode is enabled before any such information is transmitted from your computer. You will know you are in secure mode when the padlock or key icon in the upper right-hand or left-hand corner of the computer screen appears in the locked position. In addition, when accessing a secure server, the first characters of the site address will change from http to https.
6. What Personal Information Do We Share with Third Parties?
We want you to understand when and with whom we may share personal or other information we have collected about you or your activities on the Site or while using our Services.
Personal Information
. We do not share your Personal Information with others except as indicated herein or when we inform you and give you an opportunity to opt out of having your Personal Information shared. We may share Personal Information with:
Authorized Service Providers. We may share your Personal Information with our authorized service providers, including advertisers and corporate partners, who perform certain services on our behalf. These services may include fulfilling orders, processing credit card payments, providing customer service and marketing assistance, performing business analysis, supporting the functionality of the Site and our Services, supporting surveys, offering additional or related services, and other features offered through or in connection with the Site. These service providers may have access to Personal Information needed to perform their functions but are not permitted to share or use such information for any other purposes.
Other Situations. We also may disclose your information:
In response to a subpoena or similar investigative demand, a court order, or a request for cooperation from a law enforcement or other government agency; to establish or exercise our legal rights; to defend against legal claims; or as otherwise required by law. In such cases, we may raise or waive any legal objection or right available to us, in our sole discretion.
When we believe disclosure is appropriate in connection with efforts to investigate, prevent, report, or take other action regarding illegal activity, suspected fraud, or other wrongdoing; to protect and defend the rights, property, or safety of our company, our users, our employees, or others; to comply with applicable law or cooperate with law enforcement; or to enforce the Terms that apply to our Site or other agreements or policies.
In connection with a substantial corporate transaction, such as the sale of our business, a divestiture, merger, consolidation, or asset sale, or in the unlikely event of bankruptcy. Any future companies to whom we may work with will be consistent with our own Privacy Policy.
We will work to ensure that any third parties to whom we may disclose Personal Information will be consistent with this Privacy Policy. Those additional privacy policies will govern use, handling, and disclosure of your Personal Information once we have shared it with those third parties as described in this Privacy Policy. If you want to learn more about third-party privacy practices, we encourage you to visit the websites of those third parties. These entities or their servers may be located either inside or outside the United States ("
U.S.
").
Aggregated and Non-Personal Information
. We may share aggregated and/or non-Personal Information we collect under any of the above circumstances. We may also share it with third parties to develop and deliver targeted advertising on the Site, through our Services, and on websites of third parties. We may combine non-Personal Information we collect with additional non-Personal Information collected from other sources. We also may share aggregated information with third parties, including advisors, advertisers, and investors, for the purpose of conducting general business analysis. For example, we may tell our advertisers the number of visitors to our website and the most popular features or Services accessed. This information does not contain any Personal Information and may be used to develop website content and services that we hope you and other users will find of interest and to target content and advertising.
7. Social Media
The Site may include social media features, such as Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, and YouTube widgets, or interactive mini-programs that run on the Site. These features may collect your IP address, which page you are visiting on the Site, and may set a cookie to enable the feature to function properly. Social media features and widgets are either hosted by a third party or hosted directly on the Site. Your interactions with these features are governed by the privacy policy of the company providing it, such as the following examples:
Facebook - Privacy
Google - Privacy
8. Your Control
You can choose not to provide us with certain information, which may result in you being unable to use certain features of the Site and our Services because such information may be required in order for you to register, purchase products or Services, participate in a survey, event, or promotion, ask a question, or initiate or engage in other transactions on the Site or through our Services.
When you register on the Site you will be given an explicit choice as to whether you want to receive email messages and/or newsletters about product/content updates, community updates, improvements, special offers/discounts or containing special distributions of content by us. At any time you can choose to no longer receive commercial or promotional emails or newsletters from us by updating your selections on your
Email Preferences
page. You also will be given the opportunity, in any commercial email that we send to you, to unsubscribe from receiving such messages in the future. Unsubscribe requests are immediate. After twelve months of inactivity subscribed users will automatically be unsubscribed in compliance with our policies. We may send you other types of required transactional and relationship email communications (system emails), such as order receipts, gift codes, and other account and security messages like resetting a forgotten password, etc., without offering you the opportunity to unsubscribe from receiving them. Please note that changing information in your account or otherwise unsubscribing from promotional email communications will only affect future activities or communications from us. If we have already provided your information to a third party (such as a credit card processing partner) before you have changed your preferences or updated your information, you may have to change your preferences directly with that third party. We DO NOT sell the personal contact information of our users.
9. Links to Other Sites
The Site may contain links to other sites. Any Personal Information you provide on the linked sites is provided directly to that third party and is subject to that third party’s privacy policy. This Privacy Policy does not apply to such linked sites, and we are not responsible for the content or privacy and security practices and policies of these sites or any other sites that are linked to from our Site.
10. What Steps Do We Take to Protect Your Information Online?
We take reasonable measures to protect your Personal Information in an effort to prevent loss, misuse, and unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, and destruction. Please be aware, however, that despite our efforts, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable and no method of data transmission can be guaranteed against any interception or other type of misuse. If we become aware of a security systems breach, we will attempt to notify you electronically using the contact information we have available so that you can take appropriate protective steps. We may post a notice through the Site if a security breach occurs. If this happens, you will need a web browser enabling you to access our Site. We may also send an email to you at the email address you have provided to use in these circumstances. Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive notice of a security breach in writing.
Users should also be aware of how they handle and disclose their Personal Information and should avoid sending Personal Information through insecure email. Please refer to the
Federal Trade Commission’s website
for information about how to protect yourself against identity theft.
11. Your California Privacy Rights
If you are a California resident, you have the following rights under the California Consumer Privacy Act:
Right to Know
. You have the right to know and see what data we have collected about you over the past 12 months, including:
the categories of personal information we have collected about you;
the categories of sources from which the personal information is collected;
the business or commercial purpose for collecting your personal information;
the categories of third parties with whom we have shared your personal information; and
the specific pieces of personal information we have collected about you.

This request is free and may be made once a year. You also have the right not to be discriminated against for exercising any of the rights listed above.
Certain information may be exempt from such requests under applicable law. For example, we need certain types of information so that we can provide our Services to you. If you ask us to delete it, you may no longer be able to access or use our Services.
To exercise your rights under the California Consumer Privacy Act, please visit your
data management page
or contact us by sending us an email at
service@fitnessblender.com
. Please provide your full name and email address so that we may respond to your request as quickly as possible. You will be required to verify your identify before we fulfill your request. To do so, you will need to provide us with certain account information, such as your full name and email address. You can also designate an authorized agent to make a request on your behalf. To do so, you must provide us with written authorization for the agent to act on your behalf. You will still need to verify your identity directly with us.
For purposes of compliance with the CCPA, in addition to the further details as described in this Privacy Policy, we make the following disclosures:
We collect the following categories of personal information:
Identifiers (e.g., your name, account number, email address, IP address)
Commercial/transactional information (e.g., your purchase information)
Internet or other electronic network activity information (e.g., information about your website or app usage)
Geolocation data (e.g., your physical location)
Visual information (e.g., any photographs you upload on your account)
Inferences (e.g., analytics and preferences)
We use and disclose these categories of information to enable use of our sites, Services, and products, to communicate with you, to understand how our users interact with our sites, and to improve our offerings as otherwise described in this Policy.
12. Nevada and Other State Resident Privacy Rights
Chapter 603A of the Nevada Revised Statutes permits a Nevada resident to opt out of future sales of certain covered information that a website operator has collected or will collect about the resident. If you are a Nevada resident, you may submit a request to opt out of potential future sales under Nevada law by contacting us as indicated below. Please include sufficient information for us to identify you in your email, such as your account information. Please note we will take reasonable steps to verify your identity and the authenticity of the request.
Residents of other U.S. states may have similar rights, depending on the laws of each state. Please contact us as indicated below to exercise any rights you are entitled to under your state’s laws. Please note we will take reasonable steps to verify your identity and the authenticity of the request.
13. International Visitors
The Site and our Services are hosted in and provided from the U.S. If you use the Site or our Services from the European Union (or European Economic Region, "
EU
") or other regions with laws governing data collection and use that may differ from U.S. law, please note that you are transferring your personal data to the U.S. The U.S. does not have the same data protection laws as the EU and some other regions. By providing your Personal Information, you consent to the transfer of your personal data to the U.S. and the use of your Personal Information, in accordance with this Privacy Policy.
14. Information Retention, Disposal, and Management
We may retain Personal Information for as long as we have a business need for it or as applicable laws, regulations, or government orders require us to retain it. Additionally, the Site and/or our Services may enable you (or other users) to save information including information that you have made public or allowed certain users to access or see.
If you request to permanently delete your account, we will confirm with you first and then schedule your account for anonymization, which may take at least 7 days. Once anonymized, your name, email, username, and other personal information will be removed and any existing comments or discussions will display “Account Closed.”
You may manage your Personal Information on our Site, including backing up and exporting your data associated with your account, by visiting your
data management page
. If you want to delete or modify any Personal Information that is inaccurate, you may do so by visiting your
data management page
or sending an email to
service@fitnessblender.com
. If you have an account, you may login to your account to update your profile information, export such information, and request the deletion of your account. In making or requesting modifications, you must provide only truthful, complete, and accurate information. We may limit your right to make changes to Personal Information where the burden or expense of providing access would be disproportionate to the risks to your privacy or where the legitimate interests of other persons may be violated.
Please note that notwithstanding your request to change or delete Personal Information, we may be required to keep this information and not modify or delete it, or to keep this information for a certain time, in which case we will comply with your deletion request only after we have fulfilled such requirements. When we delete any information, it will be deleted from the active database, but may remain in our archives. In some instances, however, Personal Information that you requested to be removed may be retained in certain files for a period of time in order to troubleshoot problems. In addition, some types of Personal Information may be stored indefinitely on back-up systems or within log files due to technical constraints or financial or legal requirements. Therefore, you should not always expect that all of your Personal Information will be completely removed from our databases in response to your request.
We reserve the right to verify the identity of any person making a request to delete or modify incorrect Personal Information, to charge you a fee before providing access and to deny such requests, except as prohibited by law; provided, however, that we will have no liability of any kind resulting from false or erroneous requests or any change or deletion we make for any reason.
15. “Do Not Track”
Section 22575 of the California Business & Professions Code requires website and online service operators to disclose whether they honor web browser “Do Not Track” settings. Our capabilities at this time prohibit us from honoring the “Do Not Track” web browser settings. Other third parties may or may not honor Do Not Track signals. These parties may collect Personal Information about your online activities over time and across different web sites when you visit the Site, for example by using cookies on our Site. We have no access to or control over other parties’ Personal Information collection practices, even those with which we may have an affiliation. You should carefully review the privacy policy and terms of any website you visit. For more information about Do Not Track, please visit
www.allaboutdnt.org
.
16. Terms Applicable to Data from EU Member Countries
We are based in and operate from the U.S. In most cases, the Personal Information we collect is stored and used in the U.S. While we do not direct our Services to residents of the EU, it is possible that EU residents may access and use the Site.
If we collect Personal Information from EU residents in a manner subject to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) then, in addition to the above, the following terms shall also apply to our collection, use, and retention of that information:
Basis for Collection
: As set out above, we collect and process Personal Information for which you have given your express consent at the time of collection. For example, we collect Personal Information when you elect to create an account. We also collect and process Personal Information to order to improve our Site, to deliver Services and perform obligations under contracts we have with you, and to comply with our own legal obligations.
Sensitive Data
: At this time we do not intentionally collect sensitive data, for example, biometric data, health data, political affiliation, religion, sexual orientation, or data revealing racial or ethnic origin, from visitors to the Site (“Sensitive Data”). Sensitive Data is a type of Personal Information that, if revealed, can leave an individual vulnerable to discrimination or harassment and may impact their livelihood, quality of life, and ability to participate in daily activities. We therefore avoid collecting this type of information.
Onward Transfer
: Except as otherwise provided in this Privacy Policy, we only disclose Personal Information to third parties who reasonably need to have access to it for the purpose of the transaction or activity for which it was originally collected or to provide Services to or perform tasks on our behalf or under our instruction. All such third parties must agree to use such the Personal Information we provide to them only the purposes for which we have engaged them and they must either: (a) comply with the EU-US Privacy Shield Principles or another mechanism permitted by the applicable EU & Swiss data protection law(s) for transfers and processing of Personal Information; or (b) agree to provide adequate protections for the Personal Information that are no less protective than those set out in this Privacy Policy. Where we have knowledge that an entity to whom we have provided Personal Information is using or disclosing Personal Information in a manner contrary to this Privacy Policy, we will take reasonable and appropriate steps to prevent, remediate, or stop the use or disclosure.
Authorized Transfer
: We also may disclose Personal Information for other purposes or to other third parties when you have consented to or requested such disclosure. Please be aware that we will disclose Personal Information in response to lawful requests by public authorities, including to meet national security or law enforcement requirements. We are not liable for appropriate onward transfers of personal data to third parties.
Data Processors
: We may retain third parties to process or analyze Personal Information we collect from the Site. For example, a Site may be maintained or hosted by a third-party service provider, a promotion may be administered by a sales-promotion agency, and/or products may be fulfilled by a wholesaler. These suppliers and other third parties who provide services for us are contractually obligated not to use Personal Information about you except as we authorize.
Profiling
: We may analyze Personal Information we have collected about you to create a profile of your interests and preferences so that we can contact you with information that is relevant to you. We may make use of additional information about you when it is available from external sources to help us do this effectively. We may also use Personal Information about you to detect and reduce fraud and credit risk.
Your Rights
: Your rights may include: (a) a right to withdraw your consent to the processing of Personal Information about you to which you have previously given consent; (b) a right to object to processing of Personal Information about you for the purpose of direct marketing; and (c) a right to have incorrect Personal Information about you corrected or removed.
If you request to have incorrect Personal Information removed, we may retain some of your Personal Information as necessary for the purposes of our legitimate business interests or in furtherance of public interests in accordance with the Privacy Shield Principles. Any Personal Information you have shared publicly with others may continue to be publicly visible on the Site.
You also have the right to obtain a copy of the Personal Information we have about you, although we reserve the right to charge a fee for this depending on the nature and frequency of your request(s) and our cost to provide the information.
Questions and Complaints
: If you have questions or complaints regarding this Policy or our handling of your Personal Information, please contact us at
service@fitnessblender.com
. We will promptly investigate and attempt to resolve complaints and disputes in a manner that complies with the principles described in this Privacy Policy.
17. Changeability
We reserve the right to change or modify this Privacy Policy, the Site, and the Services we offer at any time to reflect changes in our business, practices, or to keep current with relevant laws or industry standards. We may attempt to notify registered users of material changes by sending an email to the email address you most recently provided us in your account, profile, or registration (unless we do not have such an email address), and/or by posting notice of the changes on the Site. Your access to and/or use of the Site and our Services will be subject to the most current version of this Privacy Policy posted on the Site at the time of your access or use. We recommend that you check the Site from time to time to inform yourself of any changes in this Privacy Policy, and stay apprised of any other Policies that may be applicable; you are solely responsible for reviewing and becoming familiar with any modifications to this Privacy Policy.
18. Questions and Contact Information
If you have any questions about our Privacy Policy or privacy practices, please contact us at
service@fitnessblender.com
