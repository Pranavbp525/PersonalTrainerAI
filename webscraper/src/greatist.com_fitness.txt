FAQ
Discover the best full spectrum CBD oil options that might enhance your wellness routine. From easing anxiety to managing pain, explore top-rated products and learn how full spectrum CBD oil may offer unique benefits.
If you follow wellness trends, you’ve probably heard about
CBD
. It’s showing some promising benefits — including reducing symptoms of
anxiety
, improving
sleep
, and managing
pain
.
But there are a bunch of different ways to add CBD into your
self-care
routine. Not only are there different ways to take it — like
oils
,
capsules
,
tinctures
,
topicals
, and
gummies
— but there are different
types
of CBD too: full-spectrum, broad-spectrum, and isolate. It’s a lot, we know.
Full-spectrum CBD has its own special advantages and disadvantages that make it a unique player in the CBD game. If you’re looking to add a little CBD into your life, it’s a great option — but there are def some things to know before diving in.
We dug into all the latest research about full-spectrum CBD and vetted the most popular brands to find you the highest quality full-spectrum CBD products out there. Let’s get started, shall we?

What is full-spectrum CBD?
Let’s back up. To help you understand what full-spectrum CBD is, it’s helpful to know the following:
There are more than 100
cannabinoids
in cannabis and hemp plants. The two most researched are
CBD
and
THC
. THC is the one that makes you feel “
high
,” while CBD won’t give you the same psychoactive effect.
Another major player in the game is
terpenes.
These aromatic compounds are known for having
therapeutic benefits
of their own. These are found in other places in nature too — including
essential oils
.
Yet another helping hand is
flavonoids.
These also have shown to have
therapeutic benefits
— they’re found in things like fruits, veggies, wine, tea, and chocolate. Yum.
Full-spectrum CBD is CBD that contains allll of the above compounds naturally found in the cannabis plant — including THC (though never more than 0.3 percent of it).
Full-spectrum CBD’s cousins —
broad-spectrum
and
isolate
— don’t contain all of these compounds. Broad-spectrum contains all of the terpenes and flavonoids, but no THC. Isolate is nothing but CBD.
Here’s a little chart to break down how they all differ:

Pros and cons of full-spectrum CBD
How do you know if full-spectrum is the right type of CBD for you? Let’s break down the pros and cons.
Pros
Full-spectrum CBD has been getting a lot of love lately, as
research
suggests that keeping all of those compounds together (THC included) enhances their therapeutic benefits — especially when it comes to
mood disorders and anxiety
. This is lovingly referred to as the “entourage effect.”
There is
some research
that says CBD can be beneficial on its own — it just requires a specific dose that can be hard to find.
The presence of THC, in particular, may help give full-spectrum CBD an extra anti-inflammatory, pain-busting boost that broad-spectrum and CBD isolate products don’t have.
Another pro of full-spectrum CBD is its easy availability. You can find a wide variety of full-spectrum products (including oils, pills, capsules, gummies, and topicals) online or in many health/wellness stores.
Cons
One of full-spectrum CBD’s biggest assets is also one of the biggest strikes against it: THC. This isn’t a con for everybody, though.
Full-spectrum products generally contain small amounts of THC. Hemp-derived products will never contain more than 0.3 percent, but cannabis-derived CBD products can contain more — so it’s important to check whether products are in line with what may or may not be legal in your state.
The THC can also put full-spectrum CBD users at risk of
testing positive on a drug test
— especially if you use full-spectrum products daily for an extended period of time.
If you want to avoid THC altogether, broad-spectrum or CBD isolate products are def a better option for you.
How we chose the best full-spectrum CBD products
When comparing these full-spectrum CBD products, we considered many factors, but the
CBD
itself wasn’t what made these our top picks. Instead, we chose these products based on criteria we think are good indicators of safety, quality, and transparency.
We made sure to include products that:
are produced by a company that provides proof of third-party testing by an
ISO 17025-compliant
lab
are made with U.S.-grown hemp
contain no more than 0.3 percent THC, according to the certificate of analysis (COA)
have passing levels of pesticides, heavy metals, residual solvents, and molds, according to the COA
Other factors we considered in selecting these products:
company certifications and manufacturing processes
product potency
overall ingredients
indicators of user trust and brand reputation, such as:
customer reviews
whether the company has been subject to an
FDA warning letter
whether the company makes any unsupported health claims
Pricing guide
Full-spectrum CBD comes in a variety of forms and volumes, so we included picks to fit any budget.

Reviewers call this oil high quality and praise how well it helps with sleep,
anxiety
, and pain. Keep in mind that it isn’t flavored, so it’ll have that strong earthy taste typical of unflavored CBD products.

How to shop for full-spectrum CBD
There are tons of full-spectrum CBD products on the market, so how do you choose the right one for you? Here are a few things to consider when shopping for a quality CBD product:
Make sure the certificate of analysis (COA) is up-to-date (and from a third-party lab!).
Verify that the product contains less than 0.3 percent THC.
Read what reviewers are saying. This may help you determine whether the product is legit and suitable for your specific needs.
Be suspicious of products that have customer complaints or outstanding lawsuits.
Check labels for misleading ingredients.
Be wary of boastful marketing. CBD is cool, but it’s
not a cure-all
, so if a claim seems too good to be true, it probably is.
Wondering what the heck a “carrier oil” is? It’s an oil that carries the CBD and other phytochemicals, helping dissolve the compounds of the hemp plant. Make sure your CBD uses a carrier oil that’s safe for you.
You’ll also want to consider the type of CBD product to get. But while having to choose between oils and gummies and topicals (oh my!) may seem overwhelming, we’ve got your back.
Oils or tinctures.
This is one of the fastest ways to reap the benefits of CBD. Oils and tinctures are extracted directly from the plant and diluted with a carrier oil. They’re usually taken orally, so they hit your bloodstream quicker than other forms, making them good for those looking for fast-acting CBD effects.
Edibles (and eatables!).
Basically any kind of CBD product you can ingest falls under the edibles category, including pills, capsules,
gummies
, fizzy drinks, and even candy (like chocolate, yum!). These are great options for those who aren’t looking for immediate impact, as
research
shows that edible CBD products absorb more slowly.
Topicals
.
Topical CBD — like lotions, creams, and
balms
— are applied directly to the skin (read: don’t eat!) for soothing relief. They’re an effective way to target a specific area, making them a particularly great option for those with arthritis, muscle pain,
period cramps
, or certain skin conditions.
Talk with your doc about full-spectrum CBD
Check with your doctor before using CBD, especially if you regularly take any medication, because CBD can interact badly with some medications.
How to use full-spectrum CBD
If you choose to use a full-spectrum CBD
oil or tincture
, you’ll simply use the dropper to measure your dose, squeeze the drops under your tongue, and hold the liquid there for about 20 seconds before swallowing.
If you like to experiment, you can also mix CBD oil with your favorite drink or add a few drops to your
moisturizer
to massage into your skin.
If you opt for
gummies, capsules, or other edible forms
of CBD, all you gotta do is eat or swallow the product. Be sure not to overdo it, though: CBD edibles aren’t meant to be noshed on like a
bag of chips
— one or two pieces will suffice. Be sure to follow the serving directions for your specific product to make sure you’re not exceeding the recommended amount.
Topical CBD
products are applied directly to the skin in the area where you’re feeling pain or discomfort. As with any topical product, be cautious using on cracked or broken skin to avoid irritation. Follow the manufacturer’s instructions (or your doctor’s orders!) on how much to use.
Dosage
If you’re new to CBD, start with a
smaller dose
to see how it feels, and then increase over time if needed. For full-spectrum CBD, you can start at 5 mg. You might have to adjust your dose depending on your weight and the issue you’re trying to address.
Frequently asked questions
Are there any side effects of taking CBD?
While CBD is
well-tolerated by humans
, some people experience mild side effects like:
fatigue
diarrhea
appetite changes
weight changes
uneasiness
Is CBD safe?
CBD is
generally considered safe
, but the FDA doesn’t guarantee the safety, effectiveness, or quality of over-the-counter CBD products. Some companies take advantage of this and sell unapproved CBD products with unsubstantiated health claims. That’s why it’s super important to do your own research before buying any CBD product.
What is full-spectrum CBD?
Full-spectrum CBD is one of three types of CBD. Unlike broad-spectrum or CBD isolate, full-spectrum CBD contains all of the naturally-occurring compounds found in the cannabis plant — including THC.
What are the benefits of full-spectrum CBD?
From easing anxiety to soothing stress, full-spectrum CBD is best known for its therapeutic benefits. When used topically, it can help
provide pain relief
to sore muscles,
achy joints
, inflammation, or even menstrual cramps.
What’s the difference between broad-spectrum and full-spectrum CBD?
The
difference between broad- and full-spectrum CBD
comes down to one thing: THC. Full-spectrum CBD contains *
all
* of the cannabis plant’s natural compounds, including THC. Broad-spectrum, however, contains all of the plant’s compounds *
except
* THC.
Does full spectrum CBD have THC?
Yes. Full-spectrum CBD contains THC — as well as all of the other compounds found in the cannabis plant.
The bottom line
The science behind CBD is still pretty new, and what works for one person may not work for another. If you’re curious about full-spectrum CBD, doing your research and finding a quality product to try could help you find some relief.
Is CBD legal?
The 2018 Farm Bill removed hemp from the legal definition of
marijuana
in the Controlled Substances Act. This made some hemp-derived CBD products with less than 0.3% THC federally legal. However, CBD products containing more than 0.3% THC still fall under the legal definition of marijuana, making them federally illegal but legal under some state laws. Be sure to check
state laws
, especially when traveling. Also, keep in mind that the FDA has not approved nonprescription CBD products, and some products may be inaccurately labeled.

Pre-pet checklist
Pet parenting gear
tl;dr
Ever want to try something new but have no idea where to start? We’re comin' in hot with the tools, the skills, and the inspo you need to tackle a new hobby or activity with confidence. Your First Gear starts here.
Share on Pinterest
Print Illustration by Maya Chastain
So you’ve been fantasizing about having a cuddle buddy, and now it’s finally time to adopt your first furry (or scaly or feathery) friend. Becoming a pet parent carries a lot of responsibility, but with the proper research and prep, you’ll welcome the right critter into your home for the next 1 to 20 years!
Adopting a cat or
dog
are obviously the more popular options, but maybe something like a rodent or a lizard is more suited to your lifestyle. Regardless, there’s still plenty of prep involved.
We break down how to get ready for your first pet and what gear you need to give them the care they deserve.
Everything you should do before becoming a pet parent
Despite the fact that it sounds pretty simple, adopting a pet is definitely not a
purr
of the moment kind of deal. It’s a *process*. And often, this process doesn’t end when you bring the little critter home.
That said, there are some essential steps you need to check off your list before getting too far down the road.
Do your animal research
Before becoming a
pet parent
, you’ll want to take a hard look at what you really want in a pet… and what you have to give. Consider your budget (adoption fees, food, and long-term costs like veterinary care), space (teeny city apartment or 2 acres to roam?), time (will you be home enough to keep your buddy healthy and happy?), and commitment (can you see this doggo in your life for the next 10 years?)
First Gear
Some extra emphasis on budget
After pet type, your budget should be your next biggest consideration, as it will vary with the type of pet friend you choose. A puppers, for example, can cost $700 to $7,000 per year. Cost will depend on if your pet has or develops medical conditions, has unique breed grooming needs, and whether you require frequent doggie day care, boarding, or walking services.
You’ll need to dig deeper into the needs of particular breeds and species, but here are some general starters when it comes to caring for the most common pet categories:
Cats and dogs.
Pups
and kitties are
popular pets
because they’re great for reflecting all your love and attention back at you. Don’t underestimate the commitment they require, though. Cats can live up to 20 years and dogs live 10 to 15 years. Both need
daily play
, regular grooming, and plenty of entertainment.
Dogs
will require a little more in terms of training and activity. Take advantage of the expert advice at animals shelters and vet clinics to help you determine which breed meets your lifestyle best.
Small mammals.
Rabbits, guinea pigs, hamsters, rats, and mice. You might think of these little critters as a kid’s starter pet, but they have pretty specific needs in terms of environment and attention. A rodent or rabbit could make the perfect pet for you if you’re short on space but have plenty of patience and curiosity to learn about their lifestyles. For example,
guinea pigs
need time out of their cage every day for play and snuggles. Some
rodents
are nocturnal, and might not be a good fit for homes that are very active during the day.
Reptiles.
It’s important to learn as much as you can before bringing home a reptile. Lizards like geckos, skinks, and bearded dragons or snakes like ball pythons and corn snakes can make great first pets. Make sure you understand what they need in terms of a secure enclosure, lighting and heat source. Also, consider your comfort with maybe having to feed your cold-blooded friend a frozen mouse once a week.
Birds.
Who doesn’t want a glorious parrot to make pirate jokes with? However, birds are needy creatures and may not be the pet to start with if you’re inexperienced. They can also live for a really long time. Lovebirds, for example, can live 25 years, some parrots can live 50 years, and some cockatoos can get up to around 60. They will need plenty of toys and a cage big enough to spread their wings. Birds are very sensitive to scents and chemicals as well, so consider your Febreze habits before bringing one home.
Fish.
For the smallest of pets, fish can come with a steep initial investment in equipment. Plopping your beta in a bowl will probably not do it. Once you get all the equipment and learn how to maintain their habitat, fish don’t require a lot in terms of attention and energy (compared to a golden retriever). Just keep in mind that starting an aquarium is probably more of a hobby or accessory than an opportunity for long-term companionship.
Personal prep
Once you pick the perfect type of pet, it’s time to prep your schedule and your space.
Here are 10 pet prep tips:
Secure anything you don’t want consumed and/or destroyed by a curious new pet: Does the garbage can have a lid? Are the
houseplants
safe? Is there anything dangly or shiny or expensive exposed? Are there strings or shoelaces they could try to eat and choke on?
For free-roaming pets, put a cozy bed or cushion in every room to discourage them from sitting on furniture.
Invest in scratching posts and high perches for curious cats.
Use gates and crates to keep dogs safe when unsupervised.
Set up cages or habitats before you bring your animal home so you both don’t get stressed by assembly hiccups.
Try to bring your pet home when you’ll be around for a day or 2 to help them adjust.
Schedule a vet visit soon to get your pet checked out and adjusted to their new vet.
Don’t invite all your friends over to meet your pet the first day. Too much activity can be overwhelming at first.
Make a firm, but flexible schedule for feeding, walks, and playtime so you can both get comfortable with the new routine.
Depending on your pet, potty training can take time. For dogs, try to designate a starting space that’s easy to clean, and then set up a game plan for transitioning them outside. For cats, you’ll obviously want to go the indoor litter box route, which is a bit of a different process. Give yourself and your pet grace. (If you don’t have a ton of time to commit to house training a
puppy
, adopt a more mature, experienced dog.)
Communication with the whole family
Are there one or more additional humans living in your space? It’s really important to make sure they’re also on board with inviting a pet into the fold.
Discuss how a new pet would affect your roommate(s), determine how to share responsibilities, set realistic expectations with children (spoiler: they probably won’t be able to totally care for a pet on their own).
Discuss whether any parts of your home will be off-limits to the pet and how to secure those areas.
Many of these factors may change as you get used to your new family member, but it’s important to start with a plan.
Allergy and other safety prep
It’s not the wild kingdom, but pet parenting does come with its risks. The most common incompatibility issue is if you or someone you live with is allergic to pets. It’s also possible to be allergic to the materials in some rodent habitats.
For the safety of everyone involved, small children may not be a good match for
small pets
. Young kids can make little animals very nervous with sudden movements, loud noises, or rough handling. And a nervous animal may bite.
People living with reptiles should also be aware of the possibility of salmonella infection, especially for vulnerable small children, pregnant people, and folks who are immunocompromised.
Your pet’s must-have gear
And last, but certainly not least, here’s the basic gear you’ll need for your new friend, broken down by pet type:
Share on Pinterest
Print Illustration by Maya Chastain
Cats
collar with identification tag
a litter box, litter, and scoop
a carrier
beds
food and water bowls
scratching surfaces
toys
a cardboard box (IYKYK)
brush
food
Dogs
collar with identification tags: Flat collar or martingale collar, which tightens to prevent slipping out without causing pain or choking
a 6-foot nylon leash
poop bags
beds
crate and/or gates (a crate should be big enough for the dog to stand and turn around comfortably)
food and water bowls
toys
: hard rubber toys for chewing, puzzle toys to keep them busy, stuffed toys for snuggling or murdering, balls and toys for outside play
brush
food
Rodents
a cage
bedding material
a box for nesting
food dish
water bottle
pellets or fresh vegetables, depending on their recommended diet
hay
toys
exercise wheel
brush
Reptiles
terrarium
habitat features like rocks, sand, branches, water
climbing structures
heating light
thermometer
humidity gauge
insects, mice, vegetables, depending on the animal’s diet
Birds
a cage large enough to allow flight
a cover for the cage
clean water and food containers
paper for lining the bottom of the cage
perches
toys
food
Fish
aquarium
net
light
thermometer
filter
pump
water conditioner
water test strips
habitat features like fake plants, rocks, caves, structures
pebbles for the bottom of the tank
fish food
You can find any of the above at a wide range of price points, according to what you want for your pet and how often your pet uses some of the gear.
Obviously, you’ll want to lean toward brands and materials that are safe and proven to be good quality. But once you have about a month or so of pet parenting under your belt, you can get a better feel for how to construct your budget around the priorities.
Bottom line
A pet can bring so much love and intrigue to your life, who wouldn’t want one? What kind of pet you get depends a lot on the time you’re able to spend time with them and the space you have.
Starting with the essentials, like doing animal research, taking inventory of your space for any needed adjustments, and communicating with others in your home will get you off to a good start.
Once you’ve chosen the perfect species and decked out their habitat, you’ll be ready to get the gear you need for your new friend. Give both yourself and your new pet some grace at the beginning. Remember, it’s a new relationship you’re forming and it takes time to find a rhythm.

Your 30s are a

1. Focus on feeling good
There’s nothing wrong with wanting a “hot bod”. But having a mindset that’s about improving your health rather than improving your appearance may actually be better for achieving your weight loss #goals.
One
study
found that participants who were primarily motivated to lose weight to improve their appearance actually
gained
weight over a 30-month period. Participants who wanted to lose weight to improve their overall health and reduce risk of disease experienced significant weight loss.
Bonus: A
2014 research review
suggested that maintaining a moderate weight can boost your
self-confidence
and body-image. (But for the record, we like you very much
just as you are
!)
2. Make sleep a priority
There are only 24 hours in a day, so squeezing in a
quality snooze sesh
can be a challenge when your time is filled with
work
, a social life, and caring for your children/fur-babies/
plants
. But it’s important to get in those Zzz’s for optimal health — and successful weight loss.
But how much sleep do you
actually need
?
The American Academy of Sleep Medicine and Sleep Research Society
suggests that the sweet spot is somewhere between 7 to 9 hours a night. Sleeping less than 7 hours on the reg may put you at a higher risk of
developing obesity
or other
health concerns
.
Pro tip
: It’s easy to let precious
sleep time slip away
. Try
scheduling your sleep
or finding a
supplement
that works for you.
3. Hydrate, hydrate, hydrate!
Keeping your body flush with fluids is key for maintaining a moderate weight.
How much
H
2
O you need depends on a bunch of factors, like your age, activity levels, and current weight.
Drinking plenty of water
can also help keep your metabolism in check. In fact, a small 2003 study showed that a single 16-ounce serving can boost your body’s calorie burning potential and rev your metabolic rate by
as much as 30 percent
!
Plain ol’ agua not making your taste buds sing? Try infusing it with
delicious fruity flavor
or enjoying some
sparkling water
.
4. Get your body moving
Not-so-fun fact: Muscle mass
starts to decline
as you get older, particularly after you turn 30.
Better fact: You can build and
maintain muscle
mass with regular movement and exercise. And this doesn’t even mean you have to hit the gym every day.
Choose whatever kind of workout or movement that suits your style and sparks joy. Take a
yoga
or
Pilates
class,
dance
around your living room, chase your kids (or dogs) around the yard. Whatever brings a smile to your face and gets your body moving and grooving can help your body!
5. Just say “no” to fad diets
There are countless fad diets that promise a “get slim quick!” solution to all your weight loss woes. While some popular diets might help you
lose weight
temporarily, many won’t work at all. And most aren’t sustainable.
According to a
research review
, dieting and disordered eating won’t help with long-term weight maintenance. Restricting what you eat and limiting calorie intake can also have a negative effect on both your physical and mental health.
Instead of jumping on the fad-wagon,
prioritize your well-being
over whatever wellness trend is currently gaining buzz.
Make nutritious choices
, indulge in moderation, and treat your body like the temple it is. If you find yourself struggling or you could use personalized guidance, consult your doctor or a nutritionist for support.
6. Keep stress in check
Stress
can definitely take a mental toll, but what about the physical? From
headaches
to digestive probs, stress can negatively impact your bod. It can also boost your
cortisol
levels or make you reach for that not-so-healthy treat. Both of those effects can lead to weight gain. This stress weight can be
harder to get rid of
in your 30s.
A
small study
suggested that you can prevent
stress-related weight gain
by adopting techniques to manage your stress. Eating a balanced diet, getting plenty of sleep, and exercising regularly can all help
keep your stress in check
. You can also try doing
mindful activities
focused on easing your body and mind, like yoga or meditation.
If you find that your stress isn’t going away and continuing to lead to weight gain or other health concerns, talk with your doctor.
7. Fuel your body with nutritious foods
A
nutrient-rich, balanced diet
is the “secret” to weight loss at any age. But what does this diet actually look like?
Start by
getting enough protein
. This helps you feel full and helps you build muscle. You’ll also want to
add fiber-rich foods
(like veggies, fruits, beans, and nuts) and nutritious fats (like eggs, yogurt, and
avocado
).
Avoid processed snack foods
whenever you can. This includes fast food, packaged snacks, and drinks like soda (aka “pop” if that’s how you roll). These items can not only make you more likely to
gain weight
, but can also up your risk of
developing heart disease or certain cancers
.
Weight loss in your 30s: FAQs
You’ve got questions, we’ve got answers.
Why is it harder to lose weight in your 30s?
This just has to do with the normal aging process. Once you reach 30, your body starts to work a bit… differently.
An older 2004 research review showed that in your 30s, you start losing
3 to 8 percent
of muscle mass per decade. Muscle helps torch calories, so losing muscle means you’re burning fewer calories. Your
metabolism is also slowing down
. That makes it even harder to get those cals gone. Add in
fluctuating hormones
(your body starts experiencing a reduction in estrogen or testosterone levels) and you’ve got a recipe for a weight loss stalemate.
Can you “kick-start” your metabolism in your 30s?
While there’s no magic fix to get your metabolism into gear, making small
diet
and lifestyle changes may help give it a nudge.
Eat a
protein-rich diet
. That may help increase calorie and fat burn.
Drink
water
or
green tea
. They might temporarily speed up your metabolism.
Get your body moving with
high-intensity interval training (HIIT)
.
Some suggest adding spicy foods or (more)
coffee
into your diet can help get your metabolism going. But the research is mixed on whether this really makes a difference.
How do you lose pregnancy weight in your 30s?
One
older 1997 study
showed that losing weight after a pregnancy can take longer as you get older. Patience is key to postpartum weight loss. Your body just created life! So, treat it with love and care.
Eating a balanced diet, getting enough sleep (or as much as possible with bébé!), and getting in some mindful movement can help you reach a moderate weight.
tl;dr
Losing weight in your 30s may be more challenging than when you were younger, but it’s not impossible. It’s important to have patience and make mindful, nutritious choices. This includes eating a balanced diet, getting enough sleep, drinking plenty of water, and making sure to get your body moving.
There’s no fast-pass to weight loss, but these lifestyle changes can work wonders in helping you to lose unwanted weight (or maintain your current weight!), no matter what your age.

The Same but Not Really: Here’s the Difference Between ADD and ADHD

ADD vs. ADHD
Types
Symptoms
Treatment
Confused about ADD vs. ADHD? You’re not alone. Dive into the history, differences, and symptoms of these terms. Learn how ADHD is diagnosed and treated today, and why the term ADD is no longer used in medical contexts.
Remember when the term “ADD” was all the rage in your seventh grade classroom? Then one day you learned ADD wasn’t a thing anymore and ADHD had taken its place (kinda like when your cousin Bobby came home for Thanksgiving last year suddenly
insisting
to be called “Robert”).
So who is this new big-kid version of ADD?
Technically, ADD (attention deficit disorder) doesn’t exist anymore — ADHD (attention deficit hyperactivity disorder) eventually
became the official term
in the American Psychiatric Association’s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. But the older term stuck around for quite a while anyway.
Share on Pinterest
So, what is the difference between ADD and ADHD
ADHD is characterized by ongoing inattention and/or hyperactivity and impulsivity that interferes with daily functioning or normal development.
In a nutshell, ADD and ADHD are basically the same. Only, they’re not… because “ADD” is an outdated term that was used to describe someone who struggled to focus but
didn’t
have hyperactivity.
ADHD affects an estimated
2.5 percent
of adults and
8.4 percent
of children in the United States. According to the
American Psychiatric Association
, it’s one of the most common mental health conditions affecting kids.
It’s also often overlooked — especially in women — because people assume the symptoms are the result of hormones, burnout, and being tired or stressed.
A history lesson in the terminology
In May 2013, the American Psychiatric Association published the DSM-5, which included updated criteria for diagnosing someone with ADHD.
It wasn’t the first time (or the second) that
the condition’s name changed
. In the DSM-2 from 1968, it was called Hyperkinetic Reaction of Childhood, with an emphasis on high levels of activity and movement.
In the DSM-3, published in 1980, the focus shifted to the symptoms of inattention, impulsivity, and hyperactivity, and the condition was called either Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity or Attention Deficit Disorder without Hyperactivity.
The DSM-3-R in 1994 eliminated the diagnosis “ADD without hyperactivity” and introduced the term “ADHD.”
And in 1994, the DSM-4 categorized ADHD into three subtypes: “predominantly inattentive,” “predominantly hyperactive-impulsive,” and “combined.” It also included ADHD “not otherwise specified.”
The final shift from ADD to ADHD happened in 2013 with the release of the DSM-5. What changed this time?
First, the criteria for diagnosing ADHD changed slightly. The APA clarified how and when symptoms can manifest, since ADHD shows up differently in adults and kids (there’s a difference between ADHD in men and in women too).
Back in the day, a diagnosis of ADHD required “clinically significant” severity, but now the DSM acknowledges that symptoms are legit if they “reduce the quality” of life at work, school, or home or in social settings.
Plus, ADHD can now be diagnosed as mild, moderate, or severe and can even be classified as being in “partial remission” if symptoms are reduced enough.
The three types of ADHD
ADHD is categorized into
three types
: predominantly inattentive, predominantly hyperactive-impulsive, and combined.
Here’s what those terms mean:
Inattentive
Inattentive ADHD is usually what people mean when they say “ADD.”
Someone with this type of ADHD might feel spacey, unable to focus, or generally distracted — but not hyperactive or impulsive. This might be the friend who invites you to go to yoga class and then stands you up.
People experiencing symptoms of inattentive ADHD might:
becomes easily distracted
struggle to pay attention to details needed to complete tasks (like school or work assignments)
ignores someone speaking to them
has issues following instruction
seem forgetful, distant in conversations, or disorganized
have poor time management skills or trouble meeting deadlines or making appointments
lose track of personal items (keys, phone, etc.)
not finish what they start
dislike activities that may take a long time or a lot of effort and focus
Hyperactive-impulsive
This type of ADHD shows up as symptoms of hyperactivity and impulsivity but not as much inattention.
People experiencing this type of ADHD tend to be fidgety and constantly moving. They act first and think later. This could be your co-worker who always overshares (hello, TMI!) and seems to be hyped-up on caffeine.
People experiencing symptoms of hyperactive-impulsive ADHD might:
not consider the consequences of their actions
have trouble staying seated
fidgets or moves a lot
say whatever comes to mind (no filter!)
interrupts a lot in conversation
has trouble waiting their turn
struggle to control their emotions (like crying easily or oversharing)
always needing to move onto the next task or activity
Combined
Combined ADHD shows up as the trifecta of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity. This type of ADHD is a mash-up of the two other types. According to the
National Institute of Mental Health
, most children who have ADHD have this type.
For someone to be diagnosed with ADHD, their symptoms must:
interfere with daily life for at least 6 months
present before age 12 (but diagnosis can happen at any age — even much later)
happen in more than one setting (such as at home
and
at school or work)
not be linked to another mental health condition (a diagnosis of depression or anxiety often accompanies ADHD)
What ADHD feels like
Symptoms of ADHD
can vary by age and sex. They can appear as early as age 3, but it’s also common for the condition to go unnoticed until adulthood.
In
little kids
, the most common symptom is hyperactivity/impulsivity. In elementary school, the inability to focus becomes more common.
By the teen years, hyperactivity usually diminishes (or shows up as restlessness or fidgeting), while impulsive or inattentive behaviors remain.
ADHD symptoms in children include:
aggressive or disobedient behavior
dislike of school and structured activities
difficulty listening to instructions
forgetfulness
frequent fidgeting or inability to sit still
overbearing, loud, or disruptive personality
trouble paying attention in school or at home
In adults
, symptoms of ADHD are different. They can be similar to the effects of stress, hormones, or burnout and might include:
a short temper or inability to control emotions
disorganization or clutter
inability to manage finances, school, or work
lack of resilience (low stress threshold)
poor time management skills
trouble with multitasking
Women may have other ADHD symptoms
that are often mistaken for chronic stress or impostor syndrome as a result of gender stereotypes. Symptoms may be brushed off as “life stuff” or “just hormones.”
Women also tend to experience more inattentive than hyperactive symptoms, which can make ADHD in women even more difficult to spot.
In women, symptoms may manifest as:
anxiety and/or depression
chronic exhaustion
lack of attention to detail
low self-esteem
sleep issues
working “all the time” but still falling behind
These symptoms can vary throughout the month
due to fluctuating hormones
throughout a woman’s menstrual cycle.
Plus, according to the Anxiety and Depression Association of America,
about half
of all adults living with ADHD also have some type of anxiety disorder.
See why it’s so hard to diagnose? Given the range of symptoms that can masquerade as something else, this condition is sneaky — but treatable!
How ADHD is treated
While there’s no cure for ADHD, you can definitely manage the symptoms. Treatment usually focuses on improving quality of life personally, professionally, and/or academically.
Treatment options include:
behavior therapy
central nervous system
stimulants
(like Adderall, Aptensio, Concerta, Daytrana, Dexedrine, Dyanavel, Evekeo, Focalin, Metadate, Methylin, ProCentra, Quillivant, Ritalin, or Vyvanse) to increase dopamine and norepinephrine, which help with focus and concentration
nonstimulant medications (such as Intuniv, Kapvay, and Strattera) containing norepinephrine to help with attention and memory
psychotherapy
classes on social or parenting skills
support groups
tl;dr
“ADD” is an outdated name for ADHD, a condition characterized by ongoing inattention and/or hyperactivity and impulsivity that interferes with daily functioning or normal development.
Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is the preferred name for a group of conditions that has been renamed and reclassified several times over the years.
The three presentations of ADHD are predominantly inattentive, predominantly hyperactive-impulsive, and combined.
Symptoms of ADHD can vary by age and sex — particularly in women, symptoms can be mistaken for chronic stress.
There’s no cure, so treatment focuses on helping you manage symptoms so you can live your best life.
Treatment includes medications, behavior therapy, psychotherapy, support groups, and classes on social or parenting skills.
Being distracted or fidgety from time to time is normal — but if those symptoms interfere with your daily life and last for at least 6 months, it might be ADHD.

Cold vs. Allergies: How Can You Tell?

Why it matters
Cold vs. allergies
Colds and allergies share many symptoms, so it may be tricky to know what’s causing those sneezy, sleepy, stuffed-up feelings. Luckily, there are some key signs that can help determine a diagnosis and get you on the road to recovery.
But remember: If something just doesn’t feel right, see a medical professional to get everything sorted out.

One of these things is not like the other — why it matters
Sure, they may share some symptoms, but colds and allergies are like apples and oranges: While the
common cold
is caused by a virus, allergy symptoms are
immune system responses
to allergens like pollen, dust, or
Fluffy’s dander
.
The easiest way to tell the difference between the two is by how long they last — which, unfortunately, doesn’t help when the symptoms first strike. A common cold usually lasts no longer than 10 days, while allergies can pester people for months on end.
Seasonal allergies
usually bloom around the same time every year (hellloo, spring!), while colds are more prominent in the winter and fall. No surprise there.
Still, each illness has serious contenders for worst symptom ever. With a cold, coughing and congestion are the main event, whereas itchiness of the mouth, eyes, and throat is an indicator of allergies.
Each is also associated with a certain type of mucus. (Gross, we know. Just hold on to those tissues!) A cold usually comes with yellowy mucus, while people with allergies deal with thin, watery snot.
Other symptoms unique to the common cold are muscle aches, fatigue, and fever, whereas an all-day sneezefest (gesundheit!) usually points to pollen.
The common cold vs. allergies
Feeling under the weather? Here’s a guide to help differentiate the common symptoms of the two pesty illnesses.
Note: If you have any of these symptoms during the
COVID-19 pandemic
, get tested as soon as possible and isolate yourself to protect others while you await your results.
Common cold:
congestion
cough
low grade fever
mild body aches or headache
sore throat
sneezing
stuffed-up or runny nose
Allergies:
cough
fever
itchy eyes
mild aches and pains
mild fatigue
runny or stuffy nose
sneezing
sore throat
Figuring out what’s causing you to stay under the covers is only half the battle. Here’s what you can do to help prevent a cold (and other contagions):
Frequently wash those hands.
Wear a face covering.
Disinfect high-touch areas frequently.
Stay away from others — colds are contagious, unlike allergies.
If it’s too late and the sniffles are already a-comin’, get plenty of rest and fluids, try an over-the-counter
cold medicine
, and eat some warm soup to soothe your throat.
As for allergies, avoiding allergens is your best bet for staying sneeze-free:
Stay indoors on dry days, when pollen can be in the air. Rain helps keep it at bay.
Avoid yard work when your allergies are acting up (or wear a pollen mask).
Rinse pollen from your hair, hands, and face after being outside.
Change your clothes after being outside.
Try taking some over-the-counter nonsedating antihistamines and decongestants as well, and
check pollen rates
before heading outdoors.
Randall KL, et al. (2018). Antihistamines and allergy. DOI:
10.18773/austprescr.2018.013
COVID-19 may have put these symptoms front and center recently, but it’s always been a good idea to check with a doctor about the cause of sniffles and sneezes
.
If a fever just won’t go away, if a cold lasts longer than 10 days, or if those allergy symptoms
never
seem to go away, it may be more complicated than cold vs. allergies.

Ugh, allergies… Those of you in-the-know
know
what we’re talking about. Certain times of the year tickle your throat or make your nose leak. Typically, a cough or an
achoooo
in March means pollen is to blame. But in pandemic times, all bets are off. It could be allergies — or
something else
.
Just about any respiratory symptom now makes us stop and run through the possibilities. Omg! Is it… the new coronavirus? Cue the ominous music.
COVID-19
,
the flu
,
colds
, and of course good ol’
allergies
all have some symptoms in common. So, it can be tricky to tell. Let’s break it down.

Getting tested
If you do have a respiratory illness, and you’re waffling between whether it’s the flu or COVID-19, the
CDC
recommends testing for both.
But if you can only get tested for one for whatever reason, it’s best to get a ruling on COVID-19 one way or the other. For one thing, if you are positive for COVID-19, it can help to have the results just in case you have complications, lingering symptoms, or any
long-hauler
symptoms that crop up.
But also, COVID-19 is the more infectious of the two. So, if you have it, you’ll need to stay home and keep clear of others, according to the
CDC
for at least 10 days from when your symptoms first appeared, and from there, at least 24 hours after your fever subsides without the use of fever-reducing meds. Your other symptoms should also be improving before you venture out.
According to the
CDC
, if it’s the flu, your healthcare provider may prescribe antiviral drugs to ease your symptoms. When you have the flu, you should stay home as much as possible to avoid transmitting an infection. The CDC says you can head out again 24 hours after your fever takes a hike without the help of meds.
Is it COVID-19?
Let’s get the big guy out of the way first. Could it be COVID-19? First, ask yourself a few questions to gauge the possibility of developing it.
C
OVID-19 questions:
Have you recently been exposed to anyone who has tested positive?
Any chance someone you live with has been around someone who has recently tested positive?
Have you recently been around others you don’t live with, and in a situation where people weren’t physically distanced or weren’t wearing masks?
Any travel on a plane, train, bus, or public transit?
Have you recently been inside a restaurant or bar?
If you’ve answered yes to any of these questions, then COVID-19 is a possibility. But a
yes
answer doesn’t automatically mean you have the new coronavirus. If you answered
no
to all questions, that doesn’t fully eliminate the potential for developing the new coronavirus, but it makes COVID-19 less likely.
Consider your symptoms. Do you have a fever or chills or a cough? A
research review
showed that these symptoms are some of the first to show up with COVID-19. But they’re also common with ye ol’ flu.
Although they are entirely different respiratory bad boys, COVID-19 and the flu do share most of their common symptoms. The big standout difference, according to the CDC, is the whole loss of taste or smell thing we’ve been hearing about. Those symptoms are unique to COVID-19. So, if you suddenly can’t taste the kimchi kick in your ramen, it’s possible COVID-19 is the culprit.
Also, consider whether you have gastrointestinal symptoms like vomiting or diarrhea. Although, GI symptoms can be a part of the flu, they’re more common in kids than adults. GI symptoms are commonly reported with COVID-19 across age groups, though not always.
Is it the flu?
Keep in mind that
flu rates are down this year
in most states, like waaay down. That’s likely a result of all the mask-wearing, hand-washing, and physical distancing we’ve been doing. Go us!
Did you get your flu shot? A flu shot is not a guarantee that you won’t get the flu, but according to the
CDC
, it typically offers some protection from developing an infection, and from severe symptoms if you do develop an infection. So, if you did get jabbed, but you’re awfully ill, that might be another reason to suspect COVID-19 rather than the flu.
Is it a cold?
A big difference between a cold and the flu is that cold symptoms usually come on gradually, according to the
CDC
, whereas the
flu hits more like a truck
, taking you down all at once.
Although a fever sometimes happens with a cold, it’s a rarer symptom. And same with a headache or body aches. These ailments are less likely to occur with a cold than they are with the flu or COVID-19. And you might feel a little more rundown when you have a cold, but if you have the flu or symptomatic COVID-19, people often feel downright tired or fatigued. And a cold shouldn’t give you any GI symptoms.
Now let’s talk about snot. I know, hot right? With a cold, you’re likely to be sneezy, sniffly, stuffy, runny, or have post-nasal drip — that’s when the snot runs down the back of your throat. Mmm. With the flu, you could certainly have nasal congestion, but you’re not likely to be a sneezy mess. A plugged nose can certainly make breathing less fun, but a cold shouldn’t leave you short of breath. But the flu or COVID-19 might.
Is it allergies?
You may already know you’re prone to
seasonal outdoor allergies
. But keep in mind that indoor allergies are also a thing and pretty common in winter, according to the
American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology
. So, if you’ve been snug as a bug in a rug, it could literally be all those bugs (dust mites) in the rugs causing you to sneeze. And if you’ve recently moved, you could be exposed to new triggers outdoors that suddenly bring on an undiagnosed allergy.
Allergies can also cause shortness of breath, especially if you have the winning combination that I do which is allergies and asthma. Oh, joy! Although allergic rhinitis is often called hay fever, a fever isn’t actually a classic symptom, according to the
CDC
. Neither are body aches nor GI symptoms.
But you might get an irritated throat if you’re plagued by post-nasal drip, and you could feel fatigued, especially if you’ve taken an antihistamine to combat sneezing or itching.
How do you know the difference between a cold and allergies since they can have similar symptoms? Allergies will come on suddenly as a result of exposure to a trigger, whereas a cold usually comes on gradually. If you are suddenly having a sneeze fest one morning, check the pollen count on your favorite weather app. That could offer at least a hint.
Takeaway
Trying to play the guessing game of whether it’s COVID-19, the flu, the common cold, or allergies can be complicated. If there’s a chance you’ve been exposed to the new coronavirus, it’s a good idea to get tested, so you know for sure.

A diabetes diagnosis often comes with a laundry list of do’s and don’ts. And with all the excess info out there, it can be hard to tell which suggestions are legit and which ones are nonsense invented by the internet.
We’re here to give it to you straight. Combined with a doctor-prescribed treatment plan, there are several lifestyle tweaks you can incorporate to get your condition under control. Here are a few of the most promising:
1. Get comfortable with tracking your new diet
There’s no way around it: If you’re learning to manage either type 1 or type 2 diabetes, you need to monitor your carb and nutrient intake, and prioritize complex carbohydrates over sugary, processed foods.
Your diet should include plenty of whole grains, fruits, vegetables, and legumes. Check out this
diabetes-friendly shopping list
!
You can also experiment with a low glycemic diet, which involves using the glycemic index to create a meal plan full of foods that take longer to break down into sugar in your bloodstream. We’ve got a full guide for ya
right here
.
Tracking your numbers
is an essential way to stay on top of your blood sugar levels and keep yourself feeling your best. If scribbling grams-per-meal on a napkin throughout the day isn’t your thing, check out helpful nutrition-tracking apps like
Fooducate
or
MySugr
, which keep everything organized and can even help you plan your meals.
Remember: Your doc can help you determine an exact number of carbs (and other nutrients) to shoot for per day, but in general:
Women should stick to
30 to 45 grams
per meal.
Men should aim for
45 to 60 grams
per meal.
2. Don’t go crazy with protein
While protein is a healthy part of every diet, it can be especially helpful for people with diabetes. Not only does protein help stabilize blood sugar (by slowing down the time it takes for your body to digest carbs), but it also keeps you feeling full for longer.
However, before you load up on chicken breasts and protein powder, it’s important to note that those living with diabetes are at a
higher risk
of developing kidney problems.
Too much protein
can cause waste to build up in the bloodstream, leading to kidney disease and other issues (eeeek).
That means you should aim to get about
20 percent of your daily calories
from protein. So, if you’re eating 2,000 calories a day, that would mean no more than 100 grams of protein daily (1 gram of protein equals 4 calories).
3. Get. Your. Butt. Off. The. Couch.
Movement is key for managing diabetes and has been found in multiple studies to improve
insulin sensitivity
(which, FYI, keeps blood sugar stable). Not to mention all the other great benefits of exercise — such as improved mood, weight loss, better heart health, etc.
But how much exercise do you need? Ideally, a mix of moderate-intensity cardio and strength training totaling
at least 150 minutes a week
.
You can spread that out over several days, but don’t let more than 2 days go by without moving your body. If you’re new to exercise, start small and start slow. Try walking a few extra steps every day while you listen to your favorite podcast or schedule in a
yoga class
, which has been found to have extra benefits for people with diabetes.
4. Swap the shiraz for seltzer… at least sometimes
In addition to staying hydrated (not drinking enough water has been linked to high blood sugar), you should also limit your alcohol intake. While there’s said to be no long-term effect on controlling blood sugar, consuming alcohol can increase your risk for low blood sugar — especially if you take insulin.
Over time, excessive drinking can lead to high blood sugar, among other health issues. So, if you do choose to indulge, limit yourself to one drink per day or less (for adult women) and two or less per day (for adult men).
5. Make stress relief a priority
Not only is chronic stress linked to an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes, but it can also interfere with your ability to manage the condition.
Find ways to keep calm and carry on, whether it’s yoga, meditation, snuggling with your dog, or a hot bath and a good book at the end of a hard day. There’s no “best” way to do self-care, so do what makes you feel good!
6. Cut out unnecessary sugars
You knew this was coming — and that goes for both the real deal and artificial sweeteners. While it was once common practice to recommend sugar-free sweeteners as a substitute for refined sugar, that’s no longer the case.
Instead of sweetening foods and drinks with pastel-colored packets, find natural ways to satisfy your sweet tooth.
Also keep an eye out for added sugar. Read the nutrition labels on any packaged foods before you buy — and don’t fall for glam labels like
organic
or
natural
. They can still hide added sugar.
Take tabs of the ingredients listed first, as ingredients are always ordered based on how much of each ingredient is present. If you see several types of sugar in the first three items listed, put that item back on the shelf.
7. Take care of your skin
One of the long-term complications of diabetes is weakness, pain, and tingling or numbness in the hands and feet. This can turn into an increased pain tolerance in those areas (not a good thing!).
Having less pain sensitivity means it’s easier to get injured or develop infections. What starts as a small, unnoticed irritation could become a big problem down the road.
To prevent a
Walking Dead
lesion situation, make skin care part of your daily routine. This could be as simple as giving yourself a foot rub, taking note of any sores or numb spots, or treating yourself to a new moisturizer and using it daily.
8. Don’t go it alone
Feeling overwhelmed? Ask for help. Find a registered dietitian in your area who is also a certified diabetes educator. They can help you plan meals and come up with plans for tricky situations, like finding appropriate foods on the menu at your favorite restaurant, navigating the grocery store with a
diabetes-friendly shopping list
, and planning for special events like birthdays and Thanksgiving.
You can also find support online, through various communities,
like this one hosted by the ADA
. Chatting with someone who’s been where you are can be incredibly helpful as you learn to navigate life with diabetes.
9. Do you
After a diagnosis, it’s tempting to live in denial or avoid dealing with your health. But the longer you wait, the harder it will be to get started.
“Instead of aiming for the disease to disappear,” says Ana Hill, RD, LD, CDE, who has lived with type 1 diabetes for more than 2 decades, “it’s best to aim at
living
with
the disease.”
Keep adding these healthy habits to your life, but don’t forget to keep living. Because you’ve got this!

Takeaway
Cholesterol: elusive but ever-present — like
sasquatch
or Taylor Swift. That’s about to change.
What, exactly, is cholesterol?
Share on Pinterest
Everyone has cholesterol, a yellowy-white wax-like
lipid
(aka fat) that’s in every cell of your body. Cholesterol keeps your cells and organs working properly. It also plays a major role in hormone, vitamin, and digestive fluid production.
Cholesterol comes from two sources —
80 percent
is naturally produced by your liver and intestines, and your diet accounts for the last 20 percent.
H to the L to the T
There are two types of cholesterol:
HDL (think “H” as in “healthy”) is often called the “good” cholesterol. It carries the bad cholesterol and other unhealthy substances to your liver. Your liver then works magic to break down and remove these toxins from your body.
LDL (think “L” as in “lousy”) is known as the “bad” cholesterol. This is the scary stuff people often think of when they hear the word “cholesterol” (
dun dun duuun
). High levels of it can gunk up your arteries and lead to serious health issues.
Triglyceride levels matter, too — that’s another type of fat in your blood that’s linked to a higher risk of heart disease and stroke.
Signs your cholesterol is too high
High cholesterol is a creeper condition — it usually doesn’t have any symptoms. It can go undetected until you have blood work or a serious health event like a stroke or heart attack.
Physical symptoms
Some people may get
cholesterol deposits
under the skin of their eyelids. These small, flat, yellowish fat deposits — called xanthelasma — don’t usually affect your vision or your ability to blink.
Cholesterol can also deposit under the skin in other areas of the body such as elbows, knees, hands, or feet. These are called
xanthomas
.
Complications: Often the first symptom of high cholesterol
Because high-cholesterol usually goes undetected, it’s a good idea to know the signs of complications like
heart attack
and
stroke
.
Coronary artery disease and heart attack
Coronary artery disease
(aka heart disease) develops when cholesterol builds up in the arteries and blocks blood flow. It usually presents as angina (chest pain) or a heart attack.
Symptoms include:
pain or discomfort in the chest, arms, or shoulder
dizziness, light-headedness, weakness, nausea, or cold sweats
shortness of breath
Peripheral artery disease
Peripheral artery disease
(PAD) happens when cholesterol accumulations prevent blood from getting to your kidneys, stomach, and limbs.
Some symptoms to be aware of:
tiredness in your legs
pain, cramping, or aching in your legs or feet
changes in the appearance of the skin or hair on your legs or feet
a burning sensation or bluish color in your toes
thickened toenails
one leg or foot feeling cooler than the other
sores on your legs or feet that heal slowly or not at all
Stroke
Cholesterol buildup that stops blood from getting to the brain may cause a stroke.
Symptoms
of a stroke come on very suddenly.
Common symptoms are:
loss of feeling or strength in the face, arm, or leg (often on only one side of the body)
difficulty speaking
vision problems
disorientation or confusion
dizziness
difficulty with walking, balancing, or coordination
a really bad headache
If you suspect you or someone you’re with is experiencing a heart attack or stroke, call 911 immediately.
Do you have high cholesterol?
The only way to diagnose high cholesterol is for your doctor to order a
simple blood test
at a routine physical.
Crunching numbers
You’ll want to pay attention to
these numbers
on your next blood test:
HDL level:
typically, the higher the better
LDL level:
the lower the better
triglycerides:
the lower the better
total cholesterol:
the sum of your HDL, LDL, and 20 percent of your
triglycerides
cholesterol ratio:
total cholesterol divided by your HDL
The
ideal values
for each of these depend on your age and sex.
Generally, adults should aim for:
an HDL greater than 60 mg/dL
an LDL under 100 mg/dL
a triglyceride level under 150
a total cholesterol of 200 or less
a cholesterol ratio of 5 or less
Your doctor can advise you on the target ranges that make sense for your personal health profile.
But why is my cholesterol so high?
High cholesterol happens when there’s too much cholesterol in your blood — the medical term for it is hypercholesterolemia. This condition affects
almost 1 in 3 adults
. Wow!
So, how does your blood get choked with this fat? Many of the potential causes of high cholesterol are lifestyle-related — diet, exercise, and so on. But family history and other medical issues can influence your cholesterol too.
The seven deadly sins
These vices and habits may increase your risk of high cholesterol:
excessive drinking
smoking
inactivity
insufficient
sleep
too much
stress
a diet high in saturated fat
a diet high in trans fat
Maybe she’s born with it
High cholesterol due to genetics is called
familial hypercholesterolemia
(FH). People with FH are born with high cholesterol because their bodies can’t process LDL correctly.
FH is one of the most common inherited diseases, affecting
1 in 220 adults
. People with FH have a
13 times greater
risk of heart disease. Untreated FH can result in chronically high cholesterol levels and heart disease.
Does that come with a side of cholesterol?
Several medical conditions also come with an elevated risk for high LDL cholesterol:
diabetes
eczema
high blood pressure
HIV
underactive thyroid
inflammatory diseases
kidney disease
obesity
PCOS
Other risk factors
Age, sex, and ethnicity also factor into your risk profile.
High cholesterol increases with age. That’s because your biochemistry changes and your body functions less efficiently.
Some demographic groups — such as
non-Hispanic white women
— have higher total cholesterol rates.
So… what can you do to manage your cholesterol levels?
Prevention for the win
You can’t totally eliminate your risk, but some lifestyle tweaks may help curb risk factors.
Eat this…
Preventing high cholesterol is a tasty endeavor! Here are some ideas to get you started:
Eat fiber-rich foods like oatmeal, beans, and legumes.
Say “yes” to unsaturated fats like avocados and oils made from vegetables and most nuts.
Fill your plate with a rainbow of fruits and veggies.
A quick internet search will lead you to more
healthy recipes
than you could possibly cook in a lifetime.
Not that
Cut back on alcohol and on foods high in sugar, salt, trans fats, and saturated fats. Trans fats are added to processed foods by manufacturers, and saturated fats are found in animal-based products.
It’s a good idea to limit your intake of:
baked goods
fast food
fried foods
full-fat dairy
hydrogenated oils
margarine
red meat
refined sugars
refined grains
These foods are fine occasionally and in small amounts, but reducing or eliminating them can help
naturally drop your LDL and total cholesterol levels
.
Weight, weight — don’t tell me
The key is to
maintain a healthy-for-you weight
. Your body functions best when it’s at
your
optimal weight. Sound nutrition and exercise habits are lifelong essentials for weight management.
No butts about it
Smoking lowers HDL cholesterol and damages your blood vessels, increasing your risk of atherosclerosis, which can lead to stroke or heart attack.
If you need help ditching cigs, consult the many
resources
at your fingertips and reach out to your doctor.
Treating high cholesterol
Depending on your specific circumstances, your doctor may recommend one or more of these go-to treatments:
You’ve got to move it move it
Research has shown
that exercise can increase HDL levels and lower triglycerides.
The
U.S. Department of Health and Human Services
recommends that adults get 150 to 300 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity or 75 to 150 minutes of vigorous physical activity per week. And kids ages 6 to 17 should get an hour or more of moderate-to-vigorous activity per day.
Lipid-lowering therapy
Many medications can reduce LDL cholesterol. Let’s break it down:
Statins
You’ve seen the TV ads for the brand-name statins. These guys strike a one-two punch by helping your body restrict cholesterol production and clear more LDL from your blood.
Other medications
Bile acid sequestrants use your bile to remove LDL from your blood.
Niacin
, a type of B vitamin, slashes the bad fat from your blood while simultaneously amping up the good stuff (HDL).
Fibrates cut your liver’s output of LDL and expedite the removal of LDL from your body.
Injectables are a newer type of medication mostly used by people with FH.
Natural therapies
Mother Earth’s medicine cabinet includes some potential remedies not yet supported by scientific research.
Natural supplements
like hawthorne, astragalus, flaxseed, and garlic are thought to help improve cholesterol, but more research is needed.
As with any supplement or complementary treatment, chat with your doctor before trying these.
The heart of the matter
Cholesterol affects every single cell, organ, and biological process that makes you you. Everyone has it, and everyone needs it — but the goal is to have more of the good kind and less of the less-good kind.
High cholesterol usually shows up without warning — there aren’t really any physical symptoms to rely on. If left untreated, high LDL cholesterol can lead to heart disease, stroke, and peripheral artery disease.
Get👏 a👏 regular👏 physical👏 and👏 blood👏 test! It’s the only reliable detection method.
High cholesterol is treatable. It’s usually managed with medication and lifestyle changes. There’s a lot you can do to help prevent (and reverse!) high cholesterol:
Stick to a healthy diet.
Get regular exercise.
Don’t drink too much alcohol.
Avoid
smoking
.
Get a dog (obviously for the stress relief).

Can You Get HIV from Someone Who Is Undetectable? What You Should Know

Undetectable HIV
Treatment
Stigma
Takeaway
Curious about whether you can get HIV from someone who is undetectable? Learn how effective HIV treatment can reduce viral load to undetectable levels, minimizing the risk of transmission. Discover the facts and stay informed.
The amount of HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) in the blood of a person who is HIV-positive is measured by how many HIV particles are present in a milliliter of blood. This measurement is referred to as the
viral load
.
Antiretroviral medications, the most common treatment for HIV, help reduce the viral load. The medication must be taken as prescribed every day for it to be most effective in treating the virus and decreasing the chances of transmission.
Sometimes, HIV medications work so well that regular lab testing doesn’t even detect the presence of HIV.
If a person previously diagnosed with HIV has an undetectable amount of HIV in their system following treatment, can they still give HIV to someone else? To better understand the nuances of this important discussion, read on.
Can you get HIV from someone who is undetectable?
According to the CDC
, if you take your HIV medication regularly and reach the point where your viral load is undetectable, you have “effectively no risk” of transmitting the virus to an HIV-negative partner through sex.
Having an undetectable viral load also helps prevent transmission to others through sharing needles, syringes, or other injection equipment — though it doesn’t eliminate it entirely.
If you’re dating someone who has an undetectable viral load, you’re not going to test positive for HIV just by having sex. That said, regular testing for HIV, especially if you have multiple sexual partners, is important.
Both the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease and the CDC promote HIV treatment as prevention. Undetectable = Untransmittable or “
U=U
” is the guiding principle.
Treatment as prevention
If you have HIV and take your HIV medication every day as prescribed, not only are you taking the proper steps to treat the virus, but you’re also helping prevent its spread.
Lowering the amount of the virus in the blood is good for your health, and it’s a step toward keeping your sexual partners healthy too.
Once you get to the point where your viral load is undetectable, it’s important to keep it undetectable. This requires taking your medications regularly as prescribed.
Although most people who have HIV successfully get an undetectable load about 6 months after starting medications intended to reduce the load, not everyone can get an undetectable viral load. In this case, other treatments can help prevent transmission.
Prevention measures include:
PrEP.
This medication, which stands for pre-exposure prophylaxis works to prevent HIV in people at risk.
Condoms.
When used correctly and each and every time during sex, condoms are very effective in preventing HIV and other STIs.
Little or no sex risk.
This refers to both sexual partners and types of sexual activity. Oral sex carries little to no risk of transmitting HIV.
STI testing.
Regular screening for HIV and other STIs is a preventative measure that can also put your mind at ease.
PEP.
This medication stands for post-exposure prophylaxis. If taken within 72 hours of a possible exposure, it may prevent HIV.
Sharing needles or syringes is never OK. If you or someone you know struggles with drug addiction, there are resources that can help, including syringe services programs (SSPs). SSPs are community-based prevention programs that provide new needles and syringes along with a safe way to dispose of used ones.
Other resources include:
FindTreatment.gov
SAMHSA.gov
1-800-662-HELP (4357)
Stigma
For people living with HIV, the stigma can often be as hard as managing the physical effects themselves. While we’ve come a long way since the virus was first discovered in the U.S. in 1981, HIV and AIDS, the late stage of HIV infection, still carry a stigma. For people living with HIV,
the stigma
may have a profound effect on overall health and well-being.
HIV’s transmission through sex and drug use is one of the biggest reasons the stigma persists today, in spite of major medical advancements. HIV education programs, visibility of HIV-positive celebs like Jonathan Van Ness and Billy Porter, and increased awareness of how the virus can and can’t be transmitted are helping destigmatize it, but more work needs to be done.
For example, an HIV-positive person spitting on a person who doesn’t have HIV is considered an
illegal act
in a number of states, even though spit isn’t a bodily fluid that’s a transmission risk.
If you have HIV and are struggling to get support from friends and family, consider sharing information from the CDC on U=U and other medical literature to increase awareness and understanding. While
studies show
increasing acceptance and comprehension of U=U among queer men, the general population continues to misunderstand HIV transmission.
You don’t have to be an HIV advocate or leader in the movement to educate people on transmission, but the more you know, the easier it’ll be to participate intelligently when conversations on HIV and its transmission come up.
Since these may often be hard conversations, it’s important to take time for yourself too. Try meditation or journaling, and don’t forget about the value of self-care.
Building a sense of community with other HIV-positive people can help you build new friendships with people who understand and also lead to a developed sense of pride and identity.
Takeaway
If an HIV-positive person has an undetectable viral load, they have effectively no risk of transmitting HIV to an HIV-negative person through sex. It is still possible through other means like direct blood-to-blood contact when sharing syringes, though the risk is reduced. Most people with HIV can reach an undetectable viral load by taking their HIV meds exactly as prescribed.

How Long Can a Migraine Episode Last? Understanding Duration and Relief Tips

When to see a doctor
Wondering how long can a migraine episode last? Migraine attacks might feel endless, but they typically between 4-72 hours. Learn about the stages, symptoms, and ways to potentially shorten the duration of your migraine.
The dreaded migraine attack. If you’ve had one (or several), then
you know
. They’re no joke and often feel like they last forever. But how long does the average migraine attack actually last? And is there a way to shorten it?
Let’s find out.
Give it to me straight: How long do migraine attacks last?
While there’s no crystal ball that can predict the length of an individual
migraine
attack, on average one can last anywhere from
4 to 72 hours
. That’s right: up to 3 freakin’ days. (That’s longer than Britney’s 2004 marriage to her childhood friend Jason Alexander.)

But why? The breakdown of a migraine attack from start to finish
Migraine attacks happen in four stages. The stages vary in length — you may spend more time in one stage than another or even skip a stage. Just as every person is unique, so is every migraine attack.
The four common stages are:
Premonitory or prodrome phase
Aura
Headache or “main attack” (followed by a resolution period, which isn’t an actual phase)
Recovery or postdrome phase
Share on Pinterest
Illustration: Maya Chastain
1. Premonitory or prodrome phase (aka the “warning phase”)
You may experience some warning signs leading up to the actual headache portion of a migraine attack.
These symptoms are often completely unrelated to headaches, so they can be difficult to identify. They typically last anywhere from
1 to 24 hours
before you move on to the next phase.
Warning symptoms include:
fatigue
mood changes, such as irritability
increased thirst or cravings for certain foods
anxiety
stiff neck
2. Aura phase
Now, don’t think we’re trying to get all woo-woo here (though there’s nothing wrong with a little woo!). The aura phase is a legit occurrence that affects
up to 25 percent
of people who experience migraine attacks.
Auras have a wide variety of neurological symptoms, which generally happen before the main attack in adults. But they can sometimes happen at the
same time
as the headache portion of the migraine attack, especially in children.
If you’re experiencing an aura, you might notice:
flashing lights
colored or dark spots
zigzag lines
sparkles (or “stars”)
You may also feel:
tingling or numbness
dizziness
anxiety
confusion
weakness
Auras can also impact your hearing or speech and, in rare instances, cause fainting or partial paralysis. Aura symptoms typically last anywhere from
5 minutes to an hour
and will sometimes occur without a headache ever happening.
3. The headache (or main attack)
“The main attack” sounds like a cool name for a wrestler, and the pain can certainly feel like you’re being hit over the head with a chair, but this is actually the crescendo of a migraine attack.
Because many attacks
don’t include aura
symptoms, this stage can happen right after the premonitory phase. You’ll likely have the same symptoms in the headache phase whether or not you experience an aura beforehand.
Headache phase symptoms are:
sensitivity to noise, light, odor, or touch
throbbing head pain on one or both sides
increased pain caused by movement or physical activity
blurred vision
nausea or vomiting
lightheadedness
loss of appetite
This is the most unpredictable stage and can last anywhere from
a few hours to a few days
. Symptoms can become so severe that you may be unable to do daily activities like work, exercise, or hobbies.
3A. Resolution period
There’s some debate as to whether this counts as an official phase. The resolution period is when the main headache symptoms fade.
More research is needed, but a
study in the ’80s
suggested that
sleep
could play an important role in dissolving symptoms and moving into the recovery phase. Even just a couple of hours of rest can help knock out that headache.
4. Recovery phase or postdrome (also known as the “migraine hangover”)
The worst is over, but this phase can come with a variety of symptoms. You may notice effects opposite of those you experienced in the warning phase. For instance, after feeling like you couldn’t stand the sight of food for hours or days, you may suddenly be starving.
These
symptoms
may last a day or two:
exhaustion and fatigue
moodiness
depression
euphoria
weakness
dizziness
confusion
Finding sweet, sweet relief
While over-the-counter meds like ibuprofen, aspirin, naproxen, or acetaminophen (or migraine-specific options like Excedrin) may work wonders for the occasional migraine attack, they aren’t one-size-fits-all.
Some attacks require something a bit more powerful, while others can be defeated through the use of non-medicinal
home remedies
.
Here’s a look at common treatment options.
Prescription meds
For more severe migraine attacks, your doctor may prescribe pain relievers like ergot, opioids, or triptans as well as medications to treat nausea.
If you have frequent migraine attacks, you and your doctor may want to discuss preventive measures. Some prescription meds can help keep future attacks at bay, including:
anitconvulsants
antidepressants
calcium channel blockers
beta-blockers
CGRP antagonists
Home remedies
There are several ways to deal with your migraine at home without medication. Here are some strategies to try:
Avoid harsh lighting and loud sounds.
Find a quiet space, dim the lights, draw the shades, and try to relax.
Use pressure points.
Applying pressure
to certain areas of your body or to your temples may help relieve pain.
Drink water!
Hydration
is important all the time, but it can be especially critical during a migraine attack.
Reach for essential oils.
Lavender and peppermint are great
soothing options
for migraine pain.
Add a cool compress.
The cold helps narrow your blood vessels and ease pain.
Try a little caffeine.
Caffeine constricts blood vessels and is commonly used to treat headaches.
Research
shows caffeine can have powerful effects (both positive and negative) on migraine attacks. Too much or too little caffeine can
cause headaches
, but if you find the sweet spot, it can ease pain and even prevent pain from returning.
Limit screen time.
The light from your digital devices can make symptoms worse, so unplug and unwind.
Migraine triggers to avoid
Migraine attacks have many possible
triggers
, so determining your specific triggers could help in prevention. Some common triggers:
stress
certain meds
irregular sleep patterns
hormonal changes
changes in the weather
certain foods
alcohol
caffeine
head injuries
When to call your doc
First migraine attack? The home remedies or OTC meds mentioned above may do the trick. But make an appointment with your healthcare provider if:
you’re over 40 and this is your first migraine attack
your symptoms last longer than 72 hours
symptoms occur after you’ve experienced a head injury
If you’re having frequent migraine attacks, scheduling time with your doc may help. Together, you can work on a treatment plan to help prevent attacks, help soothe them at the start, or simply make them more bearable.
tl;dr
One thing anyone who’s had a migraine attack can agree on: They feel like they last forever.
In reality, a typical migraine attack can last anywhere from 4 to 72 hours and may include some or all of these phases:
warning (premonitory) phase
aura (not everyone experiences this one!)
headache (aka the “main attack”), followed by a resolution period (which isn’t an actual phase)
recovery phase (or the “migraine hangover”)
The phases vary in length, and the headache phase itself typically lasts the longest (bummer).
There are a variety of methods to relieve or prevent migraine symptoms, including OTC meds, prescription pain relievers, and home remedies. You can work with your healthcare provider to find the best course of action for you.
If you experience your first migraine attack after age 40, or if an attack lasts longer than 72 hours or pops up after a head injury, call your doc ASAP.

Involving a doctor
tl;dr
Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) may not be the most comfortable topic to discuss, but if you’re sexually active (and not in a long-term monogamous relationship), the possibility of dealing with an STI is high.
The most recent data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) tells us that
1 in 5 people
in the United States has an STI, and that in 2018 there were 68 million total STIs.
Yikes
.
The good news is that it’s never been easier to get tested for an STI. Between at-home, lab-based, and traditional doctor’s clinic testing, screenings are fast, simple, and private. Plus, you can
get STI meds online
.
With so many options out there, we did the work of narrowing down the best of the bunch.
Best at-home STI tests
Best for budget:
HealthLabs
Best for couples:
MyLab Box

Best for discretion:

How we chose
After browsing the reviews and comparing the features, we’ve compiled a list of the best STI testing options at home and away from home. We used the following criteria to make our list:
price
accuracy
convenience
comprehensiveness
medical support
wait time
self-collection or in person at the lab
reputation
Best at-home STI tests
Regular testing should be safe and accessible whenever you need it. These at-home options are accurate and convenient.
Best for budget:
HealthLabs
Type:
lab-based testing
Cost:
$45–$298
Wait time:
2–4 days
STIs tested:
chlamydia, gonorrhea, hepatitis B and C, herpes type 1 and 2, HIV, syphilis, and
trichomoniasis
HealthLabs is discreet and confidential, and a great choice for those on a budget. They boast “fast, private, and affordable lab testing,” and starting at $45 for an individual test or $99 for a two-test panel, you really can’t beat the value.
Beyond that, they offer a comprehensive panel at $139, and the ultimate panel complete with early HIV detection is $298. You can use flexible spending accounts (FSAs) and health savings accounts (HSAs) to pay for these tests, but even without insurance, they’re reasonably priced, especially since you can select individual tests.
Choose a test at HealthLabs
Best for couples:
MyLAB Box
Type:
self–collection
Cost:
$79–$499
Wait time:
2–5 days
STIs tested:
chlamydia, gonorrhea, herpes, HIV, HPV, mycoplasma, syphilis, and trichomoniasis
MyLAB Box offers a variety of at-home lab tests for an extensive list of STIs. Better yet, they offer a couple’s box so partners can discreetly find answers together, rather than visiting a doctor’s office separately.
MyLAB Box also provides all-inclusive testing, meaning it includes instruments for urine collection, blood testing, and swabs for mouth and rectum in addition to the traditional vaginal swab.
If you do happen to test positive, physician consults are available to provide couples with the medical support they need.
Choose a test at MyLab Box
Best for medical support:
LetsGetChecked
Type:
self-collection
Cost:
$99–$349
Wait time:
2–5 days
STIs tested:
chlamydia, gonorrhea, herpes, HIV, mycoplasma, syphilis, trichomoniasis, and ureaplasma
LetsGetChecked provides you with comprehensive and accessible medical support if you test positive for an STI. Unlike other at-home testing services that offer physician consultation only if desired, with Let’sGetChecked, a member of the nursing team will call you to discuss your results and your treatment options if you test positive.
Furthermore, you can get your hands on a kit easily at CVS pharmacies, so you can also chat with a pharmacist there if needed. The certainty of medical assistance and advice paired with the accessibility of a local pharmacy option makes LetsGetChecked a deserving winner of this category.
Choose a test at LetsGetChecked
Best for self-collection:
Nurx
Type:
self-collection
Cost:
$150–$220
Wait time:
within 7 days
STIs tested:
chlamydia, gonorrhea, hepatitis C, HIV, syphilis, and trichomoniasis
Nurx attempts to combat the potential for testing inaccuracies by collecting swabs from multiple areas of the body, such as the mouth or throat, rectum, and vagina. They may also collect urine and blood samples.
Nurx is covered by insurance, but you do have to pay for shipping both ways, as well as for a medical consultation if you’d like one. If you prefer to go through the STI testing experience completely from the comfort of your own home and you have no problem collecting your own bodily fluids, Nurx is the way to go.
Choose a test at Nurx
Best for discretion:
Priority STD
Type:
lab-based testing
Cost:
$129–$198
Wait time:
1–3 days
STIs tested:
chlamydia, gonorrhea, hepatitis B and C, herpes, HIV, syphilis, and trichomoniasis
Priority STD is well-known for providing STI tests that are quick, discreet, and accurate. What’s even better is that you can get same-day results and medications if you need them.
With Priority STD, the entire process is extremely private, as you can order tests over the phone or online, and you can view results online or discuss them with a healthcare professional. Your results remain between you and Priority STD as they don’t share your info or results with your primary care physician.
Choose a test at Priority STD
Best for fast results:
STDCheck
Type:
lab-based testing
Cost:
$24–$349
Wait time:
1–2 days
STIs tested:
chlamydia, gonorrhea, hepatitis (A, B, and C), HIV, herpes type 1 and 2, and syphilis
STDCheck offers somewhat of a hybrid experience, as you can order your test at home, via phone or online, and then you go to a lab to provide your sample.
The quick turnaround time paired with the high accuracy of this option makes it a sound choice for anyone feeling anxious about the whole STI situation. It’s a speedy process with even quicker results, and your information is always confidential.
You can have individual tests as well as a fully comprehensive screening, including an early detection HIV screening. The range of tests available from STDCheck plus the quick delivery of results should give you peace of mind in a potentially stressful time.
Choose a test at STDCheck
Best for first-timers:
PersonaLabs
Type:
lab-based testing
Cost:
$46–$522
Wait time:
2–10 days
STIs tested:
chlamydia, Epstein-Barr virus, gonorrhea, HIV, HIV-related, Hepatitis A, B & C, herpesvirus, human t-cell lymphotropic virus, trichomoniasis, syphilis
PersonaLabs testing is pretty straightforward and offers a wide range of testing options, both individual and comprehensive.
You also have access to medical support in the form of doctor’s consultations, treatments, and even prescriptions. The extensive list of STIs tested for, as well as the access to medical help makes this a great option if this is your first time getting an STI test.
Choose a test at PersonaLabs
Best overall:
EverlyWell
Type:
self-collection
Cost:
$49–$149
Wait time:
within days
STIs tested:
chlamydia, gonorrhea, hepatitis C, HIV, syphilis, and trichomoniasis
EverlyWell seems to check all the boxes as an at-home option that tests for the most common STIs. Self-collection is user-friendly, as you can use a finger-prick test or a vaginal swab. The price point, including prepaid shipping, also makes it budget-friendly.
EverlyWell is also perhaps the most discreet at-home STI testing option, as everything is done in the comfort of your own home, and even your results are fully digital.
What rounds out EverlyWell as the best overall, however, is their medical support on top of all the other perks. If you get positive results, you’re connected with their own private physician network who will walk you through any questions and treatment options. Overall EverlyWell takes the cake in the STI testing race.

Best in-person STI testing places
If you’re more comfortable physically going into a lab and getting assistance with every step of the STI testing process, here are your best options:
CVS:
CVS Pharmacy MinuteClinic
Cost:
$99-$139
STIs tested:
You can be tested comprehensively for all STIs at the CVS MinuteClinic.
While the MinuteClinic at CVS conducts STI testing, you must be at least 18 years old, and you can’t be pregnant.
You’ll need to chat with the on-duty staff about your sexual history and any symptoms you have. They can then decide what type of samples to take, or physical examinations to perform. After your appointment, you’ll discuss appropriate treatment options for any positive test results. You’ll likely get some info on sexual health and safety.
If you test positive for a potentially chronic condition, like HIV, they may refer you to another health care provider for counseling and ongoing care.
The CVS MinuteClinic accepts most insurances, and perhaps most convenient of all, you do not need an appointment to be seen, though you may still make an appointment if you’d like.
Find your nearest CVS MinuteClinic
Walgreens:
Walgreens Healthcare Clinic
Cost:
Information not specified on the website.
STIs tested:
You can be tested comprehensively for all STIs at the Walgreens Healthcare Clinic.
To be tested for STIs at the Walgreens Healthcare Clinic, you must be at least 18 years old. They accept most insurances, and you can walk in or make an appointment.
When you’re seen at the Healthcare Clinic for STI testing, a provider will first discuss your STI risk, exposure, history, and any symptoms you have. They may collect a urine or blood sample, or both to determine your status.
Once they have your results, the healthcare provider goes over treatment options and some education on safe sex practices. They’ll also make any follow-up appointments, treatment, or referrals for more extensive testing.
*As of this writing, only locations in Arizona are performing STI testing. However, the plan is for all Walgreens Healthcare Clinic locations to provide the service as soon as they can roll it out.
Find out more about care services at Walgreens
Planned Parenthood:
Planned Parenthood testing, treatment, and vaccines
Cost:
Information not specified on the website.
STIs tested:
chlamydia, genital warts, gonorrhea, herpes, syphilis, trichomoniasis
If you’re looking for the closest thing to an anonymous clinic visit, Planned Parenthood may be right for you. They have a reputation for being open-minded and nonjudgmental. Even though you’re being seen in person, you can rest assured knowing the staff is there to help, and your information is always kept confidential.
Furthermore, Planned Parenthood offers a whole gamut of treatment options. They also provide several vaccines for STIs, so you can even get vaccinated to decrease your risk proactively. You have to make an appointment but it’s fast and straightforward either online or over the phone. They accept most insurances.
Find your nearest Planned Parenthood
Who needs to get tested for STIs?
According to the
CDC
, you should be tested for STIs if you’re:
Anyone age 13–64 and sexually active:
should have at least one HIV test
A sexually active woman:
test for gonorrhea and chlamydia
Pregnant people:
test for syphilis,
HIV
, and hepatitis B
Sexually active gay or bisexual man:
check for HIV, syphilis, chlamydia, and gonorrhea
Having
sex without a condom
or other barrier method:
have annual HIV tests
Shared injection drug equipment:
have annual HIV tests
The most common STIs tested for are
genital herpes
gonorrhea
syphilis
chlamydia
hepatitis B
HPV and/or genital warts
HIV
Even if you’re not experiencing symptoms, it’s still recommended that you get checked. Better safe than sorry! There’s nothing to lose as STI tests are safe, almost always covered by insurance, and they provide peace-of-mind for you and your sexual partners.
How to choose the test that’s right for you
When you’re starting out on your STI testing journey, consider the following questions:
Why are you testing? Is it out of curiosity, or because you’re
experiencing symptoms
, believe you came into contact with an STI, a recent or current partner tested positive, etc?
Have you had
unprotected sex
or experienced a condom, or another barrier method, malfunction?
Do you have any symptoms?
Are you about to have
sex with a new partner
?
Are you checking to see if a prior STI has cleared up?
Would you like to stop using
condoms
or barrier methods with your current partner?
When was the last time you had an in-person test?
Once you’re ready to start actively searching for an STI test, consider:
How much does it cost?
What STIs does it test for?
How long does it take to get results?
Does it offer any medical consultation and/or treatment options?
How accurate is it?
You may be able to find a test that checks all of your boxes. If not, you’ll want to decide what features are most important to you before making your selection.
Not all tests are created equal, however, and in some situations, you’re better off to bite the proverbial bullet and visit a doctor — think physical symptoms. It’s also a good idea if you’re certain you’ve come into contact with an STI
even if you don’t have symptoms.
STI sample collection may include one or all of the following:
urine test
blood test
vaginal, cervical, urethral, throat, or possibly rectal swabs
physical examination
If you’d prefer to have in-person support through the entire testing process, opt for clinic testing. As with testing kits, there are some considerations, including:
Do they have a good reputation?
Are they a recognized name with a website?
Who staffs the clinic?
What tests do they offer?
If you need help finding a place for STI testing, contact your local health department. Check out this
CDC
guide for deets.
Read the fine print
A word of warning about crisis pregnancy centers (CPCs) also called pregnancy resource centers. Although this nonprofit masquerades as a reproductive health clinic provider, its primary mission is to prevent vulva owners from choosing abortion, and they
do not adhere to ethical medical standards
.
Do your homework, and make sure any clinic you’re considering isn’t a CPC by using the
Crisis Pregnancy Center Map
.
For peeps with cervixes, note that while
PAP smears
are not a type of STI test, they test for early signs of cervical or anal cancers caused by HPV. People with cervixes should have regular PAPs at a clinic from age 21.
When to see a doctor
If you’re experiencing any physical symptoms of an STI or any unusual — er, um —
activity
in your nether region, you need to see a doctor. They can often tell you right away whether or not there’s anything to worry about and prescribe medication if needed. There’s no waiting. You can start taking the meds immediately, treat the infection, and say goodbye to that
itch
or ooze.
Likewise, if you’ve come into direct sexual contact with someone with a confirmed STI, you need to see a doctor — symptoms or no.
Many STIs don’t manifest any symptoms, but you can still spread asymptomatic STIs easily. The danger is that untreated STIs can lead to grim
health consequences
like infertility, cancer, AIDS, organ damage, neurological conditions, and even death. Just because you can’t see or feel an infection doesn’t mean one isn’t there. Do yourself a favor and go see the doc.
Takeaway
If you’re sexually active, it’s a good idea to have regular STI checks, no matter your situation. Testing keeps you and your partners safe and helps prevent the spread of infections. Plus, if you’ve contracted an STI, the earlier you seek treatment, the better.
The good news is that it’s never been easier to get tested for STIs. There are a variety of testing kits, both at-home and in-person, ranging in cost and comprehensiveness. These options are confidential and convenient, especially if you don’t fancy going for a test at the doctor’s office.
Lastly, even if it’s not the most exciting prospect, please see a medical professional if you’re experiencing any potential STI symptoms, or if you know you’ve been exposed to an STI during sex. Better safe than sorry.

What are they?
Get to know the lingo
Vitamins you need
Minerals you need
Fat-soluble vs. water-soluble
Micronutrients really are where it’s at.
Vitamins and minerals are micronutrients. And, without them, our bodies wouldn’t develop or function correctly.
From helping you turn food into fuel to fortifying bones and eyesight, vitamins and minerals are the Beyoncé of the health world — they’re extremely capable, everything revolves around them, and they have powerful effects on their environment.
We see cartons of juice and boxes of cereal trumpeting their vitamin and mineral content, but what are these microscopic nutrients, really? What do they do? How do they work? And why are they so important?

Though living things make vitamins and minerals exist naturally in soil and water, we get both of these nutritional powerhouses from the foods we eat.
This definitive guide to vitamins and minerals will fill you in on pretty much everything you need to know about these important nutrients that keep us living and smiling.
What are vitamins and minerals?
Vitamins and minerals are substances your body needs to develop and function normally.
Every time you bike-commute to work, revel in a rainbow, or
shake your booty on the dance floor
, vitamins and minerals help you do it.
Vitamins are organic compounds, which basically means they are molecules made up of carbon and other elements.
Fortmann SP, et al. (2013). Vitamin, mineral, and multivitamin supplements for the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease and cancer: A systematic evidence review for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force [Internet].
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK173989/
Heat, air, acid, or even light can cause them to break down. (Which is why storing vitamin supplements near the hot stove is a big no-no.)
It also makes getting enough vitamins from food harder because storing, cooking and even just exposing food to air can decrease its vitamin content.
Lee S, et al. (2018). Effect of different cooking methods on the content of vitamins and true retention in selected vegetables.
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6049644/
Minerals come from rocks, soil, and water. Plants absorb these as they grow, and animals then steal those
nutrients
when they chomp on said plants. Om nom nom, indeed.
Minerals
are inorganic single elements (meaning they do not contain carbon) and cannot be broken down. Score! This makes them pretty easy to absorb from food.
You get all 13 vitamins and both the major and trace minerals through the foods you eat. Your body can synthesize some by itself, like vitamin D after exposure to the sun. But most people can get all of the vitamins and minerals they need through a varied, balanced diet.
Taking a
multivitamin
can help fill in any gaps in your nutrition. However, it’s best to get them from the diet.
Vitamins and minerals are called
micronutrients
because you only need a very small amount of them compared to macronutrients (protein, carbs and fat).
But don’t be fooled by the “micro-” at the beginning of “micronutrients.” There’s nothing small about their impact on your body.
Consume or synthesize them. They’ll either bind to the fat from foods you eat and hang around in the body for later use (if they’re fat-soluble) or absorb straight into the cells (if they’re water-soluble).
And they’ll make damn sure everything ticks along smoothly.
Vitamins play many important roles in your body.
They help free the energy from the food you eat, making it possible for you to fuel yourself. They’re essential to building
protein
and help cells multiply. Which makes… erm, you.
They even help make collagen to strengthen your skin, build bones, fortify your vision, and combat harmful oxidative damage that might contribute to
diseases
and health conditions.
(Whew, vitamins are pretty busy.)
Minerals play many starring roles in your body.
They make it possible for your blood to carry oxygen throughout your body and help you achieve
fluid balance
. Minerals are key players in helping your muscles relax and contract.
They also support nerve transmission, help you maintain a steady
heartbeat
, and are even involved in making DNA.
In short, you just can’t live without them.
The lingo
Before we dive in and take a deeper look at each vitamin and mineral, let’s
iron
out some key terms we’ll be using (there’ll be some dreadful puns throughout, and no multivitamin will help you here).
Vitamins.
These are
organic substances
required for normal cell function, growth, and development. There are 13 essential vitamins, which we’ll break down for you below.
Fat-soluble vitamins.
These are vitamins that
bind to fat
in the food you eat. The body then stores them for later use. They include
vitamins A
, D, E, and K.
Water-soluble vitamins.
The rest of the vitamins —
vitamin C
, and the B complex vitamins — are
water-soluble
, meaning cells can absorb them directly.
Minerals.
Minerals
are
inorganic
substances, and all hold a place on the good ol’ periodic table. They’re also necessary for healthy body functions and development. There are two groups of minerals: macrominerals (of which the body needs at least 100 milligrams every day)
Morris, AL. (2020). Biochemistry, nutrients.
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK554545/
and trace minerals (only a pinch required — but without them, you run the risk of serious deficiencies).
Bhattacharya PT, et al. (2016). Nutritional aspects of essential trace elements in oral health and disease: An extensive review.
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4940574/
RDA.
Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) represent the
average daily dietary intake
of each vitamin and mineral a person needs to stay healthy and steer clear of deficiencies. The values, which are all backed by scientific data, are broken down by age and gender.
AI.
Those vitamins for which the science bods haven’t established an RDA (usually due to
lack of scientific data
) have an adequate intake (AI) in place.
UL.
The
tolerable upper intake level
(UL) is the maximum amount of daily vitamin or mineral dosage that is likely to be safe for the average person. Stay under the UL when using supplements to avoid toxicity.
The vitamins or minerals that we need in larger doses are expressed in units of milligrams (mg).
Trace minerals
and vitamins appear in micrograms (mcg). There are 1,000 mcg in one milligram (no fancy math here).
All of Greatist’s recommendations for daily intake (“What you need”) and limits (“What’s too much?”) follow the RDA, AI, and UL guidelines.

14 vitamins your body needs
(Plus
choline
, which isn’t
technically
a vitamin but usually sneaks into the list.)
Get these in you every day to stay on top of your health.
Supplement warning
The U.S. Food and Drug Administrations (FDA) doesn’t regulate supplements in the same way it does medications.
For this reason, if you plan to take a supplement or receive a diagnosis of nutrient deficiency, be aware that it’s best to buy from trusted brands that use third-party testing and don’t make cure-all claims about their products.
It might be best to seek consultation with a dietitian or nutritionist before you embark on any supplement journey. It’s like vodka: You want the good stuff, or you’ll start to feel like sh*t pretty soon.
We’ve got a full guide to taking supplements
here
.
Biotin (aka vitamin B7 or vitamin H)
Like the rest of the water-soluble
B-complex
vitamins, biotin plays a huge role in cell growth and food metabolism.
Said HM. (2012). Biotin: biochemical, physiological and clinical aspects. DOI:
10.1007/978-94-007-2199-9_1
Metabolism is the process by which our bodies convert the food we eat into energy and powers everything we do, from thinking, to
running
, to Hula-Hooping (definitely Hula-Hooping).
Deficiency of this vitamin is extremely rare, but overdoing it on
raw egg whites
may prevent biotin absorption (we’re looking at you, Rocky).
Mock DM. (2017). Biotin: From nutrition to therapeutics. DOI:
10.3945/jn.116.238956
What you need:
Adults need
30 mcg
. Though, women who are lactating need 35 mcg per day.
Where to get it:
As you can see below, it’s animal products that pack the best biotin punch. You might need to take a
biotin supplement
or multivitamin if you live that vegan life or avoid animal produce for other reasons.
beef liver, with
30.8 mcg
per 3 ounce (oz) serving
whole, cooked eggs, with
10 mcg
per egg
canned
salmon
, with
5 mcg
per 3oz-serving
cooked pork chop, with
3.8 mcg
per 3oz-serving
sunflower
seeds
, with
2.6 mcg
per serving
What’s too much?
Not determined. We gave a full breakdown of the benefits and risks of biotin
here
.
Choline
*All together with your best
Dolly
impersonations now* 🎤 Choline, choline, choline, choliiiiiiiiiine… 🎤
While not technically a vitamin, the essential nutrient
choline
often hangs out with the B-vitamins because of its similarities.
Choline is a building block of the neurotransmitter acetylcholine,
Purves D, et al. (2001). Neuroscience. 2nd edition.
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK11143/
which is super important for the nerve and brain activities that control memory and muscle movement.
Choline also helps turn the food we eat and our stored energy (hello, love handles) into fuel.
Zeisel SH, et al. (2018). Choline. DOI:
10.1093/advances/nmx004
Vegetarians, vegans, those who are pregnant, and endurance athletes are at greater risk for choline deficiency. Not getting enough choline is linked to fatty liver disease, atherosclerosis, neurological disorders, and impaired fetal development.
Wallace TC, et al. (2018). Choline: The underconsumed and underappreciated essential nutrient. DOI:
10.1097/NT.0000000000000302
(It’s also rare, though, as the body makes its own choline. Neat!)
What you need:
Adult men need
550 mg
per day. Women over 19 years of age have an AI of 425 mg every day (but this goes up to 450 mg daily during pregnancy, and 550 mg daily during lactation).
How to get it:
beef liver, with
356 mg
per 3oz-serving
eggs
, with
147 mg
per large egg (although make sure you eat the yolk — the choline lives in there).
braised, lean beef top round, with
117 mg
per 3oz-serving
roasted
soybeans
, with
107 mg
per 1/2 cup
cooked Atlantic cod, with
71 mg
per 3oz-serving
baked red potato, with
57 mg
per 3oz-serving
What’s too much?
3,500 mg
Extremely high doses won’t kill you, but consuming
more than 3,500 mg
per day
can
cause vomiting, increased sweating and salivation, and a fishy body odor.
(And who wants that? Fish, mostly. And if you’re reading this, you’re probably not one. And if you are, you’re likely to be a good source of choline, so watch out.)
Folic acid (aka folate or folacin)
Folic acid is such a key part of our diet that the U.S. government decided to fortify most commercial flour with this water-soluble vitamin.
So what’s all the hoopla over
folic acid
? Well, it’s vital for pregnant women to protect the baby’s development, helping prevent congenital anomalies in the brain and spine.
Chitayat D, et al. (2016). Folic acid supplementation for pregnant women and those planning pregnancy: 2015 update. DOI:
10.1002/jcph.616
No baby on board? Folic acid also helps create almost every cell in the body and may reduce the risk of heart disease and colon cancer.
Liew SC. (2016). Folic acid and diseases – supplement it or not? DOI:
10.1590/1806-9282.62.01.90
So yeah, pretty handy to have on deck. It’s one of our vitamins that make you feel great —
learn more here
.
What you need:
400
mcg per day. During pregnancy, however, women should make sure they’re getting at least 600 mcg. And, afterward, they should consume 500 mcg while they’re lactating.
Your baby is counting on it!
How to get it:
beef liver, with
215 mcg
per 3oz-serving
boiled
spinach
, with
131 mcg
per 1/2 cup
black-eyed peas, with
105 mcg
per 1/2 cup
fortified breakfast cereals, with
100 mcg
per 1/2 cup
white
rice
, with
90 mcg
per half cup
What’s too much?
More than 1,000 mcg
Since folic acid is so important for baby’s development, you may think getting more may be even better. But, like many other good things, there is a “too much.”
Taking more than 1,000 mcg before becoming pregnant may be associated with lower scores on tests of cognitive development in children between the ages of 4 to 5 years.
Valera-Gran D, et al. (2017). Effect of maternal high dosages of folic acid supplements on neurocognitive development in children at 4-5 y of age: the prospective birth cohort Infancia y Medio Ambiente (INMA) study. DOI:
10.3945/ajcn.117.152769
Taking too much may also impair your
immune system
and might have associations with cognitive impairment in older adults.
Niacin (aka vitamin B3 or nicotinic acid)
On the lookout for beautiful skin, hair,
and
red blood cells? Niacin is here to help. Ooh, yeah, bring on those luscious RBCs. Like other water-soluble B vitamins, niacin is essential for converting food into energy.
Meyer-Ficca M, et al. (2016). Niacin. DOI:
10.3945/an.115.011239
It’s also central to the health of skin, hair, eyes, liver, and the nervous system,
Gasperi V, et al. (2019). Niacin in the Central Nervous System: An Update of Biological Aspects and Clinical Applications. DOI:
10.3390/ijms20040974
and may lower risks of high cholesterol and heart disease.
D’Andrea E, et al. (2019). Assessment of the role of niacin in managing cardiovascular disease outcomes: A systematic review and meta-analysis. DOI:
10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2019.2224
Extreme deficiencies in niacin, though rare, may lead to
pellagra
, which is associated with the “the four D’s”: dermatitis (skin irritation), diarrhea, dementia, and death (yikes!).
Ikenouchi-Sugita A, et al. (2015). Niacin deficiency and cutaneous immunity. DOI:
10.2177/jsci.38.37
So yeah. Niacin does
a f*ckton
of important stuff in your body.
What you need:
Adult males need
16 mg
of niacin equivalents (NEs) daily. Women over 19 years of age need 14 mg of NEs per day, but should get 18 mg daily when pregnant, and 17 mg daily when lactating.
(By “niacin equivalents,” we mean that it’s not only niacin you’d need to consume — the body can also convert an amino acid called tryptophan into niacin. 1 mg of niacin or 60 mg of tryptophan count as an NE. How nifty!)
How to get it:
beef liver, with
14.9 mg
per 3oz-serving
grilled chicken breast, with
10.3 mg
per 3oz-serving
marinara sauce
, with
10.3 mg
per cup
roast
turkey breast
, with
10 mg
per 3oz-serving
cooked sockeye salmon, with
8.6 mg
per 3oz-serving
cooked brown rice, with
5.2 mg
per cup
What’s too much?
35 mg
Don’t overdo it on niacin supplements. High doses of niacin can be toxic, and may cause rosy tingling — the so-called “niacin flush” — if doses exceed 35 mg per day.
Pantothenic acid (aka vitamin B5)
This vitamin is important in
food metabolism
and helps synthesize neurotransmitters, steroid hormones,
red blood cells
, and more.
Kennedy DO. (2016). B Vitamins and the brain: Mechanisms, dose and efficacy: A review. DOI:
10.3390/nu8020068
You can’t really take so much that it becomes toxic. And while B5 deficiency is fairly rare (it tends to accompany severe malnutrition), neurologic symptoms, such as burning feet, may crop up.
What you need:
Adults need
5 mg
daily. Your needs increase during pregnancy to 6 mg daily, and up to 7 mg daily when lactating.
How to get it:
beef liver, with
8.3 mg
per 3oz-serving
fortified breakfast cereals, with
5 mg
per serving
cooked shitake mushrooms, with
2.6 mg
per 1/2 cup
sunflower seeds, with
2.4 mg
per 1/4 cup
roasted chicken breast, with
1.3 mg
per 3oz-serving
What’s too much?
Not determined
While some people taking large doses of pantothenic acid develop mild diarrhea and gastrointestinal distress, high intakes do not cause toxicity.
Riboflavin (aka vitamin B2)
Flavor
ful ribo
flav
in definitely has street cred (
yeeeeeeeeeeah boiiiiiiiii
).
This water-soluble B vitamin helps convert food to fuel, encourages iron absorption in the intestines, and also enhances the health of hair, skin, muscles, eyes, and the brain.
Saedisomeolia A, et al. (2018). Riboflavin in human health: A review of current evidences. DOI:
10.1016/bs.afnr.2017.11.002
And some research suggests that riboflavin may be effective at preventing migraines, too.
Thompson DF, et al. (2017). Prophylaxis of migraine headaches with riboflavin: A systematic review. DOI:
10.1111/jcpt.12548
Riboflavin deficiency is uncommon, but is associated with a sore throat, cracks and sores around the lips, an inflamed “
magenta tongue
” (say what?!), and scaly skin.
Mosegaard S, et al. (2020). Riboflavin deficiency: Implications for general human health and inborn errors of metabolism. DOI:
10.3390/ijms21113847
What you need:
Adult men need
1.3 mg
daily. Adult women need 1.1 mg per day. Those who are pregnant should get 1.4 mg daily, and intake should be 1.6 mg daily when lactating.
How to get it:

10.3945/an.116.013979
Thiamine (aka vitamin B1)
Taking too much has never caused toxicity under observation, and though thiamine deficiency (also known as
beriberi
) is rare in the U.S., it does still happen.
Symptoms affect the cardiovascular, nervous, muscular, and gastrointestinal systems in a variety of ways.
Whitfield KC, et al. (2018). Thiamine deficiency disorders: Diagnosis, prevalence, and a roadmap for global control programs. DOI:
10.1111/nyas.13919

Vitamin A (aka retinol, retinal, retinoic acid)
What’s up, doc?
Though known as being good for vision (hello, carrots),
vitamin A
has many other vital tasks: It encourages red and white blood cell production and activity, keeps the immune system primed and blood vessels healthy, helps rebuild bone, regulates cell growth and division, and may reduce the risk of some cancers.
Tanumihardjo SA, et al. (2016). Biomarkers of nutrition for development (BOND)-Vitamin A review. DOI:
10.3945/jn.115.229708
Retinoids, or variations of Vitamin A, also play a role in some medications that treat various skin diseases and acne.
Kotori MG. (2015). Low-dose Vitamin “A” Tablets-treatment of Acne Vulgaris. DOI:
10.5455/medarh.2015.69.28-30
(Many skin care products have retinol —
here’s why
.)
Though infrequent in the U.S.,
vitamin A deficiency
is not unheard of in developing countries, and can cause night blindness and, in extreme instances, complete blindness.
Faustino JF, et al. (2016). Vitamin A and the eye: An old tale for modern times. DOI:
10.5935/0004-2749.20160018

We looked
a little further
into vitamin A’s powerful skin effects.
So make like Bugs Bunny and crunch on some carrots for high doses of beta-carotene, which the body readily converts to vitamin A once digested.
Green AS, et al. (2016). Meeting the vitamin A requirement: The efficacy and importance of
β
-Carotene in animal species. DOI:
10.1155/2016/7393620
What you need:
Adult men need
900 mcg
retinol activity equivalents (RAE). Adult women need 700 mcg RAE.
Pregnant women aged 19 or older should up their intake to 770 mcg RAE, and lactating women in the same age group have even higher needs — 1,300 mcg RAE.
How to get it:
beef liver, with
6,582 mcg
RAE per 3oz-serving
baked sweet potato with skin, with
1,403 mcg
RAE per whole potato
boiled spinach, with
573 mcg
RAE per 1/2 cup

RAE per piece
raw carrots, with
459 mcg
RAE per 1/2 cup (here’s
8 reasons to drink carrot juice
, and — spoiler alert — vitamin A is one of them)
What’s too much?
3,000 mcg
Loading up on carrots,
butternut squash
or other carotenoid-rich foods may turn your skin orange (a condition known as carotenodermia), but won’t cause toxicity.
Oompa loompas
must be rolling in the stuff.
Taking too many vitamin A supplements, on the other hand, can lead to:
dizziness
nausea
headaches
skin irritation
joint and bone pain
coma
death
High doses of vitamin A can also cause significant congenital anomalies — women should keep an eye on their vitamin A intake while they’re pregnant.
Vitamin B6 (aka pyridoxal, pyridoxine, pyridoxamine)
Like a G6, this essential, water-soluble vitamin flies high above the others (or, at least on a level with the best of ’em).
Vitamin B6 helps out with the production of serotonin, a hormone that plays a hand in sleep, appetite, and mood.
Calderón-Ospina CA, et al. (2020). B Vitamins in the nervous system: Current knowledge of the biochemical modes of action and synergies of thiamine, pyridoxine, and cobalamin. DOI:

Nasty effects from high doses are usually seen in people taking supplements, and include pain and numbness in the limbs.
Taking extremely large doses of vitamin B6 daily over time can cause you to lose control over your bodily movements, as well as painful skin lesions, sensitivity to light, nausea, and heartburn.
Vitamin B12
Another water-soluble B vitamin, vitamin B12 offers a helping hand in the metabolism of fatty acids and amino acids, cell creation, and the protection of nerve cells, and also may reduce the risk of Alzheimer’s.
Moore E, et al. (2012). Cognitive impairment and vitamin B12: a review. DOI:

Vitamin C (aka ascorbic acid)
As we go on, we remember… that vitamin C is one of the best vitamins ever! Cartons of OJ are emblazoned with this popular vitamin’s name — and it’s famous for a good reason.
Vitamin C is thought to reduce the risk for some cancers, including those of the mouth, esophagus, stomach, and breast.
Ngo B, et al. (2019). Targeting cancer vulnerabilities with high-dose vitamin C. DOI:
10.1038/s41568-019-0135-7
It also helps make collagen, an important tool in wound repair and skin strength. And let’s not forget its antioxidant properties and immune-boosting effects.
Padayatty SJ, et al. (2016). Vitamin C: the known and the unknown and Goldilocks. DOI:
10.1111/odi.12446
Phew, vitamin C. Where do you even find the time? (
Here’s more
on how vitamin C can help the skin.)
But before chugging that daily glass of
Emergen-C
to ward off a cold, know that evidence linking “mega-doses” of Vitamin C to staving off sickness are conflicting.
How so? Well, a review of 29 research trials that included almost 11,000 people showed that the incidence and duration of the common cold is not decreased with high vitamin C intake.
Hemilä H, et al. (2013). Vitamin C for preventing and treating the common cold. DOI:
10.1002/14651858.CD000980.pub4
What’s more, the potential for vitamin C overdose is not ruled out, though uncertain.
But don’t skimp on C, either: After all, scurvy — the severe vitamin C deficiency linked to bleeding, bruising, join pain, and hair and tooth loss — is for pirates, not millennials.
Khalife R, et al. (2019). Scurvy, an old story in a new time: The hematologist’s experience. DOI:
10.1016/j.bcmd.2019.01.004
Arrgh, indeed.
Here are the
best vitamin C supplements
around at the moment.
What you need:
Adult men need
90 mg
per day, while adult women need 75 mg per day. Pregnant women 19 years of age or older should get 85 mg daily. Lactating women 19 years of age or older need even more at 120 mg daily.
Individuals who smoke should add an additional 35 mg per day. Also, they should
try to quit smoking
. Just sayin’.
We went deeper on the
daily vitamin C requirements
.
How to get it:
sweet red pepper, with
95 mg
per 1/2 cup
orange juice, with
93 mg
per 3/4 cup
orange, with
70 mg
per medium fruit
kiwifruit, with

broccoli, with
51 mg
per 1/2 cup
What’s too much?
2,000 mg
Vitamin C has low toxicity and isn’t likely to cause serious side effects, even if taken at high doses. The most common complaints from taking excess vitamin C include:
diarrhea
nausea
abdominal cramps
other belly troubles
Vitamin D
Here comes the sun, D-D-D-D.
This essential fat-soluble vitamin — which is vital for normal calcium metabolism, immunity, nervous system function, and bone density — sure does.
Theodoratou E, et al. (2014). Vitamin D and multiple health outcomes: umbrella review of systematic reviews and meta-analyses of observational studies and randomised trials. DOI:
10.1136/bmj.g2035
But before
vitamin D
can live up to its expectations, it must be activated by a
burst of UV rays
.
Before you throw on a bikini and soak up the sun (putting you at risk for skin cancer, be super
careful when you sunbathe
) consider supplements or cereals, milk, and juices that are fortified with the active form, which is
equally effective
.

Vitamin E
E is for the Excellent Eight. A family of eight antioxidants,
vitamin E
protects essential lipids from damage, battles free radicals, and maintains the integrity of cell membranes.

While you needn’t worry about consuming too much vitamin E from food, overdoing it on supplements can interfere with your blood’s ability to clot and may increase your risk of hemorrhagic stroke.
Vitamin K
Not to be confused with its mineral chum potassium (which is also noted as a “K” on the periodic table) (oh, hi, 4th grade chemistry), this essential, fat-soluble vitamin is a must for normal wound healing and bone development.
Akbari S, et al. (2018). Vitamin K and bone metabolism: A review of the latest rvidence in preclinical studies. DOI:
10.1155/2018/4629383
K is for “koagulation,” the German word for coagulation, or clotting (klotting?). While blood clots sound menacing, consider the importance of scabs, which are simply patches of clotted blood that form to protect cuts and scrapes.
Deficiencies in vitamin K include easy
bruisability
, bleeding, nosebleeds, and heavy menstrual periods.

Major minerals you need
Just making sure the vitamins don’t get all the shine.
Calcium
Got milk? Guzzle a glassful to get the daily dose of
calcium
, a macromineral crucial for the healthy development of bones and teeth.
But that’s not all — calcium also offers a helping hand in muscle function, blood clotting, nerve signaling, hormone secretion, and blood pressure. And alongside its sidekick, Vitamin D, calcium helps ward off osteoporosis.
Harvey NC, et al. (2017). The role of calcium supplementation in healthy musculoskeletal ageing: An expert consensus meeting of the European Society for Clinical and Economic Aspects of Osteoporosis, Osteoarthritis and Musculoskeletal Diseases (ESCEO) and the International Foundation for Osteoporosis (IOF).

While getting too much calcium from dietary sources is rare, taking too many calcium supplements
may
carry some risk for kidney stones formation,
Li K, et al. (2018). The good, the bad, and the ugly of calcium supplementation: a review of calcium intake on human health. DOI:

10.1136/heartjnl-2011-301345
Chromium
You may have chrome wheels, but do you have chromium-dense meals? We both know which is more gangsta. (Yes, the latter, we didn’t really think we’d have to point it out, to be honest.)
Though this trace mineral might well enhance insulin activity and the breakdown of dietary sugars, we only need it in small amounts. It’s not “essential” in the same way as some other minerals.
Vincent JB, et al. (2018). Chromium. DOI:
10.1093/advances/nmx021
While some
chromium supplements
tout muscle building and weight loss benefits, there’s little solid research evidence that backs up the claims.
Willoughby D, et al. (2018). Body composition changes in weight loss: Strategies and supplementation for maintaining lean body mass, a brief review. DOI:
10.3390/nu10121876
In fact, animal studies suggest that taking too many chromium supplements could cause kidney damage.

So shelf the supplement and, instead, try an
absperiment
instead for rock-hard abs.
What you need:
Adult men need
35 mcg
per day until they reach 50 years of age. Once they’re over 50 years of age, men need 30 mcg daily.
Women need 25 mcg daily through 50 years of age. Beyond this age, they need 20 mcg per day. Women’s chromium needs also increase during pregnancy, when they need 30 mcg daily, and throughout lactation, when they should get 45 mcg daily.

in rare cases, death
Iodine
Definitely dine with iodine. This essential trace mineral is a crucial component of thyroid hormones, which maintain our
basal metabolic rate
(BMR).
Mullur R, et al. (2014). Thyroid hormone regulation of metabolism.
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4044302/
Iodine also helps to regulate body temperature, as well as its nerve and muscle function. It also plays a role in the body’s growth and development. Sheesh, iodine really doesn’t give up, does it?
Too little iodine can lead to thyroid dysfunction, developmental abnormalities, and even
goiters
, a swelling of the thyroid gland (that ain’t pleasant).
Niwattisaiwong S, et al. (2017). Iodine deficiency: Clinical implications. DOI:
10.3949/ccjm.84a.15053
Too much iodine can do this too, so it’s important to have your levels in check.
Iodine is found in most
table salt
(it does say “iodized” on the container, right?).
What you need:
150 mcg
per day. People who are pregnant should increase their intake to 220 mcg daily, and up to 290 mcg daily when they’re lactating.
How to get it:
dried nori seaweed, with
232 mcg
per 10g-serving
baked cod, with

116 mcg
per cup
cooked oysters, with
93 mcg
per 3oz-serving
nonfat milk, with
85 mcg

Leung AM, et al. (2014). Consequences of excess iodine. DOI:
10.1038/nrendo.2013.251
Iron
Pump some iron (into your meals) to help hemoglobin, a component of red blood cells, and myoglobin (hemoglobin’s counterpart in muscles) bring oxygen to all the cells that need it.
Iron is also important for the making of amino acids, collagen, neurotransmitters, and hormones.
Dev S, et al. (2017). Overview of iron metabolism in health and disease. DOI:
10.1111/hdi.12542
Basically, it helps you stay
strong and happy
.
Since it’s easier to absorb this mineral from red meat and poultry, people on a vegetarian or vegan diet may want to consider iron supplements, or at least consuming more iron-rich fruits and leafy green vegetables.
Haider LM, et al. (2018). The effect of vegetarian diets on iron status in adults: A systematic review and meta-analysis. DOI:
10.1080/10408398.2016.1259210
We found some amazing
veggie sources of iron
for folks who don’t eat meat.
What you need:
Adult men need
8 mg
per day. Women between the ages of 19 to 50 years need 18 mg daily. Their needs increase to 27 mg per day during pregnancy.
Women only need 9 mg per day when lactating. Once they’re over the age of 50 years, women only need 8 mg per day.
How to get it:
fortified breakfast cereal, with
18 mg
per serving
cooked oysters, with
8 mg
per 3oz-serving
canned white beans, with
8 mg
per cup
dark chocolate, with
7 mg
per 3oz-serving
boiled spinach, with
3 mg
per 1/2 cup
beef, with
2 mg
per 3oz-serving
What’s too much?
45 mg
Don’t go too crazy for iron. While we need it, and acute overdose of iron can be lethal, and even peeking over the recommended daily intake can cause a range of symptoms, including:
Abhilash KP, et al. (2013). Fatal overdose of iron tablets in adults. DOI:
10.4103/0972-5229.120326
GI irritation
nausea
vomiting
diarrhea
constipation
Magnesium
Magnetically drawn to calcium, magnesium is a macromineral that partners with calcium to assist with:
Gröber U, et al. (2015). Magnesium in prevention and therapy. DOI:
10.3390/nu7095388
muscle contraction
blood clotting
cell signaling
energy metabolism
blood pressure regulation
building healthy bones and teeth
That’s a real team-up episode.
We looked at whether magnesium is effective for
managing anxiety
.
Rest easy, though, because magnesium deficiency is super rare and so are toxicities — unless popping magnesium supplements is your thing. If so, watch out for diarrhea, lethargy, heart rate disturbances, and muscle weakness.
Volpe SL. (2013). Magnesium in disease prevention and overall health. DOI:
10.3945/an.112.003483
We took a deeper dive on magnesium
here
.
What you need:
Men between the ages of 19 to 30 years need
400 mg
daily. Once they’re over 30 years of age, men should increase their intake to 420 mg per day.
Women between 19 to 30 years of age need 310 mg daily, and 350 mg during pregnancy. Women over 30 years of age need 320 mg daily, and 360 mg daily during pregnancy.

dry roasted almonds, with
80 mg
per 1oz-serving
boiled spinach, with
78 mg
per 1/2 cup
dry roasted cashews, with
74 mg
per 1oz-serving
It’s also available in
oil form
.
What’s too much?
There’s no upper limit for
dietary
magnesium, but if you’re getting magnesium from supplements, you should avoid exceeding
350 mg
per day.
You don’t need to worry about eating too much magnesium from food — your kidneys get rid of any excess. But loading up on magnesium supplements often leads to diarrhea, nausea, and cramping.
Manganese
Hailing from the Greek word for magic, manganese can be a double-edged sword (we fall far more on the side of science than magic, in case you hadn’t noticed).
Though an essential trace mineral and
antioxidant
that is important for energy, bone development and wound healing, it’s also potentially toxic in excess.
Aschner M, et al. (2017). Manganese. DOI:
10.3945/an.117.015305
What you need:
Adult men need 2.3 mg per day. Adult women need 1.8 mg per day. People who are pregnant should increase intake to 2.0 mg per day, and 2.6 mg daily when they’re lactating.

Overindulgence of this mineral — usually a result of water contamination — may cause a dip in intellectual function.
Chen H, et al. (2011). Manganese in drinking water and intellectual impairment in school-age children. DOI:
10.1289/ehp.1103485
Molybdenum
We can’t help with the pronunciation of this essential trace mineral (either that letter b or d is interloping and we can’t work out which).
However, we can confirm that it’s a necessary factor of many enzymes, which speed up the body’s biochemical reactions that break down nutrients into energy.
Novotny JA, et al. (2018). Molybdenum. DOI:
10.1093/advances/nmx001
Molybdenum deficiency has never been documented in healthy people, and toxicity is similarly rare.
What you need:
Adults need
45 mcg
per day. Pregnant and lactating women need 50 mcg daily.
How to get it:
boiled black eye peas, with
288 mcg
per 1/2 cup
beef liver, with

boiled lima beans, with
104 mcg
per 1/2 cup
plain, low fat yogurt, with
26 mcg
per cup
2 percent milk, with
22 mcg
per cup

2,000 mcg
Toxicity from too much molybdenum is rare.
However, in one piece of research, people who ate diets extremely rich in molybdenum (due to high levels in the soil) experienced achy joints and gout-like symptoms.
Novotny, JA. (2011). Molybdenum nutriture in humans. DOI:
10.1177/2156587211406732
Phosphorus
Keep bones and teeth prosperous with phosphorus, a macromineral that primarily builds and protects those chompers and your skeleton.
Phosphorus is also a building block of DNA and
RNA
, helps convert food into energy, and aids in shuttling nutrients to the organs that need them.
Calvo MS, et al. (2015). Phosphorus. DOI:
10.3945/an.115.008516
Rare cases of phosphorus deficiency can lead to anemia, muscle weakness, loss of appetite,
rickets
(in children), and numbness and tingling in the legs.
Jagtap VS, et al. (2012). Hypophosphatemic rickets. DOI:
10.4103/2230-8210.93733
It’s important, therefore, to keep stocked up. Phosphorus can also be great for
protecting the teeth
(eat your heart out, calcium).
What you need:
700 mg
per day
How to get it:
plain, low fat yogurt, with
245 mg
per 6oz-serving
2 percent milk, with

roasted chicken breast, with
182 mg
per 3oz-serving
What’s too much?
The UL for adults between the ages of 19 to 70 is
4,000 mg
. For women during pregnancy, this decreases to 3,500 mg. And the UL for adults over the age of 70 is even lower — 3,000 mg.
While the kidneys dislike phosphorus in excess, acute poisoning with phosphorus is virtually nonexistent.

10.1146/annurev-nutr-071816-064607
Potassium
Our hearts beat for potassium, a macromineral and electrolyte that’s essential for a steady heartbeat, the transmission of nervous system signals, and muscle function.
Weaver CM. (2013). Potassium and health. DOI:
10.3945/an.112.003533
Bananas ahoy!
Alongside sodium, potassium is also an MVP in balancing fluids by helping the kidney save fluids when we are dehydrated or excrete fluids that are in excess.
And wait, there’s more! Potassium is thought to lower blood pressure and benefit bones, too.
Iqbal S, et al. (2019). The effect of electrolytes on blood pressure: A brief summary of meta-analyses. DOI:
10.3390/nu11061362
Short-term potassium deficiencies (often from prolonged vomiting or diarrhea) may cause:
fatigue
muscle weakness and cramps
bloating
abdominal pain
constipation
So, thanks, but no thanks.
Gilligan S, et al. (2017). Hyperkalemia and hypokalemia in CKD: Prevalence, risk factors, and clinical outcomes. DOI:
10.1053/j.ackd.2017.06.004
We’ll take our potassium, please.
It’s one of the five “
you-might-not-be-getting-enough
” nutrients to watch out for.
What you need:
Adult males need
3,400 mg
per day. Adult women need 2,600 mg per day, but should increase their intake to 2,900 mg during pregnancy and 2,800 mg during lactation.
How to get it:
dried apricots, with
1,101 mg
per 1/2 cup
cooked lentils, with
731 mg
per cup
dried prunes, with
699 mg
per 1/2 cup
acorn squash, with
644 mg
per cup
baked potato, with
610 mg
per medium potato
What’s too much?
Not determined
Don’t get too pumped up on potassium, though.
Consuming high doses (typically from supplements) can lead to muscle weakness, tingling in the hands and feet, GI symptoms, and abnormal heart rhythms.

What’s too much?
400 mcg
Chronic excess of this trace mineral (usually from supplements) is known to cause nausea, GI discomfort, and hair and nail brittleness, so supplement selenium in moderation.
Hadrup N, et al. (2020). Acute human toxicity and mortality after selenium ingestion: A review. DOI:
10.1016/j.jtemb.2019.126435
Sodium chloride (aka salt)
Chemistry buffs know this pair of minerals as NaCl. The rest of us call it table salt (our name is cooler). Sodium chloride abounds in high quantities in most meals, snacks, and even drinks.
While it’s essential for fluid balance, nerve signal transmission, muscle contractions, digestion, and blood pressure, it’s possible to have too much of this savory mineral set.
Farquhar WB, et al. (2015). Dietary sodium and health: more than just blood pressure. DOI:
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jacc.2014.12.039
Since the average daily diet already includes salt waaaay in excess, consider
low salt alternatives
like olive oil (instead of butter), unsalted nuts in favor of salted ones, and fresh fruit.
What you need:
The estimated adequate intake for adults is 1,500 mg of sodium and 2,300 mg of chloride. However, most of us get way more sodium than we need and are at higher risk of getting too much than not enough.
Strohm D, et al. (2018). Revised reference values for the intake of sodium and chloride. DOI:
10.1159/000484355
How to get it:
The sodium content of a food varies wildly based on how much salt is used to prepare it. However, the question for salt shouldn’t be how to get it — you should focus on how to eat less of it.
Some brands of frozen pizza contain
370 mg
per slice, while others contain a whopping
730 mg
. Even whole fruits and vegetables contain natural sodium. For example, raw spinach contains
24 mg
per cup.
However, check out these
insane
levels of sodium in popular foods:
American cheese spread, with
2,275 mg
per cup
canned tomato sauce, with
1,350 mg
per cup
pickled herring, with
1,218 mg
per cup
canned cream of mushroom soup, with
871 mg
per 1/2 cup
hot dog, with
620 mg
per link
What’s too much?
More than
2,300 mg of sodium
(the equivalent of one teaspoon of salt) daily.
Excess sodium intake can raise blood pressure above normal limits, increasing a person’s risk for hypertension and cardiovascular disease further down the road.
Grillo A, et al. (2019). Sodium intake and hypertension. DOI:
10.3390/nu11091970
Zinc
Zippity doo dah for zinc, a trace element that’s a building block for enzymes, proteins, and cells. Zinc also plays a role in boosting the immune system,
Read SA, et al. (2019). The role of zinc in antiviral immunity. DOI:

here
.
What you need?
Men need
11 mg
per day. Women need 8 mg daily, but their needs increase to 11 mg while they’re pregnant and 12 mg while lactating.
How to get it:
breaded, fried oysters, with
74 mg
per 3oz-serving
beef chuck roast, with
7 mg
per 3oz-serving
Alaska king crab, with

baked beans, with
2.9 mg
per 1/2 cup
fortified breakfast cereal, with
2.8 mg
per serving
What’s too much?
40 mg
Taking too much zinc all at once can lead to nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, cramps, diarrhea, and headaches.
Over time, high levels of zinc supplementation results in reduced immune function, and lowered levels of HDL, your level of “good” cholesterol.
Trace minerals, also known as microminerals, are minerals your body only needs very small amounts of.
But just because you only need a tiny bit of these mineral powerhouses doesn’t mean they’re any less important than their cousins, the major minerals.
You’ll recognize these from above, and there are no slackers in this bunch:
iron
zinc
iodine
selenium
copper
manganese
fluoride

Where and how do they help?
Vitamins and minerals are involved in so many functions and organs — there are few processes in the body that don’t involve one of these key players!
Brain
That think tank doesn’t just fill itself — it needs sustenance. And that comes through the nutrients in your food.
Vitamin E and the brain
Antioxidant and neuroprotector vitamin E boosts brain health by reducing oxidative stress. It also helps combat inflammation and may help lower cholesterol, both of which are important for your little gray cells.
Also, it turns out people with Alzheimer’s have lower levels of vitamin E than those who don’t have the disease.
Lloret A, et al. (2019). The effectiveness of vitamin E treatment in Alzheimer’s disease. DOI:
10.3390/ijms20040879
B-vitamins and the brain
Being the most metabolically active organ in the body, your brain benefits as well from B vitamins helping to produce the energy that goes into creating new brain cells. All that thinking needs fuel.
Vitamins B6, B9 (folate), and B12 also help break down homocysteine, an amino acid that has associations with greater risk of dementia or Alzheimer’s disease.
Kennedy DO. (2016). B Vitamins and the brain: Mechanisms, dose and efficacy–A review. DOI:
10.3390/nu8020068
We found
47 ways
to support how your brain works.
Heart
There’s plenty to think about when keeping your ticker ticking — and vitamins and minerals play a
huge
role in heart health.
Magnesium for the heart
Low magnesium can be a predictor of heart disease — it’s been linked with cardiovascular risk factors like high blood pressure, high cholesterol and hardening of the arteries.
DiNicolantonio JJ, et al. (2018). Subclinical magnesium deficiency: a principal driver of cardiovascular disease and a public health crisis. DOI:
10.1136/openhrt-2017-000668
Folic acid for the heart
Folic acid may help reduce your risk of stroke and cardiovascular disease by lowering the concentration of homocysteine in your blood.
Li Y, et al. (2016). Folic acid supplementation and the risk of cardiovascular diseases: A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials. DOI:
10.1161/JAHA.116.003768
Potassium for the heart
Potassium helps regulate blood pressure levels, and reduces a person’s risk of stroke and cardiovascular disease.
Aaron KJ, et al. (2013). Role of dietary salt and potassium intake in cardiovascular health and disease: a review of the evidence. DOI:
10.1016/j.mayocp.2013.06.005
Vitamin D for the heart
Studies show getting enough of the sunshine vitamin may help reduce the formation of plaque and hardening of your arteries — both of which may help you avoid cardiovascular disease.
Rai V, et al. (2017). Role of vitamin D in cardiovascular diseases. DOI:
10.1016/j.ecl.2017.07.009
Here’s how to
listen to your heart

Bones
That skeleton isn’t just for Halloween vibes — it transports the wondrous being that is
you
around all day, every day. It’s best you nourish your bones. They’ve got your back — quite literally.
Vitamin D for the bones
Turns out vitamin D isn’t just good for your heart, it’s also essential for your bone growth, density and remodeling.
Goolsby MA, et al. (2017). Bone health in athletes. DOI:
10.1177/1941738116677732
That’s why a deficiency of this vitamin can lead to rickets, a malformation of the bones in the legs.
Magnesium for the bones
Magnesium, another bone fortifying micronutrient, is associated with increased grip strength, skeletal muscle mass, and bone density.
Welch, AA, et al. (2017). Dietary magnesium may be protective for aging of bone and skeletal muscle in middle and younger older age men and women: Cross-sectional findings from the UK Biobank Cohort. DOI:
10.3390/nu9111189
Calcium for the bones
Lest we forget calcium, undisputed champion of
bone function and structure
— essentially, it supports how strong bones are and how good they are at doing what they’re supposed to do.
The body stores 99 percent of its calcium supply in the bones, so you’d best make sure you’re getting enough.
Eyes
The eyes have it. And if that “it” is the right vitamins and minerals, your peepers are going to stay more effective for longer.
Vitamin A for the eyes
The old saying that carrots are good for your eyesight may have been a bit of World War II propaganda, but it was actually based in truth.
The beta-carotene in carrots is a form of vitamin A that helps you see at night and helps form the mucous membranes that protect your eyes.
Raman R, et al. (2017). Food components and ocular pathophysiology: a critical appraisal of the role of oxidative mechanisms. DOI:

Vitamin E for the eyes
Vitamin E
guards against oxidative stress
, which also happen to cause most common eye diseases. Making sure you have enough vitamin E in the diet can help
keep age-related macular degeneration at bay
.
Vitamin C for the eyes
The fluid that nourishes and protects the cornea and lens of your eyes is loaded with vitamin C.
According to this study, supplementing vitamin C may help reduce the effects of infectious keratitis, a nasty eye infection.
Cho YW, et al. (2014). Efficacy of systemic vitamin C supplementation in reducing corneal opacity resulting from infectious keratitis.
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4616340/
Zinc for the eyes
Zinc is abundant in the retina and works to protect the eye and improve night vision.
Gilbert R, et al. (2019).
Zinc nutrition and inflammation in the aging retina.
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31148351/
Making sure the eye has enough zinc (levels of which can reduce over time, giving you that zincing feeling) (sorry) is a great way to help your retinas stay healthy.
Selenium for the eyes
And selenium is a strong antioxidant for eye protection and may reduce the risk of age-related macular degeneration.

10.3390/antiox8040085
Skin
To keep your skin supple and healthy, make sure you’re getting enough of antioxidant vitamins C and E, wound healing vitamin K, and sunny vitamin D.
Vitamin C for the skin
Antioxidant vitamin C protects against the oxidative effects of harmful UV rays and helps build collagen, which helps keep your skin firm.
Pullar JM, et al. (2017). The roles of vitamin C in skin health. DOI:
10.3390/nu9080866
Vitamin E for the skin
Vitamin E is another antioxidant powerhouse that protects your skin from sun damage.

psoriasis symptoms
, atopic dermatitis, and other skin disorders.

Fat-soluble vs. water-soluble
Vitamins fall into two categories: fat-soluble and water-soluble.
Most vitamins are water-soluble, which means they dissolve in water. Fat-soluble vitamins are similar to oil, in that they do not dissolve in water. This may seem like a minor difference, but actually has a huge impact on how the vitamins act in your body.
Let’s discuss the difference between them.
Water-soluble vitamins
Water-soluble vitamins are abundant in the watery parts of the foods you eat (which would make sense, really, given the name).
Water-soluble vitamins include:
thiamine (vitamin B1)
riboflavin (vitamin B2)
niacin (vitamin B3)
pantothenic acid
biotin
pyridoxine (vitamin B6)
folic acid
cobalamin (vitamin B12)
ascorbic acid (vitamin C)
Water-soluble vitamins quickly dissolve in water. Since your body is about 80 percent water, that means they travel freely throughout your tissues.
You can’t store these vitamins in your body. So if you eat food or take a supplement that has more of a water-soluble vitamin than you need, you’ll pee the excess out (hello, bright yellow pee).
Because you don’t store them in your body, you’re not in much danger of overdoing it with these vitamins. But taking large amounts is not entirely benign.
Taking large amounts of vitamin B6, for instance, can cause permanent nerve damage, leading to numbness and muscle weakness.
It’s best to take water-soluble vitamins in frequent, small doses so your body gets what you need and you’re not literally throwing the good money you spent on supplements down the toilet.
Fat-soluble vitamins
Fat-soluble vitamins include:
vitamin A (and its precursor beta-carotene)
vitamin D
vitamin E
vitamin K
The body stores fat-soluble vitamins inside your body’s fatty tissues and liver. They aren’t excreted from your body as easily as water-soluble vitamins. It’s important to get enough of these vitamins, but too much, again, could be toxic.
Note that while you can definitely overdo it with fat-soluble vitamins from supplements, you’re unlikely to get too much from eating food that’s rich in the vitamins.
(Though your skin may turn orange from eating too many beta-carotene-rich squash or carrots — true story.)
Fat-soluble vitamins are absorbed through your intestines with the help of fats.
It’s easier for your body to absorb fat-soluble vitamins into your bloodstream when you eat them with fat, so remember to cook your kale with some olive oil for maximum nutrition.
Takeaway
Phew. It’s a lot, isn’t it? Don’t worry, here’s a roundup of the basics you need to know…
Vitamins and minerals are essential micronutrients that play a huge role in the development and functioning of your body and its organs. Though you don’t need much of them (that’s why they’re called micronutrients!), you’ll get sick if you’re deficient in any of them.
Vitamins are made by living creatures, while minerals exist naturally in the water and soil and are absorbed by plants. You can get all of the vitamins and minerals your body needs by eating a varied, balanced diet.
Among the 13 vitamins, vitamin C and the B vitamins are all water-soluble. This means they’re easily absorbed by your body and you generally pee out any extra that you ingest. You needn’t worry too much about overdoing it with these guys.
The fat-soluble vitamins (vitamins A, E, D, and K) are absorbed along with dietary fat and get stored in your body. You need to be more careful about ingesting too much of these nutrients, since your body doesn’t rid them easily.
Vitamins and minerals are involved in everything from mobilizing energy from the food you eat to allowing your blood to carry oxygen. They help you build bones and fight the harmful effects of oxidation throughout your body.
They’re especially important for brain, heart, and bones, as well as eye and skin health.
In short, these tiny nutrients have a big impact. Make sure to get your fill of these micronutrients by
eating a colorful diet
and consider a multivitamin to fill in any gaps (but be careful — not all supplements are
as flat-out good for you
as you might think).
Your body will thank you for it!

Myths about being vegetarian
tl;dr
So, you’re thinking about breaking up with meat — and maybe even
animal products altogether
. Well, hey! There are a ton of great reasons to go veggie, and adopting a
plant-based diet
is easier than ever. (See the vegan cheese and ice cream aisle.)
But if you’re wondering how exactly to get started, the prospect of overhauling your entire diet can be a little overwhelming. The good news is that transitioning to a plant-based eating plan isn’t all that hard, especially when you take the slow-and-steady approach.
Here’s what you need to know to get started.
Share on Pinterest
Plant-based vs. other ‘tarians: Vegetarian types
The common denominator is — duh — no meat. But beyond that, not every veggie diet is exactly the same. Here’s what all those labels actually mean:
Vegetarian.
Your garden variety vegetarian (heh) eats eggs and dairy products, but no meat, poultry, or fish. People who ID as lacto vegetarians do dairy, but not eggs. Ovo vegetarians do eggs, but not dairy.
Vegan.
Vegans only eat plants, period. They steer clear of animal products altogether. That means no meat, poultry, fish, eggs, or dairy. Some vegans also avoid honey.
Plant-based.
Aka flexitarian, it’s a looser framework that sticks mostly with plant foods, but occasionally includes small amounts of dairy, eggs, poultry, or fish.
Pescatarian.
Basically, just another name for a vegetarian who also eats fish.
Why go veg?
Being a vegetarian can have its pros and cons. (See going to a barbecue where the only items on the menu are hamburgers.) But the potential benefits of eating mostly plants are pretty far-reaching. Going vegetarian:
Might help keep your weight in check
Plant-based foods are often less calorie-dense than animal-based ones, so the more of them you eat, the fewer calories you might tend to take in daily. One
study
showed that plant-based foods might make it easier to lose weight or maintain a healthy weight.
Does your ticker good
Plants are naturally low in saturated fat and have no cholesterol. One
study
showed that when plants make up a big part — or even all — of your diet, you’re more likely to have healthier cholesterol and blood pressure levels.
Nourishes your gut
A
research review
showed that following a plant-based diet can help fill your microbiome with healthy bacteria, which could help promote a healthy weight and better blood sugar levels.
It’s all thanks to the fiber found in plant foods, which is key for keeping the good bacteria in your gut happy and well-fed.
Lowers disease risk
The more plants and fewer animal products you eat, the less likely you are to develop
type 2 diabetes
,
metabolic syndrome
,
heart disease
, and even
some cancers
.
And while any veg-based diet serves up these perks, in some cases, the closer you are to being totally vegan, the bigger the benefit tends to be.
Might help you live longer
Will going veg help you live to see 100? There are no guarantees, but a
2013 study
linked vegetarian diets to a lower risk of dying from any cause.
Better for the planet
According to the
Earth Institute, Columbia University
, plant-based diets have lighter carbon footprints. If you’re looking for a way to eat that’s more environmentally sustainable, veg is definitely the way to go.
Vegetarian starter kit: How to do it
Sure, totally changing up your diet and breaking up with certain foods can seem a little daunting.
But going vegetarian isn’t as hard as you might think. The key is making gradual changes, going easy on yourself, and maybe being willing to move a little bit outside of your comfort zone. Some pro tips for how to make the transition:
Rethink your plate
A balanced, filling meal doesn’t have to mean eating meat with a couple of sides — experiment with using
plant-based ingredients
as the anchor of your plate instead.
Try using whole grains as a base for a veggie and tofu bowl, make beans the star of a satisfying
stew
, or turn veggies into a mind-blowing
taco filling
.
Ease into it
No rule says that you have to go from omnivore to 100 percent vegetarian or vegan overnight. The cold turkey approach is a great option if you want to make a fast switch. But gradually upping the number of meatless meals each week is just as good.
Focusing on just a few new recipes at a time can make the transition feel seamless instead of overwhelming.
Find recipes you love
Speaking of new recipes, now’s the time to start stockpiling
go-to veggie options
that leave you feeling satisfied. Try picking up a plant-based cookbook (there are
SO MANY good ones
) or pick an ingredient to focus on and find new ideas for using it.
Did you know that there are, like,
more than 40 ways
to make tofu taste amazing?
Make friends with meal prep
Like with any dietary change,
preparation is key
. When things get busy, knowing you’ve got the goods ready and waiting in the fridge means you’re less likely to end up eating PB&J for dinner — or ordering pizza.
Expect speedbumps — and plan for them
The brutal truth? Being vegetarian means, you’re gonna sometimes run into situations where the food options are slim to none. The key is knowing when they’re likely to pop up — and being prepared.
Traveling? Pack snacks in case the food choices at the airport are all turkey and roast beef sandwiches. Meeting people at a new restaurant? Check out the menu ahead of time to verify there’s at least one thing you can eat. (FYI, there almost always will be, but it’s good to know for sure.)
Don’t feel like you have to go all or nothing
Remember, the only person you’re doing this for is yourself. It’s not the end of the world if you give in to a burger craving or accidentally eat soup made with chicken broth. Just get back to business tomorrow.
Some friendly nutrition reminders
Let’s real quick point out that vegetarian and vegan diets can deliver all the nutrition you need, provided you eat a variety of healthy foods.
There are some vitamins and minerals that can be a little harder to get than others, though, so you’ll want to make extra sure you’re getting enough of these guys:
Calcium.
If you’re regularly eating dairy foods, you’re all set. But if dairy milk, yogurt, or cheese aren’t on the menu or you only have them once in a while, be sure to get the bone builder
from other sources
. Think fortified plant milk, juices, cereals, tofu, almonds, broccoli, and leafy greens.
Vitamin D.
It’s hard even for some omnivores to get enough of it since vitamin D isn’t present in many foods. You can get it from eggs, fortified dairy milk, orange juice, plant milk, and cereals.
Iron.
The
iron in plant foods
is harder for the body to absorb than the iron in animal foods. So, load up on beans, leafy greens, eggs, and fortified cereals and always pair them with a vitamin C source to boost absorption.
Vitamin B12.
It only occurs naturally in animal-based foods, so if you’re vegan, find some solid
fortified options
, like fortified cereals, nutritional yeast, or plant milk. You can also talk with your doc about taking a supplement.
Side effects may occur (but they’re not a big deal)
Even though a veg diet can deliver mega health benefits, no style of eating is perfect. These downsides aren’t deal breakers, but they’re definitely worth being aware of.
You might have to work harder to get enough calories and nutrients
One
study
showed that, on average, you’d get around 260 fewer calories per day on a vegetarian diet and around 600 fewer calories on a vegan diet compared to an omnivorous diet. That could be helpful if you’re trying to lose weight.
If you’re happy with where the scale is right now, you might need to pay a little closer attention to make sure you’re getting the calories you need. Thankfully, an extra spoonful of almond butter or guac goes down pretty easy.
Things could get gassy, especially at first
Upping your plant intake means upping your fiber intake, which is a good thing, healthwise! But you might notice some gas, bloating, or even constipation while your digestive tract adjusts.
Your system should be back to feeling good within a few weeks, but drinking plenty of water and gradually upping your fiber intake can help with the transition.
You may need to plan a little more
Without meat, it might take a little more work to figure out how you’ll hit certain nutritional requirements. Ditto for dealing with situations like traveling or social events when you’re not sure what the food options will be like.
Mythbusters, vegetarian edition
According to the
Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics
, there’s definitely some misinformation out there about plant-based diets that’s worth clearing up. A few facts to get straight:
You don’t need to obsess about protein
You’ll easily meet the basic requirements for protein as long as you get enough calories and eat a variety of foods. If you’re a serious athlete or have extra high protein needs, working with a registered dietician can help you make sure you’re hitting all your bases.
As for combining foods, like rice + beans or bread + peanut butter to make
complete proteins
? It’s a
rookie mistake
. As long as you eat a variety of foods throughout the day, your body will get what it needs.
Don’t assume that veggie foods automatically = healthier
Vegan cupcakes have just as many empty calories as ones made with butter and eggs, guys. So, while it’s fine to treat yourself once in a while, don’t fall into the trap of thinking that just because it’s made with plants, it’s good for you or low calorie.
The same goes for meat substitutes. Veggie dogs and deli slices definitely have a
health halo
, but they’re highly processed and aren’t what you wanna have every day.
The bottom line
Vegetarian diets have loads of health benefits, provided you get enough of certain nutrients and eat a wide variety of wholesome, minimally processed foods.
The key to success is easing into your new eating plan, finding new recipes you really love, and making sure you get the vitamins and minerals you need. And if you fall off the bandwagon one day, don’t worry. There’s always another chia pudding or tofu stir-fry tomorrow.

tl;dr
It might happen slowly at first: A new, delicious chicken recipe requires a proper roasting pan and carefully measured ingredients. It also calls for minced, diced, and julienned add-ins. (“Hey Siri, what’s julienne?”)
Or it could happen all at once: Mom drops by for a surprise visit and the only things on hand are plastic cups and a jar of
peanut butter
… oops.
Maybe it’s time to stop using cookbooks as coasters and turn to their intended purpose instead — which means new cooking supplies (and
kitchen skills
) are in order.

The Right Way to Cook a Chicken Breast
List of kitchen items for prep
1. Paring knife
When going for a delicate cut, turn to the paring knife. It’s perfect for dicing smaller fruits and vegetables, mincing garlic cloves, and deveining
shrimp
.
Price range:
$3.99–$124.95
Editors’ pick:
Mercer Culinary Genesis Forged Paring Knife
($)
Share on Pinterest
2. Chef’s knife
One of the more versatile knives available, a chef’s knife allows you to chop, slice, mince, and more without switching tools. You’ll be like a kitchen Karate Kid!
A great knife may cost you a pretty penny, but it’s a worthy investment. It’ll quickly climb it’s way to the top of your most-used items list.
Tip
: Look for a stainless steel variety to keep away rust.
Price range
: $19.99–$199.99
Editors’ pick
:
Zwilling Pro 7-inch Chef’s Knife
($$$)
3. Cutting board
The workhorse of every kitchen, the cutting board is your faithful culinary friend. After all, how many dinners don’t involve cutting and chopping?
While plastic boards are inexpensive and easy to come by, wooden versions tend to be more sanitary since they lack grooves for
germs
to hang out in. They also help keep your knives in tip-top shape.
Price range:
$3.99–$129
Editors’ pick:
Sonder Los Angeles Motley Cutting Board
($$)
Share on Pinterest
4. Measuring cups and spoons
Did Mary Poppins mean a teaspoon of sugar or a tablespoon? Either way, having measuring tools is essential for following almost any recipe — or just portioning out serving sizes. Who knew a cup of
cereal
was so small?!
Price range:
$2.99–$39.99
Editors’ pick:
Prepworks from Progressive International Ultimate 19-Piece Measuring Cup and Spoon Set
($)
5. Kitchen shears
Used for everything from chopping
fresh herbs
and vegetables to slicing dried fruit and even meat, shears make every kitchen task so much easier. Take that, regular scissors!
Price range:
$2.99–$79.95
Editors’ pick:
Crate and Barrel Kitchen Shears
($)
Share on Pinterest
6. Colander
Though it’s possible to drain
pasta
using a pot lid, the result isn’t always pretty. (Jump-cut to rogue noodles escaping and burning yourself on hot steam.) Avoid this drama by using a colander, which drains water like a pro.
Bonus
: Colanders make it super simple to wash
fruits and veggies
. Buh-bye soggy pasta; hello clean produce!
Price range:
$0.99–$39.99
Editors’ pick:
Cook Pro Stainless Steel Colander
($)
7. Can opener
There are few things worse than reaching for a
can of pumpkin
and realizing there’s no way to open it. Or soup, coconut milk, beans, or anything else deliciously canned.
Though many goods have pop-tops these days, it’s always better to be prepared — ’cause you don’t want to have to hack into a can slasher-film-style just to make dinner.
Price range:
$1.49–$29.99
Editors’ pick:
Amco Swing-A-Way Portable Can Opener
($)
Share on Pinterest
8. Mixing bowls
Think mixing bowls are just for baking? Think again. Use them to marinate meat, dress veggies with sauce or seasoning, and make salad dressings and dips (give
one of these
a whirl).
Tip
: Skip glass bowls that chip easily and opt for lightweight stainless steel versions.
Price range:
$5.99–$39.99
Editors’ pick:
Cuisinart Stainless Steel Mixing Bowls with Lids
($)
9. Blender
These master mixers are used to whip up
smoothies
, mixed drinks, soups, nut butters, sauces, and oh-so-much more. And they can do it all in a matter of seconds. How’s that for an all-in-one appliance?
Price range:
$19.99–$600
Editors’ pick:
Nutribullet Blender Combo
($$$)
Share on Pinterest
10. Grater
Graters are most commonly used to shred cheese — quesadilla, anyone?
But they’re also wonderful for zesting citrus fruit, grating chocolate, and shredding vegetables like potatoes and zucchini. How else did you think
hash browns
came to be?
Price range:
$0.99–$49.99
Editors’ pick:
Thetis Homes 6-Sided Cheese Grater
($)
11. Whisk
This funny-looking tool has many more uses than beating
eggs
and making whipped cream.
It’s also great for mixing vinaigrettes, combining dry ingredients for baking, removing lumps from sauces and gravies, and standing in for a microphone during impromptu dance parties. (Trust us on this one.)
Price range:
$0.99–$34.99
Editors’ pick:
Oxo Good Grips 11-Inch Better Balloon Whisk
($)
Share on Pinterest
12. Vegetable peeler
Peeling veggies with a knife:
Top Chef
status. Peeling veggies with a peeler: just as good, minus the likelihood of an ER visit.
Spare your fingers and stick to this tool, which serves as a master potato peeler and a fancy
veggie ribbons
creator. Peelers are also great for shaving off pieces of hard cheeses, like Parmesan.
Price range:
$6.99–$29.99
Editors’ pick:
UberChef Ultra Sharp Stainless Steel Julienne Peeler & Vegetable Peeler
($)
13. Rolling pin
A rolling pin is a must-have if you love making dough (the kind you bake with, anyway). This kitchen staple will help create perfectly flattened crust for pies and pizzas. It’ll also come in handy for making
holiday cookies
.
Tip
: When rolling, use a pin that’s longer than the width of the dough. This will help ensure it’s even.
Price range:
$4.99–$59.99
Editors’ pick:
Ateco 19-Inch Length Maple Wood Rolling Pin
($)
Share on Pinterest
14. Food processor
It may be a bit bulky to haul off the pantry shelf, but a food processor takes the elbow grease out of innumerable kitchen tasks.
This workhorse can chop vegetables, purée soups, make fresh pesto or
salsas
, grind nuts, and whip up homemade breadcrumbs in seconds. Nobody puts the food processor in the corner!
Price range:
$14.99–$199
Editors’ pick:
Cuisinart 11-Cup Food Processor
($$$)
15. Food scale
Whether measuring meal portions or
baking
your next masterpiece, food scales provide a more precise measurement than cups and spoons alone. Once you start using one, you may wonder how you ever got by without!
Price range:
$24.99–$49.95
Editors’ pick:
Ozeri Pro Digital Food Scale
($)
Share on Pinterest
Best tools to get cookin’
16. Spatula
Whether you call it a flipper, a turner, or a spatula, this tool is surprisingly flexible. It can scramble eggs, flip
pancakes
, stir sauces, and more.
Price range:
$4.99–$54.99
Editors’ pick:
Rachael Ray 2-Piece Spatula Set
($)
17. Saucepans
Don’t let the name fool you; saucepans aren’t just for sauces. From simmering soups to
making quinoa
, a saucepan will quickly become one of your most-used items (if it isn’t already).
Price range:
$14.99– $129.99
Editors’ pick:
Cuisinart Chef’s Classic Stainless Steel
($)
Share on Pinterest
18. Sauté pan
Not to be confused with a skillet (a sauté pan has straight sides), these pans are perfect for braising meat and cooking lots of
leafy greens
. And thanks to those higher sides, sauce is less likely to spill all over the place.
Price range:
$19.99–$299.99
Editors’ pick:
Calphalon Nonstick Deep Saute Pan With Lid
($$$)
19. Skillet
One of the most versatile stovetop tools — you can cook nearly anything in a skillet. Nonstick varieties are inexpensive and make it easy to cook foods without needing to add much butter or oil to coat the pan.
Cast iron versions can go from the stove to the oven to make
one-pan meals
a snap. And while they’re more of an initial investment, with proper care they can last a lifetime.
Price range:
$14.99–$349.99
Editors’ pick:
Lodge Cast Iron Pre-Seasoned Skillet 12 Inch
($)
Share on Pinterest
20. Baking sheet
Even if baking cookies isn’t your thing, these sheets are super handy. Use them to
roast veggies
, make homemade fries, cook chicken, or bake bacon.
For easy cleanup, cover the surface in aluminum foil and spritz with cooking spray. When the food is done, remove the aluminum foil — no washing necessary!
Price range:
$2.99–$49.99
Editors’ pick:
Farberware Nonstick Cookie Sheet
($)
21. Oven mitts
We’ve seen enough burned fingers to know not everyone has mitts lying around. Use these to protect both you and your kitchen from the wrath of a hot oven. (Yes, they’re actually more effective than a kitchen towel.)
Price range:
$2.99–$19.99
Editors’ pick:
Nouvelle Flame Retardant Quilted Oven Mitts
($)
Share on Pinterest
22. Roasting pan
Intended as a tool for roasting meat, this pan produces juicy, flavorful results and requires little kitchen prep.
Its size also means it’s great for making large quantities of food: Think meatloaves, lasagna,
casseroles
, and more.
Tip
: Choose one with a rack to make
cooking that Thanksgiving turkey
a snap.
Price range:
$9.99–$129.95
Editors’ pick:
Cuisinart Chef’s Classic Stainless Steel 16″ Roaster with Roasting Rack
($)
23. Dutch oven
No, we’re not talking about the stinky prank your brother used to pull on you. Dutch ovens are actually a great tool for making
one-pot, slow-cooked meals
like stews, pot roasts, and soups.
A six-quart version should be large enough to make most meals.
Price range:
$39.99–$400
Editors’ pick:
Cuisinart Chef’s Classic 7-Quart Round Covered Casserole
($$)
Share on Pinterest
24. Cooling rack
Cooling racks help ensure
cookies
and other baked goods cool quickly and evenly. A quality rack is also great for getting the perfect crisp on Colonel Sanders’-style breaded meats by eliminating sogginess.
Price range
: $7.95–$29.99
Editors’ pick
:
Wilton 3-Tier Collapsible Cooling Rack
($)
25. Grill pan
If you don’t have outdoor space or it’s too cold to fire up the grill, a pan can create similar results indoors. It may not impart the same smoky flavor, but it does leave those eye-catching grill marks on meats and veggies.
It’s also an easy alternative for
grilling foods
that are often lost between traditional grates — think shrimp, fish, or asparagus.
Price range:
$24.99–$99.95
Editors’ pick:
Calphalon Contemporary 11-Inch Nonstick Griddle
Share on Pinterest
26. Potato masher
Though it may not see as much action as other kitchen tools, a potato masher is vital for making lump-free potatoes… as anyone who’s attempted to make mashed taters with a fork will agree.
For even more plant-based goodness, use this tool to mash beans for
bean burgers,
or avocados for guacamole.
Price range:
$0.99–$24.99
Editors’ pick:
KitchenAid Gourmet Stainless Steel Wire Masher
($)
27. Wok
Wok this way to get your
stir-fry
on! The high sides of this Asian-style pan mean you can stir and flip food without fear of anything escaping onto the stovetop.
Tip
: For best results, preheat a wok
before
adding the oil.
Price range:
$14.99–$89.99
Editors’ pick:
12-Inch Green Earth Wok by Ozeri
($)
Share on Pinterest
28. Meat thermometer
Never eat underdone or overcooked meat again! A meat thermometer ensures meat remains moist and safe to eat.
For the most accurate reading, stick the thermometer into the thickest part of the meat, away from fat and bone. A digital instant-read thermometer gives a temperature in just seconds.
Price:
$6.99–$49.99
Editors’ pick:
Kizen Instant-Read Meat Thermometer
($)
Must-have dining essentials
29. Flatware
No more hoarding forks and knives from local takeout joints — you’re movin’ on up!
If you’re opting for a stainless steel set, go gentle on the dishwasher detergent; too much can cause silverware to rust. Now go brush up on your table-setting skills.
Hint
: The fork always goes on the left.
Price range:
$14.99–$149.99
Editors’ pick:
Gingko International Lafayette 20-Piece Flatware Set, Service for 4
($)
Share on Pinterest
30. Plates
It sounds pretty basic, but yeah, we’re gonna go there: If you’re a grown-up, ya need plates!
Not only do real plates make delivery pizza feel gourmet, they can also be an extension of your personal style. If you’re feeling extra fancy, get yourself a set of both dinner and salad-sized options.
Price range:
$9.99–$199.99
Editors’ pick:
Certified International Radiance Teal Melamine 10.5-Inch Dinner Plate
($)
31. Bowls
BFF to late-night cereal and scoops of ice cream, bowls are a necessary ingredient for any kind of slurping.
They also work as makeshift mixing bowls if sticking to small portions like salad dressings or scrambled eggs for one.
Price range:
$5.99–$89.99
Editors’ pick:
Annovero Porcelain Cereal Bowls
($)
Share on Pinterest
32. Glasses
We won’t tell if you prefer guzzling
milk
and juice from the carton, but there
is
a more civilized way of drinking beverages.
Sticking to glass prevents the leaks that sometimes accompany Solo cups — and makes you feel that much more adult.
Price range:
$9.99–$89.99
Editors’ pick:
Bormioli Rocco Glassware Set of 4
($)
33. Mugs
While mugs may conjure up visions of sipping morning joe, they’re more than a coffee-delivery vessel.
When the dishwasher or sink is full, they make great stand-in glasses, and they’re perfect for concocting quick and easy mug cakes.
Price range:
$0.99–$29.99
Editors’ pick:
Stone & Mill Double Wall Insulated Glass Espresso Mugs, Set of 4
($)
Share on Pinterest
Tools to serve like a pro

salads
loaded with lots of veggies and other add-ins. Simply throw ingredients into the bowl, give them a good toss, grab some tongs, and get after it.
Price range:
$5.99–$64.99
Editors’ pick:
Lipper International Cherry Wavy Rim Bowl
($)
35. Serving bowls
Serving bowls are must-haves for big dinners, barbecues, or any occasion where food is being served
family-style
.
Set out everything needed for a delicious meal, and let guests serve themselves. Then bat your eyes and accept the compliments on your cooking.
Price range:
$9.99–$79.99
Editors’ pick:
Euro Ceramica Zanzibar 3-Piece Bowl Set
($$)
Share on Pinterest
36. Serving plates
Use serving plates to showcase food and make it easy to dig in. A large oval serving plate is essential for large meats and heaps of
roasted vegetables
, while specialized ones like cake serving platters are more specific.
Tip
: Stick to a lower price point if you don’t host large-scale gatherings often.
Price range:
$9.99–$99.99
Editors’ pick:
Denby Halo Oval Platter
($$)
37. Serving spoons
Look Ma, no more losing spoons in a pot! Use a slotted spoon for lifting big pieces out of liquid (like potatoes from a stew), a non-slotted one for spooning sauce over food, and a ladle to serve
soups
.
Price range:
$1.99–$64.99
Editors’ pick:
Lu Cucina 6-Piece Stainless Steel Cooking and Serving Spoon Set
($)
Share on Pinterest
38. Tongs
These claw-like tools are crazy-versatile. They can flip meat (sans bacon grease burns), serve salads, toss
stir-fry
ingredients, or squeeze juice out of a lemon like a champ. Heck, you can even use them as a bottle opener!
Price range:
$3.99–$19.95
Editors’ pick:
Winco UT-12 Coiled Spring Utility Tongs
($)
39. Wine opener
There’s no point in stocking up on “Two-Buck Chuck” without an opener, right?
While you can find plenty of spendy wine openers, the corkscrew variety is compact and easy to store or carry along. (You never know when you might be the hero in a wine emergency!)
Price range:
$6.99–$49.99
Editors’ pick:
HiCoup Ebony Wood All-In-One Corkscrew
($)
Share on Pinterest
40. Pitcher
Nothing says homey quite like a big pitcher of a refreshing drink. It also eliminates the need to constantly refill guests’ glasses. Who wants some
sangria
? (*Raises hand.*)
Price range:
$1.99–$49
Editors’ pick:
Hiware 75-Ounce Glass Pitcher
($)
Kitchen extras
41. Food storage containers
Storage containers are great for saving
leftovers
and keeping ingredients like chopped veggies fresh and ready to toss into a dish at a moment’s notice.
Sets with different sizes are useful for storing foods of all sorts, while containers with un-detachable lids means tops won’t magically disappear.
Price range:
$2.99–$39.99
Editors’ pick:
Rubbermaid 14-Piece Leak-Proof Food Containers
($)
Share on Pinterest
42. French press
The best part of waking up is
coffee in your cup
— and a French press makes it even better. Brewing is simple, the aroma is delicious, and it takes up much less room in the kitchen than a coffee maker.
Price range:
$12.99–$125
Editors’ pick:
Bodum French Press Coffee and Tea Maker
($)
43. Teakettle
If you live for hot beverages, the high-pitched whistle of the tea kettle isn’t annoying — it’s a siren song of warm, tasty goodness.
While your teapot of choice doesn’t have to be short and stout, it sure does help that it has a handle and a spout. This makes boiling water easier to pour (and easier for hands to avoid).
Tip
: Heat water in the kettle to quickly cure
ramen noodle
cravings.
Price range:
$8.99–$59.99
Editors’ pick:
OXO Good Grips Classic Tea Kettle
($)
Share on Pinterest
44. Immersion blender
Immersion blenders are sneakily useful tools. Simply stick one into a pot of soup ingredients, purée away, and viola: smooth soup sans blender fuss.
They’re also great for getting lumps out of mashed potatoes and making
creamy hummus
.
Price range:
$19.99–$120.00
Editors’ pick:
Cuisinart Smart Stick Immersion Hand Blender
($)
45. Juicer
Fresh-squeezed juice outdoes the bottled kind any day, elevating marinades, sauces, and homemade baked goods to something special and sweet.
When it comes to juicers, you can get as fancy as you want (helloooo, $100 extra-quiet, nutrient-extracting cold-press). But for day-to-day turning lemons into lemonade, all you need is a basic model.
Price range:
$15.99–100.00
Editors’ pick:
Proctor Silex Alex’s Lemonade Stand Citrus Juicer
($)
Share on Pinterest
46. Apron
Last but not least on this list of essentials: the humble cooking apron. It’s there to protect you (and your clothes) in everything from a brownie batter spill to faucet spray come dish time.
While you can’t go wrong in classic black, we prefer to add a little more sass into our style. Our favorite one of the bunch says it all: this shit is going to be delicious.
Price range:
$15.99–100.00
Editors’ pick:
Miracu Kitchen Chef Cooking Apron
($)
Bottom line
Remember: Rome wasn’t built in a day, and your kitchen stash won’t be either. To avoid total overwhelm, focus on getting one item on your wishlist at a time, master it, then move on to the next one.
As you gradually work your way to a solid collection of appliances and utensils, you’ll be ready for whatever cooking occasion comes your way — not to mention you’ll feel all kinds of fancy at your next dinner party.

Do you even lift, bro? If not, you might be missing out. Lifting weights boosts strength and improves health, transforming your fitness journey. Ready to start? Here are some expert tips.
Do you even lift, bro? If not, then you’re seriously missing out. Lifting weights has a ton of benefits, from
weight loss
and
muscle gains
to greater strength and
improved stamina
. But how the heck do you go from zero weight room experience to full-on weightlifter?
If you’re ready to get those sweet lifting #gains, we’ve got tips from a pro to help you get started.
Quick tips to start lifting weights
Consider going to a gym or consulting a personal trainer.
Invest in basic equipment to get your lift on at home.
Make sure you warm up before you lift AND cool down after each sesh.
Start with lighter weights and increase weight gradually.
Perfect your form before you start.
Rest for at least 1 minute between sets and limit workouts to 45 minutes, tops.
Take 2 or 3
rest days
each week (recovery is key!).
Build a customized workout plan that meets all your needs and #goals.

Let’s get into it: How to start weight training
Consult a trainer or join a gym
While you totally don’t need a gym or a trainer to start
lifting dumbbells
in your living room, starting your journey with guidance from a
personal trainer
can help you get a great foundation to avoid injury.
“Newcomers should always be shown professionally how to
squat
,
deadlift
, or even
lunge
properly,” says Ben Walker, personal trainer and owner of
Anywhere Fitness
in Dublin, Ireland. “This is so they don’t compensate their
lower spine
and damage vertebrae while performing an exercise.”
In addition to teaching you proper form, a
personal trainer
can work with you on specific exercises to help you reach your
fitness goals
.
Not sure how to connect with a pro? Your local gym is a great place to start. Most gyms have trainers on hand who can provide guidance on using
machines
and lifting free weights. They can also answer any questions you have to make sure you’re getting the most out of each sweat sesh.
Another option is to search online for local trainers who take private clients for one-on-one or
small-group
training. Some even offer virtual appointments, so you can get your lift on right in the comfort of your
home
(no commute necessary!).
Buy some weights
There are many exercises you can do with your own
body weight
. But if you’re ready to add some weightlifting staples to
your home gym
(or to start using them
at
the gym), you can consider:
dumbbells
kettlebells
a barbell
resistance bands
To keep things simple, all you really need to get started is one set of
dumbbells
. Once you get more comfortable with the foundational moves, you can start adding
weightlifting gear
,
kettlebells
, and
barbells
to the mix.
Beginner tips to start strength training
Start with light weights and high reps
OK, but
how much
weight should you lift
if you’re a beginner?
Walker recommends using lighter weights and doing
more repetitions
(the number of times you complete the movement) when you’re starting out.
What’s considered “light” depends on your current fitness level and what moves you’ll be doing. Different exercises can require
different weight levels
to be effective, based on which muscles they’re targeting and how many reps you plan on doing.
When selecting the appropriate weight level, you want to be challenged — without sacrificing
proper form
. If your
weights
are weighing you down so that your spine isn’t aligned and your back isn’t supported, you could be risking injury.
When in doubt, start out light.
Make sure you warm up
It’s important to
warm up
properly before jumping into any exercise. A quick
warmup
is necessary to prepare your muscles and joints for the workout ahead so that they’re limber and less susceptible to injury.
Warming up also helps increase blood flow to your working muscles and gradually increases your body temperature in preparation for harder work.
There are many ways you can warm up before you work out, such as:
Stretching.
Performing a series of
dynamic stretches
helps loosen your limbs, gets your blood a-pumpin’, and
activates your muscles
for peak performance, so
your body is ready
to hit the weights.
Light exercise.
Exercises like bodyweight
squats
can double as a warmup before you add weights.
Light cardio.
Cycling,
walking
, or
rowing
for just a few minutes can help prepare your bod for weightlifting.
Foam rolling.
Try adding
foam rolling
to your stretching routine. Regularly using a
foam roller
may help reduce muscle soreness and increase flexibility and range of motion.
Using a massage gun.
Sure,
massage guns
are great for relieving sore muscles, but
research
shows that they’re also beneficial for getting your muscles ready and raring to go before a workout.
Check your form!
Proper form
is essential for workout success.
“Beginners should always be aware that keeping a ‘neutral spine’ is necessary at all times during every exercise. This is when our spine is situated in a straight position [with the natural curve], whether we are standing or positioned on the floor,” explains Walker.
A personal trainer can help make sure your form is in top shape!
Professional help not in the cards… or in
your budget
? We feel ya. Thankfully, there are many online resources (*cough, cough*
Greatist
👀) to show you examples of what good form looks like and explain how to do it right.
Rest between sets
It’s important to give your muscles a little time off after completing a set.
When you’re a weightlifting newbie, aim for at least
1 minute
of
rest
between sets (aka groups of reps). This’ll give your muscles
time to recover
and avoid getting overworked or fatigued.
These brief rest periods also give you the opportunity to grab
a swig of sweet H
2
O
and check in with your body. (Any pain points? Stiffness? Something feeling out of sorts? Use this time to take notice!)
Keep workouts to 45 minutes
All good things must come to an end — including a killer sweat sesh.
Limiting your workouts to 45 minutes can help you avoid overdoing it.
Overtraining
can leave you feeling tired,
sore
, and potentially
cranky
. It can also increase your risk of injury because you’re not allowing your muscles to properly recover.
Plus, there’s no science that says a longer workout produces better results.
How
you spend your time is more important than how
much
time you spend lifting, so use your minutes wisely and reap the benefits. And again, REST between sessions!
Increase weight gradually
As you get deeper into your weight training journey, you’ll find that your
weights
provide less resistance over time. This means your muscles are getting stronger! Yay!
It also means you can start to
increase the amount of weight
you’re lifting. But instead of tacking on a ton of extra poundage at once, introduce more weight little by little.
Gradually
increase weight
by 5 to 10 percent, making sure you’re perfecting each move (with
proper form
!) before increasing your weight levels again.
Cool down after you work out
A quick
stretch sesh
to cool down after a workout can help ease any muscle tension or
tightness
after lifting, as well as improve your flexibility and range of motion, according to a
2012 research review
.
The
research
results on this are inconclusive and mixed, but it’s possible that
stretching
may also help prevent injury.
Plus, stretching just feels
ah-mazing
after you’ve hit the weights. You can also cool down with easy cardio, massage, or foam rolling. And don’t forget to rehydrate and refuel!
Make a workout schedule
Setting a schedule can help you stay consistent in your routine. Determine how and when to target certain muscle groups, and build in the right amount of rest and recovery for primo performance.
After a long day, a
glass of wine
and a
Netflix marathon
may sound better than a workout. So
planning your workouts
also provides you with some accountability — especially if you’re working out alone and don’t have a trainer or
friend
to hold you to it.
Your Netflix sesh will still be waiting for you after your workout.
Take rest days!
Rest days
are a key component of any workout sched and are essential for promoting
muscle recovery
and reducing the risk of getting hurt.
When starting a weightlifting program, Walker recommends taking at least 2 or 3 rest days each week. “Each muscle group needs 48 to 72 hours to recover before performing the next workout. This is why it’s a good idea to do split workouts in the beginning.”
Split training
involves focusing on specific muscle groups one day and then targeting others the next. This allows particular muscle groups to recover while you work out other groups.
“Once your body has adapted after a few weeks, the muscle groups will need 24 to 48 hours to recover,” notes Walker. “Recovering sooner, you can now plan your workouts more accordingly during the week and add an extra training day.”
Beginner weightlifting exercises to get you started
Here’s a quick refresher on weightlifting lingo:
Reps
(aka repetitions) = how many times you complete an exercise movement
Sets
= how many reps you do (for example, 20 reps may equal 1 set)
When you’re just starting out, Walker suggests
performing an average of 3–4 sets of 20 reps each
. As your muscles adapt to certain movements, you can increase the number of reps and sets you do during your workouts.
Got your
dumbbells
ready? Here are some of the best beginner weight training moves to get you started.
Dumbbell single-arm row
Share on Pinterest
GIF by Active Body, Creative Mind
Rest your left knee on a bench, keeping right foot planted on the floor. For balance, let your left hand rest palm-down near the front of the bench.
With right hand, reach down and pick up your dumbbell. Make sure your back is parallel to the floor.
Slowly lift the weight up toward your waist, bending elbow and squeezing shoulder and back muscles.
Slowly lower the weight, extending your arm to return to the starting position.
Complete 1 set, then switch to the other side and repeat.
Dumbbell shoulder press
Share on Pinterest
GIF by Active Body, Creative Mind
Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, holding a dumbbell in each hand. (You can also do this one seated — just be sure to sit up straight so that your spine is aligned!)
Lift your elbows so they’re raised at your sides at 90-degree angles.
Turn your palms forward.
Slowly press the dumbbells up toward the sky, straightening your arms. Make sure to keep your spine aligned — no leaning or arching your back!
Slowly bring your arms back down to the starting position.
Shoulder lateral raise
Share on Pinterest
GIF by Dima Bazak
Stand (or sit!) up straight with your arms at your sides and a dumbbell in each hand.
Keeping your arms straight, slowly lift arms out to the sides until they’re parallel to the floor. Don’t pinch your neck or swing your arms. Use shoulder and back muscles to make this a slow, controlled movement.
Slowly lower your arms back down to your sides.
Dumbbell chest press
Share on Pinterest
GIF by Dima Bazak
Lie faceup on a
bench
or the
floor
, holding a dumbbell in each hand. Bend elbows at 90 degrees and position your arms at about a 45-degree angle to your body.
With palms facing toward feet, slowly press the weights toward the sky, extending arms directly above your shoulders. Be sure to keep your elbows soft — don’t lock them!
Slowly lower the weights back to the starting position.
Biceps curl
Share on Pinterest
GIF by Dima Bazak
Stand or sit with arms at your sides, holding a weight in each hand.
Bend elbows to curl the weights up toward your shoulders, turning palms to face your body.
Slowly lower the weights back to the starting position.
Triceps extension
Share on Pinterest
GIF by Dima Bazak
Stand or sit, making sure your feet are shoulder-width apart.
Hold a dumbbell vertically, with both hands around the handle.
Lift arms straight up, so the weight is directly over your head.
Don’t pinch your shoulders, and leave space between your elbows and ears. Slowly bend arms, lowering the dumbbell behind your head.
Press the dumbbell up to the sky to return to the starting position.
Dumbbell lunge
Share on Pinterest
GIF by Active Body, Creative Mind
Stand with your arms at your sides, holding a dumbbell in each hand.
Step forward with right leg, bending at the knee until right thigh is parallel with the floor (make sure your bent knee does not extend past your toes!). Let left leg bend to keep you balanced.
Step right foot back to the starting position.
Repeat with the other leg.
Weighted squat
Share on Pinterest
GIF by Dima Bazak
Stand with feet shoulder-width apart. For weight, you can hold 2 dumbbells on your shoulders, 1 dumbbell at your chest, or a kettlebell at your chest (your choice!).
Keeping the weight steady, slowly bend your knees and sit back into a squat, as if sitting in a chair. (Make sure your heels don’t lift off the floor.)
Slowly rise back up to standing by activating your core and glutes.
Weighted calf raise
Share on Pinterest
GIF by Dima Bazak
Stand on a flat surface with feet shoulder-width apart and arms at your sides, holding a dumbbell in each hand.
Slowly lift onto your toes, raising your heels off the floor.
Hold for 1–2 seconds.
Slowly lower your heels back down.
Your strength training schedule
Setting a weekly weight training schedule gives you a road map for which muscles to work when and allows for proper
rest and recovery
.
How many days you exercise
each week really depends on your goals. But
the American College of Sports Medicine
generally recommends resistance training (i.e., weightlifting) 2 or 3 days a week for best results.
Here’s a simple 3-day plan (using the exercises above!) to help you get started:
Day
Muscle groups
Exercises
(
3 or 4 sets of 20 reps)
Monday
upper body (shoulders,
biceps
, and back)
biceps curl
dumbbell single-arm row
dumbbell shoulder press
Tuesday
rest or
cardio
Wednesday
lower body (
legs
and butt)
dumbbell lunge
weighted squat
weighted calf raise
Thursday
rest or cardio
Friday
upper body (
triceps
, shoulders, and chest)
shoulder lateral raise
dumbbell chest press
triceps extension
Saturday
rest or cardio
Sunday
rest or cardio
Start with the lightest weights possible, gradually increasing over time. This will help you achieve hypertrophy, which, Walker explains, is “when the muscle fibers break down to their best ability, so they can repair and grow larger.” (In other words: #gains.)
Pro tip:
Walker says that getting enough
protein
and adequate
sleep
will also aid in muscle repair and help your muscles grow to their greatest potential.
How to start weight training safely
Whether you’re a newbie or a seasoned pro, it’s important to be careful when weight training. Exercising safely can help you avoid injury and ensure that you’re not burning yourself out.
Add these safety tips to your “must follow” list:
Got pain?
Seriously, if something
hurts
, stop and reevaluate. You may need to check in with a trainer about your form. If pain persists, consult a healthcare professional ASAP.
Take it slow.
Do each exercise slowly to reap the full benefits (and to steer clear of injuries!).
Use proper form.
Always make sure your form is top-notch when doing any weight lifting exercise.
Hydrate, hydrate, hydrate!
Rest periods between sets? Perfect time for
water
.
Staying hydrated
keeps your muscles and joints moving freely.
Dress the part.
Always wear the right gear for lifting.
Workout clothes
, closed-toed shoes, and weightlifting gloves can help make your workouts safe and effective.
Breathe… just breathe.
Pay attention to your breath
as you move. Inhale before each lift and exhale during each lift.
Always give your body recovery days.
Skipping
recovery days
increases your risk of injury and can affect your fitness gains. Your body needs to recover to build muscle strength and size.
Takeaway
Weight training is a great way to burn calories, build muscle, and boost strength.
If you’re looking to add weightlifting to your workout routine, consider working with a trainer, setting a schedule, and investing in basic equipment (like dumbbells). To prevent injury or burnout, it’s important to start slowly, making sure you’re taking rest days and not doing too many reps or making your workout too long.
Always be safe when lifting weights. Take your time, use proper form, and never push through pain during workouts. If something feels wrong, stop your workout and consult a professional.

What is HIIT?
Benefits
Risks
How often to train
Discover how to build muscle at home with HIIT. This guide explores effective high intensity interval training techniques that may boost fat burning and muscle growth, all while fitting into your busy schedule. Learn more now.
Share on Pinterest
Ahh, HIIT. It’s the workout everybody brags about doing, day in and day out, because they have #BodyGoals that they’re here to, er, hit.
What is high-intensity interval training?
HIIT, or high-intensity interval training, wasn’t meant to be done every day. And if you’re able to actually bust out that level of intensity five, six, or seven days per week, you’re likely doing it wrong.
We know — it’s not what you want to hear.
But these super-quick routines were created so you could perform your chosen form of
cardio
at maximum effort, says
Joey Thurman
, certified personal trainer and author of “365 Health and Fitness Hacks That Could Save Your Life.”
“The idea is to elevate your heart rate for a brief period, followed by resting for a given period,” Thurman explains. “You can train in a 1:1 work-to-rest ratio (sprint for 30 seconds, rest for 30), a 1:2 ratio (sprint for 30 seconds, rest for 1 minute), a 1:3 ratio (sprint for 30 seconds, rest for 1.5 minutes), and so forth.”
The key, he says, is to go at your
maximum
effort during the
sprints
.
A lot of studies that show the benefits of extremely intense, short bouts of exercise are a result of people working at their give-it-all-you-got effort, says
Dalton Wong
, certified personal trainer and author of “The Feelgood Plan: Happier, Healthier & Slimmer in 15 Minutes a Day.”
“True HIIT is like sprinting, and it should make you feel like your gas tank is completely empty,” Wong says. So if you’re doing a 30-second sprint during a HIIT interval, you shouldn’t be able to get to second 31 without wanting to collapse.
Which means that if you’re able to go for even one second longer — or pencil in another
HIIT session
tomorrow — you probably didn’t go hard enough. We hate to be so blunt, but that’s the truth.
Most people aren’t used to pushing themselves as hard as is necessary for HIIT, especially for a HIIT workout that’s as short as 7 or 10 minutes, because it’s extremely uncomfortable.
HIIT benefits
Share on Pinterest
We all want the fastest, most efficient way to
get in shape
so we can do other awesome things with our lives. So the idea of being able to work out for such a short amount of time and get results, rather than slogging away on
the treadmill
for a longer time, sounds like a no-brainer.
The first benefit everyone talks about is, of course, the fat burning. “Research shows that intervals can repair your metabolism by reducing inflammation, forcing the body to improve its ability to use and burn energy,” says Thurman.
This means you’ll burn fat at a faster rate,
utilize energy
better during workouts, and continue to burn calories long after your workout is done. This is a phenomenon known as
EPOC
, or excess post-exercise oxygen consumption.
Plus, you’ll simply be able to do more during those sweat sessions. “Think of it this way: If I were to have you sprint as far as you could for as long as you could, how long would you last? One minute, two minutes, three minutes?” asks Thurman.
“By adding
rest periods
and then going back [to the effort interval], it allows you to cumulatively sprint for a longer period of time. So, if you performed ten 30-second sprints, you’ll sprint for a total of five minutes. [That’s] much longer than anyone could sprint at once.”
And, when HIIT is done correctly (and paired with a
solid nutrition plan
), you can blast belly fat and improve heart health.

10.1111/obr.12532
] [Zhaowei K, et al. (2016). Comparison of high-intensity interval training and moderate-to-vigorous continuous training for cardiometabolic health and exercise enjoyment in obese young women: A randomized controlled trial. DOI:
10.1371/journal.pone.0158589
Are there risks to doing HIIT every day?
Glad you asked. The obvious risk is injury. Your risk of getting injured due to
overtraining
skyrockets when you don’t give your muscle tissue enough time to repair and grow, says Thurman.
“It falls along the same line of not working the same muscle group when lifting two days in a row — your body, joints, and mind will eventually wear out,” he says.
And don’t forget: Mental burnout is a real thing. “If you do too much HIIT, after a while your mind will start to lag behind,” says Thurman. “You’ll feel tired, fatigued, and not look forward to your workout. If you’re not mentally invested, your performance will suffer, as well as your form, and that can again lead to overuse and injury.”
So how much HIIT should I do?
Two to three days a week is a solid amount of HIIT, says Wong, as long as you build in 24 hours of rest and recovery between sessions.
So if your goal is to work out four times per week, he recommends two HIIT sessions and two
resistance training
sessions. Whether you go full-body on those resistance days or break it into an upper-body day and a lower-body day is up to you.
Keep your programming in mind: “If you do
leg-intensive
resistance training one day, then do HIIT sprints the next, your legs will be sore and not fully recovered for the HIIT,” says Thurman. “Try to schedule a rest day or yoga in between to allow optimal results.”
Basically, we’re not telling you
not
to do HIIT. We’re also not telling you to skip exercising on the reg. Fitting in some form of movement each day is good for both your physical and
mental health
— that’s something all the experts agree on.
But if you’ve maxed out your three-times-a-week HIIT sessions or are just phoning it in, schedule a
yoga class
or
hop on the bike
for a casual ride in the sunshine. You’ve earned it.

Kettlebell warmup
Kettlebell workout
Safety
Chances are, if you’ve used kettlebells before,
you know how to swing ’em
, which, uh, gets a little boring after a while. So, how can you switch things up to get more out of your favorite horned strength training tool? Just flip it on its head.
“Swinging
kettlebells
works the posterior chain, including the back, shoulders, legs, and glutes,” explains certified personal trainer
Kenny Santucci
. “But holding the kettlebell with the bottom facing up brings balance and stability into the exercises.”
Bottoms-up kettlebell warmup

Illustration by Yaja’ Mulcare
A kettlebell workout for shoulder strength
Perform each of the moves below for 10–12 reps or a 30-second hold.
If you’re experienced, try 15 reps. To make any of these single-arm moves harder, you can add a second kettlebell for a double-arm progression.
FYI: These moves challenge your balance and stability, so you want to go lighter than you normally would with a kettlebell for swings.
“Women should start with a
6-kilogram bell
and men with an
8-kilogram bell
,” Santucci suggests. And then work your way up from there. “If you’re not able to hold the kettlebell bottoms-up, hold the handle on the side so the bell is sideways for these moves.”
For these exercises, the steps describe a single rep on one side of your body. Repeat each one on the other side for a balanced workout.
1. Bottoms-up single-arm kettlebell shoulder press
Share on Pinterest
Stand with feet shoulder-width apart, holding the kettlebell in your left hand.
Keeping left elbow close to the side of your body, bend elbow to raise your fist to your shoulder. (This is your starting position.)
Extend right arm for balance.
Keeping abs engaged and torso still, extend left arm to press the kettlebell up toward the ceiling.
Slowly lower and return to the starting position.
2. Kettlebell swing to hold
Share on Pinterest
Stand with feet shoulder-width apart, holding the kettlebell in your left hand and keeping right arm extended for balance.
Hinge at your hips and slightly bend knees as you swing the kettlebell between your legs.
Drive your hips forward to swing the kettlebell.
Stand back up, using the momentum to bring left fist to left shoulder while balancing and stabilizing the bottoms-up bell.
3. Double alternating kettlebell press
Share on Pinterest
Stand with feet shoulder-width apart, holding a kettlebell in each hand, bottoms-up. Position your fists at shoulder height and elbows close to the sides of your body.
Keeping right arm still, extend left arm, pushing the kettlebell up toward the ceiling.
As you slowly lower back down, extend right arm, pushing the kettlebell up toward the ceiling.
Continue alternating sides.
4. Reverse kettlebell lunge
Share on Pinterest
Stand with feet shoulder-width apart, balancing a bottoms-up kettlebell in each hand at shoulder height.
Keeping your arms still, step right leg back and bend knees to 90 degrees, with right hip stacked directly over right knee and left knee stacked directly over left ankle.
Push through your left heel to stand back up.
Repeat on other side to complete 1 rep.
5. Kettlebell double floor press
Share on Pinterest
Start seated and grab a kettlebell with each hand. Rack them at shoulder height.
Lean back to lie faceup with your knees bent, feet flat on the floor, and arms bent to 90 degrees, while balancing the kettlebells.
Extend your arms to press the kettlebells toward the ceiling.
Lower back down until your elbows are bent at 90 degrees.
Repeat.
Wanna make it harder?
Press through your heels to lift your hips into a bridge position, with your back and glutes raised off the floor. Stay in this bridge position for the entire set.
6. Side plank kettlebell hold
Share on Pinterest
Start in a side forearm plank on your left side, with elbow under shoulder, core engaged, and the kettlebell in your right hand.
Bend right elbow to balance the kettlebell bottom-up with your palm facing forward, wrist directly over elbow, and elbow close to the side of your body.
Extend right arm, pressing the kettlebell toward the ceiling, and hold for 30 seconds.
7. Overhead kettlebell hold
Share on Pinterest
Stand with feet shoulder-width apart, holding the kettlebell in your left hand.
Keeping left elbow close to the side of your body, bend elbow to lift the kettlebell to shoulder height with the bottom facing up.
Extend right arm forward for balance.
Keeping your torso still, extend left arm to press the kettlebell up toward the ceiling.
Hold for 30 seconds, then repeat on the other side.
8. Side plank with kettlebell corkscrew press
Share on Pinterest
Start in a side forearm plank on your left side, with elbow under shoulder, core engaged, and the kettlebell in your right hand.
Bend right elbow to balance the kettlebell bottom-up with your palm facing forward, wrist directly over elbow, and elbow close to the side of your body. This is your starting position.
Extend right arm, pressing the kettlebell up toward the ceiling while rotating your palm to the left (to face your feet).
Reverse the twist and lower the kettlebell back down to the starting position.
Complete all reps on one side, then repeat on the other side.
9. Squat with single-arm kettlebell hold
Share on Pinterest
Stand with feet shoulder-width apart, holding the kettlebell in your left hand.
Keeping left elbow close to the side of your body, bend elbow to raise your fist to your shoulder, balancing the kettlebell with the bottom facing up.
Extend right arm forward for balance.
Keeping left arm still, send your hips back and bend knees to sit back into your heels, squatting until your thighs are at least parallel to the floor while your chest stays lifted. (This is the ideal form, but it’s pretty ambitious — it’s more important to maintain posture than to get fully parallel. It might be time to work mobility work into your routine.)
Push through your heels to return to a standing position.
10. Double static kettlebell hold
Share on Pinterest
Stand with feet shoulder-width apart, holding a kettlebell in each hand.
Bend elbows to 90 degrees and raise elbows to shoulder height, with the kettlebell bottoms facing up.

Share on Pinterest
Stand with feet shoulder-width apart, holding a kettlebell in your left hand, with right arm extended for balance.
Hinge at hips and slightly bend knees as you swing the kettlebell between your legs.
Drive hips forward to stand back up as you swing the kettlebell up and overhead, keeping left arm straight the entire time.
With control, slowly lower the kettlebell back down, and swing to repeat. Make sure the power comes from your hips rather than your arms — your arms should act like a pendulum, carrying momentum from your hips. If it feels like you’re lifting your arm, refocus on your hips.
12. Kettlebell windmill with overhead hold
Share on Pinterest
Stand with feet just a bit wider than your hips, with the kettlebell bottom-up in your left hand and left arm extended straight overhead.
Keeping your eyes on the kettlebell overhead, bend knees slightly as you reach right hand to the inside of your right foot. Shift weight into your left hip while you complete the reach.
Stand back up.
13. Posting position for kettlebell Turkish get-up
Share on Pinterest
This move (the first part of a Turkish get-up) is a great way to build strength and progress to the full move.
Lie faceup with your right leg extended and left leg bent with foot flat on the floor.
Rest right arm on the floor out to the side and push the kettlebell upward, positioned bottom-up in your left hand.
Keeping your eyes on the kettlebell, extend left arm straight up,
Brace your core, bend right elbow, and push off the floor as you peel left shoulder up to sitting. Keep wrist directly above shoulder as you raise yourself.
Slowly lower back down to the starting position.
Kettlebell safety
Kettlebell workouts can be amazing for working your core, shoulders, and back with different movements — so long as you pull them off safely.
Keep these kettlebell safety tips in mind next time you’re going bell for leather:
Pick an appropriate weight.
Pushing yourself is fine, but choosing an overwhelmingly heavy weight risks strains and sprains. Pick a kettlebell that’s comfortable and provides resistance without overloading you.
Always maintain the correct form.
Incorrect form during a kettlebell workout is another surefire way to throw out a shoulder. Take it slow at first while you get used to the basics.
Pick a kettlebell that you can grip double-handed.
One-handed kettlebell moves can be quite the feat for a beginner. Be sure to use a kettlebell that you can ease into using two hands.
You’ve got the moves, the safety tips, and the structure. Now get to swingin’!

The workout
Discover the ultimate guide to resistance band exercises that might transform your fitness routine. From leg day to arm workouts, these versatile bands may help you build strength and flexibility anywhere, anytime.
Rock out with the band!
Resistance bands
are a great addition to any strength training routine or rehabilitation program. They come in a variety of sizes, lengths, and resistance levels.
They’re also portable and easy to store, so they’re perfect for home use, hotel workouts, or making the most of a small space at the gym.
Just like
free weights
, exercise bands come in a range of resistance levels, from highly stretchable to heavy-duty strength.
The most common types of bands are tube bands with handles, loop bands, and therapy bands. If you’re in doubt, a fitness professional can help determine which band is right for you, depending on your fitness level and your specific workout plan.
For most exercises, try aiming for 2 to 3 sets of 8 to 25 reps per exercise. Ready, set, stre-e-e-etch!
Lower-body exercises
Never skip leg day…
1. Front squat
Your butt, both sides of your thigh, and hamstrings are going to thank you for this one (after they stop burning). Front
squats
can also provide a strength boost to your groin, hip flexors, and calves.
Share on Pinterest
How to do it
Stand on the band with your feet slightly wider than shoulder width.
Holding a handle in each hand, bring the top of the band over each shoulder. If the band is too long, secure it in place by crossing your arms at your chest.
Lower as if you’re sitting down into a chair. Keep your chest up,
abs
firm, and feet flat.
Rise back up to the starting position.
Repeat for 8–12 reps.
2. Leg extension
Kick it up a notch with this
quad builder
.
Share on Pinterest
Amy Crandall
How to do it
Anchor a loop band in a low position on a support (like an incline bench), looping the other end around your
ankle
with the band positioned behind you.
While seated, step away from the anchor to create tension on the band, and position your feet hip-width apart.
Shift your weight to your left foot and lift your right
leg
from the floor.
Extend your knee until it straightens out in front of you.
Slowly return to the starting position.
Repeat for 8–12 reps before switching legs.
3. Prone (lying) leg curl
This one goes out to your hamstrings.
Share on Pinterest

How to do it
Lie facedown and loop a band around your right ankle, anchoring to a stable object close to the floor for support.

core
and bend your leg at your knee, bringing your heel toward your glutes as far as you can comfortably go.
Slowly return your leg to the starting position.
Repeat for 10–15 reps, then switch sides.

Salute
your glutes
!
Share on Pinterest

Share on Pinterest
Gifs by Dima Bazak
How to do it

loop band

From a wide stance, get into a
quarter squat
.
Pull your right leg in toward your left, working against the resistance.
Slowly return to the starting position. Repeat for 12–15 reps before switching sides.
6. Clamshell
Loosen up your external hip rotators and improve your movement and flexibility — after all, this Lizzo & Missy Elliott tune isn’t going to dance to itself.
Share on Pinterest
Gifs by Dima Bazak
How to do it
Loop a band around your legs just above your
knees
.

Keeping your feet together, pull your knees away from each other while contracting your glutes for 2–3 seconds.
Slowly return to the starting position.
Repeat, aiming for 10–12 reps.
7.
Plantar flexion
Improving your ankle flexibility might not be on the top of your to-do list, but if you keep them limber, they’ll give you fewer problems further down the line.
Even better news: You can take a load off for this one.
Share on Pinterest
Active Body Creative Mind
How to do it
Sit on the floor with one leg straight out in front of you, one bent.
Hold both ends of a resistance band, wrapping the middle around the ball of your foot.

toes back up

Getting started
Gear you actually need
Bottom line
Ever want to try something new but have no idea where to start? We’re comin' in hot with the tools, the skills, and the inspo you need to tackle a new hobby or activity with confidence. Your First Gear starts here.
We include products we think are useful for our readers. If you buy through links on this page, we may earn a small commission.
Here’s our process
So you wanna take that “I’m in middle school and life is easy” feeling from riding your bike around the neighborhood to the next level. It’s time to get road biking, baby.
Hitting the road on two wheels is an awesome way to
improve your endurance
and get those
exercise endorphins pumping
without putting tons of wear and tear on your joints.
All good things! The only real downside? It can feel like there are
a ton of barriers to getting started
, what with the whole needing a road bike and knowing how to take care of it thing. (And getting those padded bike shorts. Yes, you really need them.)
Enter “First Gear,” our brand-spankin’-new series on
starting a hobby
or activity in a way that doesn’t feel totally overwhelming. This month, we’re breaking down the basics of what you need — and what you need to know — to ride safely and comfortably (without any of the distracting extras that might make you feel like you’re about to bite off way more than you can chew).
Let’s do this thang.

First Gear
What you’ll need
Solid road bike (new, please!)
Well-fitting helmet
Padded cycling shorts
Jersey
Floor pump
Road repair tools, including a spare tube and tire patch kit, tire levers, a hand pump, and a multitool
Bike lock
Headlight/bike lights
Bag for your gear
Water bottle and holder
Snacks
Getting started
Ready to hit the road? Sweet. First, you’ll need a solid bike and a few pointers. Here’s what you need to know about shopping — and riding — smart.
Hit the local bike shop
There are tons of things you can buy online with no problem. A road bike isn’t one of them.
“If it’s your first bike, you should definitely buy it in person at a local bike shop where they can size the bike to you, make sure it fits you properly, and adjust it properly so you can be set up for success,” says
Garret Seacat
, an amateur cycling team manager and former bike shop manager.
Tempted to
save some moolah
with a used bike? TBH, a new bike will probably be sturdier, safer, and more reliable, so it’s really worth going fresh-from-the-factory if you can.
If used is your only option right now, try to take it to a local bike shop
before
handing over any cash. The pros there can let you know if you’re getting a good deal and whether the bike is in good enough condition to ride, says Cheryl Beattie, owner of
Bicycle Café Kamloops
in British Columbia, Canada.
Learn some tricks of the fix-it trade
Tire blowouts
and dropped chains happen on the road. Ask a pro at your bike shop to show you how to tackle these kinds of problems so you’re prepared. Some shops also offer free new rider demos once or twice a month, which are worth checking out, Beattie says.
If you’re more of a
learn-as-you-go kinda person
, pull up some YouTube videos and tinker with your bike at home — and don’t forget to make sure you have basic repair equipment with you when you ride.
Plan out your route
You might not be as familiar with the roads or terrain once you start heading
beyond your neighborhood
or town. When you’re miles away from home, it helps to know where you’re going, when you’ll be back, and what obstacles you might hit along the way.
An app like
Komoot
can help you plan your routes in advance based on
your fitness level
. And it’ll give you a heads-up about essential deets like pathway surfaces, elevation, potential hurdles, and how long the ride will take based on your speed.
Also important: Pay attention to which direction the wind is blowing as you ride and consider how it’ll affect your trip as a whole. “If you have a strong tailwind pushing you, it’s great. But then when you turn around, you have the shock of your lifetime, because that 1-hour ride out turns into a 3-hour ride back,” Beattie says.
Start out slow and steady (and expect it to hurt a little)
Don’t try to go all Tour de France on your first ride. Even if you’re in primo shape, your body needs time to adjust to the experience of being on a bike for long stretches.
“You’re gonna notice that your hands, butt, neck, lower back, and feet will be sore for those first few weeks because riding is a new sensation,” Seacat says.
He suggests easing into things by starting out with a 30- to 60-minute ride two or three times a week. As you start to feel more comfortable, you can increase your total ride time or mileage by around 10 percent per week.
If, after 2 weeks of riding, you still notice that your neck or back is super sore, head back to the bike shop. Your bike might need some adjustments.
Don’t forget the drinks and snacks
Water’s a must
, obv. “Every hour you should be drinking about 20 ounces,” Seacat says. As for food,
quick sources of energy
like bars, gels, or blocks are your BFFs when you start to lag.
“Bring more rather than less, especially if you don’t know yourself,” Beattie suggests. Once you pass the 1-hour mark, plan to take in 100 to 200 calories every hour or two, Seacat recommends.
The gear (and why you need it)
Because gear is super individualized, it often pays to talk with an expert about your unique needs instead of just shopping generic top-rated picks online. That said, there’s definitely a list of cycling must-haves every rider needs. Consider this your general checklist.
Share on Pinterest
1. Bike (of course)
Again, a bike shop is the very best place to get ride recommendations tailored to your needs and your body. Without some expert guidance, “you can accidentally buy a bike where you didn’t really know what you were getting, then you’re stuck with it,” Seacat says.
For a solid beginner bike, you can expect to pay at least $800 to $1,000, Seacat and Beattie say. For that price, you’ll get a sturdy aluminum frame, a carbon fiber fork to reduce road buzz and make riding more comfortable, and disc brakes for better stopping power. “Be prepared to spend the absolute max you can afford. Nobody’s ever come back and say they regretted spending too much on their first bike,” says Seacat.
2.
Helmet
Noggin protection
is nonnegotiable. Helmets with
MIPS
(that’s Multi-Directional Impact Protection System) offer the best insurance against concussions. But a proper fit is even more important, says Beattie. “If you’re not sure if it fits, go to a bike shop and have it fit on your head,” she says.
Try:
Giro Isode MIPS Helmet
3. Clothes
Sure, you can wear jeans and a T-shirt when you’re riding over to your friend’s place. But they’ll be mega-uncomfortable on a longer trek. Stock up on the following:
Padded cycling shorts
Padded spandex shorts with bibs (aka straps) are huge. They’ll keep your butt comfortable on the seat, and the bibs will keep the waistband from slipping down while you’re bent over riding. “It’s going to be a lot more comfortable,” Seacat says. Don’t be afraid to
spend big here
. A solid pair will run you between $100 and $150.
Try:
Pearl iZUMi Expedition Cycling Bib Shorts for Men
or
Cycology Frida Women’s Bib Shorts
Jersey
Tops made of technical fabrics like spandex, polyester, nylon, or even wool are better at wicking moisture than a basic cotton tee, Beattie says. That’s key, because if your skin is soaked with sweat while you’re zooming downhill or facing strong winds, you’ll start to feel like death real quick.
Try:
Rapha Men’s Core Jersey
or
Rapha Women’s Core Jersey
4. Floor pump
Fully filled tires make riding both easier and safer. “When your pressure is low, you can have a blowout,” Beattie says. So you need to refill your tires with a dedicated floor pump before each ride. “You can’t get that pressure with a hand pump,” she explains.
Try:
Topeak JoeBlow Sport III Bike Floor Pump
5. Road repair tools
You might not know how to use all these things right now — or even when you go out for your first ride. That’s OK. Have them on hand anyway and rest assured that you’ll learn the ins and outs of road repairs pretty quickly.
Spare tube and tire patch kit
Patch kits are a good bet for tiny punctures, but you’ll need spare tubes for big punctures or blowouts. In other words, both are key for dealing with flat tires so you can get back on your way. Just make sure the tubes you buy are the right size for your tires.
Try:
Standard Presta Valve Tube
and
Park Tool VP-1C Tire Patch Kit
Tire levers
Road bike tires fit super snug to your wheel rim. A set of levers can help you pry a tire off if you need to fix a flat.
Try:
Pedro’s Tire Levers
Hand pump
It’s not as powerful as a floor pump, but it’ll get the job done when you’re out and about.
Try:
PRO BIKE TOOL Mini Bike Pump Classic Edition
Multitool
This is basically several little tools in one — think wrenches, chain tools, and screwdrivers. The compact design means it can handle lots of different kinds of repairs without weighing you down.
Try:
Crankbrothers M19 Multi-Tool + Case
6. Bike lock
Plan on making any stops along your ride? Then you’ll def want one of these.
Try:
Hiplok Lite Chain Lock
7. Headlight
Bring one along even if you don’t plan to be out at night. Bad weather can make it harder for traffic to see you, and sometimes rides just take longer than you think.
Try:
Planet Bike Beamer 80/Grateful Red Bike Light Set
8. Bag for your gear
Backpacks add extra weight on your back, which you don’t want. A small bike seat pack will hold your repair tools and snacks without weighing you down.
Try:
Topeak Aero Expanding Wedge Saddle Pack
9. Water bottle and holder
The best place for your water bottle? Tucked into a cage that fits right on your bike frame for easy access any time you get thirsty.
Try:
Planet Bike Aluminum Water Bottle Cage
and
NUUN Purist Water Bottle
10. Snacks
Energy bars, blocks, gels, and chews are easy to toss into your bike seat pack and deliver fast energy that you can get down without having to stop.
Try:
Honey Stinger Organic Energy Chews
,
Clif Bar CLIF BLOKS
, or
Probar BOLT Organic Energy Chews
tl;dr
Road biking definitely comes with an upfront investment, not to mention a learning curve. But you only need a bike, a helmet, the right clothes, some basic tools, and a few free hours per week to get started.
Best of all, the pros at your local bike shop are there to guide you through the 101 of it all, so make that your first stop.

Benefits of daily stretching
Not only does stretching feel oh-so-good, but it’s good for you too! Fitting a 10- to 15-minute stretch sesh into your daily schedule has a ton of health benefits.
Stretching can:
Loosen up tight muscles.
Feeling a bit stiff from your day job or workout?
Stretching
is a great way to relieve any
tightness
and tension.
Increase flexibility and range of motion.
Stretching
helps your muscles and joints become more flexible. And according to a
2012 research review
, stretching can increase your range of motion. This can help you get bendy for
yoga
and just move more easily when walking across your living room.
Improve posture.
Bad desk posture
killing your vibe? A
small 2014 study
suggests that stretching may help you be more aware of your
posture
and avoid that forward slump in your shoulders.
Reduce pain.
Because stretching helps ease muscle tension, it may help reduce pain caused by chronic conditions or injuries. According to a
small 2015 study
, stretching can also help reduce pain
while
correcting poor posture.
Lower your risk of injury.
Working out or doing physical activity without a proper
warmup
can put you on the path to potential injury. A daily stretch sesh
may help prevent strains and sprains.
Boost your circulation.
A
small 2013 study
suggests that stretching is a great way to boost circulation. And better blood flow can benefit your overall
heart health
, improve
muscle recovery
, and reduce
soreness
Relieve stress.
Stretching can help relieve tension for a
stress-free body
and
mind
🧘‍♂️.
Ease headaches.
Stretching can help ease
headache-inducing
tension and provide you with sweet relief.
Your 15-minute daily stretching routine
You can do
stretching exercises
whenever you feel like it. But two great times to add movement to your routine are
right when you wake up
and
before bed
.
If you want to stretch around your
workout routine
, a proper
warmup
is key — and stretching alone may not be enough. But
studies
suggest it’s better to do dynamic stretches (
active movements
that provide a stretch) before a workout and static stretches (in which you hold one position for a while) afterward.
To keep your muscles lean and limber, try this mix of
static
and
dynamic stretches
.

Once your head is back at your chest, rest for 5 seconds, then roll to the other side.
Repeat 5 times.
2. Shoulder roll
Share on Pinterest
GIF by Dima Bazak
Stand up straight with arms at your sides.

Share on Pinterest
GIF by Dima Bazak
Stand with feet hip-width apart and cross right foot over left foot.
Reach your arms overhead and grab left wrist with right hand.
Lower your shoulders, leaving space by your ears, as you lean to the right. You should feel this stretch in your sides and shoulders without pain or tingling.
Hold for 15–30 seconds.
Return to a standing position and repeat on the other side.
5. Standing quad stretch
Share on Pinterest
GIF by Dima Bazak
Stand straight with feet shoulder-width apart.

7. Figure four stretch
Share on Pinterest
GIF by Dima Bazak
Lie faceup and lift your legs off the floor, bending knees at a 90-degree angle.
Place right ankle over left knee, then place your hands on left leg (just below your knee).
Pull your leg toward you until you feel the stretch.
Hold for 30 seconds, then release.
Repeat on the other side.
8. Hamstring stretch
Share on Pinterest
GIF by Dima Bazak
Lie faceup on the floor with legs extended in front of you. Bend right leg in, so your foot is resting next to your left thigh.
Place hands behind your right thigh. Gently straighten right leg with heel flexed as you pull your leg toward your body (stop when you feel the stretch in the back of your leg).
Hold for 30 seconds.
Switch legs and repeat. Try using a stretch strap or a towel if it’s hard to reach your leg.
9. Kneeling hip flexor stretch
Share on Pinterest
GIF by Dima Bazak
Kneel on the floor and step right foot forward, making a 90-degree angle at your hip and knee.
Engage your core and glutes to create an upward tilt in your pelvis. You’ll also feel a light
stretch in your left hip
.
Hold for up to 30 seconds.
Switch legs and repeat.
10. Child’s Pose
Share on Pinterest
GIF by Dima Bazak
Start on all fours
on a mat
, with knees directly under hips and toes pointed behind you.
Slowly sit back so your butt goes down toward your heels.
Lower your chest toward the floor, letting hands slide forward.
Hold for 30 seconds to 1 minute.
Release the pose and rest for 10 seconds.
Repeat at least 3 times.
Takeaway
Daily
stretching
is a great way to keep your body and mind in top form. Plus, you’ll get the added benefits of increased flexibility, improved circulation, and stress relief (yas!).
We know that adding even a short
stretching
routine into your day may seem daunting. If you’re looking for ways to stick to your #goals, these tips may help:
Schedule your stretch sesh for the same time every day.
Start with a short 5-minute routine and work your way up to 10, 15, or even 30 minutes!
Keep it interesting by switching up the types of stretches.
If you experience any pain during a stretch, be sure to stop. Stretches should feel good, or maybe slightly uncomfortable if your muscles are tight, but they shouldn’t hurt.
Pay attention to any sensitive spots and talk with a healthcare professional if you sense that something’s off or you feel more “ouch” than “ahhhh.”

How we chose the best home workout equipment
We consulted Katelyn Barrons,
an NASM-certified personal trainer and ACE health coach
, to determine the critical criteria for choosing home workout equipment. Her suggestions were deceptively simple, from pieces that let you add resistance to
basic bodyweight exercises
to fun
cardio equipment
to help motivate you on the days you just don’t want to do it.
With her suggestions, here are the criteria we used to pick the best home workout equipment:
Versatility.
Some pieces of equipment are single-use, and that’s fine. But others can be used for a variety of workout styles.
Space-saving.
We’re all jealous of those of you who have a dedicated room for
your home gym
. But most of us aren’t that lucky, so we considered the equipment’s square footage and how much storage space it requires.
Materials and quality.
Home workout equipment won’t take the same beating as pro gym equipment, but you want something that will last. Since home workout equipment encompasses a wide variety of products, we consulted consumer reviews. If reviews said a resistance band broke, or an
exercise bike
started squeaking or falling apart after 2 months, that product didn’t make this list.
Workout personality and style.
We made sure to include products for all kinds of workout personalities and styles. Use your preferences to pick equipment that will help you stick with your workout plan even when you’d rather eat a
doughnut on the couch
.
Vetted products.
We put every product through a thorough vetting process that checks for unsupported health claims and shady business practices. Only products that passed made our list.

Best basic home workout equipment
Best yoga mat
Gaiam Essentials Thick Yoga Mat
Share on Pinterest
Price:
$
Yoga mats
aren’t just for yoga. Sure, they’re great for a
Downward-Facing Dog
, but they’re also a helpful cushion
for push-ups
and ab work. The Gaiam Essentials Thick Yoga Mat provides a soft, thick surface so you can really dig into your poses or cushion your bod when you’re on the floor. This mat is affordable, lightweight, and portable thanks to an included carrying strap.
It gets great reviews, with tons of people saying it’s high quality, easy to clean, and the right thickness. But some say it’s not as durable as they’d hope — and others say there’s a strong off-gassing smell at first.
Pros
72 in. long and 24 in. wide
2/5 in. thick
fun color options
comes with a carrying strap
great reviews
Cons
strong off-gassing smell
Shop now at Amazon
Best foam roller
AmazonBasics High-Density Foam Roller
Share on Pinterest
Price:
$
A
foam roller
isn’t a complex piece of equipment, and the AmazonBasics High-Density Foam Roller gets the job done at an affordable price. It comes in lots of colors and lengths, so you can choose one that fits your space. The high-density foam digs into your muscles like a gopher, so it will
work out knots and sore spots
. Fair warning: The pain of that first roll will legit make you scream. 😱
A seam on one side sticks out on some of the rollers, so keep an eye out if you end up buying — reviewers say it does
not
feel good to roll on that seam.
Pros
affordable
6 color choices
4 length options
high-density foam
Cons
raised seam does
not
feel good

Best equipment storage
Wallniture Guru Wall Mount
Share on Pinterest
Price:
$
Tripping over equipment is no one’s idea of a good time. The Wallniture Guru Wall Mount makes sure there’s no more tripping or piles of
workout gear
at the bottom of your closet. It provides vertical storage space for yoga mats, foam rollers, jump ropes, and resistance bands. You can install it in a closet or the garage to keep all your
gear organized
and out of sight.
It comes with hardware, but reviewers say the hardware is the weak point. You might want to substitute sturdier versions from the local hardware store.
Pros
stores foam rollers and yoga mats
includes three hooks for hanging jump ropes or resistance bands
lightweight
Cons
included hardware could be sturdier

Best home workout strength training equipment
Best ankle weights
Bala Bangles
Share on Pinterest
Price:
$$
Yesss, the ankle weights that blew up on social media.
They have a great aesthetic (with 7 stylish colors to choose from), and they’re also made from quality materials that reviewers love — recycled steel coated in super-soft silicone (no more scratchy weights, pls.). The elastic and fasteners are also designed to allow for a better fit than regular ankle weights that slide around everywhere.
They come with a handy carrying case, and you can choose from 1- or 2-pound (lb.) weights. Slip them on your wrists or ankles when you’re doing
Pilates
,
yoga
, walking your
dog
, or even
cooking
.
Reviewers say it’s super easy to move them from your ankles to your wrists during workouts. Many also say they love the fun pop of color they add to any sweat sesh.
Some say you need to practice adjusting them to avoid Velcro rubbing on your skin — but once you get the hang of it, using them is a breeze.
Pros
made from recycled steel and soft silicone
seven colors to choose from
can choose between 1- or 2-lb. weights
come with a matching carrying case
Cons
need to adjust carefully to avoid scratchy velcro

Best mini resistance bands
Fit Simplify Resistance Loop Exercise Bands
Share on Pinterest
“The first pieces of equipment I recommend for my clients are a set of mini
resistance bands
and dumbbells,” Barrons says. The Fit Simplify Resistance Loop Bands set includes five well-marked, color-coded resistance levels, so you can
intensify your workout
by switching up the bands.
This set includes an instruction booklet to get you started on resistance workouts ASAP. High quality rubber and a super small drawstring storage bag round out the features we love about this simple set — not to mention that it’s affordable AF.
On the downside, rubber resistance bands like these may roll when you do certain exercises, which can def get annoying for some.
Pros
convenient carrying case
5 color-coded resistance levels
high quality rubber
affordable
Cons
roll down occasionally
Shop now at Amazon
Best fabric resistance bands
Vergali Fabric Booty Bands
Share on Pinterest
Price:
$
The Vergali Fabric Booty Bands are 3.16 inches (in.) wide and feature latex covered in fabric to help prevent rolling. They’re pricier than rubber resistance bands, but they’re key for peeps mostly focused on building up
the lower body
since they don’t roll down as much.
This set comes with four resistance levels that are clearly marked with the weight of the resistance so you’re tuned in to how much you’re actually lifting. There’s also a training guide to get you started.
The biggest con for these is that a few reviewers say the bands get stretched out prematurely.
Pros
4 color-coded resistance levels
grippy latex on the inside
mesh carrying bag
training instructions
weight ranges printed on the bands
Cons
may stretch out over time
Shop now at Amazon
Best light dumbbells
BalanceFrom Dumbbell Set
Share on Pinterest
Price:
$$
If you prefer
traditional dumbbells
to an adjustable set, Barrons suggests buying a lightweight set like this one from BalanceFrom (along with a heavyweight set, which we’ve got a rec for below). This set includes 3-, 5-, and 8-lb. weights and a stand to hold ’em. The neoprene covers make the weights easy to grip and
outdoor workout
-friendly, since they won’t rust.
We like that this set includes a storage tree, but some reviewers say the stand is flimsy and breaks easily.
Pros
included storage tree
neoprene covers for indoor/outdoor use
great starter weights
Cons
questionable quality control on the stand
Shop now at Amazon
Best heavy dumbbells
Cap Coated Dumbbell Weight
Share on Pinterest
Price:
$–$$$$
The Cap Coated Dumbbell Weights are high quality and come in an impressive range of weights. You can choose anywhere from 3- to 120-lb. dumbbells, depending on your
fitness level and goals
. The textured grip is also key for keeping good control through each move.
On the downside, you have to buy the weights individually, and the heavier the weight, the higher the price. There’s also no storage tree, so you’ll have to keep these bad boys on the floor or buy a storage rack separately.
Pros
textured grip
stable hexagon shape
solid cast iron with rubber coating to prevent rust
wide range of weight options
Cons
have to buy weights individually
no storage tree
Shop now at Amazon
Best adjustable dumbbells
ATIVAFIT Adjustable Dumbbell Fitness Dial Dumbbell
Share on Pinterest
Price:
$$$
The ATIVAFIT Adjustable Dumbbell Fitness Dial Dumbbell offers better weight options and quality than some of the more popular
adjustable dumbbells
(we’re looking at you,
Bowflex
). The weight range alone is impressive — 5.5 to 71.5 lbs. per dumbbell. It includes a storage cradle to keep it from rolling around too.
On the downside, it’s pricey. And we do mean “it.” If you want two of these dumbbells, you’ll have to make sure to add two to the shopping cart, because they’re not sold as a set.
Pros
saves space
includes storage cradle
great weight range (5.5–71.5 lbs.)
quick-switch design
Cons
sold individually
pricey
Shop now at Amazon
Best budget adjustable dumbbells
Yes4All Adjustable Dumbbell
Share on Pinterest
Price:
$–$$$$
The Yes4All Adjustable Dumbbell offers lots of weight options at a price that won’t require you to
donate plasma
. It’s sold as a single dumbbell — which isn’t so cool — but buying two is still relatively affordable. If you’ve ever used a traditional barbell, collar, and
weight plates
, the design of this dumbbell will feel familiar. It also includes locking collars, so the plates won’t slam into your hand.
Pros
traditional weight design
locking collars
durable cast-iron plates
textured handle
Cons
sold individually
no storage tree
Shop now at Amazon
Best kettlebell
Kettle Gryp
Share on Pinterest
Price:
$
You’re probably saying, “Hey, that’s not
a kettlebell
.” Just wait. Remember how it’s a good idea to save space with your home equipment? The Kettle Gryp lets you use a dumbbell as a kettlebell. It’s cheaper than a kettlebell, and you can use it with different weights to increase or decrease the difficulty.
The only downside is that it doesn’t work with
every
dumbbell grip.
Pros
versatile
saves space
works with different dumbbell weights
affordable
Cons
may not fit all dumbbell grips
Shop now at Amazon
Best suspension system
TRX GO Suspension Trainer System
Share on Pinterest
Price:
$$
Suspension training
has gained popularity as people have looked for new workout equipment for small spaces. The
TRX Go Suspension Trainer System
stands out for quality and user-friendliness, both of which are musts for a good suspension trainer. You can hang it on a tree or a door or use anchors. Locking loops and a single anchor make it easy to set up at home.
Suspension training goes easy on your joints, and you can adjust the moves to different fitness levels. Even TRX newbies can get a serious workout. You can also pack it up and take it with you
on the road
.
But it can take some time to figure out the exercises. Take it slow and give yourself time to learn how to use it correctly — it’ll be worth it, we promise.
Pros
easy on the joints
adjustable to different fitness levels
lightweight and portable
total-body workout
well made
Cons
may require separately sold anchors
takes practice to use correctly

Best folding squat rack
Rogue RML-3W Fold Back Wall Mount Rack
Share on Pinterest
Price:
$$$$
A
folding squat rack
is an amazing addition to any home gym — especially if you’re looking to get into heavier-duty
weightlifting
.
This one from Rogue is made from high quality materials but won’t completely drain your bank account. It can hold up to 1,000 lbs. (which we can all agree is plenty).
It comes with a pull-up bar and J-hooks to hold your barbell. It’s also compatible with 88 different accessories — so you can basically use it as a starter to a fully stocked home gym.
The best part? It folds away to a less than 5-inch depth when you’re not using it.
Reviewers love how sturdy and simple the rack is. They say it shipped super quickly and is hella easy to install.
Pros
high quality materials
folds away to 5 inches when you’re not using it
compatible with 88 different accessories
holds up to 1,000 lbs.
easy to install
Cons
still need to purchase barbells and weight plates

Best barbell
Rogue The Ohio Bar
Share on Pinterest
Price:
$$$$
Pair your new squat rack with one of Rogue’s best-selling
barbells
— the Ohio Bar.
The brand manufactures
this barbell
in the US of A (in Ohio, if you couldn’t tell). It’s made with high quality stainless steel and has a lifetime warranty to back it up.
It’s designed for Olympic and
Powerlifting
, with knurling (aka rough texture) to give you a better grip.
Many reviewers say this is one of the best additions to their home gyms. They love how high quality it feels and appreciate that the knurling gives some grip without being super uncomfortable (and even painful).
Pros
high quality stainless steel
designed for Olympic and Powerlifting
knurling allows for better grip
amazing reviews
lifetime warranty
Cons
expensive

Best weight plates
Rogue HG 2.0 Bumper Plates
Share on Pinterest
Price:
$$$$
You have your squat rack and your barbell — now it’s time for some
weight plates
.
We recommend going for a pair of
bumper plates
for your home gym. They’re typically made from rubber and are designed to be dropped without breaking the plate (or your floors!).
These bumper plates are sold in pairs up to 1,000 lbs. They’re made from recycled rubber and have a stainless steel center. This combo helps reduce bounce and noise and increases durability.
Reviewers LOVE these plates. Many say the quality for the price is unmatched. They also love the way these look in their home gyms.
Just keep in mind that bumper plates tend to take up a lot of space. They’re great if you’ve got a designated garage gym, but they’re def not super easy to stash away when you’re not using them.
Pros
designed to bounce without breaking
durable
sold as pairs or sets
good quality for price
Cons
take up a lot of space

Best weight bench
ProForm Carbon Strength Adjustable Bench
Share on Pinterest
Price:
$$$
Whether you’re looking to do step-ups, Bulgarian split squats,
tricep dips
, or incline/decline
dumbbell workouts
, a
weight bench
adds a whole lot of spice to your average workout.
We love this bench from ProForm because it’s made with high quality, durable materials for a great price.
It can hold up to 610 lbs. (you + whatever
dumbbells
you’re using) and has anti-slip rubber feet to keep it in place. It also has 6 adjustable seat positions and 11 adjustable back positions.
There aren’t a ton of reviews, but the few that exist say the bench is super easy to assemble. They’re also v satisfied with the quality.
Pros
adjustable to incline, decline, military, and flat positions
wheels for easy transport
easy to assemble
anti-slip rubber feet
affordable
Cons
not a ton of reviews

Best pull-up bar
JFIT Deluxe Multi Exercise Doorway Pull-Up Bar
Share on Pinterest
Price:
$
Not enough room for a full-on
squat rack
but want to do pull-ups at home? A doorway
pull-up bar
like this one could be the perf solution.
It’s way sturdier than your average doorway pull-up bar because you install it with hardware. When you don’t use it, you store away the bar and the hardware still allows you to use your doorway as usual.
It has a weight capacity of 300 lbs. and can be installed basically anywhere that it fits. Some reviewers use it in a hallway instead of a doorway.
Pros
sturdier than traditional doorway pull-up bars
affordable
easy to install and use
300-lb. weight capacity
Cons
some reviewers complain of doorway damage

Best home workout cardio equipment
Best treadmill
ProForm Pro 9000 Treadmill
Share on Pinterest
Price:
$$$$
Barrons says, “If you live somewhere where the weather won’t be reliable for getting
cardio in outside year-round
, a
home treadmill
… would really be worth the investment.”
We’re big fans of
ProForm treadmills
because they bring the right balance of quality and price. This treadmill in particular has all of the smart features you love to see in a high-end treadmill — like a 22-inch touch screen, Bluetooth connectivity, and connected fitness options (helllllo iFit!) — at a reasonable price.
We also love that trainers can automatically change your speed and incline based on the class you’re taking. Pretty fricken cool, right?
To top it off, this treadmill is easy to fold up to save space when you’re not using it. It also has a great maximum weight capacity (300 lbs.), speed (12 miles per hour), and incline (-3 to 12%) making this particular model a great pick for runners at any level.
Pros
Bluetooth connectivity
works with iFit subscription
22-inch display
12-miles per hour maximum speed
-3 to 12% incline
sturdy folding build saves space
Cons
difficult to turn on without signing up for an iFit subscription

Best exercise bike
Bowflex C6 Bike
Share on Pinterest
Price:
$$$$
Running isn’t for everyone. If you’re more of a
cycling person
, the Bowflex C6 Bike might be more your thing. “I recently invested in the
Bowflex C6 Bike
and am loving it,” says Barrons. That’s high praise from a pro.
The C6 brings a smooth ride with magnetic resistance. While it doesn’t have a built-in screen, the cradle fits most devices, and the bike offers Bluetooth connectivity and works with a variety of apps (including
Peloton
— but with limited functionality). We also love the toe clips so you can work your legs on the up and down strokes.
This bike is pricey, but it’s an investment worth making
if you love indoor cycling
.
Pros
comfortable, smooth, quiet ride
includes toe clips
built-in weight cradles
Bluetooth connectivity
magnetic resistance
Cons
expensive
need tablet or a Chrome-enabled device to get the most out of the bike

Best budget cardio machine
Sunny Health & Fitness Squat Assist Row-N-Ride Trainer
Share on Pinterest
Price:
$$
Get some cardio and killer buns on the same machine! Using the Sunny Health & Fitness Squat Assist Row-N-Ride is like doing
squats on fat-burning steroids
. This cardio workout will seriously mold and
sculpt your backside
, and the price is amazing.
It has great adjustability in the seat, handlebars, and squat depth for a machine at this price. That depth adjustment is particularly important, so you won’t injure your knees or hips. The Row-N-Ride includes three resistance bands to adjust the difficulty level. You have to change them manually, which we don’t love — but hey, it’s cheap.
Pros
inexpensive
surprisingly effective workout
adjustable seat
adjustable handlebar positions
adjustable squat depth
Cons
manual resistance adjustment

Best elliptical
NordicTrack FS10i Elliptical
Share on Pinterest
Price:
$$$$
Ellipticals
are the bomb for getting a
low impact workout
without sacrificing intensity.
We love this one from NordicTrack because it’s got tons of awesome features. Depending on your mood, you can use it as a traditional elliptical, a stair stepper, or a
treadmill
(wait, what?!). The brand says all you need to do is adjust your natural motion and the machine adjusts with you.
With 24 resistance levels and up to a 10 percent incline, you’re basically guaranteed a tough workout. And with a 10-inch touch screen and tons of iFit classes to choose from, you’re less likely to get totally bored of it too.
Reviewers love how smooth it rides and say it’s an amazing low impact alternative to
running
. They also appreciate how motivating iFit classes are — it’s supposedly MUCH better than using any old elliptical at the gym.
Pros
3-in-1 machines (elliptical, stair stepper, treadmill)
low impact cardio workout
iFit compatible
24 resistance levels and 10% incline
Cons
takes up a lot of space

Best jump rope
Froning SR-1F Speed Rope 2.0
Share on Pinterest
Price:
$
Do cardio old-school with
a jump rope
. If you haven’t jumped rope for a while, be prepared to poop out pretty quick. The Froning SR-1F Speed Rope 2.0 is a great option for
you CrossFitters
who are working on your double-unders. But it’s not just for seasoned athletes — it’s got easy-to-hold handles, an adjustable cable, and smooth movement that beginners can appreciate too.
But you can’t use this jump rope on an abrasive surface like pavement, because it can wear out the cable. So, grass works, carpet works, but if you’re jumping in your garage, you’ll need a rubber mat to protect the cable.
Pros
strong, flexible polyurethane cable
high speed bearings
adjustable cable length
Cons
only for use on nonabrasive surfaces

Best punching bag
Dripex Freestanding Punching Bag
Share on Pinterest
Price:
$$$
The Dripex Freestanding
Punching Bag
stands strong while you
hit, kick, and elbow
your way to a stronger body. A base that holds sand or water (sand is typically sturdier) provides the counterweight, but it’s further stabilized by 12 suction cups on the bottom. The only bummer is that the suction cups need a relatively smooth surface to maintain full suction.
A high quality leather cover, stainless steel tube-covered EPE foam, and fabric buffers make this thing durable enough to take a
daily beating
. Plus, shock absorbers and springs help reduce noise. You can even remove the springs to do more intense strength training if you want.
Reviewers say filling the base isn’t the easiest because of the small fill hole, but once it’s done, you’re good to get punching.
Pros
high quality leather cover
shock-absorbing design
suction cup stabilizers
stands 69 in. high, working well for adults and teens
sturdy, especially when the base is filled with sand
Cons
small fill hole on the base
suction cups don’t work on all surfaces

Best all-in-one home gym
Tonal
Share on Pinterest
Price:
$$$$
The
Tonal
is a smart gym that works kind of like a cable press machine — but
smarter
.
The gym mounts to a wall and has two arms that you can attach different accessories to, including handles, a bar, and a rope.
It uses digital weight to adjust the tension up to 200 lbs. You can configure the arms in multiple ways to do
upper body
,
lower body
, and
core exercises
.
Bring the arms toward the floor and you can use the bar attachment to do back
squats
, bent over rows, or
bicep curls
. Set them toward the ceiling and you can do lat pulldowns, upright rows, or
tricep
pushdowns. Use the bench accessory and you can do bench presses and Bulgarian split squats.
The Tonal has tons of
strength
,
yoga
,
cardio
, and
HIIT
classes to choose from and 17 different sensors to detect your form.
Reviewers are overall obsessed with the Tonal. Some say it’s louder than they expected and definitely pricey — but most see it as an amazing investment.
Pros
can do lower body, upper body, and core exercises
connected fitness with live and on-demand classes
sensors detect and suggest corrections for form
up to 200 lbs. of digital weight resistance
Cons
expensive

MIRROR

bodyweight and dumbbell workouts
but still want to dive into the
smart mirror
world, Lululemon’s MIRROR is where it’s at.
You can choose from
boxing
,
Pilates
, Tai Chi, sculpt, stretch, bodyweight workouts, and more. And with over 10,000 classes to choose from and new live classes every day, MIRROR is great for people that crave variety.

Reviewers are super satisfied. Many say it has enough variety that it works for the whole family. Others say it’s made them quit the gym completely.
Pros
great for bodyweight and dumbbell workouts
discreet
tons of variety
freestanding or wall-mounted
Cons
expensive
not great for people who want to lift heavier weights

How to choose the right home workout equipment for you
Strength, cardio, or both?
First things first: Nail down what kind of workout you want to focus on at home. If you get plenty of cardio on your outdoor runs, maybe you just need to focus on strength training at home. If you attend in-studio Pilates, barre, or yoga classes, it might make sense to focus more on at-home cardio. Everyone’s needs are different.
If you’re looking to do resistance training, it’s a good idea to focus more on weights and resistance bands.
“The adjustable dumbbell sets are a great way to have lots of weight options without taking up a ton of space, but if you prefer regular dumbbells, a lighter pair (5 to 10 lbs.) and a heavier pair (15 to 30 lbs.) is a great place to start,” suggests Barrons.
Barrons also recommends using resistance bands to make exercises harder before moving up in weight.
If you’re more focused on cardio, make sure you pick an option that’ll keep you coming back for more as often as possible. “Cardio is the first thing that I might skip, so having an easy, fun option at home makes it the [less likely] that will happen!” says Barrons.
Workouts you like
Boxing,
suspension training, and pull-ups aren’t for everyone. Tailor your home gym to your workout preferences — and don’t forget the battle with boredom. It pays to have a few different types of workout equipment around to spice up your routine. You’ll start skipping if your workouts become a yawn fest.
Size and storage
While there are a couple of behemoths on this list, we looked for space-optimizing equipment where we could, like
a foldable treadmill
, adjustable kettlebells and weights, and suspension trainers.
If you have room for bigger cardio machines, go for it! But if not, look for equipment with a smaller footprint that can still give you a killer cardio workout, like
a jump rope
or punching bag.
Injury prevention and comfort
Some equipment is worth having around to keep your body in working order. A foam roller, for example, can relax muscles and keep injuries at bay. A
good yoga mat
can cushion your joints while you’re doing floor work or stretching. Whatever helps
keep your body working
at its best belongs among your home workout equipment.
The bottom line
With home workout equipment, you can keep your body in tip-top shape without traveling to the gym to work out with 100 sweaty strangers. You can invest in larger equipment or start small with a few dumbbells and resistance bands.
No matter your workout style or budget, there’s equipment out there to keep you challenged and invested in your training routine.

The best 20-minute at-home workout for beginners
We talked with
Bryant D. Edwards

These moves can help you build muscle and endurance as you get started.
bridge
knee push-up
side-lying hip abduction
wall squat
straight-leg donkey kick
FYI:
It’s important to talk with your doctor before starting a brand-new workout routine.

20-minute at-home workout for beginners
In a hurry to see some results? Here’s a workout for newbies that takes only about 20 minutes.
1. Bridge
The
bridge
will boost your booty all over. It works your gluteus maximus, medius,
and
minimus muscles. It’ll also help get your
heart rate
up before you move on to more challenging exercises.
Share on Pinterest
How to do it:
Lie flat on your back.
Bend your knees and plant feet flat on the floor.
Extend arms at your sides and press palms into the floor.
Push your feet into the floor and raise your hips until your body forms a straight line from knees to shoulders.
Squeeze glutes and hold for a few seconds.
Return to the starting position.
Do 3 sets of 10 reps.
Pro tip:
Place a folded towel under your neck for extra support. You can also use a
yoga mat
to make things a little more comfy.
2. Knee push-up
This is a great way to build strength and
stamina
as you work your way up to classic
push-ups
. It targets your pecs, core,
shoulders
, and arms.
How to do it:
Start on hands and knees, keeping spine aligned and hands shoulder-width apart.
Bend elbows to a 45-degree angle as you lower your body toward the floor.
Push your palms into the floor to raise yourself back up.
Do 3 sets of 8–10 reps.
Pro tip:
Keep your shins on the floor to take some pressure off your
knees
.
3. Side-lying hip abduction
This one is
all in the hips
. The movements will help loosen tight muscles and strengthen your sides.
Share on Pinterest
How to do it:
Lie on your right side with your legs stacked. (You can bend your right leg for more support.)
Lift left leg up, then lower it toward the floor.
Repeat this motion.
Switch sides.
Shoot for 3 sets of 10 reps on each side.
Pro tip:
Add
ankle weights
or a
resistance band
if you want to kick it up a notch.
4. Wall squat
You’ll feel the burn in your
abs
, glutes, calves, and quads with this move. Wall squats can also help you learn to focus on your form and increase your stamina.
Share on Pinterest
How to do it:
Press your back flat against a wall.
Press your feet firmly into the floor, shoulder-width apart, about 2 feet in front of the wall.
Bend your knees until they’re at a 90-degree angle. Keep your back pressed into the wall.
Hold this position for up to 1 minute at a time.
Slowly return to the starting position.
Pro tip:
Try placing a
stability ball
behind your back. It can increase your range of motion while reducing your risk of injury.
5. Straight-leg donkey kick
This
bootylicious
exercise will help strengthen and tone your glutes. It also adds some sweet
shoulder
action into the mix.
Share on Pinterest
How to do it:
Start on all fours, with knees under hips and hands under shoulders.
Extend left leg straight behind you, keeping your foot flexed and toes pointed down toward the floor.
Return to the starting position.
Repeat on the other side.
Do 3 sets of 10 reps on each side.
Pro tip:
Remember to keep your spine aligned and glutes engaged.
How to build a workout that works for you
Finding your dream routine can take time. And that’s OK! Fitness isn’t one-size-fits-all. It’s all about finding the right balance and tools that work for you. Here are some ways you can personalize your workouts.
1. Add weights
Adding weights to your workout isn’t just bomb for how your bod looks. Pumping iron can
increase endorphins
and boost self-esteem.
Bonus:
Research
suggests that a steady strengthening routine can help you get a better night of
shut-eye
.
2. Pick your muscle groups
There are lots of perks of a
full-body workout
. But some folks see better results when they target one or two specific muscle groups at a time. This also gives your other muscles time to recover.
3. Join the resistance
Resistance bands are designed with
compound exercises
in mind. That means they can help engage your stabilizing muscles and improve the overall quality of your workouts. They also get major brownie points for being so
lightweight and portable
.
4.
Grab your gear
You don’t need to spend big bucks on a brand-new #FitLife wardrobe. You just need a solid pair of
sneakers
and some breathable, supportive
clothing
.
Tips for exercise newbies
Working out isn’t just about gains. Health and safety should always come first. Here are some tips to keep your workouts as safe and effective as possible:
Set realistic goals.
You won’t see huge results overnight, fam. “Too often people set a goal that sounds good because it’s what society is telling us we should strive for, but in reality it is so far off what we really want for ourselves,” Edwards says. So take your time as you transition into your training.
Drink up.
Studies
suggest that staying hydrated during a sweat sesh can help you maintain performance, lower your heart rate, and keep your fluid levels on fleek.
Fuel smart.
Try to eat 2–3 hours before your workout. Some delicious and nutritious choices:
Greek yogurt with oats
,
brown rice
with grilled chicken, or a
protein smoothie
.
Consistency is key.
According to Edwards, consistency is more important than any specific program. “If you can find an activity you enjoy and will consistently do, you’ll be more likely to keep up with it rather than constantly starting and stopping,” he says.
The importance of good form
Proper form can make or break your workout. Sloppy stances increase your risk of injury and reduce the effectiveness of each exercise.
Here are some tips to keep your form 10/10:
If it hurts, STOP.
This isn’t the time to push it to the limit.
Focus on each movement.
Tweak your position if something feels awkward.
Ease into it.
Research
suggests that keeping a slow and steady training pace can reduce your risk of injury.
Get your blood flowing.
Make sure you do a
warmup
before you start your workout. And don’t forget the
cooldown
!
P.S. It’s OK to ask for help! Most gyms have personal trainers on hand. You can also reach out to a fitness pro via
Zoom
if you want to stick to an at-home routine.
tl;dr
This 20-minute workout routine is designed for folks who are new to fitness. It’ll help you build a fantastic foundation for your future fitness goals. Just remember that results take time. If you stick with the program, you’ll def notice a difference. You’ve got this!

Before you start
Bodyweight moves
With weights
tl;dr
When it comes to bodyweight abs exercises, crunches aren’t the be-all and tense-all.
In fact, some research has shown that the classic crunch may not even be that effective, since it doesn’t activate all of your core muscle
.
Whether you want to build strength for that elusive pull-up or are just after the opportunity to show off a six-pack (hey, no judgment!), there are more effective exercises than endless crunches.

From plank variations to weighted exercises, these moves from
Tone House
head coach
Evan Betts
will totally change the way you think about working your midsection.
It won’t even feel like you’re specifically targeting your abdominals, but you’ll still be engaging your core for abs-olutely abs-tonishing results (sorry, not sorry).
How to use this list
Depending on your fitness level, Betts suggests picking two or three of the moves below and slotting them into a workout routine that takes the following shape:
Perform each move for 60 seconds (or for the number of reps indicated) Rest for 20 seconds.
Perform the next move.
At the end of all three moves, rest for up to 60 seconds.
Repeat the circuit.
Get through 3 or 4 rounds total.
Bodyweight moves
With these moves, you need nothing but your bod and sheer willpower.
1. High knees
Share on Pinterest
Imagine running, but to nowhere? With your knees going really high? If this sounds self-defeating, think again.
Stand with your feet hip-width apart, being sure to engage your core and keep your back straight.
Hold your arms steady, or swing them to help with momentum.
Run in place, drawing each knee as high as possible toward your chest, and using your lower abs to pull your knees high. (Think sprint, not jog.)
Go as fast as you can for 60 seconds.
If you’re experiencing a bit of knee pain but you want to give this a try, these
yoga poses for knee pain
can help loosen up your joints.
2. Tuck jump
Share on Pinterest
Bounce, bunny, bounce! This workout really keeps you on your toes.
Stand with your feet hip-width apart, your core engaged, and, yep, you guessed it, a straight back.
Send the hips back, bend your knees slightly, and bend your elbows at 90 degrees with your palms facing downward.
In one explosive movement (POW!), jump up and draw your knees toward your chest, so they tap your downturned palms.
Land lightly on your toes, with a slight bend in your knees, and immediately jump up again.
Jump for 60 seconds.
Jumping can be a great addition to any workout plan — here’s our guide to
mastering the vertical jump
.
3. Plank walk
Share on Pinterest
What ‘arm could it do?
Start off in a high plank position.
Lower onto your right forearm, then your left forearm. You’ll now be in a forearm plank.
Return to the starting position by pushing up from your left forearm to your left hand, then from your right forearm to your right hand.
Continue for 60 seconds.
At the 30-second mark, switch to leading with your other arm.
Here are
47 ways
to mix up your planks that will give you an insane core.
4. Plank jack
Share on Pinterest
Like a jumping jack without the jumping, and with more planking.
Start in a high plank position.
With your core braced, jump both feet apart wider than hip width. Now quickly jump them back together. Try to land softly on your toes each time (because who likes a broken toe?).
Focus on keeping your hips steady and your arms straight.
Continue for 60 seconds.
More into jacks of the “jumping” variety? Here’s
how to nail them
.
5. Plank arms walk-out
Share on Pinterest
Hey, I’m plank-walkin’ here!
Start in a high plank position.
Slowly walk your hands forward, so that your wrists are no longer under your shoulders and your body is extended.
Walk your hands as far forward as possible.
Pause at the farthest point for a moment before walking your hands back to the starting position.
Continue to repeat for up to 60 seconds.
If you’re more into working out with friends, here’s how to
incorporate someone else
into your exercise.
6. High-plank bird dog
Share on Pinterest
Because it’s a dog-tweet-dog world out there.
Start in a high plank position.
Brace your core and raise your right hand and left foot off the ground, like a traditional bird dog.
Return to the starting position and repeat this motion on the other side of your body.
Do 10 reps on each side.
We found a 7-minute workout that can
change your ab game
forever.
7. Scorpion
Share on Pinterest
This one stings, but it will get the job done.
Start on all fours.
Brace your core, come to the tips of your toes, and shift your weight to the right side of your body.
Pick your left hand and foot off the ground, allowing your right hand and foot to shift, so you come into a faceup position.
Lift your right hand and left foot off the ground. With your left leg extended, crunch your torso together to tap your right hand to your left toes.
Return to all fours.
Repeat on the other side, without letting your hips hit the ground at any time.
Continue for 10 reps on each side.
Push-ups more your bag? Try these
82 advanced variations
to get your arms (and blood) pumping.
8. Spider-man push-up
Share on Pinterest
(Disclaimer: You don’t get to swing from any tall buildings after trying this.)
Start in a high plank position.
Engage your core and bring your right knee forward toward the right elbow, turning your hip out and your inner thigh parallel to the floor.
As your right knee comes forward, bend your arms and lower yourself into a push-up.
Return to the starting position and repeat the exercise on the other side.
Do 10 reps on each side.
Make it easier:
Skip the push-up. Instead, hold a high plank throughout and focus on squeezing your obliques to
engage your core
.
9. Body saw
Share on Pinterest
You’ll need a small towel or you can
find a set of sliders online
for this move.
Start in a forearm plank with your toes on the towel/sliders.
With your core engaged, slide your body forward, bringing your shoulders as far forward as possible past your elbows.
Then slide back, allowing your shoulders to shift behind your elbows. Continue to move back and forth for 60 seconds.
Make it easier:
Do a
mountain climber
or wide-leg mountain climber instead.
10. Dragon flag
Share on Pinterest
This move is absolutely fire. And feels like it too.
Find an anchor to hold onto with your arms extended overhead. You could use a chair, bench, or closed door. (We used a floor anchor in the GIF above.)
Lie face-up with your knees bent.
Shifting your weight into your shoulders, engage your core and lift your feet overhead, like a shoulder stand.
Try to keep your legs as straight as possible.
Lower your legs, without allowing them to touch the floor, then repeat.
Do 3 to 5 slow, controlled reps.
Important note:
Do not perform this exercise if you have pre-existing shoulder issues. Once in shoulder stand, look straight ahead, never side-to-side, to protect your neck from injury.
(If your neck does hurt a little, here are
the best pillows
money can buy.)
Weighted moves
For when you wanna get hot and heavy.
11. Single-arm farmer’s walk
Share on Pinterest
This isn’t your average walk in the park (or farm).
Grab a heavy weight, such as a dumbbell, kettlebell, or sandbag (as shown).
Stand with your feet hip-width apart, your core engaged, and your back straight.
Holding the weight in your right hand, walk forward about 10 feet (or for about 30 seconds).
When you turn back, switch the weight to your opposite hand.
Make it harder:
Amp up the challenge by walking backward (carefully!) or by stopping halfway through the walk and holding for a few seconds before continuing. Sheesh!
When lifting weights, it’s super important to build up slowly. Here’s the know-how on
picking your weight
.
12. Medicine ball halo
Share on Pinterest
🎤
“You hit me like a meeeeeeedicine ball…”
🎤
Shop for a
medicine ball
(as shown),
dumbbell
, or
kettlebell
online.
Hold the weight with both your hands at chest height.
Make a big circle around your upper body. Keep your knees soft and your core engaged and steady throughout.
Repeat for 30 seconds in one direction, then reverse direction for another 30 seconds.
We found
25 more ways
a medicine ball can rock your world.
13. Resistance band rotation
Share on Pinterest
Look for a
resistance band
or cable machine for this exercise. Be sure to only use light resistance to protect your spine.
Stand with your left side toward the band anchor.
With your hands shoulder-width apart, elbows at 90 degrees, and palms down, use your core to pull away from the band anchor.
Slowly, return to the starting position — it’s important not to snap back into place.
Do 15 to 20 reps, then repeat on the other side.
Resistance bands are brilliant. We rounded up
33 great resistance band exercises
to help tone every part of your body.
14. Renegade row
Share on Pinterest
Become a renegade master…
Start in high plank position with a dumbbell close to your right hand.
Keep your body straight and your core engaged as you lift the dumbbell with your right hand.
Perform a row, keeping your arm close to your side and your elbow in line with your rib cage as you lift the dumbbell toward your ribs.
Lower the dumbbell to its starting position. Repeat the move for 30 seconds, then switch sides for another 30 seconds.
Rowing is absolutely boss when you do it right.
Here
‘s how to make sure you’re never up a creek without a paddle.
Takeaway
Wait, what’s a crunch again?
There are moves for every ability level here, and ways to edge up to the more difficult ones. So, if these seem intimidating at first, there’s always a way to make them accessible and give them a try.
We looked a little deeper into
the world of crunches
and whether they provide the complete picture for ab strength (spoiler alert: they don’t).

Leg Up Your Home Workout: 15 Leg Exercises, 3 Ways
Medically reviewed by
Jake Tipane, CPT

Written by
Dana Pitman, RD
—
Updated on September 12, 2024
Leg workouts with dumbbells
Bodyweight leg workouts
Resistance band leg workouts
The takeaway
Discover effective leg workouts at home to build strength and mobility without a gym. From weighted exercises to bodyweight moves and resistance band routines, these plans fit any space and equipment you have.
When the gym’s not an option, don’t let lack of equipment or space deter you from getting a great leg
workout
. Keeping your leg muscles strong is key to getting from point A to point B and busting out those killer dance moves you’ve been showing off at
Club Quarantine
.
Share on Pinterest
Whether you have a complete home gym, a few weights to play with, or just a room and an exercise mat, you can program your own “Leg Day: Home Edition.”
With the help of Mathew Forzaglia, an NYC-based fitness pro and the creator of
Forzag Fitness
, we’ve put together three leg workout plans you can do completely at home.
Creating your at-home leg day
Throughout these
routines
you’ll find a few staple movements — including squats, deadlifts, and lunges — with variations. Forzaglia notes that these exercises target the major leg muscles in your glutes, hamstrings, and quads for a well-rounded leg workout.
Because we don’t move in just one direction, it’s important to train your muscles in more than one direction.
Compound exercises
work multiple muscles at the same time, which saves time and burns more calories.
By incorporating weights, resistance bands, and bodyweight moves, you can build strength and mobility to support your everyday movements (and your dance moves).
Forzaglia recommends doing a leg-focused routine two or three times per week to allow time for muscle recovery while continuing to
build strength
. You can adjust the number of reps and amount of weight used to fit your
individual ability
and fitness level.
Leg workouts with weights
Forzaglia calls this the “any object” leg workout because, well, you can use just about any object that adds weight without compromising your form.
If you have dumbbells or kettlebells, grab ’em. If not, grab some soup cans, a bottle of laundry detergent, or even a weighted backpack — get
creative
!
1. Goblet squat: 3 sets of 12 reps
Share on Pinterest
Image by Dima Bazak
How-to:
Holding the weight or object in front of your chest, stand with feet just outside hip width. Drive hips back and then down, as if sitting in a chair. Keep chest up and focus on your hips breaking below your knee crease. Push into heels, squeeze glutes (your booty!), and stand back up.
Muscles targeted:
Quads and glutes
2. Pendulum lunges: 3 sets of 10 reps on each leg
Share on Pinterest
Image by Dima Bazak
How-to:
Hold the weight or object in front of your chest. Lunge forward with right leg, keeping left leg stationary until the reps are done.
Keeping your weight in your right heel, push out of heel to stand up and immediately step into a reverse lunge with right leg in the back. Complete all reps on one side before switching legs.
Muscles targeted:
Glutes, hamstrings, and calves (plus the challenge of balance and core stabilization!)
3. Romanian deadlifts: 3 sets of 12 reps
Share on Pinterest
Image by Dima Bazak
How-to:
Standing tall with feet under hips, hold weights by your sides in both hands (or hold onto the handle of a broom or mop like a barbell).
Bend knees slightly, and then hinge at your hips. Keeping core engaged, drive hips back until you feel a stretch in your hamstrings. Squeeze glutes and return to standing.
Muscles targeted:
Hamstrings, glutes, core, and upper back
4. Step-ups: 3 sets of 10 reps on each leg
Share on Pinterest
Image by Dima Bazak
How-to:
Find a stool, bench, or box you can step on (the first step of a staircase can work, too, but will be a little short).
Hold one weight at your chest and lift right foot, placing it on the box. Keeping chest up and right shin vertical, push into right heel and step up onto the box. Maintain control as you return to the starting position.
If you don’t have a box or other object to step onto: Start kneeling, step your right foot forward, and stand up. Then return to the kneeling position.
Muscles targeted:
Glutes and hamstrings (Your calves, core and lower back muscles will also engage to keep proper form.)
5. Weighted hip bridges: 3 sets of 12 reps
Share on Pinterest
Image by Dima Bazak
How-to:
Lie on your back with knees bent and feet flat on the floor. You should be able to touch your heels with your fingertips. Hold a dumbbell, kettlebell, or other item in front of your hips.
Brace core, squeeze glutes, push into heels, and lift your hips until shoulders, hips, and knees are in a line. Slowly lower your hips back to the floor.
Muscles targeted:
Glutes, hamstrings, hip adductors, core, and obliques
Leg workouts using body weight
For this workout you need nothing more than your own bod. Don’t sleep on
bodyweight workouts
— they can be
just as effective
at building muscle, strength, and endurance. Plus, they’re fantastic for mobility and stability.
1. Air squats or jump squats: 3 sets of 10 reps
Share on Pinterest
Image by Dima Bazak
How-to:
Stand with feet just outside hip width. Drive hips back and then down. Keep chest up and focus on your hips breaking below your knee crease. Push into heels to stand (or jump back up — jumping increases the intensity and the calorie burn).
Muscles targeted:
Quads, hamstrings, lower back, and core
2. Hip bridges: 3 sets of 12 reps
Share on Pinterest
Image by Dima Bazak
How-to:
Lie on your back with knees bent and feet flat on the floor. You should be able to touch your heels with your fingertips.
Brace core, squeeze glutes, push into heels, and lift your hips until shoulders, hips, and knees are in a line. Slowly lower your hips back to the floor.
Muscles targeted:
Glutes, hamstrings, hip adductors, core, and obliques
3. Reverse lunges or jumping lunges: 3 sets of 10 reps
Share on Pinterest
Image by Dima Bazak
How-to:
Start standing. Step your left foot back into a lunge, keeping right foot flat, right shin vertical, and chest up. Step left foot forward and repeat on the right.
For a jumping lunge, explode up quickly from the bottom of the lunge, switching your feet in the air and controlling your landing. This more advanced jumping version adds a cardiovascular and stability challenge.
Muscles targeted:
Quads, glutes, hamstrings, calves, core, and hip stabilizing muscles
4. Single-leg deadlifts: 3 sets of 15 reps on each leg
Share on Pinterest
Image by Dima Bazak
How-to:
Start with left foot planted on the floor. Hinging at your hips, with a slight bend in left knee, reach arms forward and push right foot back. Focus on keeping hips and shoulders in one line. Flex your back ankle and press your heel toward the wall behind you. Squeeze glutes and drive right leg forward to return to the starting position.
Muscles targeted:
Hamstrings, glutes, ankles, and core
5. Step-ups: 3 sets of 15 reps on each leg
Share on Pinterest
Image by Dima Bazak
How-to:
If you have a bench or box to step on, lift right foot and place it on the box. Keeping chest up and right shin vertical, push into right heel and step up onto the box. Maintain control as you return to the starting position.
If you don’t have a box or other object to step onto: Start kneeling, step your right foot forward, and stand up. Then return to the kneeling position.
Muscles targeted:
Glutes, hamstrings, calves, and core
Leg workouts using a resistance band
For this workout you need only a
resistance band
. Working out with resistance bands can be particularly helpful if you’re a strength training newbie or if you’re
recovering
from an injury.
If you have multiple bands, feel free to play with the resistance. Depending on your strength and ability level, you may be able to handle extra resistance with certain movements.
1. Banded step-outs: 3 sets of 10 reps on each leg
Share on Pinterest
Image by Dima Bazak
How-to:
Place the band right below your knees. Squat your hips back and keep chest up. Keeping feet outside your hips, step right foot out and then back in. Repeat on the left side.
Pro tip:
A resistance band can be worn at the ankles at a lower resistance, but it should be above the ankle if it’s a higher resistance. Placing your resistance band around the ankles can increase knee strain and risk of injury.
Muscles targeted:
Glutes, hip flexors, calves, hamstrings, and quads
2. Banded air squats: 3 sets of 12 reps
Share on Pinterest
Image by Dima Bazak
How-to:
Place the band right above your knees. Stand with feet just outside hip width. Drive hips back and then down, as if sitting in a chair. Keep chest up and focus on your hips breaking below your knee crease. Push into heels, squeeze glutes, and stand back up.
Muscles targeted:
Glutes, hip abductors, and quads
3. Banded single-leg Romanian deadlift: 3 sets of 15 reps on each leg
Share on Pinterest
Image by Dima Bazak
How-to:
Start with left foot planted on the floor. Hold one end of the band in right hand and place the band under your left foot.
Hinging at your hips, with a slight bend in left knee, push right foot back. Focus on keeping hips and shoulders in line with back heel. Flex your back ankle and press your heel toward the wall behind you. Squeeze glutes and drive right leg forward to return to the starting position.
Muscles targeted:
Glutes, hamstrings, hips, and core
4. ISO banded hip bridge knee drive-out: 3 sets of 15 reps
Share on Pinterest
Image by Dima Bazak
How-to:
Place the band right above your knees. Lie on your back with knees bent and feet flat on the floor. You should be able to touch your heels with your fingertips. Brace core, squeeze glutes, push into heels, and lift your hips until shoulders, hips, and knees are in a line.
At the top of the bridge, pulse your knees out and back in. Slowly lower your hips back to the floor.
Muscles targeted:
Glutes, hamstrings, hip adductors, core, and obliques
5. Touchdown jacks: 3 sets of 12 reps (alternating sides)
Share on Pinterest
Image by Dima Bazak
How-to:
Stand tall, with the band right below your knees. Drive knees out like you’re doing a jumping jack into a squat, placing feet outside hips. Push your hips back and touch the floor with left hand.
Jump your feet back in and repeat the movement, touching the floor with right hand. Repeat until reps are complete.
Muscles targeted:
Core, glutes, and calves
The bottom line
Forzaglia recommends performing a leg routine for 4 to 6 weeks for maximum benefits and results. It’s important to keep adding challenging movements to continue building muscle.
Whether you’re using weighted objects, your body weight, or a resistance band, these exercise routines can help build strength and endurance in your legs. For optimal leg gains, try to incorporate all three types of training into your weekly routine.
It’s also helpful to check in with a certified fitness pro, especially if you’re new to the strength training game. This can help ensure you’re doing the best exercises for your body, ability level, and goals.

Looking to build strong arms without hitting the gym? Discover effective arm workouts at home that might help you tone and strengthen your upper body. From bodyweight exercises to using household items, get started today.
Whether you’re just bored hanging at home or you’ve been meaning to work on your fitness, you can totally achieve a strong upper bod with at-home exercises for your arms.
To narrow down the best tips to get you to the gun show 💪 , we asked Thomas Salvatore, personal trainer and owner of
Your Daily Motivation Fitness
, to give us the lowdown on all things arms.

Let’s get it started: Arm toning 101
So how often should you pump some iron? A
2016 research review
suggests that training muscle groups at least twice a week can maximize results. So building a 20–30 minute arm routine into your schedule 2 or 3 times a week is a good place to start.
To build muscle in your arms, you’ll want to focus on the following upper-body muscles:
Biceps.
These are the sexy, bulging muscles at the front of the arm (the ones you flex in front of the mirror).
Triceps.
These are the muscles on the backs of your arms that you don’t use as directly when carrying or lifting (which is why they’re usually weaker than biceps).
Lats (latissimus dorsi).
These are the big ol’ V-shaped muscles that connect your arms to your spine.
Deltoids.
Posted up on the outer part of the shoulders, these muscles are known for their iconic triangular shape.
As with any exercise routine, adding a combo of healthy diet,
cardio
, and
strength training
is a great way to
reduce body fat
and add muscle mass.
Arm workouts without weights
If you have no weights in sight or you’re new to
arm workouts
, you can just use your
body weight
to get an arm workout.
According to Salvatore, most arm exercises without weights are just variations of
planks
or
push-ups
, which means they require you to
engage your core
(two for one!).
“This means you might not feel the same intense burn in your arms like you would with weights, and that’s totally fine,” he says. “But that doesn’t mean they aren’t effective. I promise you will feel it the next day.”
1. Push-up: 3 sets of 10 reps
Share on Pinterest
Image by Dima Bazak
How-to:
Start in a
high plank
position, with hands placed a little wider than shoulders. Keep your gaze straight down toward the floor. Using your arms, lower yourself to the floor, then push yourself back up by engaging arms and core.
Pro tip:
Start with just 10
push-ups
. Then increase the number weekly as you gain strength.
Muscles targeted:
Triceps, chest, and shoulders
2. Triceps dip: 3 sets of 12 reps
Share on Pinterest
Image by Dima Bazak
How-to:
Triceps dips
can be done with a couch, chair, or bench (really any stable surface you’d sit on). Place your hands shoulder-width apart on the chair and move your pelvis and booty forward, giving yourself enough space to dip down.
Step your feet forward slightly so your legs are almost straight (but don’t lock those knees!). Slowly lower your body down and then press back up, concentrating on engaging your triceps to lower and lift.
Muscles targeted:
Triceps
3. Side plank with arm extension: 3 sets of 10 reps on each side
Share on Pinterest
Image by Dima Bazak
How-to:
Lie on your right side with feet stacked. Push right forearm into the floor for support and stability as you lift into a
side plank
. Keep right arm perpendicular to your body and left arm in line with your body.
Make sure your torso is in a reasonably straight line with your head, neck, and legs. Engage left arm by extending it toward the ceiling, making sure not to lift it higher than your shoulder. Lower your arm back down. Complete a full set before repeating on the other side.
Muscles targeted:
Obliques, arms, legs, and shoulders
4. Superman with arm extension: 3 sets of 10 reps
Share on Pinterest
Image by Dima Bazak
How-to:
Lie facedown with legs extended and arms bent so elbows are by your sides. Engage shoulders and glutes while lifting arms, chest, and legs off the floor (this is the
Superman
part). Straighten arms in front of you, then bring them back into the bent position. Lower back down to the starting position.
Muscles targeted:
Shoulders, lower back, and glutes
5. Inchworm: 3 sets of 10–12 reps
Share on Pinterest
Image by Dima Bazak
How-to:
Start in a high plank position with wrists under shoulders and legs extended behind you. Lift hips toward the ceiling as you slowly walk hands back toward feet until you’re in a forward fold. (You can bend your knees if necessary to get your palms flat on the floor.) Slowly walk hands forward, returning to high plank position.
Muscles targeted:
Chest and shoulders
6. Plank tap: 3 sets of 15–20 reps
Share on Pinterest
Image by Dima Bazak
How-to:
Start in a
high plank
with hands shoulder-width apart, shoulders stacked over wrists, and legs extended behind you with feet at least shoulder-width apart. Keeping core and glutes engaged and hips as still as possible, tap right hand to left shoulder, then left hand to right shoulder to complete 1 rep.
Muscles targeted:
Triceps, deltoids, lats, glutes, and core
7. Decline push-up: 3 sets of 10 reps
Share on Pinterest
Image by Dima Bazak
How-to:
Start in a high plank position with your toes on a step, box, or exercise ball (anything that can elevate your legs). Bending your elbows, carefully lower your chest toward the floor. Push through your palms to straighten your arms and return to the starting position.
Muscles targeted:
Deltoids, triceps, chest, and core
Arm exercises with weights
You can work dumbbells, medicine balls, or kettlebells into a weighted arm routine. No weights? No problem. Grab milk jugs, laundry detergent containers, or a weighted backpack. Any heavy objects you can safely get a grip on will do!
How heavy you want the dumbbells depends on your goals. “I have the most success starting people with lighter weight and more reps for a few reasons: I can see what fitness level they’re on, and it’s easier to add more weight or reps when needed,” notes Salvatore.
You can always up the weight as you go.
1. Biceps curl: 3 sets of 10–15 reps
Share on Pinterest
Image by Dima Bazak
How-to:
While standing or sitting, hold a
weight
in each hand with arms extended toward the floor. Slowly bend your elbows, bringing the weights toward your shoulders. Lower the weights back down to the starting position, making sure elbows and wrists are aligned throughout the movement.
Muscles targeted:
Biceps
2. Lateral raise: 3 sets of 10–15 reps
Share on Pinterest
Image by Dima Bazak
How-to:
Stand or sit with arms at your sides, holding a dumbbell in each hand. Keeping palms facing your body and elbows slightly bent, lift the dumbbells until your arms are parallel to the floor, so your body forms a T shape. Lower the dumbbells slowly back to the starting position.
Muscles targeted:
Shoulders and triceps
3. Triceps kickback: 3 sets of 10–15 reps
Share on Pinterest
Image by Dima Bazak
How-to:
Stand, holding a dumbbell in each hand, with palms facing your body. Slowly hinge forward by pushing hips back and slightly bending knees.
Pull elbows up so they’re at a 90-degree bend and in line with your back. Extend arms behind you until they’re straight, and then slowly return them to the 90-degree bend, keeping upper arms still so your elbows stay high.
Muscles targeted:
Triceps
4. Overhead triceps extension: 3 sets of 10–15 reps
Share on Pinterest
Image by Dima Bazak
How-to:
Stand or sit with a straight back, holding a dumbbell with both hands around the center. Raise the dumbbell over your head. Slowly bend elbows so the weight sinks behind your head. Slowly lift the dumbbell back to the starting position.
Muscles targeted:
Triceps
5. Rainbow slam: 3 sets of 10–15 reps
Share on Pinterest
Image by Dima Bazak
How-to:
Stand with feet shoulder-width apart, holding a
medicine ball
over your head. Swivel so you’re facing your right side, raising back heel off the floor as you bend knees like you’re doing a lunge. Slam the ball to the floor as hard as you can, and then catch it.
Return to the starting position with arms above your head. Swivel so you’re facing your left side and repeat the lunge stance and ball slam (notice that you’ve made a rainbow shape in the air with the ball). Return to the starting position.
Muscles targeted:
Shoulders, core, legs, glutes, and back
6. Kettlebell swing: 3 sets of 10–15 reps
Share on Pinterest
Image by Dima Bazak
How-to:
Stand with feet shoulder-width apart, gripping the kettlebell handle with both hands in front of you. Bend knees slightly and let the kettlebell swing between your legs, keeping back flat and neck straight.
Thrust your hips forward (heh!) to drive the kettlebell into the air in front of you. Use your arms to control it, but don’t pull it up. Let the kettlebell swing back down through your legs. Control its fall by keeping core engaged. As the kettlebell swings down, immediately move into the next rep.
Pro tip:
Before swinging, make sure your core is engaged and pull your shoulders down and back, maintaining this form during the whole set. The goal is to use your lower body to drive the exercise, but this
full-body move
will still work your arms.
Muscles targeted:
Lats, shoulders, chest, abs, glutes, quads, hips, and hamstrings
7. Dumbbell pullover
: 3 sets of 10–15 reps
Share on Pinterest
Image by Dima Bazak
How-to:
Lie on your back on a bench or stability ball, holding a dumbbell with both hands. Keep feet planted firmly on the floor. Engage core and lift arms toward the ceiling, carefully holding the dumbbell above your chest with both hands.
Keeping lower back fully pressed into the bench or ball, slowly drop your arms overhead until biceps have arrived at ears. Slowly return your arms to the starting position.
Muscles targeted:
Lats and chest
Arm exercises with resistance bands
Just because resistance bands come in cute colors doesn’t mean they won’t slap you silly. Salvatore warns that they’ll light up every muscle in your arms and give you an overall burn (in a good way!).
“When people perform an exercise with dumbbells, it’s easy to lose tension toward the top of the range of motion,” Salvatore explains. “With bands, we get the opposite action — it’s constantly increasing resistance force as the band gets longer. This way, you will have the strongest force at the end of the range, which will be the greatest contraction in the muscle.”
1. Biceps curl with band: 3 sets of 10–15 reps
Share on Pinterest
Image by Dima Bazak
How-to:
Stand on the band so it lies under the arch of your foot. Grab the ends of the band, with palms facing forward and arms by your sides. Keeping elbows tight against your sides, slowly bend (curl) arms until your hands meet your shoulders. Slowly lower your hands to return to the starting position.
Pro tip:
As soon as you feel that burn of peak contraction, it’s a sign that you need to hold it for an extra second or two.
Muscles targeted:
Biceps
2. Triceps pressdown with band: 3 sets of 10–15 reps
Share on Pinterest
Image by Dima Bazak
How-to:
Safely secure the band to a bar or door. Stand facing the band with knees slightly bent. Grab the band at its highest point. With elbows at your sides, pull the band down toward the floor until arms are fully extended. Return to the starting position.
Muscles targeted:
Triceps
3. Pull-apart with band: 3 sets of 10–15 reps
Share on Pinterest
Image by Dima Bazak
How-to:
Stand with feet hip-width apart, holding one end of the band in each hand. Lift arms to chest height, keeping them straight with palms facing down and hands about 6 inches apart. The band should have a little tension without being taut.
Pull the band apart, extending your arms wide to the sides and keeping them at the same height. Bring your arms back to the center.
Muscles targeted:
Chest, shoulders, and back
4. Staggered-stance row with band: 3 sets of 10–15 reps
Share on Pinterest
Image by Dima Bazak
How-to:
Stand in a staggered stance with left foot in front of right. Secure the band under your left foot and hold one end of the band in each hand. Slightly bend your knees and hinge forward at hips, engaging core and keeping back straight. Extend your arms toward your left foot, keeping light tension on the band.
Pull your hands toward your torso in a rowing motion, keeping forearms, elbows, and hands aligned with rib cage. Extend your arms to return to the starting position.
Muscles targeted:
Shoulders and triceps
5. Triceps kickback with band: 3 sets of 10–15 reps
Share on Pinterest
Image by Dima Bazak
How-to:
Step left foot forward and secure the band under left foot, holding one end of the band in each hand. Engaging core and keeping back straight, bend left knee and hinge forward at hips. Bend elbows to 90 degrees, keeping arms close to your sides.
Slowly straighten your arms at the elbow, keeping upper arms still as shoulder blades squeeze together. Bend your elbows again to return to the starting position.
Muscles targeted:
Shoulders, triceps, and back
6. Single-arm front raise with band: 3 sets of 10–15 reps on each side
Share on Pinterest
Image by Dima Bazak
How-to:
Stand with feet hip-width apart, securing the band under your feet. Hold one end of the band in right hand, resting right arm by your side with light tension in the band.
Raise right hand straight in front of you, bringing arm to chest height. Use only your arm and shoulders here — avoid letting your torso tip or your shoulder crumple. Lower your arm to return to the starting position.
Muscles targeted:
Shoulders
7. Single-leg row with band: 3 sets of 10–15 reps
Share on Pinterest
Image by Dima Bazak
How-to:
Secure a resistance band to a sturdy surface like the base of a heavy desk or table. Standing on one leg, hold the band in front of your chest with arms extended. Squeeze shoulder blades together and pull elbows back to complete a rowing motion. Pause with elbows bent, then slowly return to the starting position.
Pro tip:
If standing on one leg is too challenging for your balance, try starting with both feet on the floor until you feel comfortable progressing to one foot. If you want more of a challenge, you can also add in single-arm rows in-between your standard rows.
Muscles targeted:
Triceps, back, and core — plus balance!
Takeaway
Whether you want to use weights, your body weight, or resistance bands, there are plenty of effective arm exercises you can bang out at home.
Don’t be afraid to get creative to make these exercises work in your space.

24 Killer Butt Workout Moves Using Just Your Body Weight

Quick butt workout
Think your glutes only exist to look hot in jeans? They do a lot more than that. It’s only thanks to this major muscle group (made up of your gluteus maximus, medius, and minimus) that you can stand upright, climb stairs, or run.
A tight rear end is an asset for a few reasons. For one thing, it can relieve
low back pain
. Plus a firm butt makes everyday movements — like standing and
climbing stairs
— that much easier.
To get the most out of those glutes, strengthen them with these
bodyweight exercises
, courtesy of Brynn Putnam, certified trainer.
You won’t need any equipment, though a step or a sturdy chair are a plus for some moves. Ramp up the intensity by holding medium-weight
kettlebells
or
dumbbells
in each hand.

Straighten your leg and return to standing, using the chair to help you rise.
Repeat on the other side.
Do 15 to 20 reps on each side.
Make it harder
: Perform a single-leg squat without the support.
20. Single-leg deadlift
Share on Pinterest
To do this exercise:
Stand on your right leg, slightly bending your knee.
Keep your back flat as you hinge forward at the hips into a
deadlift
, sending your left leg back behind you and your arms toward the floor.
Note
: Lower only as far as you can without curving your back.
Use your right hamstring and glute to stand.
Repeat on the other side.
Do 15 to 20 reps on each side.
21. Power skip
Share on Pinterest
To do this exercise:
From a lunge with your right foot in front and left foot behind, bring your left foot forward and jump up (
skipping
), lifting your right foot completely off the floor and raising your left knee high in the air.
Land lightly on your right foot before placing your left foot on the floor behind you to return to the starting position.
Do 15 to 20 reps on each side.
22. Rear-foot-elevated deadlift
Share on Pinterest
To do this exercise:
Place your left foot on a low bench or step behind you. Stand close enough to the bench that your leg isn’t stretching or locked.
With your back straight, hinge forward at the hips.
Note
: Bend forward only as far as you can without letting your back curve.
Use your glutes and hamstrings to return to an upright position.
Repeat on the other side.
Do 15 to 20 reps on each side.
23. Rear-foot elevated split squat
Share on Pinterest
To do this exercise:
Place your left foot on a low bench or step behind you. Stand near the bench so your left leg is not stretching or locked.

Using your right glute, push up and straighten your right leg to complete the rep.
Do 10 to 15 reps on each side.
24. Single-leg squat reach across
Share on Pinterest
To do this exercise:
Stand on your left leg with your right foot hovering a few inches off the floor and your arms at your sides.
Note
: You do not need to lift your right knee high. This should be a relaxed, balanced position.
Send your hips back, bend your left knee, and lower into a squat while keeping your right knee hovering off of the ground. As you lower, reach your right arm across your body toward the outside of your left foot. Get as low as you can.
Return to the starting position.
Repeat on the other side.
Do 10 to 15 reps on each side.

7-Minute Sit Workout: Maximize Results with Just a Chair and Wall

Discover the science-backed 7-minute sit workout that transforms your fitness routine. Using a chair and a wall, achieve maximum results in minimal time. Perfect for busy schedules, it targets major muscle groups efficiently.
Share on Pinterest
By now you’ve probably heard about the scientific 7-minute workout that blew up a while back. If not, allow us to fill you in.
A study laid out exactly how to work out to get the maximum results in the minimum amount of time with just
your body weight
, a chair, and a wall.
Klika BC, et al. (2013). High-intensity circuit training using body weight: Maximum results with minimal investment.
https://journals.lww.com/acsm-healthfitness/Fulltext/2013/05000/HIGH_INTENSITY_CIRCUIT_TRAINING_USING_BODY_WEIGHT_.5.aspx
Why the 7-minute workout works
The trick is to strategically order the exercises so you’re working different major muscle groups (upper body,
lower body
, core) each time.
This allows for one major muscle group to rest while you work the next muscle group, resulting in a super-efficient, super-effective routine that can improve your health and decrease body fat — and it can be done in the comfort of your home.
Although this is a great way to work out fast, the routine isn’t a miracle worker. High-intensity interval training isn’t designed to
be done every day
, so be sure to allow at least one rest day between workouts.
Exercising for 7 minutes a few times a week isn’t going to totally transform your body, but when done correctly, it’s better than zero minutes (duh).
After a few weeks, you’ll likely see some
awesome health benefits
, like being able to run up the stairs without getting winded. It will also get easier over time.
How to use this list
As always, check with your doctor before beginning any high-intensity exercise routine.
Perform each exercise below at a high-intensity effort for 30 seconds. For static exercises such as the wall sit and
plank
, hold the position for 30 seconds.
For exercises that target two sides (such as your legs), alternate sides for 30 seconds. Rest for 5 seconds after each exercise. This circuit can be repeated 2 to 3 times, if desired.

Rest for 5 seconds between exercises. To make this workout even more challenging, complete the circuit 2 or 3 times in a row.

How the plan works
Info for beginners
Week-by-week
10K training calendar
Discover a 10k running plan that may transform your fitness journey. Whether you’re a beginner or a seasoned runner, our 4-week guide offers expert tips and motivation to help you reach your 10k goals. Start your journey today.
For a lot of folks, the
pandemic
brought running front and center. When
gyms
shut down and we said “see ya later” to
group fitness
, running was an accessible form of exercise with serious
mental health benefits
.
To celebrate the
joys of running
, the slow-but-steady return of race season, and all that we’ve survived over the last year, we put together a kick-ass training plan to help you reach new heights, distances, and milestones —
no matter your fitness level
.
Whether you’re a seasoned
marathoner
, a casual
jogger
, or someone who’s never even run a mile, we’re challenging you to take on a
10K
(say it with us: YES 👏 YOU 👏 CAN 👏). Sign up for an event. Run a virtual race. Grab some friends or hit the road solo — however you decide to hit the pavement, we’re here for you every step of the way.
Ready to dig in? Here’s how to get in amazing 10K shape in just 4 weeks.

How the plan works
Meet your coaches
You deserve the best, so we tapped three running pros to build out this training plan. Consistency is key, so stick to our 4-week schedule and you’ll crush it on race day.
The calendar features 6 days of training, 1 day of rest, but there’s room for customization to make it work for you.

is a professional runner, Team USA qualifier, cross country coach, and
author

Ben
— a
Fhitting Room instructor
and run coach — has your back with movement drills, supersets, and strength circuits designed to support your runs.
Angie Asche.
If you’re gonna train hard, you need to fuel up.
Angie
is a sports nutritionist (MS, RD, CSSD — all the certs!) and
cookbook author
who works with elite endurance athletes to create meal plans that power performance. Look for her weekly nutrition tips that’ll get you to the finish line.

— and check out the short list of terms below that we’ll be using in our 10k training program.
Step 3:
Bookmark
this visual reference guide
for all the strength training exercises and stretches we’ll be doing.
Step 4:
Gear up! The only essential equipment you need is a good pair of
running shoes
(and no, they don’t have to cost a fortune!). If your 10k includes
trail running
, you’ll want a few extras for hydration and protection against the elements. Training for a winter 10k? You’ll want to invest in some
cold-weather running gear
.
Step 5:
Load up on
magnesium-rich foods
on your next grocery store run. Think almonds, black beans, and brown rice. Read on for more info.
Running Lingo for Beginners
Strides
(or “striders”) refer to a series of short sprints, usually between 50 and 200 meters.
Easy run.
These light runs are best done at a conversational pace. (That means if you can’t run and recap last night’s episode of “The Bachelor” at the same time, you’re going too fast!)
Recovery run.
Also lovingly referred to as “junk miles,” a recovery run is a short, slow run that takes place within a day after a long, harder run. This teaches your body how to work through a fatigued state.
Interval training.
Here you’ll be alternating specific time periods of specific
high and low intensity
during a run.
Tempo run.
Usually done only once per week, tempo runs are a tougher form of speed training. Runners challenge themselves to hold a “threshold” (or comfortably difficult) pace for a 20-minute period during a run. (Don’t forget a good warmup and cooldown, too).

For more O-mazing sex tips, check out our
Greatist Guide to Sex
.
Whether you’re gettin’ busy
with yourself
, a
partner
, or
multiple partners
, sometimes
sex gets stale
. From busy schedules to evolving relationships to the giant cockblock that was
COVID-19
, you may be in need of a sexual recharge.
Whatever you’re into, and whoever you’re into doing it with, our 10-day challenge is here to rev up your sex life A-S-A-P. Grab your calendar, and let’s begin.
Day 1: Masturbate
Share on Pinterest
Illustration by Brittany England
Flicking the bean
.
Jerkin’ the gherkin
.
Sexy solitaire
. No matter what you want to call it,
masturbation
is the bomb. Not only does it feel great, it’s also a fab way to get to know your body on a deeper level. This can help you better understand your sexual needs and desires solo or with partner(s).
“
Masturbation
is one of the absolute best things you can do for your sex life,”
sex therapist Vanessa Marin
says. “It can be easier to explore your
sexuality
on your own first, and develop that connection to your own body.”
Bonus
: Self-pleasure can help you maintain a healthy sexual lifestyle. A
2009 study
found that frequent vibrator use led to positive sexual function and increased sex drive in female participants. There’s also a chance
masturbating
on the reg can increase
sexual stamina
,
reduce stress
, and
stave off blue balls
. Woot!
Day 2: Communicate
Share on Pinterest
Illustration by Brittany England
Dr. Sara C. Flowers, vice president of education and training at
Planned Parenthood Federation of America
, says communication is
always
key during sex: “Practice talking openly about sex — including your boundaries and your sexual likes, dislikes, and desires.”
This kind of communication is even more important if you’re trying something new, so have a chat pre-sex sesh (even if it’s with yourself) to make sure everyone is on the same page. “Having these conversations is important for building trust and also making sure everyone involved feels safe and comfortable,” says Flowers.
Chatting before sex is also a good time to let your partner know
why
you want to spice things up.
“Emphasize that you want to try these things with your partner, because you’re excited about exploring together,” Marin says. “That helps them understand that you’re not saying you want to try new things because you hate the sex you’re currently having!”
Pro tip
: Turn this chat into a type of foreplay. Let your partner know what you want to do together. Sometimes just talking about it will get you going.
Day 3: Use toys
Share on Pinterest
Illustration by Brittany England
Sex toys
can help your
orgasms
hit new hot heights. The only downside is picking a winner. When it comes to toy options, the limit does not exist. This can make it hard (or at least semi-hard) to find the best one for you. While
sex toys
def aren’t one-size-fits-all, here are options you can give a whirl:
For #TeamVajayjay
wand vibrator
stick vibrator
G-spot vibrator
dildo
clit suction toy
butt plug
anal beads
Ben Wa balls
For peeps who have a penis
prostate massager
flesh light
cock ring
penis pump
vibrator
automatic masturbator
butt plug
anal beads
Ben Wa balls
For sharing
couples vibrator
sex dice
strap-on
sex swing
vibrating underwear
sex wedge pillow
double-sided dildo
Ohnut
FYI
: Here’s a great
guide
to finding the sex toy of your wet dreams.
Totally new to sex toys? Here are some tips
“Sex toys can be used during sex with partner(s) or sex with yourself! If you’ve never tried a sex toy before, using one during masturbation can be a great way to experiment,” says Flowers.
OK great, we’re in. What else do we need to know to get started?
Here’s what Flowers recommends:
If you want to use sex toys with a partner, talk about them first.
Whenever you’re having sex with someone else, everyone involved should agree on what kinds of sex you’re having. That includes talking about whether or not each person consents to using any kind of sex toy.
Find the right type of sex toys.
Because there are so many types of sex toys, finding the ones you — and your partner(s), if using them together — like best can take a few tries. Learning about
different types of sex toys
and what kinds of sensations they provide is a great way to think about which ones you might like best.
Use condoms with sex toys.
If you’re sharing sex toys with others, using condoms can be a great way to enjoy yourselves while lowering your chances of transmitting sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Use a new condom for each new person to help prevent STIs. And switch to a new condom after any toy has been in someone’s anus to prevent poop germs from getting in other places in your body.
Wash your sex toys and keep them clean.
After each time you use a sex toy, remember to wash it. Most can be washed safely with soap and water, but be sure to read the instructions about how to clean them the right way.
Day 4: Talk dirty to me
Share on Pinterest
Illustration by Brittany England
Some folks dread the idea of
dirty talk
. But it can actually be hella hot.
“A lot of people get in their heads about dirty talk, and think they need to be perfectly good at it right from the get-go,” Marin says.
But that’s not the case! You can totes ease your way into it.
“If you want to get more comfortable with dirty talk but you’re shy, start with just making more noise in the bedroom,” she says. “As you get more and more practice, you can start saying more complex things!”
Not sure what to say? Here are some starter ideas to get you going!
Go slow.
That feels good.
Tell me what to do.
I love the way you touch me.
Just remember, say what feels right in the moment. And don’t be afraid to get creative!
Day 5: Embrace erotica, or put on some porn
Porn
isn’t for everyone. And that’s totally OK! But if it is your thing, you can try adding it to your solo sex sesh or next hookup. Just be sure you pick a flick that your partner is comfortable with. Also, porn isn’t just about videos. Try looking at a vintage “dirty mag” or read some
erotic fan fiction
. Even if some of it feels cheesy, it can still be a fun bonding experience and a total turn on.
Day 6: Try new ways to be intimate
Share on Pinterest
Illustration by Brittany England
Skip the sex for a sec and focus on other ways to feel close to your partner(s). Some terrific tips include:
Cook together.
Cooking a meal with your partner can be surprisingly intimate. And hey, if you want to make the meal extra spicy, cook in the nude! It’s super fun and can help increase confidence.
PSA
: Just watch out for hot surfaces 🧑‍🍳.
Give each other a massage.
Break out the
baby oil
, fam! A massage is a magical way to make your partner feel good without an orgasm. But obvi, everyone loves a happy ending, so don’t worry if the massage turns X-rated.
Have an old-fashioned make out sesh.
Kissing doesn’t get enough credit. Making out can be sensual, intimate, and relaxing. Feel free to follow up with a
spooning sesh
!
Focus on each other.
A phone call mid-takeout is not hot. Turn your devices off and take the time to connect to each other.
Day 7: Foreplay it up
Share on Pinterest
Illustration by Brittany England
Sometimes the opening act can be even better than the main attraction. Here are some inspo ideas:
Take a shower or bath together.
Get nice and wet as you
touch each other
in the
warm water
💦.
Stimulate the erogenous zones.
The tops spots
include
the nips, lips, neck, ears, inner thigh, and
butt
. You can do a combo of some (or all) of
these areas
as you slowly work your way down town.
Have fun with food.
Have your partner lick tasty treats off your chest, stomach, and thighs. Yum.
Take your clothes off.
Remember that steamy scene from “The Notebook” where they slowly undress each other? Or better yet, undress each other.
Day 8: Don’t do it in bed
Share on Pinterest
Illustration by Brittany England
One of the best ways to get out of a sex slump is to step out of the bedroom. Make it more memorable by doing the deed all over the house. The couch is a solid place to start, but don’t be afraid to get creative! Here are some other places to give sex a spin:
Car.
If PDAs aren’t your thing, park it in your garage or driveway.
Kitchen.
You or your partner can bend over the sink or sit up on the counter.
Shower.
Just keep in mind, you might want to invest in some sticky grips for the floor 😉.
Day 9: Switch positions
Share on Pinterest
Illustration by Maya Chastain
“Trying new things in the bedroom is a phenomenal way to keep the spark alive,” Marin says. “It keeps you on your toes, it’s exciting, and it helps you see yourself and your partner in new ways.”
There are LOTS of ways you can have
sex
. So, put your typical sexcapades to bed for a while. Instead, start a sex position bucket list or try a
position
a day challenge. Even if some of them are a flop, you’ll still have a ball. It’s also a great way to add some excitement to your regular sexual arsenal.
Keep things funky fresh with:
anal
69-ing
foot job
pegging
hand job
scissoring
or tribbing
anallingus
nipple play
finger bang
dry humping
new positions
prostate milking
cunnilingus
blow jobs
Day 10: Play a game
Share on Pinterest
Illustration by Brittany England
Sex doesn’t have to be super serious. In fact, it’s a great way to express your playful side. Here are some fun games to get the ball rolling:
sex dice
naked twister
naked pillow fight
adult truth or dare
naked hide-and-seek
strip poker (or Go fish if Texas hold ’em isn’t your vibe)
The fun doesn’t have to stop with foreplay! There are lots of fun ways to get your freak on:
roleplay
costumes
bondage
edging
Lots of folks also like gamified and storyline apps like:
Coral
Kindu
Desire
Lovely
Dipsea
Sex Roulette
We Should Try It
tl;dr
Sex can get
boring
from time to time, and that’s totally common. While it can feel
frustrating
, just remember, it doesn’t always have to be this way. A little exploration and some small tweaks can get you back on track to regular sexy time.

It’s a new year, and after nearly 2 years of pandemic stress (and possibly, pandemic stress eating), it’s time to make our physical and mental health a priority.
Eating a more plant-based diet (which doesn’t have to be strictly vegetarian or

) is a boss way to help you meet your health goals while living a more sustainable lifestyle.

Why try plant-based?
There are two key benefits of plant-based diets: health benefits and environmental benefits. Let’s dive a little deeper into each one, shall we?
Health
Vegetarian diets offer several
health benefits
over a more conventional Western-style diet, especially when they’re composed of mostly whole, minimally processed foods.
For example, veg diets may be linked to a
reduced risk
of heart disease, cancer, type 2 diabetes, and
obesity
.
They’re also super rich in good-for-you antioxidants, fiber, and certain vitamins and minerals.
All those veggies are also excellent for your
gut health
. The fiber provides a food source for the beneficial bacteria in your large intestine, so they can function optimally — and in turn promote improved cognitive function, immune health, blood sugar control, digestive ease, and more.
Types of plant-based diets
Lacto-ovo:
includes eggs and dairy products (milk, cheese, butter, yogurt, etc.); excludes all meats (chicken, beef, pork, fish, etc.)
Lacto-vegetarian:
includes dairy products; excludes all meats; excludes eggs
Ovo-vegetarian:
includes eggs; excludes all meats; excludes dairy
Flexitarian:
mostly plant-based but includes small amounts of animal products (eggs, dairy, meat)
Pescatarian:
plant-based diet that includes fish
Vegan:
excludes all animal-derived products, including meats, fish, dairy, eggs, and even honey
Environment
Vegetarian diets may also be a better choice for the environment, especially compared to diets consisting of conventionally farmed meats.
One 2016 review of studies actually found that the widespread adoption of more
plant-based dietary patterns
could potentially
reduce greenhouse gas emissions
by up to 80 percent and water use by up to 50 percent.
Additionally, adopting a plant-based diet may be a must-do for you if you’re concerned about
animal welfare
or animal rights. While more humane farming methods are becoming more mainstream, conventional farming is still a huge problem re: the welfare and treatment of the animals at these farms.
And if you want to avoid contributing to any harm, exploitation, or killing of animals, then a
stricter vegan diet
is a natural choice.
Is it a fit for your health goals?
Like omnivorous diets,
plant-based diets
can be as healthful or as junky as you want. You’re unlikely to see health benefits from ANY change in the way you eat if you’re depending on a lot of highly processed or sugary foods.
However, a high quality plant-based diet may be just the right fit if your goals are improving your overall health, losing weight, or leading a more sustainable lifestyle.
Additionally, plant based doesn’t necessarily HAVE to mean that you’re a strict vegan or vegetarian.
You can still have meat
or dairy occasionally on a primarily plant-based diet, while enjoying the health benefits of eating mostly plants. (
Psst
, choosing humanely-raised, grass-fed, or pastured meats when you do eat meat offers a more sustainable option than conventionally farmed meats, as well.)
Pros
full of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains
may be less expensive than a meat-based diet
rich in antioxidants
high in fiber
contains a variety of vitamins and minerals
more sustainable and animal-friendly
may aid with overall health and weight
Cons
may not be beneficial if you’re depending on highly processed veg foods
will probably require more cooking at home
requires supplementation of certain vitamins
newbies have a bit of a learning curve
What to expect
How you’ll feel
after starting a plant-based diet
depends on a lot of things, and a big one is how you were eating before.
If you were already eating a plant-rich, whole food diet, you may not notice any major differences right away after cutting back on meat. However, many people experience
skin improvements
after cutting out dairy.
If you’re starting a whole food plant-based diet fresh from a pretty processed diet (heavy in things like fast food or highly processed snacks, for example), you may go through a bit of an adjustment period where you’re a little grumpier than normal. These foods can have some
addictive properties
that you may need to “detox” from.
Once you’re over the hump, though, you’ll probably find yourself feeling fantastic. Oh, and using the bathroom will be a joy 💩 thanks to all that regularity-inducing fiber.
Another thing to be aware of when you begin is that you may not have as many dining out options, so you’ll probably have to put in more effort in the kitchen. If you’re not confident in your cooking skills, don’t worry — you will be soon!
Finally, you’ll have some changes in the macro- and micronutrient content of your diet. Most plant-based diets are lower in protein than omnivore diets (which is why it’s really important to have a protein source with each meal). You’ll also want to supplement with some key nutrients that may be lacking in a plant-based diet, which we’ll discuss more below.
Quick-start for beginners
Plan, shop, prep
Making a big change to your diet can seem really intimidating at first, but it doesn’t have to be. There really are just three basic steps to getting through your first two weeks of eating plant-based:
Plan.
Plan out 2 weeks of meals. Make them easy, give yourself some wiggle room, and choose meals you know you’ll like — even if they’re not quite the idealistic meals you see on the ‘gram.
Shop.
Next, do your shopping. However often you shop, make it a priority to build up a well-rounded plant based pantry — even if you’re just picking up a few items for the pantry each week. (We’ve included a general shopping list below.)
Prep.
Finally, doing a bit of prepwork ahead of time will help you to be more successful — especially if you tend to be lacking motivation after work during the week (prime hit-the-drive-thru time). Prepping all of your breakfasts and lunches for the week at once can be helpful (Sundays work well for many people).
Gearing up
Already have a well-stocked kitchen from your pre-plant based days? You should be all set.
If swapping to plant-based this year will also be your first foray into cooking at home, here’s some essential gear you’ll need to be successful:
nonstick skillet(s)
cooking pot(s) with lid
good chef’s knife
good bread (serrated) knife
blender
strainer
measuring cups and spoons
mixing bowls of various sizes
baking sheet
loaf pan or muffin pan
whisk, turner, spatula, and large stirring spoon
can opener
Slow cookers, Instant Pots, food processors, rice cookers, and air fryers can also be really helpful and time-saving, but they’re not essential.
Easy swaps
So, it’s pretty obvious that you’ll be swapping out the meat for plant-based alternatives, but what about all the other animal-based products that you reach for on the reg?
Here are some easy swaps for those.
Instead of…
Try
an egg
For baking: a flax egg (1 tbsp flax meal and 2.5 tbsp water)
For scrambling: tofu
pudding or flavored gelatin
chia pudding (1 part chia seeds, 1 part plant milk or fruit juice, plus flavors and sweeteners of your choice — refrigerate overnight before eating)
Parmesan cheese
nutritional yeast
cow’s milk
plant milk (soy, oat, flax, almond, coconut)
mayonnaise
hummus (or vegan mayo)
butter
coconut oil
chicken or beef broth/stock
veggie stock (keep veggie scraps in a bag in your freezer to make it yourself)
Pick a protein
Getting enough protein is super important for a
successful plant-based life
. (And fortunately, it’s super easy too).
You can get plant-based protein from nuts, seeds, soy products, beans, meat alternatives, and
plant-based protein powders
(additionally, from eggs and dairy products if you’re not going strict vegan).
However, unlike animal proteins, plant proteins individually don’t provide enough of the essential amino acids to meet your needs. The solution to getting enough of these essential AAs is to simply
eat a variety
of plant-based proteins throughout your day and week.
Make sure to include a variety of nuts, seeds, beans, and meat alternatives — and you’ll have no problems getting those AAs in.

Simple meal prep
Here’s our simple meal-prep formula that works for ANYONE and ANY MEAL (plant-based or not). This is a great way to figure out your lunches and dinners for the week if you like to batch cook on the weekends.
First, pick your protein. For this example, let’s go with tofu.
Next, add a grain. Rice seems like a natural choice, but we could also go with barley, noodles, tortillas, etc.
Finally, pick a veg. Let’s do bok choy.
Tofu, rice, and bok choy… that sounds like a great stir fry! Season with soy sauce, sesame oil, honey, rice vinegar, ginger, red pepper flake, and garlic, and garnish it with sesame seeds and green onions.

Our fave hacks and cheats
Need to save some time? Here are some of our favorite hacks to make plant-based eating a little bit easier:
Taco Bell.
Hey, don’t hate. While the food is highly processed, it’s good if you don’t have any other options. They are one of the only fast food restaurants that you can find almost anywhere, and they offer a full Veggie Cravings menu featuring items certified by the American Vegetarian Association.
Meal kits and meal delivery.
If you’ve got room in the budget, consider a meal kit like Green Chef, Sunbasket, or Purple Carrot (all of which send preportioned ingredients and recipes for you to cook your own plant forward meals). Alternatively, if you’re crunched for time or need an easy work-lunch solution, consider a fresh or frozen meal delivery service like Fresh N Lean (which offers vegan or
low carb vegan
meals) or Trifecta Nutrition (which offers vegan or vegetarian plans).
Frozen veggies.
In an ideal world, you’d never find mushy brown bananas covered in fruit flies at the bottom of your fruit bowl, or liquefied bags of baby spinach in the depths of your crisper drawer. Alas, it happens — so there’s nothing wrong with keeping some frozen veggies on hand for quick meals or busy weeks where lots of fresh veggie prep may not be an option. In fact, frozen bags of peas and carrots are great for quickly throwing together some takeout style fried rice, and frozen riced cauliflower is SO easy to add to soups or to add some extra veg to a rice dish.
Canned beans.
Likewise, canned beans are AMAZING. Although dried beans are less expensive, and may taste a little bit better, they require soaking, sorting, a long cook time. So, it’s a good idea to at least keep a few different varieties of canned beans on hand for when you need a quick meal.
Precooked grains.
Likewise, precooked grains (like rice and quinoa) are a godsend for busy nights. The texture can be a bit off compared to grains you cook yourself, but they’re super convenient and only require reheating. Sometimes you just need a good meal to come together fast.
Plant-based “fast food”
Need something quick and easy? We got you, veg fam. Here are a few 5-minutes-or-less, no-cooking-required, throw-it-together meals for when you just CAN’T.
PB&J.
It’s a classic. Make it better with a good, sturdy whole grain bread, locally made jam, and almond butter.
Chickpea and avocado toast.
Canned chickpeas make this a super easy, protein rich meal. Season liberally with S&P, and enjoy reaching peak millennial as you eat.
Shortcut beans and rice.
Canned beans, precooked rice, a quick jaunt through the microwave, and the seasonings of your choice. Maybe not the greatest beans and rice ever, but a good hot meal in a pinch.
Whatever’s in the fridge salad.
Exactly what it says. On a bed of salad greens, add leftover veggies, nuts and seeds, plant-based cheese, a cut up plant based burger patty, or leftover chickpeas from your toast. Add your fave plant based dressing, or just drizzle with oil and vinegar.
Supplements
Plant-based diets can come up short on
certain nutrients
(unless they are extremely well planned), so — especially as a beginner — it’s important to include
certain supplements
to make sure all of your bases are covered. Here are the nutrients you may fall short on while eating a plant-based diet:
vitamin B12
omega-3 fats
iron
iodine
zinc
calcium
vitamin D
iron
selenium
A good multi should cover you for the most part, but be sure it includes at least 100 percent of the Daily Value (DV) for vitamin B12, as well as a vegetarian source of omega-3s. (Also, snack on seaweed! It’s full of iodine.)
14-day plant-based menu plan
Here’s a 14-day sample meal plan to help you get started. For the sake of variety, we’ve included 14 different breakfasts, lunches, dinners, and snacks or desserts for a grand total of 56 unique meal and snack ideas. However, we encourage you to tweak this to make it your own!
Most people, for instance, don’t mind eating the same breakfast over and over again. So we recommend picking the tastiest sounding breakfast option (or two or three) and running with it for these first 2 weeks. This will help you save some time in the mornings, too. The same goes for snacks and lunches, or even dinners if you’re willing to sacrifice some variety for more convenience.
Also — feel free to round out any of these meals with a side salad or some steamed or sauteed veggies that you have on hand.

Greatist Editorial Process
Written by
The Greatist Team
on November 10, 2020
Trust is everything when it comes to your health — we get it. So we want to share how we go about creating content that’s 100 percent accurate, actionable, expert-backed, and thoroughly Greatist.
The Greatist difference
Health and wellness information is everywhere — the internet offers a virtual sea of advice on how to eat better, feel better, love better, live better. But too often, it’s more intimidating than illuminating, more confusing than constructive.
Greatist is out to change that. We follow facts, not trends. We translate science-y stuff into smart, simple language you can understand without a PhD, PsyD, or RDN.
We know that how much mileage you get out of wellness content depends on everything from expertise to experience. So we’ve made it our mission to include only the best and most accurate information in our content. Greatist breaks down the research and polishes all the relatable nuggets into diamonds for you, so you can spend less time fact-finding and more time shaping a version of health that works for you.
Our goal
We want to help you feel good in ways large and small and live a happier, healthier life on your terms. Period.
What goes into our content
Whether you’re looking for a new workout to show your abs who’s boss, digging around to see if the claims behind a new food trend are fad or fact, struggling with depression, or trying to expand your boundaries (yes, even the bedroom kind), you’ll find applicable Greatist stories crafted with expertise, authority, and trust.
Each article you read goes through a capital-P Process — vetting, research, and an expert’s lens — to get you health information that lets you focus on what matters: you.
We aim to help you get to the point without cutting corners. This means you can expect our content to be comprehensive, easy to read, and easy to apply to your life. We strive to be relevant, unravel biases, and stick to the highest journalistic standards. This means fact checking, sourcing primary documents, and evaluating writers and experts.
Teaming up with the experts
To double down on what we do best, we’ve teamed up with the clinicians, doctors, and experts at Healthline. Their robust review process covers all our clinical and medical content, which includes everything from weight management to sexual health and from relationship guidance to chronic conditions.

Only the best and forward-thinking writers
At Greatist, we work with top health and wellness writers. To maintain our goal of inclusivity and health equity across all our content, we recruit and train writers with personal experiences that are relevant to the health topics we cover.
POVs: Sharing others’ stories
We also publish personal stories of health and wellness on Greatist. We respect individual perspectives and allow people to share their stories their way. In these instances, we balance freedom of expression with ethical writing practices. But because opinion is, well, opinion, we label it as such so it’s not confused with our expert-approved medical and health content.
Sticking to original references, sources, and citations
Our medical and health content is thoroughly researched, and sources are vetted to ensure they are recent, authoritative, and objective. Our strict sourcing guidelines focus on primary sources (peer-reviewed studies and interviews with experts) and trustworthy secondary sources (academic research institutions, government agencies, and medical associations).
You can find a list of all sources used, including interviews, at the bottom of each article, under the Sources heading. (The sources are initially hidden, but they expand with a click — we truly find and use a lot!)
We keep our words oiled and updated
Health information is constantly changing. New research emerges, old ideas are disproven, and terminology becomes out of date.
At Greatist, we continually monitor and update our content to make sure we’re sharing the most up-to-date and accurate information possible. To make this a reality, we have entire teams of editors and experts focused on identifying and updating inaccurate or unclear information.
Our Medical Integrity team keeps tabs on changes in standards of care, new clinical guidelines, drug approvals or recalls, and major practice recommendations. The team brings these insights to our editors and partners so that content can be updated to reflect the latest, most accurate, and most useful information.
You may see a few dates on our content. Each of these refers to a different step in our editorial process.
Each piece of content is given a “written on” date when it is originally written and published on our site.
Every time a piece of content is reviewed by an expert in our Medical Network, it receives a new “medical review” date.
Every time a piece of content is verified by one of our professional fact-checkers, it receives a new “fact-checked” date.
Whenever a piece of content is modified, it receives a new “updated on” date. The modifications may include correcting minor inaccuracies, adding new information, replacing images and sources, or making any other changes to improve the value of the content for you, the reader.
Here are some other ways we continually monitor and update content:
Regular audits.
We perform regular audits of content to address changes in language and medical terminology, and trends in health communities.
Annual brand vetting.
We reevaluate vetted brands on a yearly basis and update any content that references those brands to reflect any changes in the brand’s performance against our vetting criteria.
Immediate action from feedback.
We invite reader feedback on our content and take immediate action to address any potential issues. When a reader alerts us about a potential issue with our content — such as inaccurate, outdated, unclear, or contradictory information — we take immediate action. Our editorial and medical teams research the feedback, determine what revisions are needed, and update the content.
Our voice and style
Our voice is inclusive, friendly, sincere, and easy to read. We love a good pun but we don’t shy away from tougher topics. We champion diversity and equity, meaning we cover difficult topics with nuance and seek to incorporate unheard voices. We use empathetic language to tell judgment-free stories, and we make intentional choices to remove stigma, stereotypes, and prejudices that often go unnoticed in the healthcare system.
As for grammar and style, we look to the Associated Press and our internal language team to inform our Style Guide. This helps us stay consistent, accurate, and respectful. As language evolves, so do we.
Plagiarism
We have a zero tolerance policy for plagiarism of any kind and utilize tools, along with a team of seasoned copy editors, to check content prior to publishing it.
The why behind our process: You. Always.
We can’t expect to be your partner in health unless we take your lead on what the picture of health looks like. That’s right: Our readers (you!) matter most, and we keep you at the forefront, so that Greatist can be a truly trusted resource that’s there for you when you need it.
This “you matter” approach guides everything we do at editorial. Think of Greatist as your friendly GPS provider — giving you the right tips and directions so all you have to focus on is pumping the gas pedal at the speed you wish.

How product picks get from us to you
At Greatist, we believe that growth happens when you take any step toward better physical, emotional, or social health — and our mission is to help you grow.  The products we choose are a huge part of that. Curious about a meal kit delivery service? Ready to invest in home gym equipment but have no clue where to start? Let us do the research for you.
We’re always on the hunt for stuff that works, makes us feel good, and delivers the most bang for our buck. Everything that’s shoppable on Greatist has been thoughtfully chosen by our editors and reviewers. We only recommend products that meet specific quality standards, and we’ll always share our reasons. If you like what you see and buy something through a link on our site, we may receive a small cut. There’s no extra cost to you.
Bottom line: Our product picks are here to help — from the little things to the life changing.
Will you accept this rose recommendation? Here’s an inside look at the selection process
Our product picks start with extensive reporting and research by our team of experienced journalists. We dig into user reviews, investigate brands, fact-check any claims, and submit items for vetting by our
Medical Affairs team
, who dive deeper and analyze:
the product’s composition
the potential for these products to cause harm
the company’s integrity
But it doesn’t stop there. We do our best to thoroughly test products whenever possible. Sometimes, that means we receive an item for free, and when that’s the case, we never promise coverage or a favorable review in exchange.
And since nothing lasts forever, we’re constantly reevaluating products. If a product or brand is reevaluated and no longer meets our standards, we’ll remove it from our site. And if we share something that hasn’t passed our vetting process, we’ll be straight up about why so you can make an informed decision.
Journalistic integrity, editorial independence, and a solid foundation built on expertise, authority, and trust are at the core of everything we do. Look for content disclaimers and medical review labels on our articles. Unlike a bad ex, we’ve got nothing to hide, and we’ll always be honest with you.
Which brings us to the Greatist ‘Good for You’ seal
For the cream of the crop, we created the Good for You seal of approval. Only the best of the best finds that receive top marks from our vetting team, are beloved by our editors and readers like you, and deliver value in every way can earn this seal. It’s one more way we’re ensuring only the best products end up in your cart so you can feel good buying the things that actually make you feel good.

Can you trust fitness influencers?
How to spot untrustworthy info
5 things to watch for
Where to get credible info
tl;dr
Here’s how to know if a fitness influencer is actually qualified to give you fitness advice — plus some major red flags to watch out for.
Share on Pinterest
Illustration by Joules Garcia
Love to hate ’em or hate to love ’em, fitness influencers are an undeniable, unavoidable part of life now.
Whatever your
social media
app of choice for mindless scrolling is, you’re gonna come across fitness influencers sharing
workouts
,
supplements
, day-in-the-life (DITL) vids,
what they eat
in a day, their
favorite products
, flawless photos in the least amount of clothing they can get away with to show off their bods, and on and on.
BUT do they all deserve our trust? And if not, how do we know who to trust and who to unfollow?
We spoke with Maria Leguizamon, a certified personal trainer with
Recess.TV
, about how to figure out which influencers to trust. And she would know — she’s a fitness influencer herself, with more than 145K followers on the ’gram.
So let’s talk about how to filter out the truth from all the obviously filtered Instagram pics.
Can I trust fitness influencers?
The question of the day!
The answer: It depends. While it may seem like views, shares, and likes are good indicators of trustworthiness, they’re really (really, really) not.
Lots of influencers are likable — it’s how they amass such large followings. But Leguizamon says it’s not so much about that feeling of “Do I trust this person or not?” — it’s more about
results
, community, and
expertise
.
“It’s more about seeing the results you get from their advice,” she explains, “and the commitment to their community, not
only
as a fitness influencer but also as a
personal trainer
.”
According to her, a good influencer is one who is truly an expert but who is also engaged with and truly passionate about their community of followers — so it’s about more than money or follower count.
How to spot info you *shouldn’t* trust — even if it has 1.1 million likes
When you’re watching fitness content on social media, you definitely need to have your skeptical spectacles (skeptacles?) on. Here are some Q’s to ask yourself when evaluating whether the advice is legit or nonsense:
Is it a quick fix?
Is it a
workout
promising 2 weeks to a
bubble butt
, or a hack to
lose 10 pounds
in a week? Stop, don’t collaborate, and don’t listen.
Making lasting change to your body — be it fat loss or
sculpting
— always takes time. And you should be doubly skeptical if they’re promising a quick fix … after you pay them.
“When I see some fitness influencers charging insane amounts of money for programs or fitness advice,” says Leguizamon, “I question it.”
Is it obviously dangerous or ridiculous?
Pretty self-explanatory. Does the advice leave you shaking your head or raising your eyebrows? 🚩🚩
Case in point:
dry scooping
. This trend involves swallowing a scoop of
pre-workout powder
with just a swig of water (when it’s meant to be mixed into 6 to 8 ounces of water). And TBH, most of the people doing it (or at least the ones posting about it on TikTok) look really fit.
BUT dry scooping just AIN’T IT, Y’ALL — in fact, it’s already been linked to one
heart attack
in an otherwise healthy 20-year-old because it delivers a highly concentrated, quickly absorbed dose of
caffeine
.
What makes this person an expert on this topic?
A lot of content you see online might seem legit — it’s not touted as a quick fix, it doesn’t seem dangerous, and it’s not obviously ridiculous. So digging into the creator’s expertise is probably the biggest and most important thing you can do when evaluating fitness advice on social media.
FWIW, having a
muscular body
doesn’t make someone a fitness expert.
Certified personal trainers,
physical therapists
, orthopedic doctors, kinesiologists, sports medicine docs, and other legit experts have in-depth knowledge of body mechanics, injury prevention, proper form, and more. That non-certified 19-year-old TikToker churning out homegrown
workout routines
does NOT.
The same goes for
nutrition
: We all eat, but we ain’t all nutrition experts — so let’s leave the detailed diet advice to registered dietitians and nutrition-savvy medical professionals.
Top 5 things influencers get wrong on social media
And here are a few things that influencers get straight-up wrong on the regs, along with Leguizamon’s tips about what to look for:
1. Form, form, form
While many influencers focus a lot on
proper form
, others tend to gloss over it — which isn’t cool, according to Leguizamon. “Without teaching how to have the correct alignment and form, people can easily get injured,” she says.
The same goes for
proper breathing
while exercising, which will help you maximize your effectiveness as well.
If an influencer is sharing workouts, they should be showing you proper form to prevent injuries, as well as
how to breathe
through each movement.
2. Lack of evidence
“Anyone can google a
workout routine
,” says Leguizamon, “but the most important aspect of it should be a routine that is going to give you results.”
Screenshotting those cute workout routine images on Pinterest is great and all, but you should be verifying that it was made by a pro who knows how to craft an effective routine.
3. “Weightlifting will make you bulky”
“I think one of the biggest misconceptions is that
lifting weights
will bulk you,” says Leguizamon. “I wish it was that easy!”
So when she sees influencers (especially female ones) shying away from lifting or strength training, she’s always suspicious.
After all, “
lifting weights
will make you strong and help you tone up and grow muscle,” she explains. To bulk up, she adds, “you will have to eat insane amounts of food. Particularly for women, female hormones will prevent excessive muscle mass growth.”
4. Wild supplement claims
OK, naturally, fitness influencers make a lot of money through brand collabs, sponsored content, and affiliate sales — especially with
supplement
companies. That’s NOT to say that every brand they work with is automatically untrustworthy. But it is a good idea to do some research yourself before purchasing a supplement.
When you see an influencer saying things like “life-changing” or “game-changing” when it comes to a supplement — especially if it’s one they’re getting paid to promote — you gotta work some of that “trust but verify” action.
Look for supplements
that are produced in facilities that follow the current good manufacturing practices (CGMPs) — a set of FDA standards — and that are third-party tested for purity, quality, and the presence of contaminants.
For sports supplements, an Informed Sport and NSF Certified for Sport certification is a good thing to look for — these labels ensure that the supplement is free of banned substances.
5. Body transformations
Finally, while it’s totally cool to follow fitness influencers for (sound) advice or inspiration or just because they’re interesting, one thing you want to avoid is aiming to have a body exactly like your favorite influencer’s body.
A lot of influencer content kinda does have that undercurrent of “If you do what I do, you can have a body like mine.” And that’s just not how bodies work.
Between airbrushing, filters, lighting, posing, and professional photography, your favorite influencers probably don’t even look like their IRL selves in some of their most stunning and popular photos. (Need more proof? Check out Youtuber
Stephanie Lange
‘s videos on influencers IRL.)
And no amount of
weight loss
or working out is ever gonna change your fundamental bone structure. So while you can definitely change your body through diet and fitness, there are some things you just won’t be able to do. (For example, don’t expect to have a thigh gap if you’ve got narrow hips. BTW, you don’t need a thigh gap anyway.)
Look for fitness influencers who encourage you to make the best of the body you have through sustainable
weight loss
or realistic
workout routines
, rather than those who make you feel like there’s something wrong with how you currently are.
Where to get credible fitness info
First, let’s talk influencers. What are some signs that a fitness influencer knows what they’re talking about and deserves that double tap?
“Check their certifications,” says Leguizamon, adding that you should cross-reference the advice they’re giving with that of other influencers — esp those who’ve got the creds to back up what they’re saying. If you’re not hearing similar advice from the experts, that’s pretty sus.
As for other sources for credible info about health and fitness, Leguizamon recommends the
American College of Sports Medicine
and the
American Council on Exercise
. (These are the two biggest and most well-known certifying orgs for personal trainers, so you can use them to get connected with a trainer too.)
tl;dr
Remember, there’s nothing wrong with being a fitness influencer, and your faves probably aren’t purposefully trying to mislead you (even if they get some things wrong).
But being an influencer is a job, and a lot of expectations come along with it.
That *life changing*
supplement
that’s always sneaking into their Instagram stories? There’s a huge chance the brand is paying them to advertise it.
That #BodyGoals photo on the beach? You can bet that the posing and lighting were 100 percent on point, and it wasn’t a candid shot — even if it looks like it was (or the caption implies that it was).
We love keeping tabs on influencers (not gonna lie — our daily
matcha latte
habit was inspired by #ThatGirl Toks), but we encourage
realism
when it comes to taking their advice.
When in doubt, seek out a professional who is an expert in the area you need help with — a certified personal trainer, a physical therapist, or a registered dietitian.

Can you trust fitness influencers?
How to spot untrustworthy info
5 things to watch for
Where to get credible info
tl;dr
Here’s how to know if a fitness influencer is actually qualified to give you fitness advice — plus some major red flags to watch out for.
Share on Pinterest
Illustration by Joules Garcia
Love to hate ’em or hate to love ’em, fitness influencers are an undeniable, unavoidable part of life now.
Whatever your
social media
app of choice for mindless scrolling is, you’re gonna come across fitness influencers sharing
workouts
,
supplements
, day-in-the-life (DITL) vids,
what they eat
in a day, their
favorite products
, flawless photos in the least amount of clothing they can get away with to show off their bods, and on and on.
BUT do they all deserve our trust? And if not, how do we know who to trust and who to unfollow?
We spoke with Maria Leguizamon, a certified personal trainer with
Recess.TV
, about how to figure out which influencers to trust. And she would know — she’s a fitness influencer herself, with more than 145K followers on the ’gram.
So let’s talk about how to filter out the truth from all the obviously filtered Instagram pics.
Can I trust fitness influencers?
The question of the day!
The answer: It depends. While it may seem like views, shares, and likes are good indicators of trustworthiness, they’re really (really, really) not.
Lots of influencers are likable — it’s how they amass such large followings. But Leguizamon says it’s not so much about that feeling of “Do I trust this person or not?” — it’s more about
results
, community, and
expertise
.
“It’s more about seeing the results you get from their advice,” she explains, “and the commitment to their community, not
only
as a fitness influencer but also as a
personal trainer
.”
According to her, a good influencer is one who is truly an expert but who is also engaged with and truly passionate about their community of followers — so it’s about more than money or follower count.
How to spot info you *shouldn’t* trust — even if it has 1.1 million likes
When you’re watching fitness content on social media, you definitely need to have your skeptical spectacles (skeptacles?) on. Here are some Q’s to ask yourself when evaluating whether the advice is legit or nonsense:
Is it a quick fix?
Is it a
workout
promising 2 weeks to a
bubble butt
, or a hack to
lose 10 pounds
in a week? Stop, don’t collaborate, and don’t listen.
Making lasting change to your body — be it fat loss or
sculpting
— always takes time. And you should be doubly skeptical if they’re promising a quick fix … after you pay them.
“When I see some fitness influencers charging insane amounts of money for programs or fitness advice,” says Leguizamon, “I question it.”
Is it obviously dangerous or ridiculous?
Pretty self-explanatory. Does the advice leave you shaking your head or raising your eyebrows? 🚩🚩
Case in point:
dry scooping
. This trend involves swallowing a scoop of
pre-workout powder
with just a swig of water (when it’s meant to be mixed into 6 to 8 ounces of water). And TBH, most of the people doing it (or at least the ones posting about it on TikTok) look really fit.
BUT dry scooping just AIN’T IT, Y’ALL — in fact, it’s already been linked to one
heart attack
in an otherwise healthy 20-year-old because it delivers a highly concentrated, quickly absorbed dose of
caffeine
.
What makes this person an expert on this topic?
A lot of content you see online might seem legit — it’s not touted as a quick fix, it doesn’t seem dangerous, and it’s not obviously ridiculous. So digging into the creator’s expertise is probably the biggest and most important thing you can do when evaluating fitness advice on social media.
FWIW, having a
muscular body
doesn’t make someone a fitness expert.
Certified personal trainers,
physical therapists
, orthopedic doctors, kinesiologists, sports medicine docs, and other legit experts have in-depth knowledge of body mechanics, injury prevention, proper form, and more. That non-certified 19-year-old TikToker churning out homegrown
workout routines
does NOT.
The same goes for
nutrition
: We all eat, but we ain’t all nutrition experts — so let’s leave the detailed diet advice to registered dietitians and nutrition-savvy medical professionals.
Top 5 things influencers get wrong on social media
And here are a few things that influencers get straight-up wrong on the regs, along with Leguizamon’s tips about what to look for:
1. Form, form, form
While many influencers focus a lot on
proper form
, others tend to gloss over it — which isn’t cool, according to Leguizamon. “Without teaching how to have the correct alignment and form, people can easily get injured,” she says.
The same goes for
proper breathing
while exercising, which will help you maximize your effectiveness as well.
If an influencer is sharing workouts, they should be showing you proper form to prevent injuries, as well as
how to breathe
through each movement.
2. Lack of evidence
“Anyone can google a
workout routine
,” says Leguizamon, “but the most important aspect of it should be a routine that is going to give you results.”
Screenshotting those cute workout routine images on Pinterest is great and all, but you should be verifying that it was made by a pro who knows how to craft an effective routine.
3. “Weightlifting will make you bulky”
“I think one of the biggest misconceptions is that
lifting weights
will bulk you,” says Leguizamon. “I wish it was that easy!”
So when she sees influencers (especially female ones) shying away from lifting or strength training, she’s always suspicious.
After all, “
lifting weights
will make you strong and help you tone up and grow muscle,” she explains. To bulk up, she adds, “you will have to eat insane amounts of food. Particularly for women, female hormones will prevent excessive muscle mass growth.”
4. Wild supplement claims
OK, naturally, fitness influencers make a lot of money through brand collabs, sponsored content, and affiliate sales — especially with
supplement
companies. That’s NOT to say that every brand they work with is automatically untrustworthy. But it is a good idea to do some research yourself before purchasing a supplement.
When you see an influencer saying things like “life-changing” or “game-changing” when it comes to a supplement — especially if it’s one they’re getting paid to promote — you gotta work some of that “trust but verify” action.
Look for supplements
that are produced in facilities that follow the current good manufacturing practices (CGMPs) — a set of FDA standards — and that are third-party tested for purity, quality, and the presence of contaminants.
For sports supplements, an Informed Sport and NSF Certified for Sport certification is a good thing to look for — these labels ensure that the supplement is free of banned substances.
5. Body transformations
Finally, while it’s totally cool to follow fitness influencers for (sound) advice or inspiration or just because they’re interesting, one thing you want to avoid is aiming to have a body exactly like your favorite influencer’s body.
A lot of influencer content kinda does have that undercurrent of “If you do what I do, you can have a body like mine.” And that’s just not how bodies work.
Between airbrushing, filters, lighting, posing, and professional photography, your favorite influencers probably don’t even look like their IRL selves in some of their most stunning and popular photos. (Need more proof? Check out Youtuber
Stephanie Lange
‘s videos on influencers IRL.)
And no amount of
weight loss
or working out is ever gonna change your fundamental bone structure. So while you can definitely change your body through diet and fitness, there are some things you just won’t be able to do. (For example, don’t expect to have a thigh gap if you’ve got narrow hips. BTW, you don’t need a thigh gap anyway.)

Updated on August 6, 2024
Discover the health benefits of a daily stretching routine, from enhancing flexibility to reducing stress. Learn why fitting just 10-15 minutes of stretching into your schedule can make a big difference in your overall well-being.
You probs do a few stretches at the gym, but stretching is more than just a
pre-workout
and
post-run
ritual. A daily stretching routine can benefit your overall health by
improving your flexibility
, relieving muscle tension, and reducing stress.
Ready to add a few daily stretches to your routine? Let’s do it!

Benefits of daily stretching
Not only does stretching feel oh-so-good, but it’s good for you too! Fitting a 10- to 15-minute stretch sesh into your daily schedule has a ton of health benefits.
Stretching can:
Loosen up tight muscles.
Feeling a bit stiff from your day job or workout?
Stretching
is a great way to relieve any
tightness
and tension.
Increase flexibility and range of motion.
Stretching
helps your muscles and joints become more flexible. And according to a
2012 research review
, stretching can increase your range of motion. This can help you get bendy for
yoga
and just move more easily when walking across your living room.
Improve posture.
Bad desk posture
killing your vibe? A
small 2014 study
suggests that stretching may help you be more aware of your
posture
and avoid that forward slump in your shoulders.
Reduce pain.
Because stretching helps ease muscle tension, it may help reduce pain caused by chronic conditions or injuries. According to a
small 2015 study
, stretching can also help reduce pain
while
correcting poor posture.
Lower your risk of injury.
Working out or doing physical activity without a proper
warmup
can put you on the path to potential injury. A daily stretch sesh
may help prevent strains and sprains.
Boost your circulation.
A
small 2013 study
suggests that stretching is a great way to boost circulation. And better blood flow can benefit your overall
heart health
, improve
muscle recovery
, and reduce
soreness
Relieve stress.
Stretching can help relieve tension for a
stress-free body
and
mind
🧘‍♂️.
Ease headaches.
Stretching can help ease
headache-inducing
tension and provide you with sweet relief.
Your 15-minute daily stretching routine
You can do
stretching exercises
whenever you feel like it. But two great times to add movement to your routine are
right when you wake up
and
before bed
.
If you want to stretch around your
workout routine
, a proper
warmup
is key — and stretching alone may not be enough. But
studies
suggest it’s better to do dynamic stretches (
active movements
that provide a stretch) before a workout and static stretches (in which you hold one position for a while) afterward.
To keep your muscles lean and limber, try this mix of
static
and
dynamic stretches
.
1. Head roll
Share on Pinterest
GIF by Dima Bazak
Stand up straight with arms at your sides and feet shoulder-width apart.
Carefully drop chin down toward chest.
Slowly roll your head to one side, completing a full rotation.
Once your head is back at your chest, rest for 5 seconds, then roll to the other side.
Repeat 5 times.
2. Shoulder roll
Share on Pinterest
GIF by Dima Bazak
Stand up straight with arms at your sides.
Lift shoulder blades up like you’re shrugging your shoulders, making sure to keep some space between your shoulders and ears.
Roll your shoulder blades back and down.
Repeat 5 times, then repeat in the other direction.
3. Triceps stretch
Share on Pinterest
GIF by Dima Bazak
Stand up straight with feet shoulder-width apart.
Hold right arm straight out in front of you, then cross it in front of your body.
Bend left arm to gently hold right forearm and guide it closer to your chest.
Hold for 10–30 seconds, then release.
Repeat on the other side.
4. Arms and abs stretch
Share on Pinterest
GIF by Dima Bazak
Stand with feet hip-width apart and cross right foot over left foot.
Reach your arms overhead and grab left wrist with right hand.
Lower your shoulders, leaving space by your ears, as you lean to the right. You should feel this stretch in your sides and shoulders without pain or tingling.
Hold for 15–30 seconds.
Return to a standing position and repeat on the other side.
5. Standing quad stretch
Share on Pinterest
GIF by Dima Bazak
Stand straight with feet shoulder-width apart.
Bring left foot up toward your butt and grab your foot or ankle with left hand.
Hold for 30 seconds, then lower your foot.
Repeat on the other side.
6. Standing hamstring and calf stretch
Share on Pinterest
GIF by Dima Bazak
Stand up straight and stagger your right foot in front of your left foot.
Keeping left heel planted on the floor, flex your right foot with the heel still on the floor.
Lean forward to grab right toes with left hand (place right hand behind your back for support).
Pause here for 30 seconds.
Gently move back into a standing position.
Repeat on the other side.
7. Figure four stretch
Share on Pinterest
GIF by Dima Bazak
Lie faceup and lift your legs off the floor, bending knees at a 90-degree angle.
Place right ankle over left knee, then place your hands on left leg (just below your knee).
Pull your leg toward you until you feel the stretch.
Hold for 30 seconds, then release.
Repeat on the other side.
8. Hamstring stretch
Share on Pinterest
GIF by Dima Bazak
Lie faceup on the floor with legs extended in front of you. Bend right leg in, so your foot is resting next to your left thigh.
Place hands behind your right thigh. Gently straighten right leg with heel flexed as you pull your leg toward your body (stop when you feel the stretch in the back of your leg).
Hold for 30 seconds.
Switch legs and repeat. Try using a stretch strap or a towel if it’s hard to reach your leg.
9. Kneeling hip flexor stretch
Share on Pinterest
GIF by Dima Bazak
Kneel on the floor and step right foot forward, making a 90-degree angle at your hip and knee.
Engage your core and glutes to create an upward tilt in your pelvis. You’ll also feel a light
stretch in your left hip
.
Hold for up to 30 seconds.
Switch legs and repeat.
10. Child’s Pose
Share on Pinterest
GIF by Dima Bazak
Start on all fours
on a mat
, with knees directly under hips and toes pointed behind you.
Slowly sit back so your butt goes down toward your heels.
Lower your chest toward the floor, letting hands slide forward.
Hold for 30 seconds to 1 minute.
Release the pose and rest for 10 seconds.
Repeat at least 3 times.
Takeaway
Daily
stretching
is a great way to keep your body and mind in top form. Plus, you’ll get the added benefits of increased flexibility, improved circulation, and stress relief (yas!).
We know that adding even a short
stretching
routine into your day may seem daunting. If you’re looking for ways to stick to your #goals, these tips may help:
Schedule your stretch sesh for the same time every day.
Start with a short 5-minute routine and work your way up to 10, 15, or even 30 minutes!
Keep it interesting by switching up the types of stretches.
If you experience any pain during a stretch, be sure to stop. Stretches should feel good, or maybe slightly uncomfortable if your muscles are tight, but they shouldn’t hurt.
Pay attention to any sensitive spots and talk with a healthcare professional if you sense that something’s off or you feel more “ouch” than “ahhhh.”

ritual. A daily stretching routine can benefit your overall health by
improving your flexibility
, relieving muscle tension, and reducing stress.

Benefits of daily stretching
Not only does stretching feel oh-so-good, but it’s good for you too! Fitting a 10- to 15-minute stretch sesh into your daily schedule has a ton of health benefits.
Stretching can:
Loosen up tight muscles.
Feeling a bit stiff from your day job or workout?
Stretching
is a great way to relieve any
tightness
and tension.
Increase flexibility and range of motion.
Stretching
helps your muscles and joints become more flexible. And according to a
2012 research review
, stretching can increase your range of motion. This can help you get bendy for
yoga
and just move more easily when walking across your living room.
Improve posture.
Bad desk posture
killing your vibe? A
small 2014 study
suggests that stretching may help you be more aware of your
posture
and avoid that forward slump in your shoulders.
Reduce pain.
Because stretching helps ease muscle tension, it may help reduce pain caused by chronic conditions or injuries. According to a
small 2015 study
, stretching can also help reduce pain
while
correcting poor posture.
Lower your risk of injury.
Working out or doing physical activity without a proper
warmup
can put you on the path to potential injury. A daily stretch sesh
may help prevent strains and sprains.
Boost your circulation.
A
small 2013 study
suggests that stretching is a great way to boost circulation. And better blood flow can benefit your overall
heart health
, improve
muscle recovery
, and reduce
soreness
Relieve stress.
Stretching can help relieve tension for a
stress-free body
and
mind
🧘‍♂️.
Ease headaches.
Stretching can help ease
headache-inducing
tension and provide you with sweet relief.
Your 15-minute daily stretching routine
You can do
stretching exercises
whenever you feel like it. But two great times to add movement to your routine are
right when you wake up
and
before bed
.
If you want to stretch around your
workout routine
, a proper
warmup
is key — and stretching alone may not be enough. But
studies
suggest it’s better to do dynamic stretches (
active movements
that provide a stretch) before a workout and static stretches (in which you hold one position for a while) afterward.
To keep your muscles lean and limber, try this mix of
static
and
dynamic stretches
.

Lower your chest toward the floor, letting hands slide forward.
Hold for 30 seconds to 1 minute.
Release the pose and rest for 10 seconds.
Repeat at least 3 times.
Takeaway
Daily
stretching
is a great way to keep your body and mind in top form. Plus, you’ll get the added benefits of increased flexibility, improved circulation, and stress relief (yas!).
We know that adding even a short
stretching
routine into your day may seem daunting. If you’re looking for ways to stick to your #goals, these tips may help:
Schedule your stretch sesh for the same time every day.
Start with a short 5-minute routine and work your way up to 10, 15, or even 30 minutes!
Keep it interesting by switching up the types of stretches.
If you experience any pain during a stretch, be sure to stop. Stretches should feel good, or maybe slightly uncomfortable if your muscles are tight, but they shouldn’t hurt.
Pay attention to any sensitive spots and talk with a healthcare professional if you sense that something’s off or you feel more “ouch” than “ahhhh.”

Pros of fasting
Cons of fasting

Pre-workout fuel
Post-workout recovery
tl;dr
Deciding to eat before or after a workout can be tricky. Some swear by fasting, others need a pre-workout meal. Discover the pros and cons of each to find what works best for your fitness goals.
Figuring out
what
to eat, whether you’re looking to lose weight or maximize performance, is only one part of the equation. You’ve also got to tackle the question of
when
to eat.
Throw exercise into the mix, and the when-to-eat conundrum gets even trickier. Let’s break it down.

To eat, or not to eat?
There are two camps to the “to eat, or not to eat” before exercise debate.
One side avoids food before morning exercise (save for a cup of coffee because, hello, caffeine). The other gets dizzy at the mere thought of working out without a solid breakfast. Both have legit points.
Exercising on an empty stomach
might make you feel lighter on your toes, and avoid the bathroom run at the gym. But eating ensures you’ve got enough fuel in the tank to make it through your workout.
Pros of fasting before a workout
But there’s more to it than personal preference. Research suggests the breakfast skippers might be onto something, though the science of it is mixed.
One study of 273 participants concluded that fat burning was higher during exercise while fasted, while insulin and glucose levels were higher when not fasted.
Vieira AF, et al. (2016). Effects of aerobic exercise performed in fasted v. fed state on fat and carbohydrate metabolism in adults: a systematic review and meta-analysis. DOI:
10.1017/S0007114516003160
Generally, however, science has not given the final stamp that fasting benefits exercise, as some research shows no difference in either method.
Gillen JB, et al. (2013). Interval training in the fed or fasted state improves body composition and muscle oxidative capacity in overweight women. DOI:
10.1002/oby.20379
Cons of fasting before a workout
If you can handle it, that is. The working-out-on-an-empty-stomach thing is only helpful if you can still perform during your workout. Phoning it in or tapping out halfway because you feel like you might faint won’t cut it.
How long and how hard you’re able to go depends on what and when you last ate the day before. A carb-heavy meal the night before could leave you with enough reserves to make it through your morning run.
It’s worth noting that most people will wake up slightly dehydrated from an overnight fast. Drinking a glass of water (at the very least) is a good idea for every morning exerciser.
Consider your workout type
When it comes to the eating/not eating debate, workout type matters. You might make it through an hour of yoga without stomach growls interrupting your Savasana. But you’re unlikely to make it through a 10-mile run without some kind of nutritional boost.
Longer duration endurance sports in particular have seen evidence of improvement after a high-carb meal 3 to 4 hours before.
Jeukendrup AE. (2011). Nutrition for endurance sports: marathon, triathlon, and road cycling. DOI:
10.1080/02640414.2011.610348
For shorter duration workouts, the science is still mixed. The majority of research shows little difference in performance between fasted and fed exercise in workouts lasting less than an hour.
Aird TP, et al. (2018). Effects of fasted vs fed-state exercise on performance and post-exercise metabolism: A systematic review and meta-analysis. DOI:
10.1111/sms.13054
Your best bet? If you know you’ll be putting in the time for a longer workout or really want to go all out, make sure you have enough energy with a small meal a few hours before.
Pre-workout fuel
For optimal performance, your body needs to fuel up with protein and carbs before a workout.
Carbs build up your body’s glycogen stores, which your liver and muscles release when your energy runs low. Protein helps prevent muscle damage and speed your recovery after a workout session.
Complex (aka slow-burning) carbs like oatmeal, vegetables, brown rice, and beans are best. Protein doesn’t always have to come from a cow. These healthy sources can suit everyone from carnivores to vegans:
eggs
almonds
chicken breast
nut butters
cottage cheese
Greek yogurt
lentils
quinoa
To streamline the process, build protein-carb combos like Greek yogurt with fruit, or eggs and steamed spinach on whole-grain toast. If you’re a roll-out-of-bed-and-go person without that kind of time, try a make-ahead
protein shake
with half of a banana.
As for timing, filling your tank 2 to 3 hours before you exercise yields maximum performance, research finds.
Ormsbee MJ, et al. (2014). Pre-exercise nutrition: The role of macronutrients, modified starches, and supplements on metabolism and endurance performance. DOI:
10.3390/nu6051782
Give your body enough time to digest, especially for endurance activities like running. Undigested food in your stomach can lead to gastrointestinal issues (aka
runner’s stomach
or sprinting to the bathroom instead of your planned run).

Post-workout recovery
Refueling and recovery are the twin goals of post-workout eating. Carbs replenish the glycogen you’ve burned off, while
protein
rebuilds your muscles. Aim for a ratio of 3:1 carbs to protein.
Outlaw JL, et al. (2014). Effects of a pre-and post-workout protein-carbohydrate supplement in trained crossfit individuals. DOI:
10.1186/2193-1801-3-369
Take advantage of the window of recovery, which is within an hour after you finish your workout.
Mohr CR. (2019). Timing your pre- and post-workout nutrition. eatright.org/fitness/exercise/exercise-nutrition/timing-your-pre-and-post-workout-nutrition
Recharge with a smoothie, turkey and veggies on a whole-grain wrap, or yogurt with berries.
Don’t neglect fluid, which you’ll need to replace everything you sweated out at the gym. Water is always a good hydrator, but a glass of milk adds protein and electrolytes into the mix, which could help your recovery, research finds.
Desbrow B, et al. (2014). Comparing the rehydration potential of different milk-based drinks to a carbohydrate–electrolyte beverage.
nrcresearchpress.com/doi/abs/10.1139/apnm-2014-0174
Remember that recovery continues 24 to 48 hours after a hard workout. So don’t neglect the nutritional value of your meals throughout the day.
Bottom line
Research is still super mixed with a few studies in favor of exercising on an empty stomach, so long as your workout is low to medium intensity and your goal is fat loss or maintenance.
Just be on the lookout for signs like these that your body isn’t feeling it:
feeling dizzy or lightheaded
slowing down significantly in the middle of the workout
losing your form
rapid breathing, even if the movements don’t call for it
If you’re gearing up for a more rigorous workout, eat some protein and carbs beforehand. Feeling dizzy during a set of burpees isn’t a great start to the day.
When it comes to fitness, everyone is different. It’s up to you to experiment with different pre- and post-workout foods to find what works best for you.

Vieira AF, et al. (2016). Effects of aerobic exercise performed in fasted v. fed state on fat and carbohydrate metabolism in adults: a systematic review and meta-analysis. DOI:
10.1017/S0007114516003160
Generally, however, science has not given the final stamp that fasting benefits exercise, as some research shows no difference in either method.
Gillen JB, et al. (2013). Interval training in the fed or fasted state improves body composition and muscle oxidative capacity in overweight women. DOI:
10.1002/oby.20379
Cons of fasting before a workout
If you can handle it, that is. The working-out-on-an-empty-stomach thing is only helpful if you can still perform during your workout. Phoning it in or tapping out halfway because you feel like you might faint won’t cut it.
How long and how hard you’re able to go depends on what and when you last ate the day before. A carb-heavy meal the night before could leave you with enough reserves to make it through your morning run.
It’s worth noting that most people will wake up slightly dehydrated from an overnight fast. Drinking a glass of water (at the very least) is a good idea for every morning exerciser.
Consider your workout type
When it comes to the eating/not eating debate, workout type matters. You might make it through an hour of yoga without stomach growls interrupting your Savasana. But you’re unlikely to make it through a 10-mile run without some kind of nutritional boost.
Longer duration endurance sports in particular have seen evidence of improvement after a high-carb meal 3 to 4 hours before.
Jeukendrup AE. (2011). Nutrition for endurance sports: marathon, triathlon, and road cycling. DOI:
10.1080/02640414.2011.610348
For shorter duration workouts, the science is still mixed. The majority of research shows little difference in performance between fasted and fed exercise in workouts lasting less than an hour.
Aird TP, et al. (2018). Effects of fasted vs fed-state exercise on performance and post-exercise metabolism: A systematic review and meta-analysis. DOI:
10.1111/sms.13054
Your best bet? If you know you’ll be putting in the time for a longer workout or really want to go all out, make sure you have enough energy with a small meal a few hours before.
Pre-workout fuel
For optimal performance, your body needs to fuel up with protein and carbs before a workout.
Carbs build up your body’s glycogen stores, which your liver and muscles release when your energy runs low. Protein helps prevent muscle damage and speed your recovery after a workout session.
Complex (aka slow-burning) carbs like oatmeal, vegetables, brown rice, and beans are best. Protein doesn’t always have to come from a cow. These healthy sources can suit everyone from carnivores to vegans:
eggs
almonds
chicken breast
nut butters
cottage cheese
Greek yogurt
lentils
quinoa
To streamline the process, build protein-carb combos like Greek yogurt with fruit, or eggs and steamed spinach on whole-grain toast. If you’re a roll-out-of-bed-and-go person without that kind of time, try a make-ahead
protein shake
with half of a banana.
As for timing, filling your tank 2 to 3 hours before you exercise yields maximum performance, research finds.
Ormsbee MJ, et al. (2014). Pre-exercise nutrition: The role of macronutrients, modified starches, and supplements on metabolism and endurance performance. DOI:
10.3390/nu6051782
Give your body enough time to digest, especially for endurance activities like running. Undigested food in your stomach can lead to gastrointestinal issues (aka
runner’s stomach
or sprinting to the bathroom instead of your planned run).

Post-workout recovery
Refueling and recovery are the twin goals of post-workout eating. Carbs replenish the glycogen you’ve burned off, while
protein
rebuilds your muscles. Aim for a ratio of 3:1 carbs to protein.
Outlaw JL, et al. (2014). Effects of a pre-and post-workout protein-carbohydrate supplement in trained crossfit individuals. DOI:
10.1186/2193-1801-3-369
Take advantage of the window of recovery, which is within an hour after you finish your workout.
Mohr CR. (2019). Timing your pre- and post-workout nutrition. eatright.org/fitness/exercise/exercise-nutrition/timing-your-pre-and-post-workout-nutrition
Recharge with a smoothie, turkey and veggies on a whole-grain wrap, or yogurt with berries.
Don’t neglect fluid, which you’ll need to replace everything you sweated out at the gym. Water is always a good hydrator, but a glass of milk adds protein and electrolytes into the mix, which could help your recovery, research finds.
Desbrow B, et al. (2014). Comparing the rehydration potential of different milk-based drinks to a carbohydrate–electrolyte beverage.
nrcresearchpress.com/doi/abs/10.1139/apnm-2014-0174
Remember that recovery continues 24 to 48 hours after a hard workout. So don’t neglect the nutritional value of your meals throughout the day.
Bottom line
Research is still super mixed with a few studies in favor of exercising on an empty stomach, so long as your workout is low to medium intensity and your goal is fat loss or maintenance.
Just be on the lookout for signs like these that your body isn’t feeling it:
feeling dizzy or lightheaded
slowing down significantly in the middle of the workout
losing your form
rapid breathing, even if the movements don’t call for it
If you’re gearing up for a more rigorous workout, eat some protein and carbs beforehand. Feeling dizzy during a set of burpees isn’t a great start to the day.
When it comes to fitness, everyone is different. It’s up to you to experiment with different pre- and post-workout foods to find what works best for you.

Deciding to eat before or after a workout can be tricky. Some swear by fasting, others need a pre-workout meal. Discover the pros and cons of each to find what works best for your fitness goals.
Figuring out
what
to eat, whether you’re looking to lose weight or maximize performance, is only one part of the equation. You’ve also got to tackle the question of
when
to eat.
Throw exercise into the mix, and the when-to-eat conundrum gets even trickier. Let’s break it down.

To eat, or not to eat?
There are two camps to the “to eat, or not to eat” before exercise debate.
One side avoids food before morning exercise (save for a cup of coffee because, hello, caffeine). The other gets dizzy at the mere thought of working out without a solid breakfast. Both have legit points.
Exercising on an empty stomach
might make you feel lighter on your toes, and avoid the bathroom run at the gym. But eating ensures you’ve got enough fuel in the tank to make it through your workout.

But there’s more to it than personal preference. Research suggests the breakfast skippers might be onto something, though the science of it is mixed.

While some people are up at the crack of dawn to lace up their running shoes, others can’t fathom a workout before noon.
When your priority is just to
squeeze in some exercise
, finding the perfect time can be as much about personal preference as it is physiology.
Still, you may wonder whether one time is better than another for reaching your best times on the
treadmill
or making gains at the
weight bench
.
Exercise is supposed to feel good — but if your muscles are
tight in the morning
or working out too late
disrupts your sleep
, it can feel counterproductive. Here’s a look at the pros and cons of working out at different times of the day.
Working out in the morning: What the research says
When the
alarm
goes off, the last thing most people want to do is roll out of bed, lace up their
sneakers
, and head to the gym. But there are some awesome advantages to a morning workout worth considering.
Your habit may be more consistent
We’ve all been there: the day starts and you think, “I’ll work out later when I’m done with a few things.” But then the evening rolls around and what’s the one box on your to-do list left unchecked? Of course, it’s
the gym
.
Recent research
says that it’s easier to stay consistent with morning workouts because most people have fewer social and work events planned for the morning. It’s also pretty easy to add exercise to an existing
morning routine
.
Other
research
shows that while study participants stuck to their workout routines no matter if they worked out in the a.m. or p.m., adherence was highest in the morning group.
OTOH, afternoon and evening workouts may conflict with other responsibilities as the day progresses. Plus, a full day’s work can take a serious toll on willpower, which can overcome any gym-goer’s best intentions.
You may find that it’s easier to keep a
morning workout
routine consistent. Head out the door before you even have time to second-guess yourself, and by the time you’re 100 percent awake, you’ll already be on the
machines
.
More free time
Think about it. If you’re already done working out by the time 5 p.m. rolls around, you have more time to hang with your friends or fam or spend more time doing things you enjoy (like, a hobby).
You might have less pain
If you currently use movement and exercise as a way to manage chronic pain, it might be worth switching to an a.m. workout.
One study
found that people that worked out in the morning experienced less bodily pain than people that worked out in the evening.
You might sleep better
Morning workouts might also be a good option if you’re the
tossing-and-turning
type.
One study
showed that people who exercise in the morning tend to sleep more efficiently (aka spend less time lying in bed awake) and have fewer awakenings during the night.
Another study
found that morning exercise can help people with
insomnia
sleep better.
Research on this isn’t definitive though —
some studies
have found that evening exercise helps improve sleep too. But it’s safe to say that
most
studies have found that morning workouts are more beneficial for sleep. So, if you currently hit the gym at 7 p.m. and don’t sleep all that well, it might be worth trying 7 a.m. instead.
You’ll be less hungry
A review of studies
found that exercise can help
curb appetite
after working out. Another study found that women who worked out in the morning had a much lower calorie intake compared to those who worked out in the evening.
If you’d like to
keep hunger at bay
later in the day, a morning workout might be for you.
You may burn more fat
It’s also
been proven
that people can
burn more body fat
exercising on an
empty stomach
— much easier to do first thing in the a.m. than at night.
Working out in the afternoon: What the research says
If you can’t fit in a workout in the a.m., don’t sweat it (literally). There are plenty of reasons why exercising later in the day can be a smart choice too.
You might perform better
Multiple studies
have found that peeps perform better at short-duration maximal exercise (like all-out swimming and cycling, jumping, sprinting, and resistance exercises) in the evening.
There are ways to improve morning workout performance — like warming up or working out at the same time every day — but when all else is equal, evenings have the advantage.
You’re already warmed up
Your body temp is naturally higher
in the evening, so your muscles are warmer. Warmer muscles are associated with better performance.
In fact,
researchers
found that being exposed to warm weather/humid conditions and doing pre-workout warmups can make morning workout performance more on par with an evening performance.
So, while you can make changes to improve morning workout performance, your bod already has a natural edge at night.
You might get bigger gains
A study
found that people who worked out in the evening
gained more muscle mass
between weeks 13 to 24 of consistent training than people who worked out in the morning. If you’re trying to gain some serious muscle, evening workouts might do ya better in the long term.
Hormone levels also play a role in determining optimal workout time. Testosterone is
important for muscle growth
and strength — as well as
stamina
— no matter your sex. The body
may produce more testosterone
during late afternoon resistance training than it does during morning workouts.
You might be more motivated to actually work out
Motivation is a huge obstacle for lots of people. Working out is
hard
, right??
One study
suggests that it’s harder to stay motivated to stick to a prolonged training program that takes place in the morning. So, if getting to the gym is your biggest issue, evening workouts might be easier to stick to in the long run.
The best time to work out depends on you
Some
research
shows that your chronotype (aka whether you’re a morning person or an evening person) plays a role in when you perform best. If you like to work out in the morning, that’s amazing. If you like working out in the evening, keep doing your thing.
But if your current workout sched isn’t working for you, it’s possible to change.
Research
suggests the body could get used to regular sweat seshes, so if you hit the weight room every day at 4 p.m. (or any other time), eventually you might perform better than at other times of the day.
These findings are similar to other
research
, which suggests that the body could adapt to regular exercise by altering your
circadian rhythm
.
The bottom line
In the end, working out is good for you no matter what time of day you do it. If you want to take it up a notch, consider being more consistent.
Research
shows that peeps who work out consistently at the same time of day see better results, regardless of whether they choose morning, noon, or night to hit the gym.
If working out in the morning is best for your schedule, just make sure to
warm up muscles
that might be cold and tight from sleep.
And to keep afternoon workouts consistent, treat them as unbreakable appointments, find a workout buddy, and keep a gym bag in the car or office to minimize excuses.
In the end, it’s most important to find a realistic, consistent workout schedule, no matter what the time.

While some people are up at the crack of dawn to lace up their running shoes, others can’t fathom a workout before noon.
When your priority is just to
squeeze in some exercise
, finding the perfect time can be as much about personal preference as it is physiology.
Still, you may wonder whether one time is better than another for reaching your best times on the
treadmill
or making gains at the
weight bench
.
Exercise is supposed to feel good — but if your muscles are
tight in the morning
or working out too late
disrupts your sleep
, it can feel counterproductive. Here’s a look at the pros and cons of working out at different times of the day.
Working out in the morning: What the research says
When the
alarm
goes off, the last thing most people want to do is roll out of bed, lace up their
sneakers
, and head to the gym. But there are some awesome advantages to a morning workout worth considering.
Your habit may be more consistent
We’ve all been there: the day starts and you think, “I’ll work out later when I’m done with a few things.” But then the evening rolls around and what’s the one box on your to-do list left unchecked? Of course, it’s
the gym
.
Recent research
says that it’s easier to stay consistent with morning workouts because most people have fewer social and work events planned for the morning. It’s also pretty easy to add exercise to an existing
morning routine
.
Other
research
shows that while study participants stuck to their workout routines no matter if they worked out in the a.m. or p.m., adherence was highest in the morning group.
OTOH, afternoon and evening workouts may conflict with other responsibilities as the day progresses. Plus, a full day’s work can take a serious toll on willpower, which can overcome any gym-goer’s best intentions.
You may find that it’s easier to keep a
morning workout
routine consistent. Head out the door before you even have time to second-guess yourself, and by the time you’re 100 percent awake, you’ll already be on the
machines
.
More free time
Think about it. If you’re already done working out by the time 5 p.m. rolls around, you have more time to hang with your friends or fam or spend more time doing things you enjoy (like, a hobby).
You might have less pain
If you currently use movement and exercise as a way to manage chronic pain, it might be worth switching to an a.m. workout.
One study
found that people that worked out in the morning experienced less bodily pain than people that worked out in the evening.
You might sleep better
Morning workouts might also be a good option if you’re the
tossing-and-turning
type.
One study
showed that people who exercise in the morning tend to sleep more efficiently (aka spend less time lying in bed awake) and have fewer awakenings during the night.
Another study
found that morning exercise can help people with
insomnia
sleep better.
Research on this isn’t definitive though —
some studies
have found that evening exercise helps improve sleep too. But it’s safe to say that
most
studies have found that morning workouts are more beneficial for sleep. So, if you currently hit the gym at 7 p.m. and don’t sleep all that well, it might be worth trying 7 a.m. instead.
You’ll be less hungry
A review of studies
found that exercise can help
curb appetite
after working out. Another study found that women who worked out in the morning had a much lower calorie intake compared to those who worked out in the evening.
If you’d like to
keep hunger at bay
later in the day, a morning workout might be for you.
You may burn more fat
It’s also
been proven
that people can
burn more body fat
exercising on an
empty stomach
— much easier to do first thing in the a.m. than at night.
Working out in the afternoon: What the research says
If you can’t fit in a workout in the a.m., don’t sweat it (literally). There are plenty of reasons why exercising later in the day can be a smart choice too.
You might perform better
Multiple studies
have found that peeps perform better at short-duration maximal exercise (like all-out swimming and cycling, jumping, sprinting, and resistance exercises) in the evening.
There are ways to improve morning workout performance — like warming up or working out at the same time every day — but when all else is equal, evenings have the advantage.
You’re already warmed up
Your body temp is naturally higher
in the evening, so your muscles are warmer. Warmer muscles are associated with better performance.
In fact,
researchers
found that being exposed to warm weather/humid conditions and doing pre-workout warmups can make morning workout performance more on par with an evening performance.
So, while you can make changes to improve morning workout performance, your bod already has a natural edge at night.
You might get bigger gains
A study
found that people who worked out in the evening
gained more muscle mass
between weeks 13 to 24 of consistent training than people who worked out in the morning. If you’re trying to gain some serious muscle, evening workouts might do ya better in the long term.

Think about it. If you’re already done working out by the time 5 p.m. rolls around, you have more time to hang with your friends or fam or spend more time doing things you enjoy (like, a hobby).
You might have less pain
If you currently use movement and exercise as a way to manage chronic pain, it might be worth switching to an a.m. workout.
One study
found that people that worked out in the morning experienced less bodily pain than people that worked out in the evening.
You might sleep better
Morning workouts might also be a good option if you’re the
tossing-and-turning
type.
One study
showed that people who exercise in the morning tend to sleep more efficiently (aka spend less time lying in bed awake) and have fewer awakenings during the night.
Another study
found that morning exercise can help people with
insomnia
sleep better.
Research on this isn’t definitive though —
some studies
have found that evening exercise helps improve sleep too. But it’s safe to say that
most
studies have found that morning workouts are more beneficial for sleep. So, if you currently hit the gym at 7 p.m. and don’t sleep all that well, it might be worth trying 7 a.m. instead.
You’ll be less hungry
A review of studies
found that exercise can help
curb appetite
after working out. Another study found that women who worked out in the morning had a much lower calorie intake compared to those who worked out in the evening.
If you’d like to
keep hunger at bay
later in the day, a morning workout might be for you.
You may burn more fat
It’s also
been proven
that people can
burn more body fat
exercising on an
empty stomach
— much easier to do first thing in the a.m. than at night.
Working out in the afternoon: What the research says
If you can’t fit in a workout in the a.m., don’t sweat it (literally). There are plenty of reasons why exercising later in the day can be a smart choice too.
You might perform better
Multiple studies
have found that peeps perform better at short-duration maximal exercise (like all-out swimming and cycling, jumping, sprinting, and resistance exercises) in the evening.
There are ways to improve morning workout performance — like warming up or working out at the same time every day — but when all else is equal, evenings have the advantage.
You’re already warmed up
Your body temp is naturally higher
in the evening, so your muscles are warmer. Warmer muscles are associated with better performance.
In fact,
researchers
found that being exposed to warm weather/humid conditions and doing pre-workout warmups can make morning workout performance more on par with an evening performance.
So, while you can make changes to improve morning workout performance, your bod already has a natural edge at night.
You might get bigger gains
A study
found that people who worked out in the evening
gained more muscle mass
between weeks 13 to 24 of consistent training than people who worked out in the morning. If you’re trying to gain some serious muscle, evening workouts might do ya better in the long term.
Hormone levels also play a role in determining optimal workout time. Testosterone is
important for muscle growth
and strength — as well as
stamina
— no matter your sex. The body
may produce more testosterone
during late afternoon resistance training than it does during morning workouts.
You might be more motivated to actually work out
Motivation is a huge obstacle for lots of people. Working out is
hard
, right??
One study
suggests that it’s harder to stay motivated to stick to a prolonged training program that takes place in the morning. So, if getting to the gym is your biggest issue, evening workouts might be easier to stick to in the long run.
The best time to work out depends on you
Some
research
shows that your chronotype (aka whether you’re a morning person or an evening person) plays a role in when you perform best. If you like to work out in the morning, that’s amazing. If you like working out in the evening, keep doing your thing.
But if your current workout sched isn’t working for you, it’s possible to change.
Research
suggests the body could get used to regular sweat seshes, so if you hit the weight room every day at 4 p.m. (or any other time), eventually you might perform better than at other times of the day.
These findings are similar to other
research
, which suggests that the body could adapt to regular exercise by altering your
circadian rhythm
.
The bottom line
In the end, working out is good for you no matter what time of day you do it. If you want to take it up a notch, consider being more consistent.
Research
shows that peeps who work out consistently at the same time of day see better results, regardless of whether they choose morning, noon, or night to hit the gym.
If working out in the morning is best for your schedule, just make sure to
warm up muscles
that might be cold and tight from sleep.
And to keep afternoon workouts consistent, treat them as unbreakable appointments, find a workout buddy, and keep a gym bag in the car or office to minimize excuses.
In the end, it’s most important to find a realistic, consistent workout schedule, no matter what the time.

tl;dr
Working out can provide a wealth of mental and physical benefits, like stress relief and a cognitive boost. Your body and your mind will thank you!
Share on Pinterest
While you’re feeling that burn, you may also feel like you want to be literally anywhere other than the gym. But your body is thanking you the whole time — exercise has powerful effects on both the body and the mind.
Many people hit the gym or pound the pavement to improve cardiovascular health, build muscle, and of course, get a rockin’ bod. But working out has above-the-neck benefits too.
For the past decade or so, scientists have pondered how exercising can
boost brain function
.
Studies show that making time for exercise provides some serious mental benefits, regardless of your age or fitness level (yup, this includes everyone from mall walkers to marathoners).
Get inspired to exercise by reading up on these unexpected ways working out can benefit your
mental health
, improve your relationships, and help you lead a healthier and happier life. (Not a bad payoff for, like, an hour of being a bit sweaty.)
1. Reduce stress
Rough day at the office? Spilled coffee and got your tie stuck in the shredder? Lacey in Accounts threw stuff at you again? Chill out by taking a walk or heading to the gym for a
quick workout
.
One of the most common mental benefits of exercise is stress relief. Working up a sweat can help you manage
physical and mental stress
. Exercise also increases concentrations of norepinephrine, a chemical that can moderate your brain’s
response to stress
.
So go ahead and get sweaty — it can reduce stress
and
boost your body’s ability to deal with existing mental tension. Win-win! And boo to Lacey — we got your back in the Accounts beef.
2. Boost happy chemicals
Slogging through a few miles on the ’mill can be tough, but it’s worth the effort.
Exercise causes your body to produce endorphins, which trigger feelings of
happiness
and euphoria. Research has shown that in people with major depression, exercise can increase the chance of remission by 22 percent by circulating endorphins.
Belvederi Murri M, et al. (2018). Physical exercise in major depression: Reducing the mortality gap while improving clinical outcomes. DOI:
10.3389/fpsyt.2018.00762
For this reason,
docs recommend
that people dealing with depression or anxiety (or those who are just feeling blue) pencil in some gym time. A 2013 study found no difference between the effectiveness of antidepressants and exercise.
Blumenthal JA, et al. (2013). Is exercise a viable treatment for depression? DOI:
10.1249/01.FIT.0000416000.09526.eb
Don’t worry if you’re not exactly the gym-rat type — working out for just 30 minutes a few times a week can instantly boost your overall mood.
Sharma A, et al. (2006). Exercise for mental health.
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1470658/
3. Improve self-confidence
If you’re not quite at Fonz-level self-confidence just yet, don’t worry — not all of us have to jump the shark to feel great. Hopping on the treadmill can help you feel like a million bucks too.
On a very basic level, physical fitness can boost self-esteem and improve positive self-image.
Sani S, et al. (2016). Physical activity and self-esteem: Testing direct and indirect relationships associated with psychological and physical mechanisms.
https://www.dovepress.com/physical-activity-and-self-esteem-testing-direct-and-indirect-relation-peer-reviewed-fulltext-article-NDT
Regardless of weight, size, gender, or age, exercise can quickly elevate a person’s perception of their attractiveness.
Elavsky S. (2010). Longitudinal examination of the exercise and self-esteem model in middle-aged women.
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3603361/
Exercise is your way of reminding yourself how beautiful you are. So step on the CrossFit and send your soul some flirty DMs!
4. Enjoy the great outdoors
For an extra boost of self-love, take your workout to the great outdoors. Exercising outside can increase self-esteem even more.
Gladwell V, et al. (2013). The great outdoors: How a green exercise environment can benefit all. DOI:
10.1186/2046-7648-2-3
Find an outdoor workout that fits your style, whether it’s rock climbing, hiking, canoeing, or just taking a jog in the park. Even a long walk through verdant pastures and beautiful landscapes can be nourishing for your body and mind.
Plus, all that
vitamin D
from soaking up the sun (while wearing
sunscreen
, of course!) can reduce your risk of experiencing symptoms of depression.
Why book a spa day when a little fresh air and sunshine (and exercise) can work wonders for self-confidence and happiness?
5. Prevent cognitive decline
It’s unpleasant, but it’s true: As we get older, our brains get a little… hazy. As aging and degenerative conditions like Alzheimer’s disease kill off brain cells, the noggin shrinks, damaging many important brain functions in the process.
While exercise and a healthy diet can’t “cure” Alzheimer’s, they can help shore up your brain against cognitive decline that begins after age 45.
Intlekofer KA, et al. (2013). Exercise counteracts declining hippocampal function in aging and Alzheimer’s disease. DOI:
10.1016/j.nbd.2012.06.011
Working out also boosts the chemicals that support and prevent degeneration of the hippocampus, an important part of your brain for memory and learning.
Liu P, et al. (2018). Exercise-mediated neurogenesis in the hippocampus via BDNF. DOI:
10.3389/fnins.2018.00052
Going for a run now might help you do better in that game of bridge in 40 years.
6. Alleviate anxiety
Pop quiz, hotshot: Which is better at relieving anxiety — a warm bubble bath or a 20-minute jog?
You might be surprised at the answer. (Don’t try jogging in the bath — it is not a safe pastime.)
The warm and fuzzy chemicals that start to swim around your body after exercise can help soothe people with
anxiety disorders
.
Hopping on the track or treadmill for some moderate-to-high intensity aerobic exercise (
intervals
, anyone?) can reduce anxiety symptoms. In a small 2018 study of people with a diagnosis of panic disorder, regular moderate-to-hard exercise led to a greater reduction in anxiety than light exercise.
Lattari E, et al. (2018). Effects of aerobic exercise on anxiety symptoms and cortical activity in patients with panic disorder: A pilot study. DOI:
10.2174/1745017901814010011
7. Boost brainpower
Brawn and brains are not mutually exclusive. Studies have shown that cardiovascular exercise can create new brain cells and improve overall brain performance.
Griffin WE, et al. (2011). Aerobic exercise improves hippocampal function and increases BDNF in the serum of young adult males. DOI:
10.1016/j.physbeh.2011.06.005
(Why do you think
The Hulk
is so good at science?)
Ready to apply for a Nobel Prize? A 2019 study suggests that a tough workout increases levels of a brain-derived protein called BDNF, which
may help
with decision making, higher thinking, and learning.
De la Rosa A, et al. (2019). Long-term exercise training improves memory in middle-aged men and modulates peripheral levels of BDNF and cathepsin B. DOI:
10.1038/s41598-019-40040-8
So, spandex pants may lead to being a smartypants — so long as you exercise while you’re in ’em.
8. Sharpen memory
Get ready to win big at Go Fish and Pairs: Regular physical activity boosts memory and the ability to learn new things.
Working up a sweat increases production of cells in the hippocampus that are responsible for memory and learning.
Erickson KI, et al. (2011). Exercise training increases size of hippocampus and improves memory. DOI:
10.1073/pnas.1015950108
For this reason, research has linked children’s brain development with their level of physical fitness (take that, recess haters!).
Geertsen S, et al. (2016). Motor skills and exercise capacity are associated with objective measures of cognitive functions and academic performance in preadolescent children. DOI:
10.1371/journal.pone.0161960
But exercise-based brainpower isn’t just for kids.
Even if it’s not as fun as a game of Tag, working out can boost memory among grown-ups too. A 2006 study found that running sprints improved vocabulary retention among healthy adults.
Winter B, et al. (2006). High impact running improves learning. DOI:
10.1016/j.nlm.2006.11.003
And a 2018 study found that adults performed better on memory tests after short periods of light exercise.
Suwabe K, et al. (2018). Rapid stimulation of human dentate gyrus function with acute mild exercise. DOI:
10.1073/pnas.1805668115
9. Help manage addiction
The brain releases
dopamine
, the “reward chemical,” in response to any form of pleasure. And yes, our good friend exercise can kick off a considerable wave of dopamine.
However, so do drugs and alcohol. This reward cycle in the brain can lead to patterns of
substance use disorder
.
Exercise is there for people while they recover from addiction.
Brown AR, et al. (2010). Aerobic exercise for alcohol recovery: Rationale, program description, and preliminary findings short.
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2829243/
Physical activity can
distract people
from cravings when they’re trying to quit smoking.
Taylor AH, et al. (2007). The acute effects of exercise on cigarette cravings, withdrawal symptoms, affect and smoking behaviour: A systematic review. DOI:
10.1111/j.1360-0443.2006.01739.x
Working out while on the wagon has other benefits too. Excessive alcohol use disrupts many body processes, including
circadian rhythms
. As a result, people with alcohol use disorder may find they have trouble falling asleep without drinking.
A 2010 study on animals suggested that exercise might help
reset the body clock
so people can hit the hay at the right time without alcohol.
Hammer SB, et al. (2010). Environmental modulation of alcohol intake in hamsters: Effects of wheel running and constant light exposure.
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2929273/
10. Increase relaxation
Lifting 50-kilo dumbbells doesn’t seem that relaxing… but have you ever caught some Zzz’s after a long run or weight session at the gym? Doesn’t it feel
blissful
?
That’s because a moderate workout can be the equivalent of a sleeping pill, even for people with insomnia.
Passos GS, et al. (2011). Effects of moderate aerobic exercise training on chronic primary insomnia. DOI:
10.1016/j.sleep.2011.02.007
Exercising 5 to 6 hours before bedtime raises your body’s core temperature. When your temp drops back to normal a few hours later, it signals to your body that it’s time to sleep.
Youngstedt SD, et al. (2005). Effects of exercise on sleep. DOI:
10.1016/j.csm.2004.12.003
Kline CE. (2014). The bidirectional relationship between exercise and sleep: Implications for exercise adherence and sleep improvement.
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4341978/
That delicious sleepy feeling after exercise can help you wind down far enough to get some hearty sleep. But it can also help you relax in the meantime.
11. Get more done
Feeling uninspired in the cubicle? The solution might be just a short
walk
or jog away. Research suggests that workers who take time for regular exercise are more productive and have more energy than their more sedentary peers.
von Thiele Schwarz U, et al. (2011). Employee self-rated productivity and objective organizational production levels: Effects of worksite health interventions involving reduced work hours and physical exercise. DOI:
10.1097/JOM.0b013e31822589c2
While busy schedules can make it tough to squeeze in a gym session in the middle of the day, some experts believe that
midday
is the ideal time for a workout due to the body’s circadian rhythms.
12. Tap into creativity
Most people follow a tough workout with a hot shower, but maybe we should be breaking out the colored pencils instead. (Showering in paint, however, is inadvisable.)
A heart-pumping gym session can boost creativity and spontaneous thinking.
Rominger C, et al. (2019). Creative challenge: Regular exercising moderates the association between task-related heart rate variability changes and individual differences in originality. DOI:
10.1371/journal.pone.0220205
We can safely assume Vin Diesel worked out for his “Fast and Furious” roles
after
the scripts were written.
You can supercharge that post-workout inspiration by exercising outdoors (see benefit #4).
Atchley RA, et al. (2012). Creativity in the wild: Improving creative reasoning through immersion in natural settings. DOI:
10.1371/journal.pone.0051474
Next time you need a burst of creative thinking,
hit the trails
for a long walk or run to refresh your body and brain at the same time. Sitting at home, slouched over a keyboard, may not be the answer.
13. Inspire others
Whether it’s a pick-up game of soccer, a group class at the gym, or just a run with a friend, exercise rarely happens in a bubble. And that’s good news for all of us.
Studies show that most people
perform better
during aerobic tests when paired with a workout buddy.
Irwin BC, et al. (2012). Aerobic exercise is promoted when individual performance affects the group: A test of the Kohler Motivation Gain Effect. DOI:
10.1007/s12160-012-9367-4
It could be the result of inspiration or good old-fashioned competition — nobody wants to let the other person down.
In fact, being part of a team is so powerful that it can actually increase athletes’ tolerance for pain.
Cohen EEA, et al. (2010). Rowers’ high: Behavioural synchrony is correlated with elevated pain thresholds. DOI:
10.1098/rsbl.2009.0670
Even fitness beginners can inspire each other to push harder during a sweat session.
Feltz DL, et al. (2012). Two-player partnered exergame for obesity prevention: Using discrepancy in players’ abilities as a strategy to motivate physical activity.
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3440153/
Find yourself a workout buddy and motivate each other!
tl;dr
Working out can have positive effects far beyond those rippling biceps. Gaining self-confidence, getting out of a funk, and even thinking more creatively are some of the great reasons to exercise on a regular basis.
You might think exercise isn’t for you — but it’s for everybody, and it’s never too late to start. We’ve got some
tips to help you start lifting
, whatever your age.
And you don’t need to have obscene amounts of money to access gym equipment. Here are
21 ideas for setting up a home gym
that don’t require much more than a trip to Home Depot and some elbow grease.
The possibilities and benefits are endless. Let’s get moving!

tl;dr
Working out can provide a wealth of mental and physical benefits, like stress relief and a cognitive boost. Your body and your mind will thank you!
Share on Pinterest
While you’re feeling that burn, you may also feel like you want to be literally anywhere other than the gym. But your body is thanking you the whole time — exercise has powerful effects on both the body and the mind.
Many people hit the gym or pound the pavement to improve cardiovascular health, build muscle, and of course, get a rockin’ bod. But working out has above-the-neck benefits too.
For the past decade or so, scientists have pondered how exercising can
boost brain function
.
Studies show that making time for exercise provides some serious mental benefits, regardless of your age or fitness level (yup, this includes everyone from mall walkers to marathoners).
Get inspired to exercise by reading up on these unexpected ways working out can benefit your
mental health
, improve your relationships, and help you lead a healthier and happier life. (Not a bad payoff for, like, an hour of being a bit sweaty.)
1. Reduce stress
Rough day at the office? Spilled coffee and got your tie stuck in the shredder? Lacey in Accounts threw stuff at you again? Chill out by taking a walk or heading to the gym for a
quick workout
.
One of the most common mental benefits of exercise is stress relief. Working up a sweat can help you manage
physical and mental stress
. Exercise also increases concentrations of norepinephrine, a chemical that can moderate your brain’s
response to stress
.
So go ahead and get sweaty — it can reduce stress
and
boost your body’s ability to deal with existing mental tension. Win-win! And boo to Lacey — we got your back in the Accounts beef.
2. Boost happy chemicals
Slogging through a few miles on the ’mill can be tough, but it’s worth the effort.
Exercise causes your body to produce endorphins, which trigger feelings of
happiness
and euphoria. Research has shown that in people with major depression, exercise can increase the chance of remission by 22 percent by circulating endorphins.
Belvederi Murri M, et al. (2018). Physical exercise in major depression: Reducing the mortality gap while improving clinical outcomes. DOI:
10.3389/fpsyt.2018.00762
For this reason,
docs recommend
that people dealing with depression or anxiety (or those who are just feeling blue) pencil in some gym time. A 2013 study found no difference between the effectiveness of antidepressants and exercise.
Blumenthal JA, et al. (2013). Is exercise a viable treatment for depression? DOI:
10.1249/01.FIT.0000416000.09526.eb
Don’t worry if you’re not exactly the gym-rat type — working out for just 30 minutes a few times a week can instantly boost your overall mood.
Sharma A, et al. (2006). Exercise for mental health.
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1470658/
3. Improve self-confidence
If you’re not quite at Fonz-level self-confidence just yet, don’t worry — not all of us have to jump the shark to feel great. Hopping on the treadmill can help you feel like a million bucks too.
On a very basic level, physical fitness can boost self-esteem and improve positive self-image.
Sani S, et al. (2016). Physical activity and self-esteem: Testing direct and indirect relationships associated with psychological and physical mechanisms.
https://www.dovepress.com/physical-activity-and-self-esteem-testing-direct-and-indirect-relation-peer-reviewed-fulltext-article-NDT
Regardless of weight, size, gender, or age, exercise can quickly elevate a person’s perception of their attractiveness.
Elavsky S. (2010). Longitudinal examination of the exercise and self-esteem model in middle-aged women.
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3603361/
Exercise is your way of reminding yourself how beautiful you are. So step on the CrossFit and send your soul some flirty DMs!
4. Enjoy the great outdoors
For an extra boost of self-love, take your workout to the great outdoors. Exercising outside can increase self-esteem even more.
Gladwell V, et al. (2013). The great outdoors: How a green exercise environment can benefit all. DOI:
10.1186/2046-7648-2-3
Find an outdoor workout that fits your style, whether it’s rock climbing, hiking, canoeing, or just taking a jog in the park. Even a long walk through verdant pastures and beautiful landscapes can be nourishing for your body and mind.
Plus, all that
vitamin D
from soaking up the sun (while wearing
sunscreen
, of course!) can reduce your risk of experiencing symptoms of depression.
Why book a spa day when a little fresh air and sunshine (and exercise) can work wonders for self-confidence and happiness?
5. Prevent cognitive decline
It’s unpleasant, but it’s true: As we get older, our brains get a little… hazy. As aging and degenerative conditions like Alzheimer’s disease kill off brain cells, the noggin shrinks, damaging many important brain functions in the process.
While exercise and a healthy diet can’t “cure” Alzheimer’s, they can help shore up your brain against cognitive decline that begins after age 45.
Intlekofer KA, et al. (2013). Exercise counteracts declining hippocampal function in aging and Alzheimer’s disease. DOI:
10.1016/j.nbd.2012.06.011
Working out also boosts the chemicals that support and prevent degeneration of the hippocampus, an important part of your brain for memory and learning.
Liu P, et al. (2018). Exercise-mediated neurogenesis in the hippocampus via BDNF. DOI:
10.3389/fnins.2018.00052
Going for a run now might help you do better in that game of bridge in 40 years.
6. Alleviate anxiety
Pop quiz, hotshot: Which is better at relieving anxiety — a warm bubble bath or a 20-minute jog?
You might be surprised at the answer. (Don’t try jogging in the bath — it is not a safe pastime.)
The warm and fuzzy chemicals that start to swim around your body after exercise can help soothe people with
anxiety disorders
.
Hopping on the track or treadmill for some moderate-to-high intensity aerobic exercise (
intervals
, anyone?) can reduce anxiety symptoms. In a small 2018 study of people with a diagnosis of panic disorder, regular moderate-to-hard exercise led to a greater reduction in anxiety than light exercise.
Lattari E, et al. (2018). Effects of aerobic exercise on anxiety symptoms and cortical activity in patients with panic disorder: A pilot study. DOI:
10.2174/1745017901814010011
7. Boost brainpower
Brawn and brains are not mutually exclusive. Studies have shown that cardiovascular exercise can create new brain cells and improve overall brain performance.
Griffin WE, et al. (2011). Aerobic exercise improves hippocampal function and increases BDNF in the serum of young adult males. DOI:
10.1016/j.physbeh.2011.06.005
(Why do you think
The Hulk
is so good at science?)
Ready to apply for a Nobel Prize? A 2019 study suggests that a tough workout increases levels of a brain-derived protein called BDNF, which
may help
with decision making, higher thinking, and learning.
De la Rosa A, et al. (2019). Long-term exercise training improves memory in middle-aged men and modulates peripheral levels of BDNF and cathepsin B. DOI:
10.1038/s41598-019-40040-8
So, spandex pants may lead to being a smartypants — so long as you exercise while you’re in ’em.
8. Sharpen memory
Get ready to win big at Go Fish and Pairs: Regular physical activity boosts memory and the ability to learn new things.
Working up a sweat increases production of cells in the hippocampus that are responsible for memory and learning.
Erickson KI, et al. (2011). Exercise training increases size of hippocampus and improves memory. DOI:
10.1073/pnas.1015950108
For this reason, research has linked children’s brain development with their level of physical fitness (take that, recess haters!).
Geertsen S, et al. (2016). Motor skills and exercise capacity are associated with objective measures of cognitive functions and academic performance in preadolescent children. DOI:
10.1371/journal.pone.0161960
But exercise-based brainpower isn’t just for kids.
Even if it’s not as fun as a game of Tag, working out can boost memory among grown-ups too. A 2006 study found that running sprints improved vocabulary retention among healthy adults.
Winter B, et al. (2006). High impact running improves learning. DOI:
10.1016/j.nlm.2006.11.003
And a 2018 study found that adults performed better on memory tests after short periods of light exercise.
Suwabe K, et al. (2018). Rapid stimulation of human dentate gyrus function with acute mild exercise. DOI:
10.1073/pnas.1805668115
9. Help manage addiction
The brain releases
dopamine
, the “reward chemical,” in response to any form of pleasure. And yes, our good friend exercise can kick off a considerable wave of dopamine.
However, so do drugs and alcohol. This reward cycle in the brain can lead to patterns of
substance use disorder
.
Exercise is there for people while they recover from addiction.
Brown AR, et al. (2010). Aerobic exercise for alcohol recovery: Rationale, program description, and preliminary findings short.
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2829243/
Physical activity can
distract people
from cravings when they’re trying to quit smoking.
Taylor AH, et al. (2007). The acute effects of exercise on cigarette cravings, withdrawal symptoms, affect and smoking behaviour: A systematic review. DOI:
10.1111/j.1360-0443.2006.01739.x
Working out while on the wagon has other benefits too. Excessive alcohol use disrupts many body processes, including
circadian rhythms
. As a result, people with alcohol use disorder may find they have trouble falling asleep without drinking.
A 2010 study on animals suggested that exercise might help
reset the body clock
so people can hit the hay at the right time without alcohol.
Hammer SB, et al. (2010). Environmental modulation of alcohol intake in hamsters: Effects of wheel running and constant light exposure.
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2929273/
10. Increase relaxation
Lifting 50-kilo dumbbells doesn’t seem that relaxing… but have you ever caught some Zzz’s after a long run or weight session at the gym? Doesn’t it feel
blissful
?
That’s because a moderate workout can be the equivalent of a sleeping pill, even for people with insomnia.
Passos GS, et al. (2011). Effects of moderate aerobic exercise training on chronic primary insomnia. DOI:
10.1016/j.sleep.2011.02.007
Exercising 5 to 6 hours before bedtime raises your body’s core temperature. When your temp drops back to normal a few hours later, it signals to your body that it’s time to sleep.
Youngstedt SD, et al. (2005). Effects of exercise on sleep. DOI:
10.1016/j.csm.2004.12.003
Kline CE. (2014). The bidirectional relationship between exercise and sleep: Implications for exercise adherence and sleep improvement.
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4341978/
That delicious sleepy feeling after exercise can help you wind down far enough to get some hearty sleep. But it can also help you relax in the meantime.
11. Get more done
Feeling uninspired in the cubicle? The solution might be just a short
walk
or jog away. Research suggests that workers who take time for regular exercise are more productive and have more energy than their more sedentary peers.
von Thiele Schwarz U, et al. (2011). Employee self-rated productivity and objective organizational production levels: Effects of worksite health interventions involving reduced work hours and physical exercise. DOI:
10.1097/JOM.0b013e31822589c2
While busy schedules can make it tough to squeeze in a gym session in the middle of the day, some experts believe that
midday
is the ideal time for a workout due to the body’s circadian rhythms.
12. Tap into creativity
Most people follow a tough workout with a hot shower, but maybe we should be breaking out the colored pencils instead. (Showering in paint, however, is inadvisable.)
A heart-pumping gym session can boost creativity and spontaneous thinking.
Rominger C, et al. (2019). Creative challenge: Regular exercising moderates the association between task-related heart rate variability changes and individual differences in originality. DOI:
10.1371/journal.pone.0220205
We can safely assume Vin Diesel worked out for his “Fast and Furious” roles
after
the scripts were written.
You can supercharge that post-workout inspiration by exercising outdoors (see benefit #4).
Atchley RA, et al. (2012). Creativity in the wild: Improving creative reasoning through immersion in natural settings. DOI:
10.1371/journal.pone.0051474
Next time you need a burst of creative thinking,
hit the trails
for a long walk or run to refresh your body and brain at the same time. Sitting at home, slouched over a keyboard, may not be the answer.
13. Inspire others
Whether it’s a pick-up game of soccer, a group class at the gym, or just a run with a friend, exercise rarely happens in a bubble. And that’s good news for all of us.
Studies show that most people
perform better
during aerobic tests when paired with a workout buddy.
Irwin BC, et al. (2012). Aerobic exercise is promoted when individual performance affects the group: A test of the Kohler Motivation Gain Effect. DOI:
10.1007/s12160-012-9367-4
It could be the result of inspiration or good old-fashioned competition — nobody wants to let the other person down.
In fact, being part of a team is so powerful that it can actually increase athletes’ tolerance for pain.
Cohen EEA, et al. (2010). Rowers’ high: Behavioural synchrony is correlated with elevated pain thresholds. DOI:
10.1098/rsbl.2009.0670
Even fitness beginners can inspire each other to push harder during a sweat session.
Feltz DL, et al. (2012). Two-player partnered exergame for obesity prevention: Using discrepancy in players’ abilities as a strategy to motivate physical activity.
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3440153/
Find yourself a workout buddy and motivate each other!
tl;dr
Working out can have positive effects far beyond those rippling biceps. Gaining self-confidence, getting out of a funk, and even thinking more creatively are some of the great reasons to exercise on a regular basis.
You might think exercise isn’t for you — but it’s for everybody, and it’s never too late to start. We’ve got some
tips to help you start lifting
, whatever your age.
And you don’t need to have obscene amounts of money to access gym equipment. Here are
21 ideas for setting up a home gym
that don’t require much more than a trip to Home Depot and some elbow grease.
The possibilities and benefits are endless. Let’s get moving!

Motivation for others
tl;dr
Working out can provide a wealth of mental and physical benefits, like stress relief and a cognitive boost. Your body and your mind will thank you!
Share on Pinterest
While you’re feeling that burn, you may also feel like you want to be literally anywhere other than the gym. But your body is thanking you the whole time — exercise has powerful effects on both the body and the mind.
Many people hit the gym or pound the pavement to improve cardiovascular health, build muscle, and of course, get a rockin’ bod. But working out has above-the-neck benefits too.
For the past decade or so, scientists have pondered how exercising can
boost brain function
.
Studies show that making time for exercise provides some serious mental benefits, regardless of your age or fitness level (yup, this includes everyone from mall walkers to marathoners).
Get inspired to exercise by reading up on these unexpected ways working out can benefit your
mental health
, improve your relationships, and help you lead a healthier and happier life. (Not a bad payoff for, like, an hour of being a bit sweaty.)
1. Reduce stress
Rough day at the office? Spilled coffee and got your tie stuck in the shredder? Lacey in Accounts threw stuff at you again? Chill out by taking a walk or heading to the gym for a
quick workout
.
One of the most common mental benefits of exercise is stress relief. Working up a sweat can help you manage
physical and mental stress
. Exercise also increases concentrations of norepinephrine, a chemical that can moderate your brain’s
response to stress
.
So go ahead and get sweaty — it can reduce stress
and
boost your body’s ability to deal with existing mental tension. Win-win! And boo to Lacey — we got your back in the Accounts beef.
2. Boost happy chemicals
Slogging through a few miles on the ’mill can be tough, but it’s worth the effort.
Exercise causes your body to produce endorphins, which trigger feelings of
happiness
and euphoria. Research has shown that in people with major depression, exercise can increase the chance of remission by 22 percent by circulating endorphins.
Belvederi Murri M, et al. (2018). Physical exercise in major depression: Reducing the mortality gap while improving clinical outcomes. DOI:
10.3389/fpsyt.2018.00762
For this reason,
docs recommend
that people dealing with depression or anxiety (or those who are just feeling blue) pencil in some gym time. A 2013 study found no difference between the effectiveness of antidepressants and exercise.
Blumenthal JA, et al. (2013). Is exercise a viable treatment for depression? DOI:
10.1249/01.FIT.0000416000.09526.eb
Don’t worry if you’re not exactly the gym-rat type — working out for just 30 minutes a few times a week can instantly boost your overall mood.
Sharma A, et al. (2006). Exercise for mental health.
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1470658/
3. Improve self-confidence
If you’re not quite at Fonz-level self-confidence just yet, don’t worry — not all of us have to jump the shark to feel great. Hopping on the treadmill can help you feel like a million bucks too.
On a very basic level, physical fitness can boost self-esteem and improve positive self-image.
Sani S, et al. (2016). Physical activity and self-esteem: Testing direct and indirect relationships associated with psychological and physical mechanisms.
https://www.dovepress.com/physical-activity-and-self-esteem-testing-direct-and-indirect-relation-peer-reviewed-fulltext-article-NDT
Regardless of weight, size, gender, or age, exercise can quickly elevate a person’s perception of their attractiveness.
Elavsky S. (2010). Longitudinal examination of the exercise and self-esteem model in middle-aged women.
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3603361/
Exercise is your way of reminding yourself how beautiful you are. So step on the CrossFit and send your soul some flirty DMs!
4. Enjoy the great outdoors
For an extra boost of self-love, take your workout to the great outdoors. Exercising outside can increase self-esteem even more.
Gladwell V, et al. (2013). The great outdoors: How a green exercise environment can benefit all. DOI:
10.1186/2046-7648-2-3
Find an outdoor workout that fits your style, whether it’s rock climbing, hiking, canoeing, or just taking a jog in the park. Even a long walk through verdant pastures and beautiful landscapes can be nourishing for your body and mind.
Plus, all that
vitamin D
from soaking up the sun (while wearing
sunscreen
, of course!) can reduce your risk of experiencing symptoms of depression.
Why book a spa day when a little fresh air and sunshine (and exercise) can work wonders for self-confidence and happiness?
5. Prevent cognitive decline
It’s unpleasant, but it’s true: As we get older, our brains get a little… hazy. As aging and degenerative conditions like Alzheimer’s disease kill off brain cells, the noggin shrinks, damaging many important brain functions in the process.
While exercise and a healthy diet can’t “cure” Alzheimer’s, they can help shore up your brain against cognitive decline that begins after age 45.
Intlekofer KA, et al. (2013). Exercise counteracts declining hippocampal function in aging and Alzheimer’s disease. DOI:
10.1016/j.nbd.2012.06.011
Working out also boosts the chemicals that support and prevent degeneration of the hippocampus, an important part of your brain for memory and learning.
Liu P, et al. (2018). Exercise-mediated neurogenesis in the hippocampus via BDNF. DOI:
10.3389/fnins.2018.00052
Going for a run now might help you do better in that game of bridge in 40 years.
6. Alleviate anxiety
Pop quiz, hotshot: Which is better at relieving anxiety — a warm bubble bath or a 20-minute jog?
You might be surprised at the answer. (Don’t try jogging in the bath — it is not a safe pastime.)
The warm and fuzzy chemicals that start to swim around your body after exercise can help soothe people with
anxiety disorders
.
Hopping on the track or treadmill for some moderate-to-high intensity aerobic exercise (
intervals
, anyone?) can reduce anxiety symptoms. In a small 2018 study of people with a diagnosis of panic disorder, regular moderate-to-hard exercise led to a greater reduction in anxiety than light exercise.
Lattari E, et al. (2018). Effects of aerobic exercise on anxiety symptoms and cortical activity in patients with panic disorder: A pilot study. DOI:
10.2174/1745017901814010011
7. Boost brainpower
Brawn and brains are not mutually exclusive. Studies have shown that cardiovascular exercise can create new brain cells and improve overall brain performance.
Griffin WE, et al. (2011). Aerobic exercise improves hippocampal function and increases BDNF in the serum of young adult males. DOI:
10.1016/j.physbeh.2011.06.005
(Why do you think
The Hulk
is so good at science?)
Ready to apply for a Nobel Prize? A 2019 study suggests that a tough workout increases levels of a brain-derived protein called BDNF, which
may help
with decision making, higher thinking, and learning.
De la Rosa A, et al. (2019). Long-term exercise training improves memory in middle-aged men and modulates peripheral levels of BDNF and cathepsin B. DOI:
10.1038/s41598-019-40040-8
So, spandex pants may lead to being a smartypants — so long as you exercise while you’re in ’em.
8. Sharpen memory
Get ready to win big at Go Fish and Pairs: Regular physical activity boosts memory and the ability to learn new things.
Working up a sweat increases production of cells in the hippocampus that are responsible for memory and learning.
Erickson KI, et al. (2011). Exercise training increases size of hippocampus and improves memory. DOI:
10.1073/pnas.1015950108
For this reason, research has linked children’s brain development with their level of physical fitness (take that, recess haters!).
Geertsen S, et al. (2016). Motor skills and exercise capacity are associated with objective measures of cognitive functions and academic performance in preadolescent children. DOI:
10.1371/journal.pone.0161960
But exercise-based brainpower isn’t just for kids.
Even if it’s not as fun as a game of Tag, working out can boost memory among grown-ups too. A 2006 study found that running sprints improved vocabulary retention among healthy adults.
Winter B, et al. (2006). High impact running improves learning. DOI:
10.1016/j.nlm.2006.11.003
And a 2018 study found that adults performed better on memory tests after short periods of light exercise.
Suwabe K, et al. (2018). Rapid stimulation of human dentate gyrus function with acute mild exercise. DOI:
10.1073/pnas.1805668115
9. Help manage addiction
The brain releases
dopamine
, the “reward chemical,” in response to any form of pleasure. And yes, our good friend exercise can kick off a considerable wave of dopamine.
However, so do drugs and alcohol. This reward cycle in the brain can lead to patterns of
substance use disorder
.
Exercise is there for people while they recover from addiction.
Brown AR, et al. (2010). Aerobic exercise for alcohol recovery: Rationale, program description, and preliminary findings short.
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2829243/
Physical activity can
distract people
from cravings when they’re trying to quit smoking.
Taylor AH, et al. (2007). The acute effects of exercise on cigarette cravings, withdrawal symptoms, affect and smoking behaviour: A systematic review. DOI:
10.1111/j.1360-0443.2006.01739.x
Working out while on the wagon has other benefits too. Excessive alcohol use disrupts many body processes, including
circadian rhythms
. As a result, people with alcohol use disorder may find they have trouble falling asleep without drinking.
A 2010 study on animals suggested that exercise might help
reset the body clock
so people can hit the hay at the right time without alcohol.
Hammer SB, et al. (2010). Environmental modulation of alcohol intake in hamsters: Effects of wheel running and constant light exposure.
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2929273/
10. Increase relaxation
Lifting 50-kilo dumbbells doesn’t seem that relaxing… but have you ever caught some Zzz’s after a long run or weight session at the gym? Doesn’t it feel
blissful
?
That’s because a moderate workout can be the equivalent of a sleeping pill, even for people with insomnia.
Passos GS, et al. (2011). Effects of moderate aerobic exercise training on chronic primary insomnia. DOI:
10.1016/j.sleep.2011.02.007
Exercising 5 to 6 hours before bedtime raises your body’s core temperature. When your temp drops back to normal a few hours later, it signals to your body that it’s time to sleep.
Youngstedt SD, et al. (2005). Effects of exercise on sleep. DOI:
10.1016/j.csm.2004.12.003
Kline CE. (2014). The bidirectional relationship between exercise and sleep: Implications for exercise adherence and sleep improvement.
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4341978/
That delicious sleepy feeling after exercise can help you wind down far enough to get some hearty sleep. But it can also help you relax in the meantime.
11. Get more done
Feeling uninspired in the cubicle? The solution might be just a short
walk
or jog away. Research suggests that workers who take time for regular exercise are more productive and have more energy than their more sedentary peers.
von Thiele Schwarz U, et al. (2011). Employee self-rated productivity and objective organizational production levels: Effects of worksite health interventions involving reduced work hours and physical exercise. DOI:
10.1097/JOM.0b013e31822589c2
While busy schedules can make it tough to squeeze in a gym session in the middle of the day, some experts believe that
midday
is the ideal time for a workout due to the body’s circadian rhythms.
12. Tap into creativity
Most people follow a tough workout with a hot shower, but maybe we should be breaking out the colored pencils instead. (Showering in paint, however, is inadvisable.)
A heart-pumping gym session can boost creativity and spontaneous thinking.
Rominger C, et al. (2019). Creative challenge: Regular exercising moderates the association between task-related heart rate variability changes and individual differences in originality. DOI:
10.1371/journal.pone.0220205
We can safely assume Vin Diesel worked out for his “Fast and Furious” roles
after
the scripts were written.
You can supercharge that post-workout inspiration by exercising outdoors (see benefit #4).
Atchley RA, et al. (2012). Creativity in the wild: Improving creative reasoning through immersion in natural settings. DOI:
10.1371/journal.pone.0051474
Next time you need a burst of creative thinking,
hit the trails
for a long walk or run to refresh your body and brain at the same time. Sitting at home, slouched over a keyboard, may not be the answer.
13. Inspire others
Whether it’s a pick-up game of soccer, a group class at the gym, or just a run with a friend, exercise rarely happens in a bubble. And that’s good news for all of us.
Studies show that most people
perform better
during aerobic tests when paired with a workout buddy.
Irwin BC, et al. (2012). Aerobic exercise is promoted when individual performance affects the group: A test of the Kohler Motivation Gain Effect. DOI:
10.1007/s12160-012-9367-4
It could be the result of inspiration or good old-fashioned competition — nobody wants to let the other person down.
In fact, being part of a team is so powerful that it can actually increase athletes’ tolerance for pain.
Cohen EEA, et al. (2010). Rowers’ high: Behavioural synchrony is correlated with elevated pain thresholds. DOI:
10.1098/rsbl.2009.0670
Even fitness beginners can inspire each other to push harder during a sweat session.
Feltz DL, et al. (2012). Two-player partnered exergame for obesity prevention: Using discrepancy in players’ abilities as a strategy to motivate physical activity.
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3440153/
Find yourself a workout buddy and motivate each other!
tl;dr
Working out can have positive effects far beyond those rippling biceps. Gaining self-confidence, getting out of a funk, and even thinking more creatively are some of the great reasons to exercise on a regular basis.
You might think exercise isn’t for you — but it’s for everybody, and it’s never too late to start. We’ve got some
tips to help you start lifting
, whatever your age.
And you don’t need to have obscene amounts of money to access gym equipment. Here are
21 ideas for setting up a home gym
that don’t require much more than a trip to Home Depot and some elbow grease.
The possibilities and benefits are endless. Let’s get moving!

Multiple benefits of breathing
Different breathing per physical activity
Breathing with a mask on
Being short of breath
This is a series where we break down simple fitness activities you can do anywhere — and not just do them, but do them right. With these helpful tips, you can take control of your exercise process at your pace.

Inhale. Exhale. Repeat. There’s not much to the whole breathing thing, right?
*Buzzer noise* Wrong. And especially wrong whenever you’re getting your sweat on.
Here are the deets on the importance of workout breathing.
What’s the big deal with breathing, anyway?
Besides sending oxygen to your lungs so you can live, breathing also sends oxygen to your bloodstream so you can function.
“Our bodies use the oxygen in our bloodstream to create something called adenosine triphosphate (ATP), which is energy,” explains certified personal trainer Alexis Ring, founder of
The Endurance Hub
.
So, no oxygen = less energy = a tired you.
“Breathing also steadies the heart rate and steadies your central nervous systems,” she says. “Meaning: Not breathing also skyrockets your heart rate, which can make whatever you’re doing feel harder.”
The Lift
Don’t be afraid to get deep
It might sound bananas — given that we’re in a pandemic that calls for us to avoid breathing in certain particles — but deep breathing has a lot to do with boosted immunity.
Deep breathing:
decreases blood pressure
reduces stress
improves your autonomic response
Different exercises call for different breathing
Makes sense that you’d breathe differently while doing yoga than while doing CrossFit, right? Here are four fitness activities that call for four different breathing patterns.
Running
Fitness experts say inefficient breathing can impair speed and performance.
So what qualifies as efficient breathing? “While there’s no golden rule, many runners find it most comfortable to take one breath for every two foot strikes,” says
Alison McConnell
, a breathing expert and the author of
Breathe Strong Perform Better
.
This means taking two steps (one left, one right) while breathing in and two steps while breathing out. This is also known as the 2:2 rhythm.
“Because the diaphragm and surrounding organs are all subject to the forces of gravity,” McConnell says, “synchronizing the breath-to-running cadence will keep the organs from putting unnecessary pressure on the diaphragm, which can impede breathing and make running more uncomfortable than it needs to be.”
The more you know!
Strength training
If you’re a Bulkinator, meathead, or CrossFitter, you’ve likely heard the tip “exhale
on the exertion
of a lift” or “exhale on the up.”
The gist is this: You should contract your midsection at the start of a lift for better lumbar stability, balance, and control during the lift. Perform the eccentric portion of the movement. Then, on the concentric portion of the movement, exhale slowly and continuously while returning to the starting position.
Using the bench press as an example, you’d hold your breath while bringing the bar down to nipple height and exhale as you press the bar overhead.
“Just remember that once that barbell is pressed, the weight doesn’t vanish,” McConnell says. “So be sure to keep the core engaged to protect the spine, similar to preparing for impact during contact sports.”
Yoga
There are two popular breathing methods to help you chill out or power through.
Sama Vritti Pranayama (“equal breathing”):
“This fundamental style of breath is said to calm the nervous system, lower blood pressure, and reduce stress,” says yoga instructor Rebecca Pacheco. “It involves matching an equal-length inhale to an equal-length exhale.”
Ujjayi Pranayama, (aka “victorious breath”):
“This breathing style is designed to help you power through more rigorous types of yoga, such as Ashtanga, Vinyasa, and power yoga,” says Pacheco. “It involves simply breathing in and out through the nose, maintaining a slight contraction in the back of the throat.”
The Lift
Catch your breath, but don’t hold it
If you ever find yourself holding your breath when it’s time for Warrior III, Wheelbarrow, and other holy-crap-this-is-hard poses, take a pause. Pacheco says it’s a common sign of overexertion, and it means you should take a break to refocus and breathe and then hop back into the pose whenever you’re ready.
Tackle sports
When engaging in sports like rugby and football, how you breathe can be the difference between spine stability and spine instability. McConnell explains, “Breathing muscles are an integral part of the core stabilizing and postural control systems.”
The breath should come from your diaphragm (the most efficient breathing muscle), not your chest. And when anticipating a tackle, it’s best to take a deep breath and then brace your core before impact. “Not only will this protect the spine, but it will also make you more difficult to knock over,” says McConnell.
“Breathing deeper, calmer, and more efficiently can also give athletes a psychological edge against their opponents,” she adds.
Cheers to mind games!
What if I’m exercising while wearing a mask?
First off: Don’t even think about taking it off! Masks are pretty damn effective at reducing the risk of COVID-19 transmission.
So, as Ring puts it, “We have to make the most of the situation we are in.”
Her tip:
If you’re planning on working out away from home or around others, acknowledge the fact that doing so while wearing a mask is probably going to affect your breathing.
“Know that you will have to work harder to breathe, and plan accordingly,” she says. “That might mean that you do less intense cardio or take longer recovery times between strength training sets.

I’m not wearing a mask, but I’m still short of breath… now what?
There
is
such a thing as strength training for your respiratory muscles, which may improve performance in endurance and high-intensity sports. There’s even an
app for that
, developed to help athletes breathe stronger and more efficiently.
Avoiding smoking, correcting posture issues, and keeping allergies and asthma in check are also key to better breathing.

Making time for exercise can be tough AF, especially if you have a busy work schedule. But even if your life is hella hectic, it’s uber-important to fit fitness into your daily routine. After all, you (and your body) deserve the best.
Here are six simple ways you can make time for exercise, no matter how busy your life is.

6 ways to make time for exercise
Ready to get your sweat on? Here’s how you can make room for exercise in your busy routine.
1. Work out efficiently
Pick a workout that you can do almost anywhere. Ideally, this will be a form of exercise that doesn’t require much preparation (maybe save the windsurfing for the weekend).
To make the most of your limited time, it’s a good idea to opt for workouts that offer significant gains in a short time. Here are some top-notch options:
CrossFit
Tabata training
interval running
quick ab routine
weighted jump rope
bodyweight workouts
resistance band workouts
high intensity interval training (HIIT)
If you’re looking for a good bang for your workout buck,
HIIT
might be your best bet.
In addition to increasing overall strength, interval training workouts like
HIIT
have been
found
to increase aerobic endurance and oxygen uptake. That basically means it helps increase your body’s ability to take in oxygen and deliver it to your tissues.
2. Do what you like
Flexing your self-discipline muscles is often necessary when it comes to exercise. But TBH, there’s no point in doing something you hate. If you can’t stand running, don’t run! You’re much more likely to stick to a
workout routine
if you actually like it.
Make things easier on yourself by choosing a form of exercise that fits your lifestyle, personality, and taste. Not sure what you love to do? Don’t be afraid to experiment with different forms of exercise until you find what works best for you.
Remember, you don’t
have
to do an activity you hate.
3. Keep it competitive
Gym class dodgeball was lit. Keep that spark alive by adding friendly competition to your workouts.
Research suggests that competition can be a major motivator. According to a
2022 study
, competitions that provide rewards can make exercise more interesting and fun. There’s also a chance it can inspire you to stick to your workout routines.
Whether you’re elite, beginner, or somewhere in between, there’s something for everyone. You might want to try:
fun runs
cycling events
CrossFit competitions
powerlifting competitions
long-distance running events
1:1 competition with a workout buddy
competitions at your local gym or
fitness studio
Sign up, set a goal, and go for it! It might be just the push you need to stay in the workout game.
Pro tip:
If you want to compete a bit with your friends and fam, you can download a
fitness app
that lets you keep track of each other’s stats.
4. Add it to your calendar
You might be more keen on exercising if you prioritize it as much as the other things in your life. If you unexpectedly had to pick up your kiddo from school and had no backup plan, how would you deal with the situation? Cancel a meeting? Take some work home with you?
The truth is that when we really need to, we get out of the office at the time that is necessary. So, make a schedule and stick to it. You deserve some
you
time.
5. Keep track of your activity
There’s an old saying that goes, “If you don’t measure it, it doesn’t exist.” While it’s a slight exaggeration, this phrase does have some truth to it, especially when it comes to exercise.
So take notes in your calendar every time you work out. Then add up your workout sessions at the end of each week, month, and year so you can monitor your progress and identify areas for improvement.
Measuring your activity levels (and, ideally, keeping notes on your progress) can help you stay on track and realize when you’re slipping before you’ve completely lost the habit.
Pro tip:
If you’re not a fan of old-school note-taking, download a
fitness app
!
6. Choose something over nothing
You don’t need an hour — or even 30 minutes — to get an effective workout.
Some exercise is virtually always better than none. When done frequently enough as part of an effective program, short and speedy workouts can do wonders for both your body and your mind. Heck, even
7 minutes
can make a difference!
So squeeze in fitness wherever you are, no matter how much time you have. Here are some tips to sneak extra exercise into your day:
Skip the elevator and take the stairs.
Use your lunch break to go for a brisk walk.
Park
farther away from a building than you need to.
Deskercise
or move around at least once per hour at
work
.
Do squats while your brush your teeth or while you wait for your morning coffee to brew.
Wake up 15 minutes early to stretch. You can also do some
crunches
,
push-ups
,
jumping jacks
, or
lunges
to get your blood pumping.
tl;dr
Finding time for exercise is one of the best investments you can make in your well-being. But that doesn’t mean it’s easy! Still, there are lots of easy ways you can fit fitness into your busy schedule.
Make the most of your workouts by opting for exercises that give you the most bang for your buck. Do your best to prioritize working out and focus on exercises you actually like. This will help you stick to your fitness routine.

There’s an old saying that goes, “If you don’t measure it, it doesn’t exist.” While it’s a slight exaggeration, this phrase does have some truth to it, especially when it comes to exercise.
So take notes in your calendar every time you work out. Then add up your workout sessions at the end of each week, month, and year so you can monitor your progress and identify areas for improvement.
Measuring your activity levels (and, ideally, keeping notes on your progress) can help you stay on track and realize when you’re slipping before you’ve completely lost the habit.
Pro tip:
If you’re not a fan of old-school note-taking, download a
fitness app
!
6. Choose something over nothing
You don’t need an hour — or even 30 minutes — to get an effective workout.
Some exercise is virtually always better than none. When done frequently enough as part of an effective program, short and speedy workouts can do wonders for both your body and your mind. Heck, even
7 minutes
can make a difference!
So squeeze in fitness wherever you are, no matter how much time you have. Here are some tips to sneak extra exercise into your day:
Skip the elevator and take the stairs.
Use your lunch break to go for a brisk walk.
Park
farther away from a building than you need to.
Deskercise
or move around at least once per hour at
work
.
Do squats while your brush your teeth or while you wait for your morning coffee to brew.
Wake up 15 minutes early to stretch. You can also do some
crunches
,
push-ups
,
jumping jacks
, or
lunges
to get your blood pumping.
tl;dr
Finding time for exercise is one of the best investments you can make in your well-being. But that doesn’t mean it’s easy! Still, there are lots of easy ways you can fit fitness into your busy schedule.
Make the most of your workouts by opting for exercises that give you the most bang for your buck. Do your best to prioritize working out and focus on exercises you actually like. This will help you stick to your fitness routine.

Benefits of both
Which should you do first?
How often should you do cardio or weights?
Life has teams that naturally bump heads: Chrissy Teigen vs. Twitter trolls, Kanye vs. T. Swift, and devout weightlifters vs. cardio enthusiasts. Working on your fitness can be daunting when you have two different camps telling you what’s best.
But is one really better than the other? These two forms of exercise offer different benefits and can come together for the greater good — a strong bod and stellar health.

What’s the difference: Strength training vs. cardio
While it’s obvious that cardio and strength training are different exercises, what’s going on in your body is really what sets them apart.
Strength training
(aka weight training, resistance training, or whatever other term you prefer for lifting weights) is an
anaerobic
activity. This includes lifting free weights like
barbells
, dumbbells, and
kettlebells
or using weight machines.
Anaerobic exercises break down glucose for energy, without relying on oxygen like cardio does. More energy is used in a short amount of time.
Cardio (short for “cardiovascular conditioning”) is an
aerobic
activity, which means it uses oxygen to increase your breathing and heart rate.
Running
is often the most polarizing of the cardio bunch, but any activity that makes you breathe harder and faster and increases your heart rate counts.
If you’re team cardio, you can get moving with activities like running, cycling, swimming, or even a Zumba class, to name a few.
Why join team cardio?
Improved heart health and endurance
Cardio helps keep your ticker pumping strongly and efficiently, especially when you need endurance. When you do any cardio workout, your heart rate goes up and you start breathing faster as your body tries to get more oxygen for your blood.
For example, when you start inhaling deeply during a run and praying to make it to the next tree, your body is doing this oxygen exchange.
Cardio exercise helps boost your
aerobic capacity
(how much oxygen your blood gets and uses) and allows your heart and lungs to more efficiently move oxygen through your body (good job, body!).
This not only helps you get through longer workouts but also prevents huffing and puffing whenever you take the office stairs.
You can burn more calories *during* your workout
When you burn calories during any workout, your body is using up energy to power through it. How much you weigh will affect how much you burn. (A 180-pound male uses more energy to run 3 miles than a 120-pound female does.)
Another big plus for cardio is that you’ll burn more calories during your workout than you would when weight training (big emphasis on
during
).
According to
Harvard Medical School
, a 155-pound person burns about 112 calories when lifting weights for 30 minutes and 372 calories when running at an
average 10-minute-per-mile
pace for the same amount of time.
A 155-pound person can also burn 391 calories in 30 minutes of vigorous stationary cycling. So if you’re a SoulCycle fan (*ahem* cycling cult recruit), there’s a reason you sweat through all your clothes in every class.
Faster weight loss
Compared to weight training and workouts involving both cardio and strength, just plain cardio is the queen of
burning more fat
and faster weight loss.
A
2012 study
from Duke University and the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) looked at three groups of adults with overweight or obesity who did cardio, strength training, or a combination of both to see the effects on weight loss.
The results: Cardio kicks butt at reducing fat and body mass compared to just strength training. Those who did a combination of the two (which took twice as much time to complete) had the same weight loss results as those who did just cardio.
Why join team weights?
Gains on gains
Weight training still burns calories, but it’s
really
good for building muscle. There’s a reason you don’t see many jacked elite marathoners or svelte professional weightlifters.
The same
2012 study
that found cardio was more effective for weight loss also found some great benefits of strength training. Participants who were part of a resistance training program increased their lean muscle mass, which in nontechnical speak means they started to get ripped.
You’ll burn calories all day
While a cardio workout will help you burn more calories during a sweat sesh, strength training helps you keep burning those calories throughout the day.
This is thanks to that muscle you’re building, which increases your resting metabolism (aka your body’s ability to burn calories while binge-watching Netflix). Muscle helps your body
burn more calories
when at rest than fat does.
A
small 2001 study
that compared the resting metabolism of men and women who strength trained found an increase in resting metabolism for both genders.
Men had a 9 percent increase in resting metabolic rate, and women had an increase of about 4 percent (which is not considered “significant” — how rude!). When both groups’ results were combined, the result was an overall 7 percent increase.
You can prevent injury
Lifting weights also helps increase bone density, which affects the strength of your bones. If you’re lifting dumbbells, you’re on your way to stronger bones, which can help prevent osteoporosis as well as breaks and fractures.
Stronger muscles also
help out your joints
by supporting them, reducing your risk of knee or shoulder injuries and arthritis.
Cardio *and* weights: Why choose when you can do both?
You’ll lose fat but gain muscle
By combining strength training and cardio, you can get the best of both worlds: fat loss and muscle gain. It’s going to take a little more time to incorporate both, but it’s time well spent if you want less fat and more muscle.
You can’t totally rely on the number on the scale to track your weight loss if you’re strength training and incorporating cardio, because muscle has
greater density
than fat.
You’ll have even better heart health
In a
2019 study
, participants who did a combination of strength training and cardio for 8 weeks had greater improvement in heart disease risk factors than those who did just one or the other. Your heart with thank you for combining both forms of exercise.
Your mental health will improve
Research has shown
that exercise does wonders for improving anxiety and depression. A
2017 study
found that resistance training helped improve anxiety in both healthy participants and those with a physical or mental illness.
Which should come first: Cardio or weights?
This question will send you deep into a bro-science rabbit hole. But the
American Council on Exercise
(ACE), which certifies personal trainers, has made sense of which order is better for your goals.
When to do weights before cardio
If you want to burn more calories with less effort, ACE recommends doing cardio after strength training. An ACE-backed study in 2014 found that doing cardio after lifting resulted in a heart rate
12 beats per minute faster
than doing cardio alone.
Weights before cardio is also a better strategy if your goal is to build strength. For example, if you’re lifting to train just your lower-body muscles (leg day, anyone?), ACE recommends doing weights first.
When to do cardio before weights
If your goal is to have better endurance for an upcoming race, cardio before weights is the way to go.
How much cardio/weights per week?
How much you run, bike, or lift each week depends on your goals.
As a baseline for cardio, a study from the
American College of Sports Medicine
suggests that
150 to 250 minutes
of moderate to vigorous activity like cardio will help most people maintain their weight and people with moderate diet restriction lose some pounds.
In workout speak, that would be
five to eight 30-minute cardio sessions a week
. You’d need to do more than 250 minutes a week for significant weight loss.
If you’re working to accomplish a major fitness goal like a triathlon or a marathon (
😱
), you’ll want to look into dedicated training plans that will bump up those minutes with necessary mileage.
For strength training, a general rule of thumb is
2 or 3 days a week
of full body exercises or 3 to 5 days of exercises separated by muscle group (chest, shoulders, back, arms, legs, etc.). Weight training sessions should last
20 to 30 minutes
.
A
2016 study
suggests weight training at least twice a week for ultimate muscle gains. Training two or three times a week can also help you maintain the muscle you worked hard to build.
In conclusion:
Cardio burns more calories
during
your workout and burns fat faster, so it’s ideal for weight loss.
Strength training helps you build muscle and burn more calories all day (even while on the couch).
Running, cycling, or another form of cardio is great for a healthy heart.
Combining cardio and strength training is fab for fat loss and muscle gain and even better for heart health.
Cardio after weights = more weight loss.
To prioritize weight loss, get in five to eight 30-minute cardio sessions a week.
For muscle gain, lift for 20 to 30 minutes at least three times a week.

In workout speak, that would be
five to eight 30-minute cardio sessions a week
. You’d need to do more than 250 minutes a week for significant weight loss.
If you’re working to accomplish a major fitness goal like a triathlon or a marathon (
😱
), you’ll want to look into dedicated training plans that will bump up those minutes with necessary mileage.
For strength training, a general rule of thumb is
2 or 3 days a week
of full body exercises or 3 to 5 days of exercises separated by muscle group (chest, shoulders, back, arms, legs, etc.). Weight training sessions should last
20 to 30 minutes
.
A
2016 study
suggests weight training at least twice a week for ultimate muscle gains. Training two or three times a week can also help you maintain the muscle you worked hard to build.
In conclusion:
Cardio burns more calories
during
your workout and burns fat faster, so it’s ideal for weight loss.
Strength training helps you build muscle and burn more calories all day (even while on the couch).
Running, cycling, or another form of cardio is great for a healthy heart.
Combining cardio and strength training is fab for fat loss and muscle gain and even better for heart health.
Cardio after weights = more weight loss.
To prioritize weight loss, get in five to eight 30-minute cardio sessions a week.
For muscle gain, lift for 20 to 30 minutes at least three times a week.

Cardio vs. Weights: Which Is Better for Your Fitness Goals?

What’s the difference?
Cardio benefits
Weightlifting benefits
Benefits of both
Which should you do first?
How often should you do cardio or weights?
Life has teams that naturally bump heads: Chrissy Teigen vs. Twitter trolls, Kanye vs. T. Swift, and devout weightlifters vs. cardio enthusiasts. Working on your fitness can be daunting when you have two different camps telling you what’s best.
But is one really better than the other? These two forms of exercise offer different benefits and can come together for the greater good — a strong bod and stellar health.

What’s the difference: Strength training vs. cardio
While it’s obvious that cardio and strength training are different exercises, what’s going on in your body is really what sets them apart.
Strength training
(aka weight training, resistance training, or whatever other term you prefer for lifting weights) is an
anaerobic
activity. This includes lifting free weights like
barbells
, dumbbells, and
kettlebells
or using weight machines.
Anaerobic exercises break down glucose for energy, without relying on oxygen like cardio does. More energy is used in a short amount of time.
Cardio (short for “cardiovascular conditioning”) is an
aerobic
activity, which means it uses oxygen to increase your breathing and heart rate.
Running
is often the most polarizing of the cardio bunch, but any activity that makes you breathe harder and faster and increases your heart rate counts.
If you’re team cardio, you can get moving with activities like running, cycling, swimming, or even a Zumba class, to name a few.
Why join team cardio?
Improved heart health and endurance
Cardio helps keep your ticker pumping strongly and efficiently, especially when you need endurance. When you do any cardio workout, your heart rate goes up and you start breathing faster as your body tries to get more oxygen for your blood.
For example, when you start inhaling deeply during a run and praying to make it to the next tree, your body is doing this oxygen exchange.
Cardio exercise helps boost your
aerobic capacity
(how much oxygen your blood gets and uses) and allows your heart and lungs to more efficiently move oxygen through your body (good job, body!).
This not only helps you get through longer workouts but also prevents huffing and puffing whenever you take the office stairs.
You can burn more calories *during* your workout
When you burn calories during any workout, your body is using up energy to power through it. How much you weigh will affect how much you burn. (A 180-pound male uses more energy to run 3 miles than a 120-pound female does.)
Another big plus for cardio is that you’ll burn more calories during your workout than you would when weight training (big emphasis on
during
).
According to
Harvard Medical School
, a 155-pound person burns about 112 calories when lifting weights for 30 minutes and 372 calories when running at an
average 10-minute-per-mile
pace for the same amount of time.
A 155-pound person can also burn 391 calories in 30 minutes of vigorous stationary cycling. So if you’re a SoulCycle fan (*ahem* cycling cult recruit), there’s a reason you sweat through all your clothes in every class.
Faster weight loss
Compared to weight training and workouts involving both cardio and strength, just plain cardio is the queen of
burning more fat
and faster weight loss.
A
2012 study
from Duke University and the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) looked at three groups of adults with overweight or obesity who did cardio, strength training, or a combination of both to see the effects on weight loss.
The results: Cardio kicks butt at reducing fat and body mass compared to just strength training. Those who did a combination of the two (which took twice as much time to complete) had the same weight loss results as those who did just cardio.
Why join team weights?
Gains on gains
Weight training still burns calories, but it’s
really
good for building muscle. There’s a reason you don’t see many jacked elite marathoners or svelte professional weightlifters.
The same
2012 study
that found cardio was more effective for weight loss also found some great benefits of strength training. Participants who were part of a resistance training program increased their lean muscle mass, which in nontechnical speak means they started to get ripped.
You’ll burn calories all day
While a cardio workout will help you burn more calories during a sweat sesh, strength training helps you keep burning those calories throughout the day.
This is thanks to that muscle you’re building, which increases your resting metabolism (aka your body’s ability to burn calories while binge-watching Netflix). Muscle helps your body
burn more calories
when at rest than fat does.
A
small 2001 study
that compared the resting metabolism of men and women who strength trained found an increase in resting metabolism for both genders.
Men had a 9 percent increase in resting metabolic rate, and women had an increase of about 4 percent (which is not considered “significant” — how rude!). When both groups’ results were combined, the result was an overall 7 percent increase.
You can prevent injury
Lifting weights also helps increase bone density, which affects the strength of your bones. If you’re lifting dumbbells, you’re on your way to stronger bones, which can help prevent osteoporosis as well as breaks and fractures.
Stronger muscles also
help out your joints
by supporting them, reducing your risk of knee or shoulder injuries and arthritis.
Cardio *and* weights: Why choose when you can do both?
You’ll lose fat but gain muscle
By combining strength training and cardio, you can get the best of both worlds: fat loss and muscle gain. It’s going to take a little more time to incorporate both, but it’s time well spent if you want less fat and more muscle.
You can’t totally rely on the number on the scale to track your weight loss if you’re strength training and incorporating cardio, because muscle has
greater density
than fat.
You’ll have even better heart health
In a
2019 study
, participants who did a combination of strength training and cardio for 8 weeks had greater improvement in heart disease risk factors than those who did just one or the other. Your heart with thank you for combining both forms of exercise.
Your mental health will improve
Research has shown
that exercise does wonders for improving anxiety and depression. A
2017 study
found that resistance training helped improve anxiety in both healthy participants and those with a physical or mental illness.
Which should come first: Cardio or weights?
This question will send you deep into a bro-science rabbit hole. But the
American Council on Exercise
(ACE), which certifies personal trainers, has made sense of which order is better for your goals.
When to do weights before cardio
If you want to burn more calories with less effort, ACE recommends doing cardio after strength training. An ACE-backed study in 2014 found that doing cardio after lifting resulted in a heart rate
12 beats per minute faster
than doing cardio alone.
Weights before cardio is also a better strategy if your goal is to build strength. For example, if you’re lifting to train just your lower-body muscles (leg day, anyone?), ACE recommends doing weights first.
When to do cardio before weights
If your goal is to have better endurance for an upcoming race, cardio before weights is the way to go.
How much cardio/weights per week?
How much you run, bike, or lift each week depends on your goals.
As a baseline for cardio, a study from the
American College of Sports Medicine
suggests that
150 to 250 minutes
of moderate to vigorous activity like cardio will help most people maintain their weight and people with moderate diet restriction lose some pounds.
In workout speak, that would be
five to eight 30-minute cardio sessions a week
. You’d need to do more than 250 minutes a week for significant weight loss.
If you’re working to accomplish a major fitness goal like a triathlon or a marathon (
😱
), you’ll want to look into dedicated training plans that will bump up those minutes with necessary mileage.
For strength training, a general rule of thumb is
2 or 3 days a week
of full body exercises or 3 to 5 days of exercises separated by muscle group (chest, shoulders, back, arms, legs, etc.). Weight training sessions should last
20 to 30 minutes
.
A
2016 study
suggests weight training at least twice a week for ultimate muscle gains. Training two or three times a week can also help you maintain the muscle you worked hard to build.
In conclusion:
Cardio burns more calories
during
your workout and burns fat faster, so it’s ideal for weight loss.
Strength training helps you build muscle and burn more calories all day (even while on the couch).
Running, cycling, or another form of cardio is great for a healthy heart.
Combining cardio and strength training is fab for fat loss and muscle gain and even better for heart health.
Cardio after weights = more weight loss.
To prioritize weight loss, get in five to eight 30-minute cardio sessions a week.
For muscle gain, lift for 20 to 30 minutes at least three times a week.

Top Benefits of Cardio: Why You Should Get Your Heart Pumping

Updated on October 11, 2024
Discover the top 8 benefits of cardio that might get you off the couch. From boosting heart health to improving mental well-being, cardio exercises like running and dancing can enhance your overall health. Learn more now.
Cardio (that’s short for “
cardiovascular activity
”) is basically anything that gets your blood pumping. Whether you’re
running
, dancing, or even hauling a week’s worth of
groceries
— as long as your heart rate’s elevated, you’re getting your cardio in.
Here’s why this type of exercise is so important to keep your bod happy and healthy.
Benefits of cardio
Here’s what cardio (aka
aerobic exercise
) does for your health:
gets your blood pumping
lowers your blood pressure
strengthens your
immune system
improves your
sleep
supports your mental health
regulates your
blood sugar
contributes to a healthy weight
gives your brain a boost

8 benefits of cardio that’ll get you off the couch
The
U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)
recommends getting at least 150 minutes of moderate
cardio exercise
(like
brisk walking
)
or
75 mins of vigorous activity (like running) each week.
Still, mixing any cardio into your routine could lead to beaucoup benefits. Need a little motivation to get your body moving? Check out these possible perks.
1. Gets your blood pumping
Getting your cardio in on the reg can improve heart health by
lowering cholesterol
levels and reducing your risk of heart disease. How? Just like doing a
biceps curl
trains your arm muscles, cardio exercise challenges your heart. This helps blood move more efficiently throughout your body and strengthens your heart.
The
American Heart Association
and most docs recommend following the HHS guidelines to keep your heart healthy.
And since cardiovascular disease is the
leading cause of death globally
, most peeps could benefit from a little more cardio in their life.
2. Lowers your blood pressure
According to a
2015 research review
, exercise is key to treating and preventing hypertension (aka
high blood pressure
). Hypertension can lead to
heart attack
, stroke, aneurysm, heart failure, or even dementia.
The researchers note that exercise, including cardio exercise, consistently leads to lower systolic and diastolic blood pressure in folks with hypertension. It may also work to immediately reduce systolic blood pressure for almost 24 hours.
Just keep in mind that studies are done primarily on middle-aged men of European descent (surprise, surprise), so the potential results may not apply to everyone. Still, there’s no evidence that age, sex, or ethnicity has any effect on your blood pressure response to cardio exercise.
3. Strengthens your immune system
Wanna beat cold season? You’re in luck. According to a
2020 review
, regular exercise (like cardio) is beneficial for the immune system.
Getting your
workout
on also helps keep your blood cells and cytokines (a type of proteins) healthy. Both of these components are key to immune system regulation.
Researchers think certain types of cancer may even improve as a result of exercise — but that research is still inconclusive. Plus, the authors of another
2020 review
speculate that regular exercise could even help prevent
COVID-19 infections
.
While the jury’s still out on whether getting physical can really stave off cancer or COVID-19, it certainly seems to support a
healthy immune system
.
4. Improves your sleep
It prob doesn’t come as a surprise that tuckering yourself out on the treadmill can make you extra-
sleepy
come sundown. According to
lots
of
research
, even a little bit of exercise can help you catch A+ Zzz’s.
While older adults may benefit the most, science suggests that everyone will likely have a breezier trip to Dreamland with a little extra cardio. A small
2013 study
in people with insomnia found that consistent exercise led to
improved sleep quality
.
5. Supports your mental health
Many peeps feel extra-sunny after sweating it out. Exercise causes your bod to
release endorphins
(hormones that give you those happy, euphoric vibes).
This positive effect has even been confirmed by multiple scientific studies. According to a
2019 review,
physical activity like cardio can help treat symptoms of major
depression
.
According to the authors of another
research review from 2020
, exercise is an affordable and noninvasive way to help treat or prevent
anxiety
, depression, and other mental disorders. A
small 2018 study
in people with
panic disorder
found that regular exercise led to reduced anxiety.
Remember, hopping on the
treadmill
might not be like waving a magic wand and
poof
, your anxiety’s gone — but the research does point to numerous potential benefits.
6. Regulates your blood sugar
Blood sugar
skyrocketing? A quick trip to the
gym
just might do the trick.
In a
2013 study
in people with
type 2 diabetes
, researchers found that cardio exercise helped participants regulate their insulin levels,
lower their blood sugar
, and maintain a healthy weight.
That’s why exercise is usually one of the first strategies (alongside dietary changes) that docs recommend to patients who have recently received a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes.
According to a
2017 review
, cardio, resistance training, and
high intensity interval training
all help improve glucose regulation and keep blood sugar levels in check too.
Even if you don’t have diabetes, exercising regularly can be excellent prevention for probs down the road.
7. Contributes to a healthy weight
OK, OK, you’ve heard this one before: Exercise can help you maintain a healthy weight. Nothing new here, but it’s true! Doing
regular cardio
can help you keep your weight at a moderate level.
In a small
2013 study
with 92 participants, cardio alone — without any dietary changes — led to weight loss over a 10-month period in men and women who were overweight or had obesity. Still, a
2017 review
notes that combining exercise with dietary changes will be the most effective.
So, you *can*
lose weight
by just hopping on the treadmill daily and noshing as usual. But you’ll be more successful if you also incorporate nutritious eating habits.
8. Gives your brain a boost
Cardio: It’s not just for your bod but also for your brain. Exercise is associated with
reduced cognitive decline
, sharper memory, and better brain performance.
According to a
2013 review
, regular exercise like cardio can help protect your brain from cognitive decline that may otherwise begin around age 45.
Getting your workout on also boosts chemicals that
support the hippocampus
, which is your noggin’s center of
memory
and learning.
A
2019 study
(in middle-aged men) found that a hardcore workout boosts a protein in your brain called BNDF, which may improve your ability to think, learn, and make decisions.
So if someone ever asks why you’re going to the gym instead of studying for your test, tell them it’s so you can ace it. (But don’t forget to study at some point too.)
Cardio newbie? 30-minute beginner-friendly workout
Convinced about cardio but unsure where to start? Take it slow and start simple — no
equipment
required.
1. Jumping jacks
Jumping jacks
: They’re not just for gym class. You’ve probably done these before, so why not do them in your living room? (Trust us,
Netflix
has never felt so productive.)
For the best results, do these babies with purpose.
Stand with your feet hip-width apart and arms by your sides. Jump off the floor and spread your legs wider than shoulder-width, lifting your hands above your head at the same time. Then return to the starting position.
Repeat for 3 sets of 30 seconds each. Take 30 seconds of rest in between.
2. High knees
Time to kick it into high gear with
high knees
.
Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and arms by your sides.
Engage your core
and bring your right knee toward your chest, just above waist level, as you bring your left hand up.
Lower and repeat on the opposite side. Go for 3 sets of 30 secs. Take 30 secs of rest in between sets.
3. Run/jog
Running
or
jogging
is the perf cardio workout for many people because it doesn’t require a costly gym membership or any fancy equipment.
Simply
run
or jog for about 20 mins — longer if you can, or shorter if you need to! Eventually, you’ll find your sweet spot.
If jogging or running isn’t for you, consider
alternatives
like:
cycling
swimming
using the
elliptical
jumping rope
boxing
dancing
playing sports (like
soccer
)
4. Walk
Cool down by walking it off for about 5 minutes.
tl;dr
Cardio is a killer form of exercise that comes with a host of health benefits, including blood sugar regulation, improved mood, and better brain power.
Whether you opt to swim, bike, or run,
adding cardio to your routine
can help improve your health.

Top Benefits of Cardio: Why You Should Get Your Heart Pumping

Updated on October 11, 2024
Discover the top 8 benefits of cardio that might get you off the couch. From boosting heart health to improving mental well-being, cardio exercises like running and dancing can enhance your overall health. Learn more now.
Cardio (that’s short for “
cardiovascular activity
”) is basically anything that gets your blood pumping. Whether you’re
running
, dancing, or even hauling a week’s worth of
groceries
— as long as your heart rate’s elevated, you’re getting your cardio in.
Here’s why this type of exercise is so important to keep your bod happy and healthy.
Benefits of cardio
Here’s what cardio (aka
aerobic exercise
) does for your health:
gets your blood pumping
lowers your blood pressure
strengthens your
immune system
improves your
sleep
supports your mental health
regulates your
blood sugar
contributes to a healthy weight
gives your brain a boost

8 benefits of cardio that’ll get you off the couch
The
U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)
recommends getting at least 150 minutes of moderate
cardio exercise
(like
brisk walking
)
or
75 mins of vigorous activity (like running) each week.
Still, mixing any cardio into your routine could lead to beaucoup benefits. Need a little motivation to get your body moving? Check out these possible perks.
1. Gets your blood pumping
Getting your cardio in on the reg can improve heart health by
lowering cholesterol
levels and reducing your risk of heart disease. How? Just like doing a
biceps curl
trains your arm muscles, cardio exercise challenges your heart. This helps blood move more efficiently throughout your body and strengthens your heart.
The
American Heart Association
and most docs recommend following the HHS guidelines to keep your heart healthy.
And since cardiovascular disease is the
leading cause of death globally
, most peeps could benefit from a little more cardio in their life.
2. Lowers your blood pressure
According to a
2015 research review
, exercise is key to treating and preventing hypertension (aka
high blood pressure
). Hypertension can lead to
heart attack
, stroke, aneurysm, heart failure, or even dementia.
The researchers note that exercise, including cardio exercise, consistently leads to lower systolic and diastolic blood pressure in folks with hypertension. It may also work to immediately reduce systolic blood pressure for almost 24 hours.
Just keep in mind that studies are done primarily on middle-aged men of European descent (surprise, surprise), so the potential results may not apply to everyone. Still, there’s no evidence that age, sex, or ethnicity has any effect on your blood pressure response to cardio exercise.
3. Strengthens your immune system
Wanna beat cold season? You’re in luck. According to a
2020 review
, regular exercise (like cardio) is beneficial for the immune system.
Getting your
workout
on also helps keep your blood cells and cytokines (a type of proteins) healthy. Both of these components are key to immune system regulation.
Researchers think certain types of cancer may even improve as a result of exercise — but that research is still inconclusive. Plus, the authors of another
2020 review
speculate that regular exercise could even help prevent
COVID-19 infections
.
While the jury’s still out on whether getting physical can really stave off cancer or COVID-19, it certainly seems to support a
healthy immune system
.
4. Improves your sleep
It prob doesn’t come as a surprise that tuckering yourself out on the treadmill can make you extra-
sleepy
come sundown. According to
lots
of
research
, even a little bit of exercise can help you catch A+ Zzz’s.
While older adults may benefit the most, science suggests that everyone will likely have a breezier trip to Dreamland with a little extra cardio. A small
2013 study
in people with insomnia found that consistent exercise led to
improved sleep quality
.
5. Supports your mental health
Many peeps feel extra-sunny after sweating it out. Exercise causes your bod to
release endorphins
(hormones that give you those happy, euphoric vibes).
This positive effect has even been confirmed by multiple scientific studies. According to a
2019 review,
physical activity like cardio can help treat symptoms of major
depression
.
According to the authors of another
research review from 2020
, exercise is an affordable and noninvasive way to help treat or prevent
anxiety
, depression, and other mental disorders. A
small 2018 study
in people with
panic disorder
found that regular exercise led to reduced anxiety.
Remember, hopping on the
treadmill
might not be like waving a magic wand and
poof
, your anxiety’s gone — but the research does point to numerous potential benefits.
6. Regulates your blood sugar
Blood sugar
skyrocketing? A quick trip to the
gym
just might do the trick.
In a
2013 study
in people with
type 2 diabetes
, researchers found that cardio exercise helped participants regulate their insulin levels,
lower their blood sugar
, and maintain a healthy weight.
That’s why exercise is usually one of the first strategies (alongside dietary changes) that docs recommend to patients who have recently received a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes.
According to a
2017 review
, cardio, resistance training, and
high intensity interval training
all help improve glucose regulation and keep blood sugar levels in check too.
Even if you don’t have diabetes, exercising regularly can be excellent prevention for probs down the road.
7. Contributes to a healthy weight
OK, OK, you’ve heard this one before: Exercise can help you maintain a healthy weight. Nothing new here, but it’s true! Doing
regular cardio
can help you keep your weight at a moderate level.
In a small
2013 study
with 92 participants, cardio alone — without any dietary changes — led to weight loss over a 10-month period in men and women who were overweight or had obesity. Still, a
2017 review
notes that combining exercise with dietary changes will be the most effective.
So, you *can*
lose weight
by just hopping on the treadmill daily and noshing as usual. But you’ll be more successful if you also incorporate nutritious eating habits.
8. Gives your brain a boost
Cardio: It’s not just for your bod but also for your brain. Exercise is associated with
reduced cognitive decline
, sharper memory, and better brain performance.
According to a
2013 review
, regular exercise like cardio can help protect your brain from cognitive decline that may otherwise begin around age 45.

support the hippocampus
, which is your noggin’s center of
memory
and learning.

recommends getting at least 150 minutes of moderate
cardio exercise
(like
brisk walking
)
or
75 mins of vigorous activity (like running) each week.
Still, mixing any cardio into your routine could lead to beaucoup benefits. Need a little motivation to get your body moving? Check out these possible perks.
1. Gets your blood pumping
Getting your cardio in on the reg can improve heart health by
lowering cholesterol
levels and reducing your risk of heart disease. How? Just like doing a
biceps curl
trains your arm muscles, cardio exercise challenges your heart. This helps blood move more efficiently throughout your body and strengthens your heart.
The
American Heart Association
and most docs recommend following the HHS guidelines to keep your heart healthy.
And since cardiovascular disease is the
leading cause of death globally
, most peeps could benefit from a little more cardio in their life.
2. Lowers your blood pressure
According to a
2015 research review
, exercise is key to treating and preventing hypertension (aka
high blood pressure
). Hypertension can lead to
heart attack
, stroke, aneurysm, heart failure, or even dementia.
The researchers note that exercise, including cardio exercise, consistently leads to lower systolic and diastolic blood pressure in folks with hypertension. It may also work to immediately reduce systolic blood pressure for almost 24 hours.
Just keep in mind that studies are done primarily on middle-aged men of European descent (surprise, surprise), so the potential results may not apply to everyone. Still, there’s no evidence that age, sex, or ethnicity has any effect on your blood pressure response to cardio exercise.
3. Strengthens your immune system
Wanna beat cold season? You’re in luck. According to a
2020 review
, regular exercise (like cardio) is beneficial for the immune system.
Getting your
workout
on also helps keep your blood cells and cytokines (a type of proteins) healthy. Both of these components are key to immune system regulation.
Researchers think certain types of cancer may even improve as a result of exercise — but that research is still inconclusive. Plus, the authors of another
2020 review
speculate that regular exercise could even help prevent
COVID-19 infections
.
While the jury’s still out on whether getting physical can really stave off cancer or COVID-19, it certainly seems to support a
healthy immune system
.
4. Improves your sleep
It prob doesn’t come as a surprise that tuckering yourself out on the treadmill can make you extra-
sleepy
come sundown. According to
lots
of
research
, even a little bit of exercise can help you catch A+ Zzz’s.
While older adults may benefit the most, science suggests that everyone will likely have a breezier trip to Dreamland with a little extra cardio. A small
2013 study
in people with insomnia found that consistent exercise led to
improved sleep quality
.
5. Supports your mental health
Many peeps feel extra-sunny after sweating it out. Exercise causes your bod to
release endorphins
(hormones that give you those happy, euphoric vibes).
This positive effect has even been confirmed by multiple scientific studies. According to a
2019 review,
physical activity like cardio can help treat symptoms of major
depression
.
According to the authors of another
research review from 2020
, exercise is an affordable and noninvasive way to help treat or prevent
anxiety
, depression, and other mental disorders. A
small 2018 study
in people with
panic disorder
found that regular exercise led to reduced anxiety.
Remember, hopping on the
treadmill
might not be like waving a magic wand and
poof
, your anxiety’s gone — but the research does point to numerous potential benefits.
6. Regulates your blood sugar
Blood sugar
skyrocketing? A quick trip to the
gym
just might do the trick.
In a
2013 study
in people with
type 2 diabetes
, researchers found that cardio exercise helped participants regulate their insulin levels,
lower their blood sugar
, and maintain a healthy weight.
That’s why exercise is usually one of the first strategies (alongside dietary changes) that docs recommend to patients who have recently received a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes.
According to a
2017 review
, cardio, resistance training, and
high intensity interval training
all help improve glucose regulation and keep blood sugar levels in check too.
Even if you don’t have diabetes, exercising regularly can be excellent prevention for probs down the road.
7. Contributes to a healthy weight
OK, OK, you’ve heard this one before: Exercise can help you maintain a healthy weight. Nothing new here, but it’s true! Doing
regular cardio
can help you keep your weight at a moderate level.
In a small
2013 study
with 92 participants, cardio alone — without any dietary changes — led to weight loss over a 10-month period in men and women who were overweight or had obesity. Still, a
2017 review
notes that combining exercise with dietary changes will be the most effective.
So, you *can*
lose weight
by just hopping on the treadmill daily and noshing as usual. But you’ll be more successful if you also incorporate nutritious eating habits.
8. Gives your brain a boost
Cardio: It’s not just for your bod but also for your brain. Exercise is associated with
reduced cognitive decline
, sharper memory, and better brain performance.
According to a
2013 review
, regular exercise like cardio can help protect your brain from cognitive decline that may otherwise begin around age 45.
Getting your workout on also boosts chemicals that
support the hippocampus
, which is your noggin’s center of
memory
and learning.
A
2019 study
(in middle-aged men) found that a hardcore workout boosts a protein in your brain called BNDF, which may improve your ability to think, learn, and make decisions.
So if someone ever asks why you’re going to the gym instead of studying for your test, tell them it’s so you can ace it. (But don’t forget to study at some point too.)
Cardio newbie? 30-minute beginner-friendly workout
Convinced about cardio but unsure where to start? Take it slow and start simple — no
equipment
required.
1. Jumping jacks
Jumping jacks
: They’re not just for gym class. You’ve probably done these before, so why not do them in your living room? (Trust us,
Netflix
has never felt so productive.)
For the best results, do these babies with purpose.
Stand with your feet hip-width apart and arms by your sides. Jump off the floor and spread your legs wider than shoulder-width, lifting your hands above your head at the same time. Then return to the starting position.
Repeat for 3 sets of 30 seconds each. Take 30 seconds of rest in between.
2. High knees
Time to kick it into high gear with
high knees
.
Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and arms by your sides.
Engage your core
and bring your right knee toward your chest, just above waist level, as you bring your left hand up.
Lower and repeat on the opposite side. Go for 3 sets of 30 secs. Take 30 secs of rest in between sets.
3. Run/jog
Running
or
jogging
is the perf cardio workout for many people because it doesn’t require a costly gym membership or any fancy equipment.
Simply
run
or jog for about 20 mins — longer if you can, or shorter if you need to! Eventually, you’ll find your sweet spot.
If jogging or running isn’t for you, consider
alternatives
like:
cycling
swimming
using the
elliptical
jumping rope
boxing
dancing
playing sports (like
soccer
)
4. Walk
Cool down by walking it off for about 5 minutes.
tl;dr
Cardio is a killer form of exercise that comes with a host of health benefits, including blood sugar regulation, improved mood, and better brain power.
Whether you opt to swim, bike, or run,
adding cardio to your routine
can help improve your health.

Running has beaucoup benefits, but going from couch potato (and proud!) to Usain Bolt takes a lot of practice. And it’s important to do so safely, because doing too much too fast can lead to overuse injuries.
Not sure where to begin? We’ve got you. Here’s how peeps of all ages and activity levels can start running, safely.

5 steps to start running
Running might seem simple, but it can be intimidating AF if you’ve never done it before. Here are some steps to help you get to steppin’.
Step 1: Get your gear
You have to be prepared before you hit the pavement. Here’s what you need:
Shoes.
Any sneakers you have in the back of the closet will work, but investing in a solid pair of
running shoes
can help reduce injuries and increase comfort.
Cushioned running socks
can also help a LOT.
Workout clothes.
You can run in a paper bag if you want to, but it won’t get you as far. We suggest sweat-wicking material that can help keep you cool. And if you’re
running in the winter
, don’t forget to layer up!
Step 2: Pick a motivation station
Getting started is the hardest part. Once you make running a habit, it can turn into something you look forward to. Here are some tips to get you going:
Create a
bomb playlist
to help you hit that runner’s high.
Try to run at the
same time each day
. This helps you get used to your race routine.
Treat yourself
to something healthful yet special at the end of every run. A chocolaty
protein shake
can do the trick.
Step 3: Start slow
If you try to run a marathon your first day out, you’ll wind up disappointed and EXHAUSTED. You could even hurt yourself.
That’s why it’s super important to set realistic goals that allow you to get up to speed (and distance) at a safe pace. Hit one
mile
stone at a time and it’ll all be fine.
Step 4: Track your progress
Activity apps
can help you hit your goals and can make the experience a lot more fun.
They can keep track of your:
pace
steps
distance
heart rate
calories burned
MapMyRun
,
Garmin
, and
Fitbit
are all popular options.
Step 5: Build up endurance
Once you’ve gotten into a good groove, it’s time to take it up a notch. Try to increase your distance and running time each day. You can also challenge yourself by running steeper inclines on the treadmill or tackling hills
outside
.
How to start safely
Running is a high impact sport, so you have to be careful not to overdo it. Here are some easy ways to keep your training safe:
Stay on top of your
hydration
.
Wear proper
footwear
.
Do a
warmup
and a cooldown.
Stretch before and after every run.
Know your limits — don’t push yourself too far.
For outdoor runners:
Don’t run alone at night or in secluded areas.
Make sure you’re visible. Always wear reflective gear if you’re running at night.
Always stop for red lights. You can run in place to keep your heart rate up.
Sample running programs
These easy-to-follow programs will help you get going. How do you know they’re legit? Each was designed by certified personal trainer Daniel Bubnis.
Total beginner
Going from 0 to 100 isn’t a good idea. This program will help you get used to running step-by-step. Some days you’ll walk the whole time to build up your muscles, and some days you’ll alternate between walking and running to practice getting your
jog on
.
Total time
Workout
Repeat
Week 1: Walk
30 minutes
30-minute walk
3 times a week
Week 2: Brisk walk
40 minutes
40-minute walk

Week 4: Fartlek running
40 minutes
5-minute walk
30-minute rotation [5-minute jog, 5-minute moderate run, 5-minute fast run]
5-minute walk
every other day
FYI:
Fartlek running is when you train at different paces throughout the run. You’ll do a mix of jogging, moderate running, and sprints. This can help you build stamina and get faster.
How to stay on track
Having a hard time adjusting to #RunnerLife? Here are some tips to help you stay motivated:
Make it competitive.
Try a fun race with friends or try to outpace yourself day-to-day.
Feel the burn.
Running is a killer
cardio
exercise that can burn cals and help you maintain a healthy weight.
Mix it up.
Try to run different routes so you don’t get bored.
Treat it as “me time.”
Use your runs as a way to unwind and
de-stress
.
It’s OK to feel sluggish.
Don’t worry — you’ll get more
stamina
as you go along.
Note:
Stretch the programs out over a longer period if you’re not ready to level up yet. You can also tweak each day’s workout according to your needs and goals. Don’t give up — you’ve got this!
Running form
As fun as it would be to run wild like
Phoebe
, that’s a one-way ticket to injury. Here’s how to keep your form on fleek:
Look ahead.
Focus on the ground in front of you and keep your head steady. This puts less stress on your neck and shoulders and can reduce your risk of tripping.
No spaghetti arms.
Keep your arms at your sides and bent at 90-degree angles. This reduces tension and exerts less energy.
Frankie says relax.
Avoid clenching your fists and tightening your muscles, which can cause strain. Also, be sure to square your shoulders, since rounding them can restrict your
breathing
.
Check your posture.
Keep your head up,
back straight
, and shoulders even. Leaning forward can make you feel tired faster.
Don’t bounce.
Vertical oscillation — bouncing as you run — wastes a ton of energy. It can also put more pressure on your feet as they absorb the shock.
How to fuel your runner’s body
A balanced diet is a major part of any healthy workout regimen. Running burns a lot of energy, and you need to keep your body fueled before, after, and during a race.
Before your run
You should eat
3 to 4 hours
before your run for the max effect, especially if you’re doing long distances. According to
fitness experts
, this also helps prevent a yak attack while you’re on the move.
The best pre-run snacks are easy to digest, so avoid fatty, fried, or fiber-heavy foods. Carbs — things like toast and fruit — are a top choice since they break down into glucose, which will keep you energized. A little lean protein can also be beneficial.
Reminder:
Don’t forget to hydrate! Drink at least
17 to 20 ounces
of H₂O during your pre-run meal.
During your run
Your glycogen stores drop within an hour or two of running. This can lead to an energy crash. Both
older
and
more recent
studies have noted the importance of maintaining healthy glycogen stores.
That’s why you should eat
30 to 60 grams
of carbs per hour if your run lasts longer than 90 minutes. Space these mini carb boosts 15 to 20 minutes apart.
Some good options:
Sports drinks.
Good ol’ Gatorade (or a similar drink) can restore
electrolytes
.
Energy bars.
They tend to be high in carbs and lowish in protein, perf for a midrace pick-me-up.
Energy gels.
They’re a concentrated source of carbs and often contain caffeine and electrolytes. Plus, they’re endorsed by
Dwight Schrute
.
You also need to drink water throughout your run. Aim for
17 to 34 ounces
per hour in normal conditions. And if it’s uber-hot out, you’ll need to drink more.
After your run
You should eat within the first 2 hours after a run, but the sooner you get your noms in, the better.
Experts
suggest this can minimize muscle soreness.
Keep in mind that
what
you eat is just as important as
when
you eat. You don’t need to have a whole meal, but try to get a combo of carbs and protein. A recovery
smoothie
or almond butter on whole-grain bread should do the trick.
PSA:
Don’t booze it up after a run.
Research suggests
that alcohol can prevent protein from repairing your muscles.
Rest days
On rest days, your bod needs fewer calories because you’re not burning as many. But that doesn’t mean you have to cut your cals in half. Just listen to what your body needs.
Also, be sure to get enough
protein
. This helps your body bounce back from your workouts. It’s also important to eat complex carbs to help restore your glycogen levels.
Ready for the races?
There are lots of races out there, but 5Ks, 10Ks, and marathons are the most popular. Here’s how to train for each.
Training for a 5K
If you’re new to running, start with this 4-week plan until you’re ready for your first 5K (3.1 miles).
Total time
Workout
Repeat
Week 1: Fast walking/running
50 minutes
25-minute run
25-minute walk
every other day
Week 2: Endurance running
50 minutes
5-minute walk
40-minute run
5-minute walk
5 times a week
Week 3: Fartlek running
50 minutes
5-minute walk
40-minute rotation [7-minute jog, 7-minute moderate run, 7-minute fast run]
5-minute walk
4 times a week
Week 4: Fast walking/jogging, tapering
30 minutes
2 days: 30-minute rotation [2-minute jog, 2-minute walk]
2 days: 30-minute walk
4 times a week
Training for a 10K
Now that you’ve slayed your first race, it’s time to prep for a 10K (6.21 miles).
Total time
Workout
Repeat
Week 1: Endurance running
50 minutes
5-minute walk
40-minute run
5-minute walk (cooldown)
5 times a week
Week 2: Fartlek running
60 minutes
5-minute walk
50-minute rotation [5-minute jog, 5-minute moderate run, 5-minute fast run]
5-minute walk
4 times a week
Week 3: Jogging/walking
40 minutes
20-minute run
20-minute walk
4 times a week
Week 4: Fast walking/jogging, tapering
30 minutes
2 days: 30-minute intervals [2-minute jog, 2-minute walk]
2 days: 30-minute walk
4 times a week
Marathon
Training for a marathon might feel like an unthinkable task, but it’s totally possible. The most important things are to set realistic goals and not to push yourself past your limits too quickly.
Start off with a 10K (or a 5K if that’s where you are right now) and gradually build up to a half-marathon. From there you can work up to a full marathon.
The bottom line
It takes time and energy to build up running stamina, so if it takes you a while to get the hang of it, that’s normal. Just ramp up slowly and safely to make sure the process is not a *literal* pain.
Now choose a running plan to follow, get your pump-up jams flowing, and stick to it!

Running has beaucoup benefits, but going from couch potato (and proud!) to Usain Bolt takes a lot of practice. And it’s important to do so safely, because doing too much too fast can lead to overuse injuries.
Not sure where to begin? We’ve got you. Here’s how peeps of all ages and activity levels can start running, safely.

5 steps to start running
Running might seem simple, but it can be intimidating AF if you’ve never done it before. Here are some steps to help you get to steppin’.
Step 1: Get your gear
You have to be prepared before you hit the pavement. Here’s what you need:
Shoes.
Any sneakers you have in the back of the closet will work, but investing in a solid pair of
running shoes
can help reduce injuries and increase comfort.
Cushioned running socks
can also help a LOT.
Workout clothes.
You can run in a paper bag if you want to, but it won’t get you as far. We suggest sweat-wicking material that can help keep you cool. And if you’re
running in the winter
, don’t forget to layer up!
Step 2: Pick a motivation station
Getting started is the hardest part. Once you make running a habit, it can turn into something you look forward to. Here are some tips to get you going:
Create a
bomb playlist
to help you hit that runner’s high.
Try to run at the
same time each day
. This helps you get used to your race routine.
Treat yourself
to something healthful yet special at the end of every run. A chocolaty
protein shake
can do the trick.
Step 3: Start slow
If you try to run a marathon your first day out, you’ll wind up disappointed and EXHAUSTED. You could even hurt yourself.
That’s why it’s super important to set realistic goals that allow you to get up to speed (and distance) at a safe pace. Hit one
mile
stone at a time and it’ll all be fine.
Step 4: Track your progress
Activity apps
can help you hit your goals and can make the experience a lot more fun.
They can keep track of your:
pace
steps
distance
heart rate
calories burned
MapMyRun
,
Garmin
, and
Fitbit
are all popular options.
Step 5: Build up endurance
Once you’ve gotten into a good groove, it’s time to take it up a notch. Try to increase your distance and running time each day. You can also challenge yourself by running steeper inclines on the treadmill or tackling hills
outside
.
How to start safely
Running is a high impact sport, so you have to be careful not to overdo it. Here are some easy ways to keep your training safe:
Stay on top of your
hydration
.
Wear proper
footwear
.
Do a
warmup
and a cooldown.
Stretch before and after every run.
Know your limits — don’t push yourself too far.
For outdoor runners:
Don’t run alone at night or in secluded areas.
Make sure you’re visible. Always wear reflective gear if you’re running at night.
Always stop for red lights. You can run in place to keep your heart rate up.
Sample running programs
These easy-to-follow programs will help you get going. How do you know they’re legit? Each was designed by certified personal trainer Daniel Bubnis.
Total beginner
Going from 0 to 100 isn’t a good idea. This program will help you get used to running step-by-step. Some days you’ll walk the whole time to build up your muscles, and some days you’ll alternate between walking and running to practice getting your
jog on
.
Total time
Workout
Repeat
Week 1: Walk
30 minutes
30-minute walk
3 times a week
Week 2: Brisk walk
40 minutes
40-minute walk
4 times a week
Week 3: Run/walk combo

45-minute rotation [1–2 minute run, 1–3 minute walk]
4 times a week
Week 4: Run at moderate pace
45 minutes
7-minute walk
31-minute run

Some experience
If you have the hang of it, here’s a program to help you run farther and faster.
Total time
Workout
Repeat
Week 1: Jogging
30 minutes
5-minute walk
20-minute jog
5-minute walk
every other day
Week 2: Running
30 minutes

20-minute run
5-minute walk
every other day
Week 3: Running

5-minute walk
every other day
Week 4: Fartlek running
40 minutes
5-minute walk
30-minute rotation [5-minute jog, 5-minute moderate run, 5-minute fast run]
5-minute walk
every other day
FYI:
Fartlek running is when you train at different paces throughout the run. You’ll do a mix of jogging, moderate running, and sprints. This can help you build stamina and get faster.
How to stay on track
Having a hard time adjusting to #RunnerLife? Here are some tips to help you stay motivated:
Make it competitive.
Try a fun race with friends or try to outpace yourself day-to-day.
Feel the burn.
Running is a killer
cardio
exercise that can burn cals and help you maintain a healthy weight.
Mix it up.
Try to run different routes so you don’t get bored.
Treat it as “me time.”
Use your runs as a way to unwind and
de-stress
.
It’s OK to feel sluggish.
Don’t worry — you’ll get more
stamina
as you go along.
Note:
Stretch the programs out over a longer period if you’re not ready to level up yet. You can also tweak each day’s workout according to your needs and goals. Don’t give up — you’ve got this!
Running form
As fun as it would be to run wild like
Phoebe
, that’s a one-way ticket to injury. Here’s how to keep your form on fleek:
Look ahead.
Focus on the ground in front of you and keep your head steady. This puts less stress on your neck and shoulders and can reduce your risk of tripping.
No spaghetti arms.
Keep your arms at your sides and bent at 90-degree angles. This reduces tension and exerts less energy.
Frankie says relax.
Avoid clenching your fists and tightening your muscles, which can cause strain. Also, be sure to square your shoulders, since rounding them can restrict your
breathing
.
Check your posture.
Keep your head up,
back straight
, and shoulders even. Leaning forward can make you feel tired faster.
Don’t bounce.
Vertical oscillation — bouncing as you run — wastes a ton of energy. It can also put more pressure on your feet as they absorb the shock.
How to fuel your runner’s body
A balanced diet is a major part of any healthy workout regimen. Running burns a lot of energy, and you need to keep your body fueled before, after, and during a race.
Before your run
You should eat
3 to 4 hours
before your run for the max effect, especially if you’re doing long distances. According to
fitness experts
, this also helps prevent a yak attack while you’re on the move.
The best pre-run snacks are easy to digest, so avoid fatty, fried, or fiber-heavy foods. Carbs — things like toast and fruit — are a top choice since they break down into glucose, which will keep you energized. A little lean protein can also be beneficial.
Reminder:
Don’t forget to hydrate! Drink at least
17 to 20 ounces
of H₂O during your pre-run meal.
During your run
Your glycogen stores drop within an hour or two of running. This can lead to an energy crash. Both
older
and
more recent
studies have noted the importance of maintaining healthy glycogen stores.
That’s why you should eat
30 to 60 grams
of carbs per hour if your run lasts longer than 90 minutes. Space these mini carb boosts 15 to 20 minutes apart.
Some good options:
Sports drinks.
Good ol’ Gatorade (or a similar drink) can restore
electrolytes
.
Energy bars.
They tend to be high in carbs and lowish in protein, perf for a midrace pick-me-up.
Energy gels.
They’re a concentrated source of carbs and often contain caffeine and electrolytes. Plus, they’re endorsed by
Dwight Schrute
.
You also need to drink water throughout your run. Aim for
17 to 34 ounces
per hour in normal conditions. And if it’s uber-hot out, you’ll need to drink more.
After your run
You should eat within the first 2 hours after a run, but the sooner you get your noms in, the better.
Experts
suggest this can minimize muscle soreness.
Keep in mind that
what
you eat is just as important as
when
you eat. You don’t need to have a whole meal, but try to get a combo of carbs and protein. A recovery
smoothie
or almond butter on whole-grain bread should do the trick.
PSA:
Don’t booze it up after a run.
Research suggests
that alcohol can prevent protein from repairing your muscles.
Rest days
On rest days, your bod needs fewer calories because you’re not burning as many. But that doesn’t mean you have to cut your cals in half. Just listen to what your body needs.
Also, be sure to get enough
protein
. This helps your body bounce back from your workouts. It’s also important to eat complex carbs to help restore your glycogen levels.
Ready for the races?
There are lots of races out there, but 5Ks, 10Ks, and marathons are the most popular. Here’s how to train for each.
Training for a 5K
If you’re new to running, start with this 4-week plan until you’re ready for your first 5K (3.1 miles).
Total time
Workout
Repeat
Week 1: Fast walking/running
50 minutes
25-minute run
25-minute walk
every other day
Week 2: Endurance running
50 minutes
5-minute walk
40-minute run
5-minute walk
5 times a week
Week 3: Fartlek running
50 minutes
5-minute walk
40-minute rotation [7-minute jog, 7-minute moderate run, 7-minute fast run]
5-minute walk
4 times a week
Week 4: Fast walking/jogging, tapering
30 minutes
2 days: 30-minute rotation [2-minute jog, 2-minute walk]
2 days: 30-minute walk
4 times a week
Training for a 10K
Now that you’ve slayed your first race, it’s time to prep for a 10K (6.21 miles).
Total time
Workout
Repeat
Week 1: Endurance running
50 minutes
5-minute walk
40-minute run
5-minute walk (cooldown)
5 times a week
Week 2: Fartlek running
60 minutes
5-minute walk
50-minute rotation [5-minute jog, 5-minute moderate run, 5-minute fast run]
5-minute walk
4 times a week
Week 3: Jogging/walking
40 minutes
20-minute run
20-minute walk
4 times a week
Week 4: Fast walking/jogging, tapering
30 minutes
2 days: 30-minute intervals [2-minute jog, 2-minute walk]
2 days: 30-minute walk
4 times a week
Marathon
Training for a marathon might feel like an unthinkable task, but it’s totally possible. The most important things are to set realistic goals and not to push yourself past your limits too quickly.
Start off with a 10K (or a 5K if that’s where you are right now) and gradually build up to a half-marathon. From there you can work up to a full marathon.
The bottom line
It takes time and energy to build up running stamina, so if it takes you a while to get the hang of it, that’s normal. Just ramp up slowly and safely to make sure the process is not a *literal* pain.
Now choose a running plan to follow, get your pump-up jams flowing, and stick to it!

5 steps to start running
Running might seem simple, but it can be intimidating AF if you’ve never done it before. Here are some steps to help you get to steppin’.
Step 1: Get your gear
You have to be prepared before you hit the pavement. Here’s what you need:
Shoes.
Any sneakers you have in the back of the closet will work, but investing in a solid pair of

Cushioned running socks

Workout clothes.
You can run in a paper bag if you want to, but it won’t get you as far. We suggest sweat-wicking material that can help keep you cool. And if you’re

Step 3: Start slow
If you try to run a marathon your first day out, you’ll wind up disappointed and EXHAUSTED. You could even hurt yourself.
That’s why it’s super important to set realistic goals that allow you to get up to speed (and distance) at a safe pace. Hit one
mile
stone at a time and it’ll all be fine.
Step 4: Track your progress
Activity apps
can help you hit your goals and can make the experience a lot more fun.
They can keep track of your:
pace
steps
distance
heart rate
calories burned
MapMyRun
,
Garmin
, and
Fitbit
are all popular options.
Step 5: Build up endurance
Once you’ve gotten into a good groove, it’s time to take it up a notch. Try to increase your distance and running time each day. You can also challenge yourself by running steeper inclines on the treadmill or tackling hills

.

Know your limits — don’t push yourself too far.
For outdoor runners:
Don’t run alone at night or in secluded areas.
Make sure you’re visible. Always wear reflective gear if you’re running at night.
Always stop for red lights. You can run in place to keep your heart rate up.

How to stay on track
Having a hard time adjusting to #RunnerLife? Here are some tips to help you stay motivated:
Make it competitive.
Try a fun race with friends or try to outpace yourself day-to-day.
Feel the burn.
Running is a killer
cardio
exercise that can burn cals and help you maintain a healthy weight.
Mix it up.
Try to run different routes so you don’t get bored.
Treat it as “me time.”
Use your runs as a way to unwind and
de-stress
.
It’s OK to feel sluggish.
Don’t worry — you’ll get more
stamina
as you go along.
Note:
Stretch the programs out over a longer period if you’re not ready to level up yet. You can also tweak each day’s workout according to your needs and goals. Don’t give up — you’ve got this!
Running form
As fun as it would be to run wild like
Phoebe
, that’s a one-way ticket to injury. Here’s how to keep your form on fleek:
Look ahead.
Focus on the ground in front of you and keep your head steady. This puts less stress on your neck and shoulders and can reduce your risk of tripping.
No spaghetti arms.
Keep your arms at your sides and bent at 90-degree angles. This reduces tension and exerts less energy.
Frankie says relax.
Avoid clenching your fists and tightening your muscles, which can cause strain. Also, be sure to square your shoulders, since rounding them can restrict your
breathing
.
Check your posture.
Keep your head up,
back straight
, and shoulders even. Leaning forward can make you feel tired faster.
Don’t bounce.
Vertical oscillation — bouncing as you run — wastes a ton of energy. It can also put more pressure on your feet as they absorb the shock.
How to fuel your runner’s body
A balanced diet is a major part of any healthy workout regimen. Running burns a lot of energy, and you need to keep your body fueled before, after, and during a race.
Before your run
You should eat
3 to 4 hours
before your run for the max effect, especially if you’re doing long distances. According to
fitness experts
, this also helps prevent a yak attack while you’re on the move.
The best pre-run snacks are easy to digest, so avoid fatty, fried, or fiber-heavy foods. Carbs — things like toast and fruit — are a top choice since they break down into glucose, which will keep you energized. A little lean protein can also be beneficial.
Reminder:
Don’t forget to hydrate! Drink at least
17 to 20 ounces
of H₂O during your pre-run meal.
During your run
Your glycogen stores drop within an hour or two of running. This can lead to an energy crash. Both
older
and
more recent
studies have noted the importance of maintaining healthy glycogen stores.
That’s why you should eat
30 to 60 grams
of carbs per hour if your run lasts longer than 90 minutes. Space these mini carb boosts 15 to 20 minutes apart.
Some good options:
Sports drinks.
Good ol’ Gatorade (or a similar drink) can restore
electrolytes
.
Energy bars.
They tend to be high in carbs and lowish in protein, perf for a midrace pick-me-up.
Energy gels.
They’re a concentrated source of carbs and often contain caffeine and electrolytes. Plus, they’re endorsed by
Dwight Schrute
.
You also need to drink water throughout your run. Aim for
17 to 34 ounces
per hour in normal conditions. And if it’s uber-hot out, you’ll need to drink more.
After your run
You should eat within the first 2 hours after a run, but the sooner you get your noms in, the better.
Experts
suggest this can minimize muscle soreness.
Keep in mind that
what
you eat is just as important as
when
you eat. You don’t need to have a whole meal, but try to get a combo of carbs and protein. A recovery
smoothie
or almond butter on whole-grain bread should do the trick.
PSA:
Don’t booze it up after a run.
Research suggests
that alcohol can prevent protein from repairing your muscles.
Rest days
On rest days, your bod needs fewer calories because you’re not burning as many. But that doesn’t mean you have to cut your cals in half. Just listen to what your body needs.
Also, be sure to get enough
protein
. This helps your body bounce back from your workouts. It’s also important to eat complex carbs to help restore your glycogen levels.
Ready for the races?
There are lots of races out there, but 5Ks, 10Ks, and marathons are the most popular. Here’s how to train for each.
Training for a 5K
If you’re new to running, start with this 4-week plan until you’re ready for your first 5K (3.1 miles).
Total time
Workout
Repeat
Week 1: Fast walking/running
50 minutes
25-minute run
25-minute walk
every other day
Week 2: Endurance running
50 minutes
5-minute walk
40-minute run
5-minute walk
5 times a week
Week 3: Fartlek running
50 minutes
5-minute walk
40-minute rotation [7-minute jog, 7-minute moderate run, 7-minute fast run]
5-minute walk
4 times a week
Week 4: Fast walking/jogging, tapering
30 minutes
2 days: 30-minute rotation [2-minute jog, 2-minute walk]
2 days: 30-minute walk
4 times a week
Training for a 10K
Now that you’ve slayed your first race, it’s time to prep for a 10K (6.21 miles).
Total time
Workout
Repeat
Week 1: Endurance running
50 minutes
5-minute walk
40-minute run
5-minute walk (cooldown)
5 times a week
Week 2: Fartlek running
60 minutes
5-minute walk
50-minute rotation [5-minute jog, 5-minute moderate run, 5-minute fast run]
5-minute walk
4 times a week
Week 3: Jogging/walking
40 minutes
20-minute run
20-minute walk
4 times a week
Week 4: Fast walking/jogging, tapering
30 minutes
2 days: 30-minute intervals [2-minute jog, 2-minute walk]
2 days: 30-minute walk
4 times a week
Marathon
Training for a marathon might feel like an unthinkable task, but it’s totally possible. The most important things are to set realistic goals and not to push yourself past your limits too quickly.
Start off with a 10K (or a 5K if that’s where you are right now) and gradually build up to a half-marathon. From there you can work up to a full marathon.
The bottom line
It takes time and energy to build up running stamina, so if it takes you a while to get the hang of it, that’s normal. Just ramp up slowly and safely to make sure the process is not a *literal* pain.
Now choose a running plan to follow, get your pump-up jams flowing, and stick to it!

Walking Cardio: How to Turn Your Daily Walk into a Legit Workout

How to walk for cardio
How to increase intensity
Walking benefits
Walking is great for your health, but if you want to turn it into a cardio routine, you’ll need to challenge your heart by hitting a moderate intensity level. Here’s what that means.
There are lots of
walks
in life: the catwalk, the moonwalk, the walk of shame. But for most of us, walking is just a great way to get around. It’s also one of the easiest forms of exercise, since it requires
no equipment
and minimal training.
At the same time, we all know that walking from the
bedroom
to the
living room
isn’t going to count toward your
cardio goals
. So when does walking turn into legit exercise?
How to turn walking into a cardio workout
If you want to get a real workout in during your
daily walk
, you’ll need to challenge your cardiovascular system enough to at least hit a moderate intensity level. You can do that by picking up the pace, adding
an incline
(hello, hills!), or walking a longer distance.
But how do you know if you’ve reached the right intensity level? Well, according to the
CDC
, moderate intensity means you should be able to talk but not quite able to sing.
If you’re not willing to belt out a ballad to see if you’re working hard enough, you can also check your heart rate. It should be between 64% and 76% of your
maximum heart rate
.

Break it down for me: How do I get actual exercise from walking?
Before you get too caught up in the details, know that walking in all forms and at all paces is still good for you. According to
Dr. Robert Graham
at
FRESH Medicine
at
Physio Logic NYC
, “All exercise counts. Exercise helps everything from preventing
heart disease
to
depression
.”
But if you’re looking to use walking as your daily sweat sesh, when does it become cardio?
“Cardio” — short for “
cardiovascular exercise
” — refers to activity that involves or requires oxygen to meet the energy demands of your body. Any activity that increases your
heart rate
and
respiration rate
while using large muscles repetitively and rhythmically (yep, including
sex
) can fit the bill.
Walking
can fit into that category if you walk at a moderate
intensity
, which means it’s actually challenging your cardiovascular system by putting increased demands on
your muscles
and heart.
But what does “moderate intensity” even mean? According to Graham, a moderate level of activity noticeably increases your heart rate and breathing rate.
“Simply put, you
may sweat
, but you are still able to carry on a conversation. You can talk, but you can’t sing,” he says.
You can also check your heart rate to see if your efforts are up to snuff. The
CDC
says your heart rate should be between 64% and 76% of your maximum heart rate during moderate intensity exercise.
Finding your moderate intensity heart rate
To start, you’ll need to find your maximum heart rate. It’s not a perfect science, but you can estimate your maximum heart rate by subtracting your age from 220.
For example, if you’re 30, your maximum heart rate is about 190 beats per minute (bpm).
You then need to find 64% and 76% of your maximum heart rate to determine your moderate intensity heart rate range.
So, if your max heart rate is 190 bpm, your moderate intensity heart rate range is 121 to 144 bpm.
How do I up my walking intensity?
You’ve got options. To increase your walking intensity, you can add an incline, pick up your pace, or walk a longer distance — or all of the above!
The specific incline, pace, and distance you’ll need to tackle to achieve moderate intensity totally depends on your activity level, weight, and health history. No two walkers are the same, so what feels like an easy stroll for you could be a moderate intensity walk for your BFF, or vice versa.
According to the CDC, a “brisk walking” pace for most people is 3 miles or 5 kilometers per hour, or about 20 minutes per mile and 12 minutes per kilometer. Walking faster than 4 miles per hour (under 15 minutes per mile) is considered a fast pace — and
definitely
cardio.
Not sure what pace you’re walking at? Put a little pep in your step during your next walk. See if you break a small sweat. Or next time you hit the gym, get on the treadmill and set the pace to 3 miles per hour to get a feel for it. Then ask yourself if you can safely increase the pace to 3.5 or 4 miles per hour and maintain that pace for at least 30 minutes.
Benefits of walking the walk
Walking
is
exercise — and it comes with a lot of benefits.
“Walking improves everything, [including] general fitness, cardiac health, depression, and
fatigue
. It improves
mood
, reduces the risk for cancer and numerous chronic diseases, [and] improves circulation and even
posture
,” says Graham.
Wondering if
running
might be even better for you than walking?
A
2013 study
compared the results of a National Runners’ Health Study with those of a National Walkers’ Health Study and found that the energy used for moderate intensity walking and vigorous intensity running resulted in similar reductions in risk for high blood pressure, high cholesterol,
diabetes
, and heart disease over a 6-year period.
So yes, running is an excellent workout, but you’ll see a lot of the same benefits from slowin’ it down a bit.
The bottom line
If you want to see some major benefits from walking, challenge yourself by increasing your intensity to at least a moderate level. You can do that by walking faster, picking a longer walking route, or hitting the hills.
Moderate intensity walks are super beneficial for your body (and
your mood
) and may be just as effective as
running
in warding off chronic diseases and health conditions that can lead to much bigger problems. And how many of your favorite workouts can you do at every age? Walking wins.
Plus, it’s fun. Hit the pavement with a friend, enjoy a stroll with
your pup
, or catch up on your favorite podcast while you’re out and about. Need more than that? Try picking a fun destination or using a
fitness tracker
to keep a step count competition going with your friends or co-workers.
Get some
comfy sneakers
, put on a colorful sweat-wicking outfit, pop in some
headphones
, and get those legs moving. Do it for your heart, your body, and your soul.

Walking Cardio: How to Turn Your Daily Walk into a Legit Workout

How to walk for cardio
How to increase intensity
Walking benefits
Walking is great for your health, but if you want to turn it into a cardio routine, you’ll need to challenge your heart by hitting a moderate intensity level. Here’s what that means.
There are lots of
walks
in life: the catwalk, the moonwalk, the walk of shame. But for most of us, walking is just a great way to get around. It’s also one of the easiest forms of exercise, since it requires
no equipment
and minimal training.
At the same time, we all know that walking from the
bedroom
to the
living room
isn’t going to count toward your
cardio goals
. So when does walking turn into legit exercise?
How to turn walking into a cardio workout
If you want to get a real workout in during your
daily walk
, you’ll need to challenge your cardiovascular system enough to at least hit a moderate intensity level. You can do that by picking up the pace, adding
an incline
(hello, hills!), or walking a longer distance.
But how do you know if you’ve reached the right intensity level? Well, according to the
CDC
, moderate intensity means you should be able to talk but not quite able to sing.
If you’re not willing to belt out a ballad to see if you’re working hard enough, you can also check your heart rate. It should be between 64% and 76% of your
maximum heart rate
.

Break it down for me: How do I get actual exercise from walking?
Before you get too caught up in the details, know that walking in all forms and at all paces is still good for you. According to
Dr. Robert Graham
at
FRESH Medicine
at
Physio Logic NYC
, “All exercise counts. Exercise helps everything from preventing
heart disease
to
depression
.”
But if you’re looking to use walking as your daily sweat sesh, when does it become cardio?
“Cardio” — short for “
cardiovascular exercise
” — refers to activity that involves or requires oxygen to meet the energy demands of your body. Any activity that increases your
heart rate
and
respiration rate
while using large muscles repetitively and rhythmically (yep, including
sex
) can fit the bill.
Walking
can fit into that category if you walk at a moderate
intensity
, which means it’s actually challenging your cardiovascular system by putting increased demands on
your muscles
and heart.
But what does “moderate intensity” even mean? According to Graham, a moderate level of activity noticeably increases your heart rate and breathing rate.
“Simply put, you
may sweat
, but you are still able to carry on a conversation. You can talk, but you can’t sing,” he says.
You can also check your heart rate to see if your efforts are up to snuff. The
CDC
says your heart rate should be between 64% and 76% of your maximum heart rate during moderate intensity exercise.
Finding your moderate intensity heart rate
To start, you’ll need to find your maximum heart rate. It’s not a perfect science, but you can estimate your maximum heart rate by subtracting your age from 220.
For example, if you’re 30, your maximum heart rate is about 190 beats per minute (bpm).
You then need to find 64% and 76% of your maximum heart rate to determine your moderate intensity heart rate range.
So, if your max heart rate is 190 bpm, your moderate intensity heart rate range is 121 to 144 bpm.
How do I up my walking intensity?
You’ve got options. To increase your walking intensity, you can add an incline, pick up your pace, or walk a longer distance — or all of the above!
The specific incline, pace, and distance you’ll need to tackle to achieve moderate intensity totally depends on your activity level, weight, and health history. No two walkers are the same, so what feels like an easy stroll for you could be a moderate intensity walk for your BFF, or vice versa.
According to the CDC, a “brisk walking” pace for most people is 3 miles or 5 kilometers per hour, or about 20 minutes per mile and 12 minutes per kilometer. Walking faster than 4 miles per hour (under 15 minutes per mile) is considered a fast pace — and
definitely
cardio.
Not sure what pace you’re walking at? Put a little pep in your step during your next walk. See if you break a small sweat. Or next time you hit the gym, get on the treadmill and set the pace to 3 miles per hour to get a feel for it. Then ask yourself if you can safely increase the pace to 3.5 or 4 miles per hour and maintain that pace for at least 30 minutes.
Benefits of walking the walk
Walking
is
exercise — and it comes with a lot of benefits.
“Walking improves everything, [including] general fitness, cardiac health, depression, and
fatigue
. It improves
mood
, reduces the risk for cancer and numerous chronic diseases, [and] improves circulation and even
posture
,” says Graham.
Wondering if
running
might be even better for you than walking?
A
2013 study
compared the results of a National Runners’ Health Study with those of a National Walkers’ Health Study and found that the energy used for moderate intensity walking and vigorous intensity running resulted in similar reductions in risk for high blood pressure, high cholesterol,
diabetes
, and heart disease over a 6-year period.
So yes, running is an excellent workout, but you’ll see a lot of the same benefits from slowin’ it down a bit.
The bottom line
If you want to see some major benefits from walking, challenge yourself by increasing your intensity to at least a moderate level. You can do that by walking faster, picking a longer walking route, or hitting the hills.
Moderate intensity walks are super beneficial for your body (and
your mood
) and may be just as effective as
running
in warding off chronic diseases and health conditions that can lead to much bigger problems. And how many of your favorite workouts can you do at every age? Walking wins.
Plus, it’s fun. Hit the pavement with a friend, enjoy a stroll with
your pup
, or catch up on your favorite podcast while you’re out and about. Need more than that? Try picking a fun destination or using a
fitness tracker
to keep a step count competition going with your friends or co-workers.
Get some
comfy sneakers
, put on a colorful sweat-wicking outfit, pop in some
headphones
, and get those legs moving. Do it for your heart, your body, and your soul.

Horizontal seated leg press
Lat pulldown

Cable triceps bar
Chest press
Hanging leg raise
Rowing machine
Discover why machines at the gym might be your best workout buddies. Perfect for beginners, these machines may help you safely build strength and master movement patterns. Explore top picks to enhance your fitness journey.
Fitness pros agree: Exercise machines are totally fine to use and may be especially helpful for beginners.
Kettlebell and
bodyweight workouts
might win the gym popularity contest right now, but don’t sleep on using gym machines. Sometimes exercise machines are actually better.
“It’s true that if you’re using
free weights
, you have to recruit so many stabilizing muscles,” says Shannon Fable, certified trainer and programming director for
Anytime Fitness
. “But when you’re getting started, using [the machines with
weighted plates
] and just learning the movement pattern is OK.”
If you’re returning from a gym hiatus or gaining back strength
after an injury
, weight machines are an easy way to get back in the game. Plus, you won’t risk dropping anything heavy on your foot.
“If you haven’t got full strength or balance or full range of motion, machines are much safer,” says Stuart Munro, certified personal trainer for the New York Health and Racquet Club.
With that in mind, here are the top machines three trainers suggest. Each machine will help you
build strength
and train your body to use the right muscles.
1. Horizontal seated leg press
Share on Pinterest
GIF by Dima Bazak
What you’re working:
quads, glutes, hamstrings, calves
Why it’s worth it:
All the trainers we spoke with agreed that this was their go-to lower-body machine. “If people use this with correct technique, it can help you move toward
squats
off the machine,” Munro says.
2. Lat pulldown
Share on Pinterest
GIF by Dima Bazak
What you’re working:
latissimus dorsi (the broadest muscle of the back), shoulder girdle
Why it’s worth it:
If you’re interested in ever doing a
pull-up
, this is a great place to start. You’ll build your
back muscles
and start activating the entire posterior chain.
“Beginners can start with an under grasp (palms facing you), which uses more
biceps
and tends to be a little easier,” Munro says.
You can also bring your hands closer together or spread them farther apart (so your arms make a V shape) to make the move more challenging.
3. Cable biceps bar
Share on Pinterest
GIF by Dima Bazak
What you’re working:
biceps
Why it’s worth it:
“These are great for avoiding the swinging that happens with
dumbbells
,” says
Rachel Mariotti
, certified trainer and Precision Run coach for
Equinox
.
As with all the other movements on this list, you’ll get the most out of this one when you slowly raise and lower the weight. The cable here helps force you to do that.
4. Cable triceps bar (or triceps pushdown)
Share on Pinterest
GIF by Dima Bazak
What you’re working:
triceps
Why it’s worth it:
As with the lat pulldown or the cable biceps bar, you can switch the
grip
here — using a straight bar, a V-bar, or even a rope — to vary the move.
Building strong
triceps
is uber-important for
push-ups
and
pull-ups
and for maintaining balanced strength in your arms.
5. Chest press
Share on Pinterest
GIF by Dima Bazak
What you’re working:
chest, biceps, triceps
Why it’s worth it:
“The chest press machine is a similar motion to a
push-up
,” Munro says. If you’re new to working out, building up your
chest
, your
biceps
, and even your
triceps
will be helpful for doing
compound movements
later on.
6. Hanging leg raise
Share on Pinterest
GIF by Dima Bazak
What you’re working:
core, hip flexors
Why it’s worth it:
“This is easy to operate and a great way to
work your abs
by propping up on your
forearms
and simply lifting — not swinging — your legs up,” Mariotti says.
7. Rowing machine
Share on Pinterest
GIF by Dima Bazak
What you’re working:
total body, particularly the posterior chain, and building cardio endurance
Why it’s worth it:
While there’s nothing wrong with a
treadmill
, the
rowing machine
can be a great way to change things up, Mariotti says.
“It’s got the upper-body and lower-body aspect of resistance training and will help balance the whole hunch-forward-from-sitting-at-computers,” Munro adds.
Takeaway
Leg press one day,
weighted squats
with
perfect form
the next. Using these machines will help your body get stronger and prepare for the workouts ahead.
If you’re new to the gym or need a refresher, weight machines usually remove the guesswork with helpful how-to cards right on them. You can also ask a gym employee to show you the ropes. They’re there to help!

Horizontal seated leg press
Lat pulldown
Cable biceps bar
Cable triceps bar
Chest press
Hanging leg raise
Rowing machine
Discover why machines at the gym might be your best workout buddies. Perfect for beginners, these machines may help you safely build strength and master movement patterns. Explore top picks to enhance your fitness journey.
Fitness pros agree: Exercise machines are totally fine to use and may be especially helpful for beginners.
Kettlebell and
bodyweight workouts
might win the gym popularity contest right now, but don’t sleep on using gym machines. Sometimes exercise machines are actually better.
“It’s true that if you’re using
free weights
, you have to recruit so many stabilizing muscles,” says Shannon Fable, certified trainer and programming director for
Anytime Fitness
. “But when you’re getting started, using [the machines with
weighted plates
] and just learning the movement pattern is OK.”
If you’re returning from a gym hiatus or gaining back strength
after an injury
, weight machines are an easy way to get back in the game. Plus, you won’t risk dropping anything heavy on your foot.
“If you haven’t got full strength or balance or full range of motion, machines are much safer,” says Stuart Munro, certified personal trainer for the New York Health and Racquet Club.
With that in mind, here are the top machines three trainers suggest. Each machine will help you
build strength
and train your body to use the right muscles.
1. Horizontal seated leg press
Share on Pinterest
GIF by Dima Bazak
What you’re working:
quads, glutes, hamstrings, calves
Why it’s worth it:
All the trainers we spoke with agreed that this was their go-to lower-body machine. “If people use this with correct technique, it can help you move toward
squats
off the machine,” Munro says.
2. Lat pulldown
Share on Pinterest
GIF by Dima Bazak
What you’re working:
latissimus dorsi (the broadest muscle of the back), shoulder girdle
Why it’s worth it:
If you’re interested in ever doing a
pull-up
, this is a great place to start. You’ll build your
back muscles
and start activating the entire posterior chain.
“Beginners can start with an under grasp (palms facing you), which uses more
biceps
and tends to be a little easier,” Munro says.
You can also bring your hands closer together or spread them farther apart (so your arms make a V shape) to make the move more challenging.
3. Cable biceps bar
Share on Pinterest
GIF by Dima Bazak
What you’re working:
biceps
Why it’s worth it:
“These are great for avoiding the swinging that happens with
dumbbells
,” says
Rachel Mariotti
, certified trainer and Precision Run coach for
Equinox
.
As with all the other movements on this list, you’ll get the most out of this one when you slowly raise and lower the weight. The cable here helps force you to do that.
4. Cable triceps bar (or triceps pushdown)
Share on Pinterest
GIF by Dima Bazak
What you’re working:
triceps
Why it’s worth it:
As with the lat pulldown or the cable biceps bar, you can switch the
grip
here — using a straight bar, a V-bar, or even a rope — to vary the move.
Building strong
triceps
is uber-important for
push-ups
and
pull-ups
and for maintaining balanced strength in your arms.
5. Chest press
Share on Pinterest
GIF by Dima Bazak
What you’re working:
chest, biceps, triceps
Why it’s worth it:
“The chest press machine is a similar motion to a
push-up
,” Munro says. If you’re new to working out, building up your
chest
, your
biceps
, and even your
triceps
will be helpful for doing
compound movements
later on.
6. Hanging leg raise
Share on Pinterest
GIF by Dima Bazak
What you’re working:
core, hip flexors
Why it’s worth it:
“This is easy to operate and a great way to
work your abs
by propping up on your
forearms
and simply lifting — not swinging — your legs up,” Mariotti says.
7. Rowing machine
Share on Pinterest
GIF by Dima Bazak
What you’re working:
total body, particularly the posterior chain, and building cardio endurance
Why it’s worth it:
While there’s nothing wrong with a
treadmill
, the
rowing machine
can be a great way to change things up, Mariotti says.
“It’s got the upper-body and lower-body aspect of resistance training and will help balance the whole hunch-forward-from-sitting-at-computers,” Munro adds.
Takeaway
Leg press one day,
weighted squats
with
perfect form
the next. Using these machines will help your body get stronger and prepare for the workouts ahead.
If you’re new to the gym or need a refresher, weight machines usually remove the guesswork with helpful how-to cards right on them. You can also ask a gym employee to show you the ropes. They’re there to help!

muscle gains
to greater strength and
improved stamina
. But how the heck do you go from zero weight room experience to full-on weightlifter?
If you’re ready to get those sweet lifting #gains, we’ve got tips from a pro to help you get started.
Quick tips to start lifting weights
Consider going to a gym or consulting a personal trainer.
Invest in basic equipment to get your lift on at home.
Make sure you warm up before you lift AND cool down after each sesh.
Start with lighter weights and increase weight gradually.
Perfect your form before you start.
Rest for at least 1 minute between sets and limit workouts to 45 minutes, tops.
Take 2 or 3
rest days
each week (recovery is key!).
Build a customized workout plan that meets all your needs and #goals.

Let’s get into it: How to start weight training
Consult a trainer or join a gym
While you totally don’t need a gym or a trainer to start
lifting dumbbells
in your living room, starting your journey with guidance from a
personal trainer
can help you get a great foundation to avoid injury.
“Newcomers should always be shown professionally how to
squat
,
deadlift
, or even
lunge
properly,” says Ben Walker, personal trainer and owner of
Anywhere Fitness
in Dublin, Ireland. “This is so they don’t compensate their
lower spine
and damage vertebrae while performing an exercise.”
In addition to teaching you proper form, a
personal trainer
can work with you on specific exercises to help you reach your
fitness goals
.
Not sure how to connect with a pro? Your local gym is a great place to start. Most gyms have trainers on hand who can provide guidance on using
machines
and lifting free weights. They can also answer any questions you have to make sure you’re getting the most out of each sweat sesh.
Another option is to search online for local trainers who take private clients for one-on-one or
small-group
training. Some even offer virtual appointments, so you can get your lift on right in the comfort of your
home
(no commute necessary!).
Buy some weights
There are many exercises you can do with your own
body weight
. But if you’re ready to add some weightlifting staples to
your home gym
(or to start using them
at
the gym), you can consider:
dumbbells
kettlebells
a barbell
resistance bands
To keep things simple, all you really need to get started is one set of
dumbbells
. Once you get more comfortable with the foundational moves, you can start adding
weightlifting gear
,
kettlebells
, and
barbells
to the mix.
Beginner tips to start strength training
Start with light weights and high reps
OK, but
how much
weight should you lift
if you’re a beginner?
Walker recommends using lighter weights and doing
more repetitions
(the number of times you complete the movement) when you’re starting out.
What’s considered “light” depends on your current fitness level and what moves you’ll be doing. Different exercises can require
different weight levels
to be effective, based on which muscles they’re targeting and how many reps you plan on doing.
When selecting the appropriate weight level, you want to be challenged — without sacrificing
proper form
. If your
weights
are weighing you down so that your spine isn’t aligned and your back isn’t supported, you could be risking injury.
When in doubt, start out light.
Make sure you warm up
It’s important to
warm up
properly before jumping into any exercise. A quick
warmup
is necessary to prepare your muscles and joints for the workout ahead so that they’re limber and less susceptible to injury.
Warming up also helps increase blood flow to your working muscles and gradually increases your body temperature in preparation for harder work.
There are many ways you can warm up before you work out, such as:
Stretching.
Performing a series of
dynamic stretches
helps loosen your limbs, gets your blood a-pumpin’, and
activates your muscles
for peak performance, so
your body is ready
to hit the weights.
Light exercise.
Exercises like bodyweight
squats
can double as a warmup before you add weights.
Light cardio.
Cycling,
walking
, or
rowing
for just a few minutes can help prepare your bod for weightlifting.
Foam rolling.
Try adding
foam rolling
to your stretching routine. Regularly using a
foam roller
may help reduce muscle soreness and increase flexibility and range of motion.
Using a massage gun.
Sure,
massage guns
are great for relieving sore muscles, but
research
shows that they’re also beneficial for getting your muscles ready and raring to go before a workout.
Check your form!
Proper form
is essential for workout success.
“Beginners should always be aware that keeping a ‘neutral spine’ is necessary at all times during every exercise. This is when our spine is situated in a straight position [with the natural curve], whether we are standing or positioned on the floor,” explains Walker.
A personal trainer can help make sure your form is in top shape!
Professional help not in the cards… or in
your budget
? We feel ya. Thankfully, there are many online resources (*cough, cough*
Greatist
👀) to show you examples of what good form looks like and explain how to do it right.
Rest between sets
It’s important to give your muscles a little time off after completing a set.
When you’re a weightlifting newbie, aim for at least
1 minute
of
rest
between sets (aka groups of reps). This’ll give your muscles
time to recover
and avoid getting overworked or fatigued.
These brief rest periods also give you the opportunity to grab
a swig of sweet H
2
O
and check in with your body. (Any pain points? Stiffness? Something feeling out of sorts? Use this time to take notice!)
Keep workouts to 45 minutes
All good things must come to an end — including a killer sweat sesh.
Limiting your workouts to 45 minutes can help you avoid overdoing it.
Overtraining
can leave you feeling tired,
sore
, and potentially
cranky
. It can also increase your risk of injury because you’re not allowing your muscles to properly recover.
Plus, there’s no science that says a longer workout produces better results.
How
you spend your time is more important than how
much
time you spend lifting, so use your minutes wisely and reap the benefits. And again, REST between sessions!
Increase weight gradually
As you get deeper into your weight training journey, you’ll find that your
weights
provide less resistance over time. This means your muscles are getting stronger! Yay!
It also means you can start to
increase the amount of weight
you’re lifting. But instead of tacking on a ton of extra poundage at once, introduce more weight little by little.
Gradually
increase weight
by 5 to 10 percent, making sure you’re perfecting each move (with
proper form
!) before increasing your weight levels again.
Cool down after you work out
A quick
stretch sesh
to cool down after a workout can help ease any muscle tension or
tightness
after lifting, as well as improve your flexibility and range of motion, according to a
2012 research review
.
The
research
results on this are inconclusive and mixed, but it’s possible that
stretching
may also help prevent injury.
Plus, stretching just feels
ah-mazing
after you’ve hit the weights. You can also cool down with easy cardio, massage, or foam rolling. And don’t forget to rehydrate and refuel!
Make a workout schedule
Setting a schedule can help you stay consistent in your routine. Determine how and when to target certain muscle groups, and build in the right amount of rest and recovery for primo performance.
After a long day, a
glass of wine
and a
Netflix marathon
may sound better than a workout. So
planning your workouts
also provides you with some accountability — especially if you’re working out alone and don’t have a trainer or
friend
to hold you to it.
Your Netflix sesh will still be waiting for you after your workout.
Take rest days!
Rest days
are a key component of any workout sched and are essential for promoting
muscle recovery
and reducing the risk of getting hurt.
When starting a weightlifting program, Walker recommends taking at least 2 or 3 rest days each week. “Each muscle group needs 48 to 72 hours to recover before performing the next workout. This is why it’s a good idea to do split workouts in the beginning.”
Split training
involves focusing on specific muscle groups one day and then targeting others the next. This allows particular muscle groups to recover while you work out other groups.
“Once your body has adapted after a few weeks, the muscle groups will need 24 to 48 hours to recover,” notes Walker. “Recovering sooner, you can now plan your workouts more accordingly during the week and add an extra training day.”
Beginner weightlifting exercises to get you started
Here’s a quick refresher on weightlifting lingo:
Reps
(aka repetitions) = how many times you complete an exercise movement
Sets
= how many reps you do (for example, 20 reps may equal 1 set)
When you’re just starting out, Walker suggests
performing an average of 3–4 sets of 20 reps each
. As your muscles adapt to certain movements, you can increase the number of reps and sets you do during your workouts.
Got your
dumbbells
ready? Here are some of the best beginner weight training moves to get you started.
Dumbbell single-arm row
Share on Pinterest
GIF by Active Body, Creative Mind
Rest your left knee on a bench, keeping right foot planted on the floor. For balance, let your left hand rest palm-down near the front of the bench.
With right hand, reach down and pick up your dumbbell. Make sure your back is parallel to the floor.
Slowly lift the weight up toward your waist, bending elbow and squeezing shoulder and back muscles.
Slowly lower the weight, extending your arm to return to the starting position.
Complete 1 set, then switch to the other side and repeat.
Dumbbell shoulder press
Share on Pinterest
GIF by Active Body, Creative Mind
Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, holding a dumbbell in each hand. (You can also do this one seated — just be sure to sit up straight so that your spine is aligned!)
Lift your elbows so they’re raised at your sides at 90-degree angles.
Turn your palms forward.
Slowly press the dumbbells up toward the sky, straightening your arms. Make sure to keep your spine aligned — no leaning or arching your back!
Slowly bring your arms back down to the starting position.
Shoulder lateral raise
Share on Pinterest
GIF by Dima Bazak
Stand (or sit!) up straight with your arms at your sides and a dumbbell in each hand.
Keeping your arms straight, slowly lift arms out to the sides until they’re parallel to the floor. Don’t pinch your neck or swing your arms. Use shoulder and back muscles to make this a slow, controlled movement.
Slowly lower your arms back down to your sides.
Dumbbell chest press
Share on Pinterest
GIF by Dima Bazak
Lie faceup on a
bench
or the
floor
, holding a dumbbell in each hand. Bend elbows at 90 degrees and position your arms at about a 45-degree angle to your body.
With palms facing toward feet, slowly press the weights toward the sky, extending arms directly above your shoulders. Be sure to keep your elbows soft — don’t lock them!
Slowly lower the weights back to the starting position.
Biceps curl
Share on Pinterest
GIF by Dima Bazak
Stand or sit with arms at your sides, holding a weight in each hand.
Bend elbows to curl the weights up toward your shoulders, turning palms to face your body.
Slowly lower the weights back to the starting position.
Triceps extension
Share on Pinterest
GIF by Dima Bazak
Stand or sit, making sure your feet are shoulder-width apart.
Hold a dumbbell vertically, with both hands around the handle.
Lift arms straight up, so the weight is directly over your head.
Don’t pinch your shoulders, and leave space between your elbows and ears. Slowly bend arms, lowering the dumbbell behind your head.
Press the dumbbell up to the sky to return to the starting position.
Dumbbell lunge
Share on Pinterest
GIF by Active Body, Creative Mind
Stand with your arms at your sides, holding a dumbbell in each hand.
Step forward with right leg, bending at the knee until right thigh is parallel with the floor (make sure your bent knee does not extend past your toes!). Let left leg bend to keep you balanced.
Step right foot back to the starting position.
Repeat with the other leg.
Weighted squat
Share on Pinterest
GIF by Dima Bazak
Stand with feet shoulder-width apart. For weight, you can hold 2 dumbbells on your shoulders, 1 dumbbell at your chest, or a kettlebell at your chest (your choice!).
Keeping the weight steady, slowly bend your knees and sit back into a squat, as if sitting in a chair. (Make sure your heels don’t lift off the floor.)
Slowly rise back up to standing by activating your core and glutes.
Weighted calf raise
Share on Pinterest
GIF by Dima Bazak
Stand on a flat surface with feet shoulder-width apart and arms at your sides, holding a dumbbell in each hand.
Slowly lift onto your toes, raising your heels off the floor.
Hold for 1–2 seconds.
Slowly lower your heels back down.
Your strength training schedule
Setting a weekly weight training schedule gives you a road map for which muscles to work when and allows for proper
rest and recovery
.
How many days you exercise
each week really depends on your goals. But
the American College of Sports Medicine
generally recommends resistance training (i.e., weightlifting) 2 or 3 days a week for best results.
Here’s a simple 3-day plan (using the exercises above!) to help you get started:
Day
Muscle groups
Exercises
(
3 or 4 sets of 20 reps)
Monday
upper body (shoulders,
biceps
, and back)
biceps curl
dumbbell single-arm row
dumbbell shoulder press
Tuesday
rest or
cardio
Wednesday
lower body (
legs
and butt)
dumbbell lunge
weighted squat
weighted calf raise
Thursday
rest or cardio
Friday
upper body (
triceps
, shoulders, and chest)
shoulder lateral raise
dumbbell chest press
triceps extension
Saturday
rest or cardio
Sunday
rest or cardio
Start with the lightest weights possible, gradually increasing over time. This will help you achieve hypertrophy, which, Walker explains, is “when the muscle fibers break down to their best ability, so they can repair and grow larger.” (In other words: #gains.)
Pro tip:
Walker says that getting enough
protein
and adequate
sleep
will also aid in muscle repair and help your muscles grow to their greatest potential.
How to start weight training safely
Whether you’re a newbie or a seasoned pro, it’s important to be careful when weight training. Exercising safely can help you avoid injury and ensure that you’re not burning yourself out.
Add these safety tips to your “must follow” list:
Got pain?
Seriously, if something
hurts
, stop and reevaluate. You may need to check in with a trainer about your form. If pain persists, consult a healthcare professional ASAP.
Take it slow.
Do each exercise slowly to reap the full benefits (and to steer clear of injuries!).
Use proper form.
Always make sure your form is top-notch when doing any weight lifting exercise.
Hydrate, hydrate, hydrate!
Rest periods between sets? Perfect time for
water
.
Staying hydrated
keeps your muscles and joints moving freely.
Dress the part.
Always wear the right gear for lifting.
Workout clothes
, closed-toed shoes, and weightlifting gloves can help make your workouts safe and effective.
Breathe… just breathe.
Pay attention to your breath
as you move. Inhale before each lift and exhale during each lift.
Always give your body recovery days.
Skipping
recovery days
increases your risk of injury and can affect your fitness gains. Your body needs to recover to build muscle strength and size.
Takeaway
Weight training is a great way to burn calories, build muscle, and boost strength.
If you’re looking to add weightlifting to your workout routine, consider working with a trainer, setting a schedule, and investing in basic equipment (like dumbbells). To prevent injury or burnout, it’s important to start slowly, making sure you’re taking rest days and not doing too many reps or making your workout too long.
Always be safe when lifting weights. Take your time, use proper form, and never push through pain during workouts. If something feels wrong, stop your workout and consult a professional.

Let’s get into it: How to start weight training
Consult a trainer or join a gym
While you totally don’t need a gym or a trainer to start
lifting dumbbells
in your living room, starting your journey with guidance from a
personal trainer
can help you get a great foundation to avoid injury.
“Newcomers should always be shown professionally how to
squat
,
deadlift
, or even
lunge
properly,” says Ben Walker, personal trainer and owner of
Anywhere Fitness
in Dublin, Ireland. “This is so they don’t compensate their
lower spine
and damage vertebrae while performing an exercise.”
In addition to teaching you proper form, a
personal trainer
can work with you on specific exercises to help you reach your
fitness goals
.
Not sure how to connect with a pro? Your local gym is a great place to start. Most gyms have trainers on hand who can provide guidance on using
machines
and lifting free weights. They can also answer any questions you have to make sure you’re getting the most out of each sweat sesh.
Another option is to search online for local trainers who take private clients for one-on-one or
small-group
training. Some even offer virtual appointments, so you can get your lift on right in the comfort of your
home
(no commute necessary!).
Buy some weights
There are many exercises you can do with your own
body weight
. But if you’re ready to add some weightlifting staples to
your home gym
(or to start using them
at
the gym), you can consider:
dumbbells
kettlebells
a barbell
resistance bands
To keep things simple, all you really need to get started is one set of
dumbbells
. Once you get more comfortable with the foundational moves, you can start adding
weightlifting gear
,
kettlebells
, and
barbells
to the mix.
Beginner tips to start strength training
Start with light weights and high reps
OK, but
how much
weight should you lift
if you’re a beginner?
Walker recommends using lighter weights and doing
more repetitions
(the number of times you complete the movement) when you’re starting out.
What’s considered “light” depends on your current fitness level and what moves you’ll be doing. Different exercises can require
different weight levels
to be effective, based on which muscles they’re targeting and how many reps you plan on doing.
When selecting the appropriate weight level, you want to be challenged — without sacrificing
proper form
. If your
weights
are weighing you down so that your spine isn’t aligned and your back isn’t supported, you could be risking injury.
When in doubt, start out light.
Make sure you warm up
It’s important to
warm up
properly before jumping into any exercise. A quick
warmup
is necessary to prepare your muscles and joints for the workout ahead so that they’re limber and less susceptible to injury.
Warming up also helps increase blood flow to your working muscles and gradually increases your body temperature in preparation for harder work.
There are many ways you can warm up before you work out, such as:
Stretching.
Performing a series of
dynamic stretches
helps loosen your limbs, gets your blood a-pumpin’, and
activates your muscles
for peak performance, so
your body is ready
to hit the weights.
Light exercise.
Exercises like bodyweight
squats
can double as a warmup before you add weights.
Light cardio.
Cycling,
walking
, or
rowing
for just a few minutes can help prepare your bod for weightlifting.
Foam rolling.
Try adding
foam rolling
to your stretching routine. Regularly using a
foam roller
may help reduce muscle soreness and increase flexibility and range of motion.
Using a massage gun.
Sure,
massage guns
are great for relieving sore muscles, but
research
shows that they’re also beneficial for getting your muscles ready and raring to go before a workout.
Check your form!
Proper form
is essential for workout success.
“Beginners should always be aware that keeping a ‘neutral spine’ is necessary at all times during every exercise. This is when our spine is situated in a straight position [with the natural curve], whether we are standing or positioned on the floor,” explains Walker.
A personal trainer can help make sure your form is in top shape!
Professional help not in the cards… or in
your budget
? We feel ya. Thankfully, there are many online resources (*cough, cough*
Greatist
👀) to show you examples of what good form looks like and explain how to do it right.
Rest between sets
It’s important to give your muscles a little time off after completing a set.
When you’re a weightlifting newbie, aim for at least
1 minute
of
rest
between sets (aka groups of reps). This’ll give your muscles
time to recover
and avoid getting overworked or fatigued.
These brief rest periods also give you the opportunity to grab
a swig of sweet H
2
O
and check in with your body. (Any pain points? Stiffness? Something feeling out of sorts? Use this time to take notice!)
Keep workouts to 45 minutes
All good things must come to an end — including a killer sweat sesh.
Limiting your workouts to 45 minutes can help you avoid overdoing it.
Overtraining
can leave you feeling tired,
sore
, and potentially
cranky
. It can also increase your risk of injury because you’re not allowing your muscles to properly recover.
Plus, there’s no science that says a longer workout produces better results.
How
you spend your time is more important than how
much
time you spend lifting, so use your minutes wisely and reap the benefits. And again, REST between sessions!
Increase weight gradually
As you get deeper into your weight training journey, you’ll find that your
weights
provide less resistance over time. This means your muscles are getting stronger! Yay!
It also means you can start to
increase the amount of weight
you’re lifting. But instead of tacking on a ton of extra poundage at once, introduce more weight little by little.
Gradually
increase weight
by 5 to 10 percent, making sure you’re perfecting each move (with
proper form
!) before increasing your weight levels again.
Cool down after you work out
A quick
stretch sesh
to cool down after a workout can help ease any muscle tension or
tightness
after lifting, as well as improve your flexibility and range of motion, according to a
2012 research review
.
The
research
results on this are inconclusive and mixed, but it’s possible that
stretching
may also help prevent injury.
Plus, stretching just feels
ah-mazing
after you’ve hit the weights. You can also cool down with easy cardio, massage, or foam rolling. And don’t forget to rehydrate and refuel!
Make a workout schedule
Setting a schedule can help you stay consistent in your routine. Determine how and when to target certain muscle groups, and build in the right amount of rest and recovery for primo performance.
After a long day, a
glass of wine
and a
Netflix marathon
may sound better than a workout. So
planning your workouts
also provides you with some accountability — especially if you’re working out alone and don’t have a trainer or
friend
to hold you to it.
Your Netflix sesh will still be waiting for you after your workout.
Take rest days!
Rest days
are a key component of any workout sched and are essential for promoting
muscle recovery
and reducing the risk of getting hurt.
When starting a weightlifting program, Walker recommends taking at least 2 or 3 rest days each week. “Each muscle group needs 48 to 72 hours to recover before performing the next workout. This is why it’s a good idea to do split workouts in the beginning.”
Split training
involves focusing on specific muscle groups one day and then targeting others the next. This allows particular muscle groups to recover while you work out other groups.
“Once your body has adapted after a few weeks, the muscle groups will need 24 to 48 hours to recover,” notes Walker. “Recovering sooner, you can now plan your workouts more accordingly during the week and add an extra training day.”
Beginner weightlifting exercises to get you started
Here’s a quick refresher on weightlifting lingo:
Reps
(aka repetitions) = how many times you complete an exercise movement
Sets
= how many reps you do (for example, 20 reps may equal 1 set)
When you’re just starting out, Walker suggests
performing an average of 3–4 sets of 20 reps each
. As your muscles adapt to certain movements, you can increase the number of reps and sets you do during your workouts.
Got your
dumbbells
ready? Here are some of the best beginner weight training moves to get you started.
Dumbbell single-arm row
Share on Pinterest
GIF by Active Body, Creative Mind
Rest your left knee on a bench, keeping right foot planted on the floor. For balance, let your left hand rest palm-down near the front of the bench.
With right hand, reach down and pick up your dumbbell. Make sure your back is parallel to the floor.
Slowly lift the weight up toward your waist, bending elbow and squeezing shoulder and back muscles.
Slowly lower the weight, extending your arm to return to the starting position.
Complete 1 set, then switch to the other side and repeat.
Dumbbell shoulder press
Share on Pinterest
GIF by Active Body, Creative Mind
Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, holding a dumbbell in each hand. (You can also do this one seated — just be sure to sit up straight so that your spine is aligned!)
Lift your elbows so they’re raised at your sides at 90-degree angles.
Turn your palms forward.
Slowly press the dumbbells up toward the sky, straightening your arms. Make sure to keep your spine aligned — no leaning or arching your back!
Slowly bring your arms back down to the starting position.
Shoulder lateral raise
Share on Pinterest
GIF by Dima Bazak
Stand (or sit!) up straight with your arms at your sides and a dumbbell in each hand.
Keeping your arms straight, slowly lift arms out to the sides until they’re parallel to the floor. Don’t pinch your neck or swing your arms. Use shoulder and back muscles to make this a slow, controlled movement.
Slowly lower your arms back down to your sides.
Dumbbell chest press
Share on Pinterest
GIF by Dima Bazak
Lie faceup on a
bench
or the
floor
, holding a dumbbell in each hand. Bend elbows at 90 degrees and position your arms at about a 45-degree angle to your body.
With palms facing toward feet, slowly press the weights toward the sky, extending arms directly above your shoulders. Be sure to keep your elbows soft — don’t lock them!
Slowly lower the weights back to the starting position.
Biceps curl
Share on Pinterest
GIF by Dima Bazak
Stand or sit with arms at your sides, holding a weight in each hand.
Bend elbows to curl the weights up toward your shoulders, turning palms to face your body.
Slowly lower the weights back to the starting position.
Triceps extension
Share on Pinterest
GIF by Dima Bazak
Stand or sit, making sure your feet are shoulder-width apart.
Hold a dumbbell vertically, with both hands around the handle.
Lift arms straight up, so the weight is directly over your head.
Don’t pinch your shoulders, and leave space between your elbows and ears. Slowly bend arms, lowering the dumbbell behind your head.
Press the dumbbell up to the sky to return to the starting position.
Dumbbell lunge
Share on Pinterest
GIF by Active Body, Creative Mind
Stand with your arms at your sides, holding a dumbbell in each hand.
Step forward with right leg, bending at the knee until right thigh is parallel with the floor (make sure your bent knee does not extend past your toes!). Let left leg bend to keep you balanced.
Step right foot back to the starting position.
Repeat with the other leg.
Weighted squat
Share on Pinterest
GIF by Dima Bazak
Stand with feet shoulder-width apart. For weight, you can hold 2 dumbbells on your shoulders, 1 dumbbell at your chest, or a kettlebell at your chest (your choice!).
Keeping the weight steady, slowly bend your knees and sit back into a squat, as if sitting in a chair. (Make sure your heels don’t lift off the floor.)
Slowly rise back up to standing by activating your core and glutes.
Weighted calf raise
Share on Pinterest
GIF by Dima Bazak
Stand on a flat surface with feet shoulder-width apart and arms at your sides, holding a dumbbell in each hand.
Slowly lift onto your toes, raising your heels off the floor.
Hold for 1–2 seconds.
Slowly lower your heels back down.
Your strength training schedule
Setting a weekly weight training schedule gives you a road map for which muscles to work when and allows for proper
rest and recovery
.
How many days you exercise
each week really depends on your goals. But
the American College of Sports Medicine
generally recommends resistance training (i.e., weightlifting) 2 or 3 days a week for best results.
Here’s a simple 3-day plan (using the exercises above!) to help you get started:
Day
Muscle groups
Exercises
(
3 or 4 sets of 20 reps)
Monday
upper body (shoulders,
biceps
, and back)
biceps curl
dumbbell single-arm row
dumbbell shoulder press
Tuesday
rest or
cardio
Wednesday
lower body (
legs
and butt)
dumbbell lunge
weighted squat
weighted calf raise
Thursday
rest or cardio
Friday
upper body (
triceps
, shoulders, and chest)
shoulder lateral raise
dumbbell chest press
triceps extension
Saturday
rest or cardio
Sunday
rest or cardio
Start with the lightest weights possible, gradually increasing over time. This will help you achieve hypertrophy, which, Walker explains, is “when the muscle fibers break down to their best ability, so they can repair and grow larger.” (In other words: #gains.)
Pro tip:
Walker says that getting enough
protein
and adequate
sleep
will also aid in muscle repair and help your muscles grow to their greatest potential.
How to start weight training safely
Whether you’re a newbie or a seasoned pro, it’s important to be careful when weight training. Exercising safely can help you avoid injury and ensure that you’re not burning yourself out.
Add these safety tips to your “must follow” list:
Got pain?
Seriously, if something
hurts
, stop and reevaluate. You may need to check in with a trainer about your form. If pain persists, consult a healthcare professional ASAP.
Take it slow.
Do each exercise slowly to reap the full benefits (and to steer clear of injuries!).
Use proper form.
Always make sure your form is top-notch when doing any weight lifting exercise.
Hydrate, hydrate, hydrate!
Rest periods between sets? Perfect time for
water
.
Staying hydrated
keeps your muscles and joints moving freely.
Dress the part.
Always wear the right gear for lifting.
Workout clothes
, closed-toed shoes, and weightlifting gloves can help make your workouts safe and effective.
Breathe… just breathe.
Pay attention to your breath
as you move. Inhale before each lift and exhale during each lift.
Always give your body recovery days.
Skipping
recovery days
increases your risk of injury and can affect your fitness gains. Your body needs to recover to build muscle strength and size.
Takeaway
Weight training is a great way to burn calories, build muscle, and boost strength.
If you’re looking to add weightlifting to your workout routine, consider working with a trainer, setting a schedule, and investing in basic equipment (like dumbbells). To prevent injury or burnout, it’s important to start slowly, making sure you’re taking rest days and not doing too many reps or making your workout too long.
Always be safe when lifting weights. Take your time, use proper form, and never push through pain during workouts. If something feels wrong, stop your workout and consult a professional.

? We feel ya. Thankfully, there are many online resources (*cough, cough*
Greatist
👀) to show you examples of what good form looks like and explain how to do it right.
Rest between sets
It’s important to give your muscles a little time off after completing a set.
When you’re a weightlifting newbie, aim for at least
1 minute
of
rest
between sets (aka groups of reps). This’ll give your muscles
time to recover
and avoid getting overworked or fatigued.
These brief rest periods also give you the opportunity to grab
a swig of sweet H
2
O
and check in with your body. (Any pain points? Stiffness? Something feeling out of sorts? Use this time to take notice!)
Keep workouts to 45 minutes
All good things must come to an end — including a killer sweat sesh.
Limiting your workouts to 45 minutes can help you avoid overdoing it.
Overtraining
can leave you feeling tired,
sore
, and potentially
cranky
. It can also increase your risk of injury because you’re not allowing your muscles to properly recover.
Plus, there’s no science that says a longer workout produces better results.
How
you spend your time is more important than how
much
time you spend lifting, so use your minutes wisely and reap the benefits. And again, REST between sessions!
Increase weight gradually
As you get deeper into your weight training journey, you’ll find that your
weights
provide less resistance over time. This means your muscles are getting stronger! Yay!
It also means you can start to
increase the amount of weight
you’re lifting. But instead of tacking on a ton of extra poundage at once, introduce more weight little by little.
Gradually
increase weight
by 5 to 10 percent, making sure you’re perfecting each move (with
proper form
!) before increasing your weight levels again.
Cool down after you work out
A quick
stretch sesh
to cool down after a workout can help ease any muscle tension or
tightness
after lifting, as well as improve your flexibility and range of motion, according to a
2012 research review
.
The
research
results on this are inconclusive and mixed, but it’s possible that
stretching
may also help prevent injury.
Plus, stretching just feels
ah-mazing
after you’ve hit the weights. You can also cool down with easy cardio, massage, or foam rolling. And don’t forget to rehydrate and refuel!
Make a workout schedule
Setting a schedule can help you stay consistent in your routine. Determine how and when to target certain muscle groups, and build in the right amount of rest and recovery for primo performance.
After a long day, a
glass of wine
and a
Netflix marathon
may sound better than a workout. So
planning your workouts
also provides you with some accountability — especially if you’re working out alone and don’t have a trainer or
friend
to hold you to it.
Your Netflix sesh will still be waiting for you after your workout.
Take rest days!
Rest days
are a key component of any workout sched and are essential for promoting
muscle recovery
and reducing the risk of getting hurt.
When starting a weightlifting program, Walker recommends taking at least 2 or 3 rest days each week. “Each muscle group needs 48 to 72 hours to recover before performing the next workout. This is why it’s a good idea to do split workouts in the beginning.”
Split training
involves focusing on specific muscle groups one day and then targeting others the next. This allows particular muscle groups to recover while you work out other groups.
“Once your body has adapted after a few weeks, the muscle groups will need 24 to 48 hours to recover,” notes Walker. “Recovering sooner, you can now plan your workouts more accordingly during the week and add an extra training day.”
Beginner weightlifting exercises to get you started
Here’s a quick refresher on weightlifting lingo:
Reps
(aka repetitions) = how many times you complete an exercise movement
Sets
= how many reps you do (for example, 20 reps may equal 1 set)
When you’re just starting out, Walker suggests
performing an average of 3–4 sets of 20 reps each
. As your muscles adapt to certain movements, you can increase the number of reps and sets you do during your workouts.
Got your
dumbbells
ready? Here are some of the best beginner weight training moves to get you started.
Dumbbell single-arm row
Share on Pinterest
GIF by Active Body, Creative Mind
Rest your left knee on a bench, keeping right foot planted on the floor. For balance, let your left hand rest palm-down near the front of the bench.
With right hand, reach down and pick up your dumbbell. Make sure your back is parallel to the floor.
Slowly lift the weight up toward your waist, bending elbow and squeezing shoulder and back muscles.
Slowly lower the weight, extending your arm to return to the starting position.
Complete 1 set, then switch to the other side and repeat.
Dumbbell shoulder press
Share on Pinterest
GIF by Active Body, Creative Mind
Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart, holding a dumbbell in each hand. (You can also do this one seated — just be sure to sit up straight so that your spine is aligned!)
Lift your elbows so they’re raised at your sides at 90-degree angles.
Turn your palms forward.
Slowly press the dumbbells up toward the sky, straightening your arms. Make sure to keep your spine aligned — no leaning or arching your back!
Slowly bring your arms back down to the starting position.
Shoulder lateral raise
Share on Pinterest
GIF by Dima Bazak
Stand (or sit!) up straight with your arms at your sides and a dumbbell in each hand.
Keeping your arms straight, slowly lift arms out to the sides until they’re parallel to the floor. Don’t pinch your neck or swing your arms. Use shoulder and back muscles to make this a slow, controlled movement.
Slowly lower your arms back down to your sides.
Dumbbell chest press
Share on Pinterest
GIF by Dima Bazak
Lie faceup on a
bench
or the
floor
, holding a dumbbell in each hand. Bend elbows at 90 degrees and position your arms at about a 45-degree angle to your body.
With palms facing toward feet, slowly press the weights toward the sky, extending arms directly above your shoulders. Be sure to keep your elbows soft — don’t lock them!
Slowly lower the weights back to the starting position.
Biceps curl
Share on Pinterest
GIF by Dima Bazak
Stand or sit with arms at your sides, holding a weight in each hand.
Bend elbows to curl the weights up toward your shoulders, turning palms to face your body.
Slowly lower the weights back to the starting position.
Triceps extension
Share on Pinterest
GIF by Dima Bazak
Stand or sit, making sure your feet are shoulder-width apart.
Hold a dumbbell vertically, with both hands around the handle.
Lift arms straight up, so the weight is directly over your head.
Don’t pinch your shoulders, and leave space between your elbows and ears. Slowly bend arms, lowering the dumbbell behind your head.
Press the dumbbell up to the sky to return to the starting position.
Dumbbell lunge
Share on Pinterest
GIF by Active Body, Creative Mind
Stand with your arms at your sides, holding a dumbbell in each hand.
Step forward with right leg, bending at the knee until right thigh is parallel with the floor (make sure your bent knee does not extend past your toes!). Let left leg bend to keep you balanced.
Step right foot back to the starting position.
Repeat with the other leg.
Weighted squat
Share on Pinterest
GIF by Dima Bazak
Stand with feet shoulder-width apart. For weight, you can hold 2 dumbbells on your shoulders, 1 dumbbell at your chest, or a kettlebell at your chest (your choice!).
Keeping the weight steady, slowly bend your knees and sit back into a squat, as if sitting in a chair. (Make sure your heels don’t lift off the floor.)
Slowly rise back up to standing by activating your core and glutes.
Weighted calf raise
Share on Pinterest
GIF by Dima Bazak
Stand on a flat surface with feet shoulder-width apart and arms at your sides, holding a dumbbell in each hand.
Slowly lift onto your toes, raising your heels off the floor.
Hold for 1–2 seconds.
Slowly lower your heels back down.
Your strength training schedule
Setting a weekly weight training schedule gives you a road map for which muscles to work when and allows for proper
rest and recovery
.
How many days you exercise
each week really depends on your goals. But
the American College of Sports Medicine
generally recommends resistance training (i.e., weightlifting) 2 or 3 days a week for best results.
Here’s a simple 3-day plan (using the exercises above!) to help you get started:
Day
Muscle groups
Exercises
(
3 or 4 sets of 20 reps)
Monday
upper body (shoulders,
biceps
, and back)
biceps curl
dumbbell single-arm row
dumbbell shoulder press
Tuesday
rest or
cardio
Wednesday
lower body (
legs
and butt)
dumbbell lunge
weighted squat
weighted calf raise
Thursday
rest or cardio
Friday
upper body (
triceps
, shoulders, and chest)
shoulder lateral raise
dumbbell chest press
triceps extension
Saturday
rest or cardio
Sunday
rest or cardio
Start with the lightest weights possible, gradually increasing over time. This will help you achieve hypertrophy, which, Walker explains, is “when the muscle fibers break down to their best ability, so they can repair and grow larger.” (In other words: #gains.)
Pro tip:
Walker says that getting enough
protein
and adequate
sleep
will also aid in muscle repair and help your muscles grow to their greatest potential.
How to start weight training safely
Whether you’re a newbie or a seasoned pro, it’s important to be careful when weight training. Exercising safely can help you avoid injury and ensure that you’re not burning yourself out.
Add these safety tips to your “must follow” list:
Got pain?
Seriously, if something
hurts
, stop and reevaluate. You may need to check in with a trainer about your form. If pain persists, consult a healthcare professional ASAP.
Take it slow.
Do each exercise slowly to reap the full benefits (and to steer clear of injuries!).
Use proper form.
Always make sure your form is top-notch when doing any weight lifting exercise.
Hydrate, hydrate, hydrate!
Rest periods between sets? Perfect time for
water
.
Staying hydrated
keeps your muscles and joints moving freely.
Dress the part.
Always wear the right gear for lifting.
Workout clothes
, closed-toed shoes, and weightlifting gloves can help make your workouts safe and effective.
Breathe… just breathe.
Pay attention to your breath
as you move. Inhale before each lift and exhale during each lift.
Always give your body recovery days.
Skipping
recovery days
increases your risk of injury and can affect your fitness gains. Your body needs to recover to build muscle strength and size.
Takeaway
Weight training is a great way to burn calories, build muscle, and boost strength.
If you’re looking to add weightlifting to your workout routine, consider working with a trainer, setting a schedule, and investing in basic equipment (like dumbbells). To prevent injury or burnout, it’s important to start slowly, making sure you’re taking rest days and not doing too many reps or making your workout too long.
Always be safe when lifting weights. Take your time, use proper form, and never push through pain during workouts. If something feels wrong, stop your workout and consult a professional.

What is Pilates?
Pilates is the brainchild of Joseph Pilates, who developed the technique in the mid-20th century. It uses a series of
stretching
, strengthening, and breathing exercises that activate your
core muscles
and help those fibers become long and lean.
Over the years,
Pilates
has become a popular workout option. You can do Pilates using only a
mat
, or you can add tools and equipment such as a
Pilates reformer
. Either option can give you an awesome workout with all the Pilates bennies.
Pilates vs. yoga: What’s the diff?
Sure, Pilates and
yoga
seem similar at first glance. They’re both popular forms of exercise that use stretching and
breathing
techniques to improve your overall health. But they also have some notable differences.
Pilates is a
low impact exercise
that focuses on performing small movements that rely on your back and core muscles for stabilization. The main physical benefits of Pilates are improved core strength and better posture.
Yoga
focuses on
mindfulness
and deep breathing as you flow through a series of held poses. It’s often used to deepen meditation practices, boost
flexibility
, and improve
balance
.
10 mind and body benefits of Pilates
There are lots of benefits (for both your body and your
mind
) to making Pilates part of your health and
wellness routine
.
1. Develops body awareness and control
Pilates focuses on controlled movements. You’ll be challenged to stay aware of your
breath
, posture, and movement while you’re performing these routines.
All this attention can seem overwhelming when you’re
starting out
, but don’t worry. Over time, you’ll get more in tune with your body, both on and off the mat.
2. Reduces lower back pain
Physical therapists
agree that Pilates helps relieve pain in certain populations. If your
body awareness
has decreased (this can happen with age or injury), Pilates can be an effective way to manage and relieve related
lower back pain
.
However, if you’re dealing with a back fracture or
preeclampsia
, Pilates prob won’t make a big difference in your pain.
3. Improves posture
When your spine’s not stabilized, your
posture
suffers. Regular Pilates workouts can strengthen any underdeveloped muscles that may be causing you to slouch.
4. Helps maintain weight
Pilates can help you on your journey to
maintain a healthy weight
thanks to its focus on strengthening, sculpting, and building lean muscle.
In an
8-week study
of 37 women who were overweight or had obesity, Pilates helped participants lose weight and reduce
BMI
.
Just remember that it’s important to combine exercise with
healthy diet
and lifestyle choices.
5. Relieves stress
As the wise
Elle Woods
once said, “Exercise gives you
endorphins
. Endorphins make you happy.”
Pilates is a great restorative workout, so it’s an effective way to
help you relax
. All this relaxation can help release muscle tension, kick
stress
to the curb, and elevate your mood.
6. Strengthens core
Pilates activates
your core muscles
(the ones in your back, abdomen, and pelvic floor). These muscles are essential for supporting your entire body.
A regular Pilates routine can keep your
core strong
and firm (hello,
abs!
). When the rest of your body isn’t overcompensating for a weak core, those muscles can catch a break.
7. Boosts energy
Once you get into the Pilates groove, you may notice an
uptick in energy
. Why? Because Pilates helps improve blood circulation. That gets your body flowin’ and goin’.
It also makes your body feel good all around (thanks to that aligned spine, strong core, and added flexibility!), which can add an extra pep in your step.
8. Improves focus
When you do a Pilates workout, you’re exercising your body, but you’re also giving your ability to focus a workout.
Reaping the most rewards from Pilates requires
concentration
. You need to ensure that your body and breath are in sync with every movement. This
boosts your focus
in the moment and can carry over into other parts of your life.
9. Helps you get better sleep
Pilates may be just what the doctor ordered for a
good night’s sleep
.
Research
suggests that Pilates can significantly improve sleep quality.
Bonus:
Better sleep leads to
better moods
. It’s a win-win situation!
10. Improves flexibility
Like yoga, Pilates incorporates careful
stretching
and bending. This helps increase your range of motion while keeping your muscles strong. This one-two punch of
stretching
and strengthening can allow you (and your joints!) to become more
flexible
as you progress in your Pilates practice.

What is Pilates?
Pilates is the brainchild of Joseph Pilates, who developed the technique in the mid-20th century. It uses a series of
stretching
, strengthening, and breathing exercises that activate your
core muscles
and help those fibers become long and lean.
Over the years,
Pilates
has become a popular workout option. You can do Pilates using only a
mat
, or you can add tools and equipment such as a
Pilates reformer
. Either option can give you an awesome workout with all the Pilates bennies.
Pilates vs. yoga: What’s the diff?
Sure, Pilates and
yoga
seem similar at first glance. They’re both popular forms of exercise that use stretching and
breathing
techniques to improve your overall health. But they also have some notable differences.
Pilates is a
low impact exercise
that focuses on performing small movements that rely on your back and core muscles for stabilization. The main physical benefits of Pilates are improved core strength and better posture.
Yoga
focuses on
mindfulness
and deep breathing as you flow through a series of held poses. It’s often used to deepen meditation practices, boost
flexibility
, and improve
balance
.
10 mind and body benefits of Pilates
There are lots of benefits (for both your body and your
mind
) to making Pilates part of your health and
wellness routine
.
1. Develops body awareness and control
Pilates focuses on controlled movements. You’ll be challenged to stay aware of your
breath
, posture, and movement while you’re performing these routines.
All this attention can seem overwhelming when you’re
starting out
, but don’t worry. Over time, you’ll get more in tune with your body, both on and off the mat.
2. Reduces lower back pain
Physical therapists
agree that Pilates helps relieve pain in certain populations. If your
body awareness
has decreased (this can happen with age or injury), Pilates can be an effective way to manage and relieve related
lower back pain
.
However, if you’re dealing with a back fracture or
preeclampsia
, Pilates prob won’t make a big difference in your pain.
3. Improves posture
When your spine’s not stabilized, your
posture
suffers. Regular Pilates workouts can strengthen any underdeveloped muscles that may be causing you to slouch.
4. Helps maintain weight
Pilates can help you on your journey to
maintain a healthy weight
thanks to its focus on strengthening, sculpting, and building lean muscle.
In an
8-week study
of 37 women who were overweight or had obesity, Pilates helped participants lose weight and reduce
BMI
.
Just remember that it’s important to combine exercise with
healthy diet
and lifestyle choices.
5. Relieves stress
As the wise
Elle Woods
once said, “Exercise gives you
endorphins
. Endorphins make you happy.”
Pilates is a great restorative workout, so it’s an effective way to
help you relax
. All this relaxation can help release muscle tension, kick
stress
to the curb, and elevate your mood.
6. Strengthens core
Pilates activates
your core muscles
(the ones in your back, abdomen, and pelvic floor). These muscles are essential for supporting your entire body.
A regular Pilates routine can keep your
core strong
and firm (hello,
abs!
). When the rest of your body isn’t overcompensating for a weak core, those muscles can catch a break.
7. Boosts energy
Once you get into the Pilates groove, you may notice an
uptick in energy
. Why? Because Pilates helps improve blood circulation. That gets your body flowin’ and goin’.
It also makes your body feel good all around (thanks to that aligned spine, strong core, and added flexibility!), which can add an extra pep in your step.
8. Improves focus
When you do a Pilates workout, you’re exercising your body, but you’re also giving your ability to focus a workout.
Reaping the most rewards from Pilates requires
concentration
. You need to ensure that your body and breath are in sync with every movement. This
boosts your focus
in the moment and can carry over into other parts of your life.
9. Helps you get better sleep
Pilates may be just what the doctor ordered for a
good night’s sleep
.
Research
suggests that Pilates can significantly improve sleep quality.
Bonus:
Better sleep leads to
better moods
. It’s a win-win situation!
10. Improves flexibility
Like yoga, Pilates incorporates careful
stretching
and bending. This helps increase your range of motion while keeping your muscles strong. This one-two punch of
stretching
and strengthening can allow you (and your joints!) to become more
flexible
as you progress in your Pilates practice.

Muscle growth 101
Workouts
Diet
Supplements
Rome wasn’t built in a day — and your
muscles
can’t be, either.
A combo of
exercise
and a balanced diet can put you on track for healthy
muscle growth
, but it can take some time. Here’s how to gain muscle as quickly as possible in just 1 month.
How much muscle can you actually gain in a month?
The short answer:
about 0.5 to 2 pounds of muscle
According to
Dr. Jessica Volciak
of
Bene Physical Therapy
, that’s what “the medical and strength training community agrees… is naturally obtainable” per month.
However, “everyone is different and builds muscle at different rates,” Volciak says. “Those with more experience and already-developed muscle fibers find it harder and slower to have as much muscle growth as those who are newer to strength training.”
Some research
suggests that “advanced trainees” (aka experienced fitness peeps) might not gain more than a few pounds of muscle per year.
So, it’s tough to say how much you’ll bulk up in 30 days. Like Volciak says, “it will always depend on several factors, such as training, hormones, nutrition, recovery, supplements, etc.”

How to gain more muscle, stat
Whether you want to build
muscle
for the health benefits, to compete in
lifting competitions
, or maybe just so you can kiss your biceps in the mirror, here’s how to get the best results.
How does muscle growth actually work?
When you work your muscles like you mean it, you actually
traumatize muscle fibers
. That might sound like a bad thing, but your muscles were made for this. The trauma activates satellite cells that work to fix your muscles, making them bigger and stronger in the process.
Your muscles don’t fuse new fibers together and grow bigger
while
you
work out
— that happens afterward. That’s right: Your
biceps
are bulking up while you’re
napping
on the couch, not while you’re pumping iron. But you can’t have one without the other.
So, how do you pump up this process?
To max out this muscle cell growth (a process called
hypertrophy
), resistance training is key.
According to a
2019 research review
, effective hypertrophy-oriented training should include a combo of mechanical tension and metabolic stress. That means you need to do multiple sets of resistance exercises while getting your
heart rate
up.
For the everyday bodybuilder, Volciak recommends enlisting a coach or learning the ins and outs of hypertrophy on your own. She also advises working on your diet with a
registered dietitian
to make sure you’re getting the vital
protein
and other macronutrients your body needs to build those muscles.
Ultimately, she says, the goal is to “figure out an individualized program that works for you.”
WTF is blood flow restriction (BFR) training?
If you’re in the bodybuilding scene, you may have heard of this newish hypertrophy technique aimed at restricting blood flow. It’s designed to create the ideal cell environment for muscle growth.
In a
2021 review
, researchers note that participants in BFR studies have experienced rapid increases in muscle size, strength, and endurance capacity.
But don’t go restricting your blood flow just yet. “[BFR] has not yet been proven to increase the amount of muscle mass in a month,” Volciak says, “and should only be used with trained, clinical supervision.”
Your monthly muscle growth checklist
To max out muscle growth, researchers also
recommend
the following:
Do multiple sets.
Experts say 3–6 is best.
Complete multiple reps.
Aim for 6–12
reps
.
Take short rests.
Rest up
for 60 seconds or less between sets.
Shoot for a moderate intensity.
Give it 60 to 80 percent effort per rep.
Mix it up.
Mix up your routine with a
4-day split or a circuit workout
to help avoid muscle plateaus.
Up your training regimen.
Keep increasing your training volume to keep challenging your
muscles
.
Advance your skills.
For trained athletes, researchers recommend adding advanced techniques to help overcome plateaus, prevent boredom, and even reduce training time.
Incorporate cardio.
The pros at the
American Council on Exercise
recommend adding a couple days of high-intensity interval training (HIIT) cardio to burn extra cals each week.
Prioritize your diet.
A balanced diet with plenty of
lean proteins, veggies, fruits, and whole grains
is important for optimal hypertrophy.
Don’t give up.
As with most good things, persistence is key when it comes to maximizing your results.
Muscle-building workouts that really work
You don’t need to get too fancy to bulk up. Exercises that work more than one muscle group, like
squats
,
overhead presses
, and rows, will get you
the biggest bang
for each rep. The best of the best tend to be
bodyweight
exercises or moves that involve
barbells
or
dumbbells
.
Here are some ideas to kick off your month of muscle growth.
1. Squats
Squats
with barbells make for
massive legs
, but they also work a lot of
upper-body
muscles. Stand with your feet hip-width apart, lower down like you’re sitting in an invisible chair, and feel the burn.
(And with
40 squat variations
, just *try* to get bored.)
2. Deadlifts
A round of
deadlifts
with a barbell might make your hammies,
glutes
, and back
feel dead tired
afterward. Bonus: Deadlifts can also make you ripped.
Pro tip:
As you lift the barbell to hip level, be sure to keep your torso perpendicular to the floor.
3. Dips
Triceps dips
work your
shoulders
,
chest
, and triceps hard AF. You’ll need parallel bars to pull off this move. Be sure your hands are shoulder-width apart and your arms are straight, and then dip down like you mean it.
4. Pull-ups
Ah, another classic. If you
can’t do a pull-up
yet, prep your bod by doing a dead hang on the
bar
for as long as you can. Eventually, you’ll get there.
5. Bench presses
There are lots of
bench press
variations, and they’re all super effective for bulking up your upper bod.
Try a flat bench barbell or dumbbell press to start, and then work your way up to the tougher inclines.
Diet deets
You don’t have to down five dozen eggs
like Gaston
to get jacked. Basically, you just need to eat a
healthy, well-rounded diet
. Here’s what to do.
Get your lean protein
While it might seem like muscly people and
protein powder
go together like PB&J, there
is
such a thing as too much protein. Yes, that’s true even if you’re aiming to bulk up. Going too hard on protein can lead to
weight gain or even kidney stones
.
The
American College of Sports Medicine
recommends getting anywhere from 10 to 35 percent of your daily cals from protein. If you’re working out hard, you might fall into the upper end of this spectrum. While the 10 percent figure is often cited,
research from 2019
suggests that number may be a minimum rather than an ideal.
And you don’t necessarily need a supplement to get enough of this nutrient. You can find plenty of
protein
in foods like these:
beans
nuts
tofu
eggs
fish
poultry
lean meat
If you’re not sure whether you’re getting enough protein, a registered dietitian may be able to help you figure it out.
Nosh on complex carbs
Carbs partly convert to glycogen (a substance that helps build muscle). For optimal health, aim to get about half (
45 to 65 percent
) of your total cals from carbs.
Veggies and fruits are A+ carb sources. The
CDC
recommends getting at least 3.5 to 5 cups of them per day. Complex carbs like peas, beans,
sweet potatoes
, quinoa, and whole grains are also great options.
Some
dairy products
, like milk and
Greek yogurt
, also contain carbs.
Don’t forget your (healthy) fats
Don’t get it twisted: Even if you don’t want to
gain
fat
, you still need to
eat
fat.
According to the
2020–2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans
, adults should aim to get 20 to 35 percent of their total daily cals from fat.
The guidelines also advise getting less than 10 percent of
calories
per day from saturated fats. Saturated fats are the not-so-healthy ones that come from foods like processed meats, butter, and most sweet treats.
Instead, try to choose foods with more heart-healthy fats, like nuts, fatty fish, and
avocado
.
The scoop on supplements
No matter how much your gym buddy raves about supplements, most people can get the nutrients they need to build muscle fast through a
healthy, balanced diet
.
But using one of the following supps might help too.
Protein supplements
Protein is essential for building muscle. If you have trouble fitting enough
protein
into your diet, there are plenty of supplements that can fill in the gap.
If you’re OK with dairy, you can try
whey
or casein (both are dairy byproducts). For
plant-based
options, there’s pea protein,
hemp protein
, soy protein, and more.
Creatine
Your body naturally produces creatine, which helps your muscles and tissues use energy in powerful bursts.
This supplement is super popular with bodybuilders and gym fanatics alike. By supplementing your body’s natural production of
creatine
, you may be able to build muscle more efficiently.
Pro tip:
Creatine pulls water into your cells to help build more muscle. To get the biggest benefits while taking creatine, avoid
alcohol
(it can dehydrate you) and drink
plenty
of
H
2
O
.
Weight gainers
If you struggle to gain muscle and weight, even when
pumping iron
and consuming plenty of cals, weight gainers might be for you.
But don’t overdo it. These high cal supplements often contain
more than 1,000 calories
, hundreds of grams of carbs, and more than 50 grams of protein per serving.
Beta-alanine
Beta-alanine is an amino acid that may reduce fatigue and boost
exercise
performance.
Though there’s still not a ton of research on this one, the
International Society of Sports Nutrition
has noted that it may be effective for improved muscle growth and deemed it safe to use.
These are just a few of the most popular supplements. If you take a trip to your local supplement store, you’ll find many, many (did we say many?) more.
It’s always a good idea to talk with a medical professional or a registered dietitian before taking any supplements. A pro can help you figure out whether a certain supp is a good option for you.
Sooo… what about steroids?
You may be tempted to reach for some ’roids to bulk up more quickly. After all, it seems like lots of bodybuilders do it.
But, although anabolic steroids (synthetic forms of testosterone)
do
sometimes have
legit medical uses
, bulking up isn’t one of them.
These powerful drugs can come with
harmful side effects
like high blood pressure, liver disorders, and sexual and reproductive disorders. It’s illegal to use them without a prescription in many countries,
including the United States
. And it’s not a good idea to use them without talking with your doctor first.
tl;dr
It’s hard to say how much muscle you can gain in a month.
Fitness experience level
, genetics, age, diet, and workout regimen all play a role in muscle growth. On average, though, most people can gain 0.5 to 2 pounds of muscle per month.
The most important things you can do to amp up your muscle growth are focus on resistance training and eat a well-rounded diet.

If you’re not sure whether you’re getting enough protein, a registered dietitian may be able to help you figure it out.
Nosh on complex carbs
Carbs partly convert to glycogen (a substance that helps build muscle). For optimal health, aim to get about half (
45 to 65 percent
) of your total cals from carbs.
Veggies and fruits are A+ carb sources. The
CDC
recommends getting at least 3.5 to 5 cups of them per day. Complex carbs like peas, beans,
sweet potatoes
, quinoa, and whole grains are also great options.
Some
dairy products
, like milk and
Greek yogurt
, also contain carbs.
Don’t forget your (healthy) fats
Don’t get it twisted: Even if you don’t want to
gain
fat
, you still need to
eat
fat.
According to the
2020–2025 Dietary Guidelines for Americans
, adults should aim to get 20 to 35 percent of their total daily cals from fat.
The guidelines also advise getting less than 10 percent of
calories
per day from saturated fats. Saturated fats are the not-so-healthy ones that come from foods like processed meats, butter, and most sweet treats.
Instead, try to choose foods with more heart-healthy fats, like nuts, fatty fish, and
avocado
.
The scoop on supplements
No matter how much your gym buddy raves about supplements, most people can get the nutrients they need to build muscle fast through a
healthy, balanced diet
.
But using one of the following supps might help too.
Protein supplements
Protein is essential for building muscle. If you have trouble fitting enough
protein
into your diet, there are plenty of supplements that can fill in the gap.
If you’re OK with dairy, you can try
whey
or casein (both are dairy byproducts). For
plant-based
options, there’s pea protein,
hemp protein
, soy protein, and more.
Creatine
Your body naturally produces creatine, which helps your muscles and tissues use energy in powerful bursts.
This supplement is super popular with bodybuilders and gym fanatics alike. By supplementing your body’s natural production of
creatine
, you may be able to build muscle more efficiently.
Pro tip:
Creatine pulls water into your cells to help build more muscle. To get the biggest benefits while taking creatine, avoid
alcohol
(it can dehydrate you) and drink
plenty
of
H
2
O
.
Weight gainers
If you struggle to gain muscle and weight, even when
pumping iron
and consuming plenty of cals, weight gainers might be for you.
But don’t overdo it. These high cal supplements often contain
more than 1,000 calories
, hundreds of grams of carbs, and more than 50 grams of protein per serving.
Beta-alanine
Beta-alanine is an amino acid that may reduce fatigue and boost
exercise
performance.
Though there’s still not a ton of research on this one, the
International Society of Sports Nutrition
has noted that it may be effective for improved muscle growth and deemed it safe to use.
These are just a few of the most popular supplements. If you take a trip to your local supplement store, you’ll find many, many (did we say many?) more.
It’s always a good idea to talk with a medical professional or a registered dietitian before taking any supplements. A pro can help you figure out whether a certain supp is a good option for you.
Sooo… what about steroids?
You may be tempted to reach for some ’roids to bulk up more quickly. After all, it seems like lots of bodybuilders do it.
But, although anabolic steroids (synthetic forms of testosterone)
do
sometimes have
legit medical uses
, bulking up isn’t one of them.
These powerful drugs can come with
harmful side effects
like high blood pressure, liver disorders, and sexual and reproductive disorders. It’s illegal to use them without a prescription in many countries,
including the United States
. And it’s not a good idea to use them without talking with your doctor first.
tl;dr
It’s hard to say how much muscle you can gain in a month.
Fitness experience level
, genetics, age, diet, and workout regimen all play a role in muscle growth. On average, though, most people can gain 0.5 to 2 pounds of muscle per month.
The most important things you can do to amp up your muscle growth are focus on resistance training and eat a well-rounded diet.

Muscle growth 101
Workouts
Diet
Supplements
Rome wasn’t built in a day — and your
muscles
can’t be, either.
A combo of
exercise
and a balanced diet can put you on track for healthy
muscle growth
, but it can take some time. Here’s how to gain muscle as quickly as possible in just 1 month.
How much muscle can you actually gain in a month?
The short answer:
about 0.5 to 2 pounds of muscle
According to
Dr. Jessica Volciak
of
Bene Physical Therapy
, that’s what “the medical and strength training community agrees… is naturally obtainable” per month.
However, “everyone is different and builds muscle at different rates,” Volciak says. “Those with more experience and already-developed muscle fibers find it harder and slower to have as much muscle growth as those who are newer to strength training.”
Some research
suggests that “advanced trainees” (aka experienced fitness peeps) might not gain more than a few pounds of muscle per year.
So, it’s tough to say how much you’ll bulk up in 30 days. Like Volciak says, “it will always depend on several factors, such as training, hormones, nutrition, recovery, supplements, etc.”

How to gain more muscle, stat
Whether you want to build
muscle
for the health benefits, to compete in
lifting competitions
, or maybe just so you can kiss your biceps in the mirror, here’s how to get the best results.
How does muscle growth actually work?
When you work your muscles like you mean it, you actually
traumatize muscle fibers
. That might sound like a bad thing, but your muscles were made for this. The trauma activates satellite cells that work to fix your muscles, making them bigger and stronger in the process.
Your muscles don’t fuse new fibers together and grow bigger
while
you
work out
— that happens afterward. That’s right: Your
biceps
are bulking up while you’re
napping
on the couch, not while you’re pumping iron. But you can’t have one without the other.
So, how do you pump up this process?
To max out this muscle cell growth (a process called
hypertrophy
), resistance training is key.
According to a
2019 research review
, effective hypertrophy-oriented training should include a combo of mechanical tension and metabolic stress. That means you need to do multiple sets of resistance exercises while getting your
heart rate
up.
For the everyday bodybuilder, Volciak recommends enlisting a coach or learning the ins and outs of hypertrophy on your own. She also advises working on your diet with a
registered dietitian
to make sure you’re getting the vital
protein
and other macronutrients your body needs to build those muscles.
Ultimately, she says, the goal is to “figure out an individualized program that works for you.”
WTF is blood flow restriction (BFR) training?
If you’re in the bodybuilding scene, you may have heard of this newish hypertrophy technique aimed at restricting blood flow. It’s designed to create the ideal cell environment for muscle growth.
In a
2021 review
, researchers note that participants in BFR studies have experienced rapid increases in muscle size, strength, and endurance capacity.
But don’t go restricting your blood flow just yet. “[BFR] has not yet been proven to increase the amount of muscle mass in a month,” Volciak says, “and should only be used with trained, clinical supervision.”
Your monthly muscle growth checklist
To max out muscle growth, researchers also
recommend
the following:
Do multiple sets.
Experts say 3–6 is best.
Complete multiple reps.
Aim for 6–12
reps
.
Take short rests.
Rest up
for 60 seconds or less between sets.
Shoot for a moderate intensity.
Give it 60 to 80 percent effort per rep.
Mix it up.
Mix up your routine with a
4-day split or a circuit workout
to help avoid muscle plateaus.
Up your training regimen.
Keep increasing your training volume to keep challenging your
muscles
.
Advance your skills.
For trained athletes, researchers recommend adding advanced techniques to help overcome plateaus, prevent boredom, and even reduce training time.
Incorporate cardio.
The pros at the
American Council on Exercise
recommend adding a couple days of high-intensity interval training (HIIT) cardio to burn extra cals each week.
Prioritize your diet.
A balanced diet with plenty of
lean proteins, veggies, fruits, and whole grains
is important for optimal hypertrophy.
Don’t give up.
As with most good things, persistence is key when it comes to maximizing your results.
Muscle-building workouts that really work
You don’t need to get too fancy to bulk up. Exercises that work more than one muscle group, like
squats
,
overhead presses
, and rows, will get you
the biggest bang
for each rep. The best of the best tend to be
bodyweight
exercises or moves that involve
barbells
or
dumbbells
.
Here are some ideas to kick off your month of muscle growth.
1. Squats
Squats
with barbells make for
massive legs
, but they also work a lot of
upper-body
muscles. Stand with your feet hip-width apart, lower down like you’re sitting in an invisible chair, and feel the burn.
(And with
40 squat variations
, just *try* to get bored.)
2. Deadlifts
A round of
deadlifts
with a barbell might make your hammies,
glutes
, and back
feel dead tired
afterward. Bonus: Deadlifts can also make you ripped.
Pro tip:
As you lift the barbell to hip level, be sure to keep your torso perpendicular to the floor.
3. Dips
Triceps dips
work your
shoulders
,
chest
, and triceps hard AF. You’ll need parallel bars to pull off this move. Be sure your hands are shoulder-width apart and your arms are straight, and then dip down like you mean it.
4. Pull-ups
Ah, another classic. If you
can’t do a pull-up
yet, prep your bod by doing a dead hang on the
bar
for as long as you can. Eventually, you’ll get there.
5. Bench presses
There are lots of
bench press
variations, and they’re all super effective for bulking up your upper bod.
Try a flat bench barbell or dumbbell press to start, and then work your way up to the tougher inclines.
Diet deets
You don’t have to down five dozen eggs
like Gaston
to get jacked. Basically, you just need to eat a
healthy, well-rounded diet
. Here’s what to do.
Get your lean protein
While it might seem like muscly people and
protein powder
go together like PB&J, there
is
such a thing as too much protein. Yes, that’s true even if you’re aiming to bulk up. Going too hard on protein can lead to
weight gain or even kidney stones
.
The
American College of Sports Medicine
recommends getting anywhere from 10 to 35 percent of your daily cals from protein. If you’re working out hard, you might fall into the upper end of this spectrum. While the 10 percent figure is often cited,
research from 2019
suggests that number may be a minimum rather than an ideal.
And you don’t necessarily need a supplement to get enough of this nutrient. You can find plenty of
protein
in foods like these:
beans
nuts
tofu
eggs
fish
poultry
lean meat
If you’re not sure whether you’re getting enough protein, a registered dietitian may be able to help you figure it out.
Nosh on complex carbs
Carbs partly convert to glycogen (a substance that helps build muscle). For optimal health, aim to get about half (
45 to 65 percent
) of your total cals from carbs.
Veggies and fruits are A+ carb sources. The
CDC
recommends getting at least 3.5 to 5 cups of them per day. Complex carbs like peas, beans,
sweet potatoes
, quinoa, and whole grains are also great options.

dairy products
, like milk and
Greek yogurt

, you still need to

Om... Say What? Yoga Basics for Beginners

Basic poses
Other yoga practices
tl;dr
I avoided yoga through high school, probably because I was a teenager and it was something my mom was trying to get me to do. But I picked it up in college when I was no longer playing sports and needed an outlet for my energy.
I quickly fell in love with the practice — it made me feel
stronger
and calmer, and I started
sleeping better
. Now I try to get to yoga at least twice a week and do an
online video
on the days when I can’t make it out (read: when it’s under 30 degrees).
But yoga can be intimidating to those new to it, and I wanted to shed some light on what it’s all about, including some beginner poses to try.

Basic yoga poses for beginners
When it comes to yoga, there’s absolutely no need to start with challenging
inversions
or complicated poses. In fact, you never have to do them if you don’t want to. There are benefits to
easier yoga poses
, especially for stretching and
relaxation
.
Here are a few basic yoga poses to get you started.
1. Down Dog on a chair (Uttana Shishosana)
How to do this pose:
Using the back of a chair, stand with your feet shoulder-width apart. Step back, keeping your spine parallel to the floor until you’re in a 90-degree angle. Gently lengthen your back toward your hips.
2. Child’s Pose (Balasana)
How to do this pose:
Kneel with your knees shoulder-width apart. Your toes can curl in as shown or lie flat on the mat. Reach your arms forward, your hips back, and your head to the floor to feel the stretch.
If it feels like too much, you can modify it by placing a rolled-up towel behind your knees to rest on.
3. Happy Baby (Ananda Balasana)
How to do this pose:
Lie on your back and bring your knees up closer to your body. Grab the edges of your feet (or your ankles or shins if that’s too challenging), and separate your knees as far as is comfortable. Gently rock from side to side. Try to keep the length of your spine on the floor, especially the tailbone area.
4. Bound Angle Pose (Baddha Konasana)
Photography by Julia Hembree
How to do this pose:
Sit on the floor and bend your knees to bring the soles of your feet together. Bring your heels as close to your pelvis as is comfortable, or until you feel the stretch.
Bring your torso down toward your feet to lengthen your back muscles. Try to keep your spine straight and not rolled forward. The pose pictured is modified with
yoga blocks
.
5. Cat-Cow (Marjaryasana-Bitilasana)
How to do this pose:
Start on your hands and knees (or lean on your forearms if this pose feels uncomfortable). Arch your back gently up while tucking your head down into Cat Pose.
Lift your tailbone and lengthen your chest forward while dropping your belly down into Cow Pose. Hold for a few seconds, and then return to the starting position.
Other yoga practices: What do these mean?!
Breathing into your little toe (or any other body part)
I asked
Lauren Larry
, founder of Sunny Sankalpa Yoga, what it means when a teacher says to breathe into your toe or your hip or any body part that’s not a lung.
“This is actually a descriptor that I found confusing as a yoga student,” Larry says. “When you ‘breathe’ into a part of your body, picture the body part and relax the muscles around it.”
“As you bring awareness to that area of the body, contract and release the muscle you’re focusing on. Bring awareness to the body part mentioned in your inhale, and release tension on the muscles on your exhale. When you release tension in that muscle, you’re ‘breathing’ into the muscle.”
Ann Swanson
, a certified yoga therapist and the author of
Science of Yoga
, adds, “This is just a visualization to help bring your awareness to the area, increasing interoception, or internal body awareness. You cannot actually ‘breathe into’ a body part except your lungs. For that reason, I prefer to add ‘imagine’ before a cue like that.”
Breathing
into a part of your body other than your lungs is impossible, but by bringing awareness to a certain part of your body, you can send energy to it.
Andrea Trank
, founder of
Heaven Lane Healing & Creative Arts
, which provides customized yoga lessons and lifestyle coaching, says, “Energetically, when you breathe into an area, you are sending energy, attention, and possibly healing to this area. When you are moving as you do in yoga, with breath awareness, you are helping to circulate freshly oxygenated blood to all parts of your body involved in the practice.”
Setting an intention
I often feel panicky (definitely not the feeling yoga is intended to evoke) when teachers instruct the class to “set an
intention
.” From this anxiety comes a certain level of snark, and my intention can end up being something as thoughtless as “just let me make it through this class.”
I realized this anxious feeling arises because I’m not clear on what it means to set an intention and I worry I’m the only one doing it “wrong.” I remember feeling this way in math class when we were learning proofs — I had such trouble grasping the concept that I didn’t even know what questions to ask to get a clearer understanding.
Ever been there? Yeah, it sucks. So, what exactly does it mean to set an intention?
“I often start a yoga class by asking my students if they want to set an ‘intention’ for their practice.” Trank says. “It could be for yourself, a friend in need, or something that is needed by the world. It allows your practice to be more than just a physical asana practice. It becomes a spiritual practice as well.”
Ali Owens
, a certified yoga instructor and contributor to the
yogawakeup
app, tells her students that setting an intention can be a powerful way to bring meaning to your practice, whether by connecting with your breath or adding more love and joy to your life.
Setting an intention can be as simple as focusing on one word during your practice. Some people may focus on “ease” or “peace” or “love.”
The Sanskrit name for intention is “Sankalpa.”
“This is the deepest desire of your heart. It’s more than a goal of nailing a headstand,” Larry says. “It’s the embodiment of what you would like to manifest in life. It’s a word, a phrase, or even an emotion you would like to embody.”
She continues, “Find something you want in the big picture of your life, like grace under fire or forgiveness. When you pick your intention, come back to it during class. You’ll notice your classes have a new meaning.”
One word seems manageable to me!
Chanting 101
I used to lip-sync in classes that began with chanting, just like I used to mouth the words to “Happy Birthday” every time it was a co-worker’s birthday. (I say “used to” here because I work from home now and my dog doesn’t care that I can’t carry a tune.)
I’ve gotten over this self-consciousness in yoga class, but I still sometimes feel silly letting the “om”s fly. So, why is chanting beneficial?
It turns out that chanting “om” can actually switch your brain into relaxation mode.
One 2016 study
suggests that chanting “om” for 10 minutes can have a positive effect on mood and social cognition. And a
2019 study
suggests that religious chanting could have psychotherapeutic effects.
It may just be worth adding a chant to your yoga routine.
Inverted poses… and your period
I’ve had a few teachers who have offered alternative poses during the
inversion
part of class for anyone who is on their cycle. I always find this to be a bit of an awkward announcement that I have my period, much like the time I accidentally dropped three tampons in the middle of a crowded Starbucks and then walked out.
Is it true that for 1 week each month, I should pass on the headstand?
“There is no known medical reason to not do inversions while on your period. Currently, there is not convincing evidence that it would cause endometriosis or any health issues,” Swanson says.
She continues, “It may just simply be uncomfortable, especially if you are not used to inversions. According to yoga philosophy, going upside down may affect the natural downward flow that should happen during menstruation (apana vayu), but even with that, we can’t be sure if the subtle energy works that way, because we have no way to measure it.”
Owens adds, “When we invert, we send energy and blood upwards towards your heart and head, which can be great for circulation but counterproductive during your cycle. I have also found in my own personal practice that I feel a lack of willingness and sometimes ability to engage the muscles necessary to support my inversion practice.”
There’s really no evidence that any harm will come from inverting during your period — the larger concern is that it just may not feel great.
As Trank says, “I think the key is not to follow fast rules but to pay close attention to your body and be mindful of how each of the poses feel.” Do what feels right for you and your body each day.
Savasan-uhhhh… I wanna leave this class
I often find myself close to dosing off during Savasana (the final resting pose), especially if it’s an evening class. Or, worse (and this happens during midday classes), I’m anxious for Savasana to end so I can get on with my day. When I’m practicing at home, I never include this step.
I reasoned that if I learned what Savasana was doing for my mental and physical health, I may be able to think of it as more than a precursor to a nap or something impeding me from getting to the nonessential errands and manicure I have planned post-class.
But Larry explains that the “work” of yoga begins with Savasana.
“After the pranayama (breathing) and asana (postures), our bodies need to settle into themselves. Savasana isn’t a nap time, it’s a connection of mind, body, and spirit. Your body receives much-needed rest, and the yoga teacher guides your mind into stillness so you can connect fully.”
She continues, “You’ll notice your mind wants to be busy, but if you focus on your breathing, your mind will settle into stillness. It takes a lot of practice and dedication to get to that point.”
Savasana can be even more important than the active practice.
“Commonly known as Corpse Pose, it is a chance to mentally, physically, and spiritually consolidate all you have learned in your yoga practice that day,” Trank says. “It is a difficult pose because you are resting yet alert. If you skip Savasana, often your yoga practice feels incomplete.”
Takeaway
Yoga has come a long way since my living room in the early ’90s. There’s now
drunk yoga
, acroyoga, and even goat or puppy yoga. And as Francis Bacon said, knowledge is power. Learning more about the yoga cues you hear will only deepen your practice and improve your form.
The instructors I talked to all emphasized how important it is to listen to and trust your body before you follow any hard and fast rules.

I’ve had a few teachers who have offered alternative poses during the

Om... Say What? Yoga Basics for Beginners

Basic poses
Other yoga practices
tl;dr
I avoided yoga through high school, probably because I was a teenager and it was something my mom was trying to get me to do. But I picked it up in college when I was no longer playing sports and needed an outlet for my energy.
I quickly fell in love with the practice — it made me feel
stronger
and calmer, and I started
sleeping better
. Now I try to get to yoga at least twice a week and do an
online video
on the days when I can’t make it out (read: when it’s under 30 degrees).
But yoga can be intimidating to those new to it, and I wanted to shed some light on what it’s all about, including some beginner poses to try.

Basic yoga poses for beginners
When it comes to yoga, there’s absolutely no need to start with challenging
inversions
or complicated poses. In fact, you never have to do them if you don’t want to. There are benefits to
easier yoga poses
, especially for stretching and
relaxation
.
Here are a few basic yoga poses to get you started.
1. Down Dog on a chair (Uttana Shishosana)
How to do this pose:
Using the back of a chair, stand with your feet shoulder-width apart. Step back, keeping your spine parallel to the floor until you’re in a 90-degree angle. Gently lengthen your back toward your hips.
2. Child’s Pose (Balasana)
How to do this pose:
Kneel with your knees shoulder-width apart. Your toes can curl in as shown or lie flat on the mat. Reach your arms forward, your hips back, and your head to the floor to feel the stretch.
If it feels like too much, you can modify it by placing a rolled-up towel behind your knees to rest on.
3. Happy Baby (Ananda Balasana)
How to do this pose:
Lie on your back and bring your knees up closer to your body. Grab the edges of your feet (or your ankles or shins if that’s too challenging), and separate your knees as far as is comfortable. Gently rock from side to side. Try to keep the length of your spine on the floor, especially the tailbone area.
4. Bound Angle Pose (Baddha Konasana)
Photography by Julia Hembree
How to do this pose:
Sit on the floor and bend your knees to bring the soles of your feet together. Bring your heels as close to your pelvis as is comfortable, or until you feel the stretch.
Bring your torso down toward your feet to lengthen your back muscles. Try to keep your spine straight and not rolled forward. The pose pictured is modified with
yoga blocks
.
5. Cat-Cow (Marjaryasana-Bitilasana)
How to do this pose:
Start on your hands and knees (or lean on your forearms if this pose feels uncomfortable). Arch your back gently up while tucking your head down into Cat Pose.
Lift your tailbone and lengthen your chest forward while dropping your belly down into Cow Pose. Hold for a few seconds, and then return to the starting position.
Other yoga practices: What do these mean?!
Breathing into your little toe (or any other body part)
I asked
Lauren Larry
, founder of Sunny Sankalpa Yoga, what it means when a teacher says to breathe into your toe or your hip or any body part that’s not a lung.
“This is actually a descriptor that I found confusing as a yoga student,” Larry says. “When you ‘breathe’ into a part of your body, picture the body part and relax the muscles around it.”
“As you bring awareness to that area of the body, contract and release the muscle you’re focusing on. Bring awareness to the body part mentioned in your inhale, and release tension on the muscles on your exhale. When you release tension in that muscle, you’re ‘breathing’ into the muscle.”
Ann Swanson
, a certified yoga therapist and the author of
Science of Yoga
, adds, “This is just a visualization to help bring your awareness to the area, increasing interoception, or internal body awareness. You cannot actually ‘breathe into’ a body part except your lungs. For that reason, I prefer to add ‘imagine’ before a cue like that.”
Breathing
into a part of your body other than your lungs is impossible, but by bringing awareness to a certain part of your body, you can send energy to it.
Andrea Trank
, founder of
Heaven Lane Healing & Creative Arts
, which provides customized yoga lessons and lifestyle coaching, says, “Energetically, when you breathe into an area, you are sending energy, attention, and possibly healing to this area. When you are moving as you do in yoga, with breath awareness, you are helping to circulate freshly oxygenated blood to all parts of your body involved in the practice.”
Setting an intention
I often feel panicky (definitely not the feeling yoga is intended to evoke) when teachers instruct the class to “set an
intention
.” From this anxiety comes a certain level of snark, and my intention can end up being something as thoughtless as “just let me make it through this class.”
I realized this anxious feeling arises because I’m not clear on what it means to set an intention and I worry I’m the only one doing it “wrong.” I remember feeling this way in math class when we were learning proofs — I had such trouble grasping the concept that I didn’t even know what questions to ask to get a clearer understanding.
Ever been there? Yeah, it sucks. So, what exactly does it mean to set an intention?
“I often start a yoga class by asking my students if they want to set an ‘intention’ for their practice.” Trank says. “It could be for yourself, a friend in need, or something that is needed by the world. It allows your practice to be more than just a physical asana practice. It becomes a spiritual practice as well.”
Ali Owens
, a certified yoga instructor and contributor to the
yogawakeup
app, tells her students that setting an intention can be a powerful way to bring meaning to your practice, whether by connecting with your breath or adding more love and joy to your life.
Setting an intention can be as simple as focusing on one word during your practice. Some people may focus on “ease” or “peace” or “love.”
The Sanskrit name for intention is “Sankalpa.”
“This is the deepest desire of your heart. It’s more than a goal of nailing a headstand,” Larry says. “It’s the embodiment of what you would like to manifest in life. It’s a word, a phrase, or even an emotion you would like to embody.”
She continues, “Find something you want in the big picture of your life, like grace under fire or forgiveness. When you pick your intention, come back to it during class. You’ll notice your classes have a new meaning.”
One word seems manageable to me!
Chanting 101
I used to lip-sync in classes that began with chanting, just like I used to mouth the words to “Happy Birthday” every time it was a co-worker’s birthday. (I say “used to” here because I work from home now and my dog doesn’t care that I can’t carry a tune.)
I’ve gotten over this self-consciousness in yoga class, but I still sometimes feel silly letting the “om”s fly. So, why is chanting beneficial?
It turns out that chanting “om” can actually switch your brain into relaxation mode.
One 2016 study
suggests that chanting “om” for 10 minutes can have a positive effect on mood and social cognition. And a
2019 study
suggests that religious chanting could have psychotherapeutic effects.
It may just be worth adding a chant to your yoga routine.
Inverted poses… and your period
I’ve had a few teachers who have offered alternative poses during the
inversion
part of class for anyone who is on their cycle. I always find this to be a bit of an awkward announcement that I have my period, much like the time I accidentally dropped three tampons in the middle of a crowded Starbucks and then walked out.
Is it true that for 1 week each month, I should pass on the headstand?
“There is no known medical reason to not do inversions while on your period. Currently, there is not convincing evidence that it would cause endometriosis or any health issues,” Swanson says.
She continues, “It may just simply be uncomfortable, especially if you are not used to inversions. According to yoga philosophy, going upside down may affect the natural downward flow that should happen during menstruation (apana vayu), but even with that, we can’t be sure if the subtle energy works that way, because we have no way to measure it.”
Owens adds, “When we invert, we send energy and blood upwards towards your heart and head, which can be great for circulation but counterproductive during your cycle. I have also found in my own personal practice that I feel a lack of willingness and sometimes ability to engage the muscles necessary to support my inversion practice.”
There’s really no evidence that any harm will come from inverting during your period — the larger concern is that it just may not feel great.
As Trank says, “I think the key is not to follow fast rules but to pay close attention to your body and be mindful of how each of the poses feel.” Do what feels right for you and your body each day.
Savasan-uhhhh… I wanna leave this class
I often find myself close to dosing off during Savasana (the final resting pose), especially if it’s an evening class. Or, worse (and this happens during midday classes), I’m anxious for Savasana to end so I can get on with my day. When I’m practicing at home, I never include this step.
I reasoned that if I learned what Savasana was doing for my mental and physical health, I may be able to think of it as more than a precursor to a nap or something impeding me from getting to the nonessential errands and manicure I have planned post-class.
But Larry explains that the “work” of yoga begins with Savasana.
“After the pranayama (breathing) and asana (postures), our bodies need to settle into themselves. Savasana isn’t a nap time, it’s a connection of mind, body, and spirit. Your body receives much-needed rest, and the yoga teacher guides your mind into stillness so you can connect fully.”
She continues, “You’ll notice your mind wants to be busy, but if you focus on your breathing, your mind will settle into stillness. It takes a lot of practice and dedication to get to that point.”
Savasana can be even more important than the active practice.
“Commonly known as Corpse Pose, it is a chance to mentally, physically, and spiritually consolidate all you have learned in your yoga practice that day,” Trank says. “It is a difficult pose because you are resting yet alert. If you skip Savasana, often your yoga practice feels incomplete.”
Takeaway
Yoga has come a long way since my living room in the early ’90s. There’s now
drunk yoga
, acroyoga, and even goat or puppy yoga. And as Francis Bacon said, knowledge is power. Learning more about the yoga cues you hear will only deepen your practice and improve your form.
The instructors I talked to all emphasized how important it is to listen to and trust your body before you follow any hard and fast rules.

Yoga defined
14 types

The benefits of yoga are backed by science: It can
improve sleep
,
reduce stress
, promote
healthy eating
habits,
improve balance
, and more.
But much like choosing a pair of yoga pants, the options can feel downright intimidating.
If you’ve ever stared blankly at a yoga class schedule, wondering what the eff the difference between Vinyasa and Kundalini is (Spoiler: a whole lot), then you’re in the right place.

What exactly is yoga, anyway?
The physical practice of yoga takes
many
forms — but what factors make them all yoga?
“Whether it’s a power flow class, a prenatal yoga class, or a Yin class, all of them go for creating a connection between your mind, your body, and your breath,” says
Sarah Burns
, a Memphis-based E-RYT 200 yoga instructor. “There’s also a big emphasis on being present on your mat and making space for anything you’re feeling in your physical and emotional space.”
To view yoga as a whole, consider that “it’s ultimately about breath work related to physical postures (or asanas),” says
Kate DeSisto
, a CYT-250 yoga instructor with additional certifications in aerial and SUP yoga. “Everything is based on breathing. You’re going to move with a breath.”
The structure of all yoga types is similar as well. “Most classes you walk into will usually have a warmup, often based around sun salutations, then you’ll work toward some sort of focus posture or focus flow, and then you’ll have a cooldown,” explains DeSisto.

Finding your ideal yoga type is a little like dating: It’s not one-size-fits-all, and everyone has unique needs. But rest assured, you’ll find your yoga soulmate — or maybe even a few!
Here are some common (and a few new and trendy) types of yoga you can expect to see in studios and gyms or online.
Hatha yoga
According to traditional yoga philosophy, there are six branches of yoga. “Hatha” means yoga of sensation or of movement. So
technically
, any yoga where you’re moving your body is Hatha. (The other branches are nonphysical.) “But in Western civilization, if someone says Hatha, they mean slow flow or gentle flow yoga,” says Burns.
In a Hatha class, you start with a gentle intro to a variety of basic yoga postures and then move through a sequence of poses, holding each for a few breaths. Hatha is similar to Vinyasa (more on that in a second) — just slower.
“So, if you really want time to experience a posture, Hatha is the way to go,” says DeSisto. “If you’re more interested in moving your body and working things out, Vinyasa is your jam.”
Who should try it:
If you’re relatively new to yoga, this is a great entry point. You’ll experience many of the same postures as in a Vinyasa class, just slower. It’s also a nice option if you haven’t been active in a while.
Vinyasa yoga
Think of Vinyasa (or Vinyasa flow) as one-breath-per-movement yoga. Classes are organized to smoothly transition from one pose to another in coordination with your breath. Instructors switch up their sequences each class to keep it fresh, and they often play music.
If you’re looking for a real workout, rest assured that Vinyasa is physically demanding. “Vinyasa yoga is faster and more rigorous than Hatha yoga,” says Burns. “You’ll experience more dynamic motion and bodyweight resistance with positions like planks and side planks.”
It’s also
very
common at studios and gyms — so if you’ve taken a yoga class but don’t remember what type, it was probably Vinyasa.
W
ho should try it:
If you’re not a fan of routine or sitting still and you want to feel like you’re getting a
real
workout, Vinyasa yoga is for you.
Power yoga
Depending on the instructor, sometimes power yoga and Vinyasa are the exact same thing, says Burns — it’s all about that dynamic, fluid motion. “Power” as a marketing term just happens to appeal more to the gym crowd.
Additional strength-building moves like crunches are sometimes incorporated, says DeSisto. You’ll probably get some fun music to keep you motivated in this class too.
Who should try it:
If you’re a frequent gym-goer who’s making a foray into yoga (and you’re less into the spiritual stuff), a power class will get you sweaty.
Ashtanga yoga
Some consider Ashtanga the OG of yoga, since it’s one of the longest-practiced forms and is based on ancient teachings. Ashtanga is a physically demanding practice that synchronizes movement with breath.
“There is some flow between poses, and then you do hold certain poses for five breaths — it’s a blend between flow and isometric holds,” says Burns.
A lot of what you see in a Vinyasa classes actually stems from Ashtanga. “This is what was brought to the West first, then people took it in different directions,” says Burns.
What differentiates Ashtanga from other types of yoga is the set series of postures
every single time
. A class will start with sun salutations and then move into a set sequence of standing poses and floor poses. “A benefit of returning to the exact same sequence of poses is that you get to feel your body change and make progress over time,” says Burns.
You’ll often see two types of Ashtanga classes offered: led style and Mysore style. In a led class, a teacher guides you through the sequence. In a Mysore class, you already know the sequence and do it on your own, with support from a teacher if needed. Pro tip: Start with a led class.
Who should try it:
So, spontaneity stresses you out? Ashtanga is great for those who want a dynamic, athletic practice… and nothing
too
unexpected.
Iyengar yoga
This yoga style was developed by the prominent yogi BKS Iyengar. It emphasizes proper alignment and body positioning in each pose, not the flowing motion of sequences or quick movements.
Most Iyengar classes are “all about the props,” says DeSisto. The use of blocks, straps, bolsters, or even rope walls to get deeper into certain postures safely is the norm. Postures are held for a while as you make minor adjustments to achieve optimal alignment. It’s a slower, more methodical yoga practice.
Who should try it:
Iyengar is great for those who are more prone to injury, since it’s more difficult to overstrain yourself. It’s also great if you’re a perfectionist, are really into proper body mechanics, or want to improve your posture.
Hot and Bikram yoga
Many people think hot yoga and Bikram are one and the same — they’re not. “With a hot yoga class, you’re looking at a Vinyasa class or a power class with heat,” says DeSisto. Think: flowing through poses in coordination with your breath.
The room is typically heated to anywhere from 95 to 105 degrees, depending on the studio. Expect to move and sweat A LOT. You’ll leave feeling longer, looser, and relaxed.
“The heat does help you get deeper into a pose,” says Burns. “And if you want a really intense physical challenge, working out in a hot room will do it.”
Bikram is a branded type of yoga that was created by Bikram Choudhury. With this type of yoga, the room is heated to 105 degrees and you move through the same specific sequence of 26 poses and two breathing exercises every class.
It’s not as “flowy” as a Vinyasa-esque hot yoga class, but it’s a mega-workout nonetheless. (It’s become a smidge less popular over the years as a result of controversy surrounding its founder.)
Who should try it:
Anyone who wants an intense physical challenge. For a more regimented experience, opt for Bikram. If you want more of a flow, general hot yoga is for you.
Skip this type of class if you have high blood pressure or are prone to fainting.
Yin yoga
Yin is a slow, gentle, more restorative style of yoga that can help balance out rigorous workouts.
Yin yoga doesn’t focus on large muscle groups. Instead, it targets deep connective tissues like ligaments, fascia, and joints through nonmuscular postures you hold for up to 5 minutes (like forward folds, hip openers, and seated twists). “This type of yoga is really, really good for your flexibility,” says Burns.
You’re not likely to sweat in a Yin yoga class. It’s practiced on the floor, and over the course of an hour, you might do as few as five poses. Yin can be meditative, allowing ample time to focus and sit with any physical sensations or emotions that pop up.
Who should try it:
Anyone who wants to slow down and chill out, particularly if you want to balance out a more rigorous exercise routine or increase flexibility or if you have a condition that limits mobility.
Restorative yoga
Yin yoga and restorative yoga sometimes get confused, but you can consider restorative the more passive of the two — meaning you don’t do a whole lot.
This style of yoga uses blankets, bolsters, and blocks to prop you into long, comfortable poses, allowing for a deeper state of mind-body relaxation.
“I like to think of it as professional napping,” says DeSisto. “The idea isn’t to fall asleep, but you shouldn’t really feel anything happening other than relaxation.”
Who should try it:
Burned out? Everything aches? Anyone who needs to de-stress and turn off the world for a while, for whatever reason, can benefit from restorative yoga.
Prenatal yoga
Prenatal yoga addresses particular issues that may arise during pregnancy.
“In a prenatal class we’ll do a lot for relieving pressure in your back, in your hips where you’ll generally feel some discomfort,” says Burns. “You’ll see a lot of poses you’d see in a regular class, but designed specifically to help modify the body. Things like Pigeon Pose, which is modified with pillows to keep weight off the stomach.”
Prenatal yoga will typically include fewer inversions, more props, some gentler flowing, and work that helps with balance.
Who should try it:
Pregnant women — but always check with your doc if you have concerns about whether you should do a certain type of exercise.
Chair-based yoga
While it’s not super common at studios or gyms, chair-based yoga is becoming increasingly popular at community centers (you can find plenty of online
chair yoga videos
too).
You use a chair as a tool to perform postures that might not otherwise be possible if you have an injury or limited mobility. You might hold the back of a chair during standing lunges or do Warrior I
over
a chair if you have weak ankles.
“Think Hatha yoga with the support of a chair,” says DeSisto. “It makes things really accessible if you’re worried about injury.”
Who should try it:
While it’s a good option for older, less active folks, chair yoga is also great for anyone looking to stay active while recovering from an injury.
Aerial yoga
Swap the yoga mat for a silk hammock suspended from the ceiling. Aerial yoga classes look a lot like a standard yoga class — but suspended from a hammock.
“You may do a lunge or some take on sun salutations while partially suspended in the hammock,” says DeSisto, who’s a certified aerial yoga teacher. Other classes might look a bit more circus-y.
This type of yoga helps extend your spine and relieves pressure on your joints. “Aerial yogis like to joke that you’ll never go to a chiropractor again,” says DeSisto. “You’re kind of letting gravity do things for you.”
Aerial yoga helps balance out a mat-based yoga practice. “In mat practice, you’re using pushing muscles all the time in poses like Downward Dog, but in aerial you get to use your pulling muscles,” DeSisto says.
Who should try it:
Anyone who wants to lengthen and elongate their body (Hint: all you desk jockeys) or balance a mat practice — or anyone who has ever dreamt of being in Cirque du Soleil.
Stand up paddle board (SUP) yoga
New to the yoga scene, SUP yoga is gaining popularity among the outdoorsy crowd. If you’re having a hard time picturing this, basically “take a Hatha or a Vinyasa class, put it on a paddleboard in the middle of the water, and that’s SUP yoga,” says DeSisto, who’s also a certified SUP yoga instructor.
“It’s really fantastic for developing balance, more than any other type of yoga, plus it gets you outside.” (Some gyms offer it in their indoor pools as well.)
Don’t worry about floating away. Boards are anchored so you stay (relatively) put. Teachers can offer a variety of modifications to suit your level of balance.
Who should try it:
Nature lovers or anyone who wants to take their yoga practice outside and seriously work their balance.
Kundalini yoga
Kundalini is for those who want to experience the spiritual side of yoga. It’s about awakening and releasing
cosmic energy that’s trapped in the base of the spine
through a combination of quick repetitive movements, breath work, chanting (aka mantras), and meditation.
It doesn’t look like your typical yoga class, either. Kundalini classes are composed of an opening chant, a spine warmup, a
kriya
(a specific series of poses paired with breath work and chanting), and a closing meditation or song.
It can bring up a lot of emotions. “I’ve seen lots of people cry,” says DeSisto. “It stirs everything up in your body to the point that sh*t just comes out.”
Who should try it:
Anyone who wants a blended physical and spiritual practice or wants to dive deeper into breath work.
tl;dr
Yoga is about connecting your mind, breath, and body — all while tuning in to what you’re feeling, both physically and emotionally.
It can be deeply relaxing (restorative) or deeply invigorating (power or Vinyasa flow). It can be regimented (Iyengar) or free-flowing (Vinyasa). It can be done in a silk hammock (aerial) or even with the support of a chair. Yoga can be anything you need, once you know your options.
Keep in mind: Depending on the individual instructor or studio, there will be subtle variations even within each type of yoga, so don’t knock one type until you’ve tried it at least twice.

The physical practice of yoga takes
many
forms — but what factors make them all yoga?
“Whether it’s a power flow class, a prenatal yoga class, or a Yin class, all of them go for creating a connection between your mind, your body, and your breath,” says
Sarah Burns
, a Memphis-based E-RYT 200 yoga instructor. “There’s also a big emphasis on being present on your mat and making space for anything you’re feeling in your physical and emotional space.”
To view yoga as a whole, consider that “it’s ultimately about breath work related to physical postures (or asanas),” says
Kate DeSisto
, a CYT-250 yoga instructor with additional certifications in aerial and SUP yoga. “Everything is based on breathing. You’re going to move with a breath.”
The structure of all yoga types is similar as well. “Most classes you walk into will usually have a warmup, often based around sun salutations, then you’ll work toward some sort of focus posture or focus flow, and then you’ll have a cooldown,” explains DeSisto.

Finding your ideal yoga type is a little like dating: It’s not one-size-fits-all, and everyone has unique needs. But rest assured, you’ll find your yoga soulmate — or maybe even a few!
Here are some common (and a few new and trendy) types of yoga you can expect to see in studios and gyms or online.
Hatha yoga
According to traditional yoga philosophy, there are six branches of yoga. “Hatha” means yoga of sensation or of movement. So
technically
, any yoga where you’re moving your body is Hatha. (The other branches are nonphysical.) “But in Western civilization, if someone says Hatha, they mean slow flow or gentle flow yoga,” says Burns.
In a Hatha class, you start with a gentle intro to a variety of basic yoga postures and then move through a sequence of poses, holding each for a few breaths. Hatha is similar to Vinyasa (more on that in a second) — just slower.
“So, if you really want time to experience a posture, Hatha is the way to go,” says DeSisto. “If you’re more interested in moving your body and working things out, Vinyasa is your jam.”
Who should try it:
If you’re relatively new to yoga, this is a great entry point. You’ll experience many of the same postures as in a Vinyasa class, just slower. It’s also a nice option if you haven’t been active in a while.
Vinyasa yoga
Think of Vinyasa (or Vinyasa flow) as one-breath-per-movement yoga. Classes are organized to smoothly transition from one pose to another in coordination with your breath. Instructors switch up their sequences each class to keep it fresh, and they often play music.
If you’re looking for a real workout, rest assured that Vinyasa is physically demanding. “Vinyasa yoga is faster and more rigorous than Hatha yoga,” says Burns. “You’ll experience more dynamic motion and bodyweight resistance with positions like planks and side planks.”
It’s also
very
common at studios and gyms — so if you’ve taken a yoga class but don’t remember what type, it was probably Vinyasa.
W
ho should try it:
If you’re not a fan of routine or sitting still and you want to feel like you’re getting a
real
workout, Vinyasa yoga is for you.
Power yoga
Depending on the instructor, sometimes power yoga and Vinyasa are the exact same thing, says Burns — it’s all about that dynamic, fluid motion. “Power” as a marketing term just happens to appeal more to the gym crowd.
Additional strength-building moves like crunches are sometimes incorporated, says DeSisto. You’ll probably get some fun music to keep you motivated in this class too.
Who should try it:
If you’re a frequent gym-goer who’s making a foray into yoga (and you’re less into the spiritual stuff), a power class will get you sweaty.
Ashtanga yoga
Some consider Ashtanga the OG of yoga, since it’s one of the longest-practiced forms and is based on ancient teachings. Ashtanga is a physically demanding practice that synchronizes movement with breath.
“There is some flow between poses, and then you do hold certain poses for five breaths — it’s a blend between flow and isometric holds,” says Burns.
A lot of what you see in a Vinyasa classes actually stems from Ashtanga. “This is what was brought to the West first, then people took it in different directions,” says Burns.
What differentiates Ashtanga from other types of yoga is the set series of postures
every single time
. A class will start with sun salutations and then move into a set sequence of standing poses and floor poses. “A benefit of returning to the exact same sequence of poses is that you get to feel your body change and make progress over time,” says Burns.
You’ll often see two types of Ashtanga classes offered: led style and Mysore style. In a led class, a teacher guides you through the sequence. In a Mysore class, you already know the sequence and do it on your own, with support from a teacher if needed. Pro tip: Start with a led class.
Who should try it:
So, spontaneity stresses you out? Ashtanga is great for those who want a dynamic, athletic practice… and nothing
too
unexpected.
Iyengar yoga
This yoga style was developed by the prominent yogi BKS Iyengar. It emphasizes proper alignment and body positioning in each pose, not the flowing motion of sequences or quick movements.
Most Iyengar classes are “all about the props,” says DeSisto. The use of blocks, straps, bolsters, or even rope walls to get deeper into certain postures safely is the norm. Postures are held for a while as you make minor adjustments to achieve optimal alignment. It’s a slower, more methodical yoga practice.
Who should try it:
Iyengar is great for those who are more prone to injury, since it’s more difficult to overstrain yourself. It’s also great if you’re a perfectionist, are really into proper body mechanics, or want to improve your posture.
Hot and Bikram yoga
Many people think hot yoga and Bikram are one and the same — they’re not. “With a hot yoga class, you’re looking at a Vinyasa class or a power class with heat,” says DeSisto. Think: flowing through poses in coordination with your breath.
The room is typically heated to anywhere from 95 to 105 degrees, depending on the studio. Expect to move and sweat A LOT. You’ll leave feeling longer, looser, and relaxed.
“The heat does help you get deeper into a pose,” says Burns. “And if you want a really intense physical challenge, working out in a hot room will do it.”
Bikram is a branded type of yoga that was created by Bikram Choudhury. With this type of yoga, the room is heated to 105 degrees and you move through the same specific sequence of 26 poses and two breathing exercises every class.
It’s not as “flowy” as a Vinyasa-esque hot yoga class, but it’s a mega-workout nonetheless. (It’s become a smidge less popular over the years as a result of controversy surrounding its founder.)
Who should try it:
Anyone who wants an intense physical challenge. For a more regimented experience, opt for Bikram. If you want more of a flow, general hot yoga is for you.
Skip this type of class if you have high blood pressure or are prone to fainting.
Yin yoga
Yin is a slow, gentle, more restorative style of yoga that can help balance out rigorous workouts.
Yin yoga doesn’t focus on large muscle groups. Instead, it targets deep connective tissues like ligaments, fascia, and joints through nonmuscular postures you hold for up to 5 minutes (like forward folds, hip openers, and seated twists). “This type of yoga is really, really good for your flexibility,” says Burns.
You’re not likely to sweat in a Yin yoga class. It’s practiced on the floor, and over the course of an hour, you might do as few as five poses. Yin can be meditative, allowing ample time to focus and sit with any physical sensations or emotions that pop up.
Who should try it:
Anyone who wants to slow down and chill out, particularly if you want to balance out a more rigorous exercise routine or increase flexibility or if you have a condition that limits mobility.
Restorative yoga
Yin yoga and restorative yoga sometimes get confused, but you can consider restorative the more passive of the two — meaning you don’t do a whole lot.
This style of yoga uses blankets, bolsters, and blocks to prop you into long, comfortable poses, allowing for a deeper state of mind-body relaxation.
“I like to think of it as professional napping,” says DeSisto. “The idea isn’t to fall asleep, but you shouldn’t really feel anything happening other than relaxation.”
Who should try it:
Burned out? Everything aches? Anyone who needs to de-stress and turn off the world for a while, for whatever reason, can benefit from restorative yoga.
Prenatal yoga
Prenatal yoga addresses particular issues that may arise during pregnancy.
“In a prenatal class we’ll do a lot for relieving pressure in your back, in your hips where you’ll generally feel some discomfort,” says Burns. “You’ll see a lot of poses you’d see in a regular class, but designed specifically to help modify the body. Things like Pigeon Pose, which is modified with pillows to keep weight off the stomach.”
Prenatal yoga will typically include fewer inversions, more props, some gentler flowing, and work that helps with balance.
Who should try it:
Pregnant women — but always check with your doc if you have concerns about whether you should do a certain type of exercise.
Chair-based yoga
While it’s not super common at studios or gyms, chair-based yoga is becoming increasingly popular at community centers (you can find plenty of online
chair yoga videos
too).
You use a chair as a tool to perform postures that might not otherwise be possible if you have an injury or limited mobility. You might hold the back of a chair during standing lunges or do Warrior I
over
a chair if you have weak ankles.
“Think Hatha yoga with the support of a chair,” says DeSisto. “It makes things really accessible if you’re worried about injury.”
Who should try it:
While it’s a good option for older, less active folks, chair yoga is also great for anyone looking to stay active while recovering from an injury.
Aerial yoga
Swap the yoga mat for a silk hammock suspended from the ceiling. Aerial yoga classes look a lot like a standard yoga class — but suspended from a hammock.
“You may do a lunge or some take on sun salutations while partially suspended in the hammock,” says DeSisto, who’s a certified aerial yoga teacher. Other classes might look a bit more circus-y.
This type of yoga helps extend your spine and relieves pressure on your joints. “Aerial yogis like to joke that you’ll never go to a chiropractor again,” says DeSisto. “You’re kind of letting gravity do things for you.”
Aerial yoga helps balance out a mat-based yoga practice. “In mat practice, you’re using pushing muscles all the time in poses like Downward Dog, but in aerial you get to use your pulling muscles,” DeSisto says.
Who should try it:
Anyone who wants to lengthen and elongate their body (Hint: all you desk jockeys) or balance a mat practice — or anyone who has ever dreamt of being in Cirque du Soleil.
Stand up paddle board (SUP) yoga
New to the yoga scene, SUP yoga is gaining popularity among the outdoorsy crowd. If you’re having a hard time picturing this, basically “take a Hatha or a Vinyasa class, put it on a paddleboard in the middle of the water, and that’s SUP yoga,” says DeSisto, who’s also a certified SUP yoga instructor.
“It’s really fantastic for developing balance, more than any other type of yoga, plus it gets you outside.” (Some gyms offer it in their indoor pools as well.)
Don’t worry about floating away. Boards are anchored so you stay (relatively) put. Teachers can offer a variety of modifications to suit your level of balance.
Who should try it:
Nature lovers or anyone who wants to take their yoga practice outside and seriously work their balance.
Kundalini yoga
Kundalini is for those who want to experience the spiritual side of yoga. It’s about awakening and releasing
cosmic energy that’s trapped in the base of the spine
through a combination of quick repetitive movements, breath work, chanting (aka mantras), and meditation.
It doesn’t look like your typical yoga class, either. Kundalini classes are composed of an opening chant, a spine warmup, a

Who should try it:
Anyone who wants a blended physical and spiritual practice or wants to dive deeper into breath work.
tl;dr
Yoga is about connecting your mind, breath, and body — all while tuning in to what you’re feeling, both physically and emotionally.

, any yoga where you’re moving your body is Hatha. (The other branches are nonphysical.) “But in Western civilization, if someone says Hatha, they mean slow flow or gentle flow yoga,” says Burns.
In a Hatha class, you start with a gentle intro to a variety of basic yoga postures and then move through a sequence of poses, holding each for a few breaths. Hatha is similar to Vinyasa (more on that in a second) — just slower.
“So, if you really want time to experience a posture, Hatha is the way to go,” says DeSisto. “If you’re more interested in moving your body and working things out, Vinyasa is your jam.”
Who should try it:
If you’re relatively new to yoga, this is a great entry point. You’ll experience many of the same postures as in a Vinyasa class, just slower. It’s also a nice option if you haven’t been active in a while.
Vinyasa yoga
Think of Vinyasa (or Vinyasa flow) as one-breath-per-movement yoga. Classes are organized to smoothly transition from one pose to another in coordination with your breath. Instructors switch up their sequences each class to keep it fresh, and they often play music.
If you’re looking for a real workout, rest assured that Vinyasa is physically demanding. “Vinyasa yoga is faster and more rigorous than Hatha yoga,” says Burns. “You’ll experience more dynamic motion and bodyweight resistance with positions like planks and side planks.”
It’s also
very
common at studios and gyms — so if you’ve taken a yoga class but don’t remember what type, it was probably Vinyasa.
W
ho should try it:
If you’re not a fan of routine or sitting still and you want to feel like you’re getting a
real
workout, Vinyasa yoga is for you.
Power yoga
Depending on the instructor, sometimes power yoga and Vinyasa are the exact same thing, says Burns — it’s all about that dynamic, fluid motion. “Power” as a marketing term just happens to appeal more to the gym crowd.
Additional strength-building moves like crunches are sometimes incorporated, says DeSisto. You’ll probably get some fun music to keep you motivated in this class too.
Who should try it:
If you’re a frequent gym-goer who’s making a foray into yoga (and you’re less into the spiritual stuff), a power class will get you sweaty.
Ashtanga yoga
Some consider Ashtanga the OG of yoga, since it’s one of the longest-practiced forms and is based on ancient teachings. Ashtanga is a physically demanding practice that synchronizes movement with breath.
“There is some flow between poses, and then you do hold certain poses for five breaths — it’s a blend between flow and isometric holds,” says Burns.
A lot of what you see in a Vinyasa classes actually stems from Ashtanga. “This is what was brought to the West first, then people took it in different directions,” says Burns.
What differentiates Ashtanga from other types of yoga is the set series of postures
every single time
. A class will start with sun salutations and then move into a set sequence of standing poses and floor poses. “A benefit of returning to the exact same sequence of poses is that you get to feel your body change and make progress over time,” says Burns.
You’ll often see two types of Ashtanga classes offered: led style and Mysore style. In a led class, a teacher guides you through the sequence. In a Mysore class, you already know the sequence and do it on your own, with support from a teacher if needed. Pro tip: Start with a led class.
Who should try it:
So, spontaneity stresses you out? Ashtanga is great for those who want a dynamic, athletic practice… and nothing
too
unexpected.
Iyengar yoga
This yoga style was developed by the prominent yogi BKS Iyengar. It emphasizes proper alignment and body positioning in each pose, not the flowing motion of sequences or quick movements.
Most Iyengar classes are “all about the props,” says DeSisto. The use of blocks, straps, bolsters, or even rope walls to get deeper into certain postures safely is the norm. Postures are held for a while as you make minor adjustments to achieve optimal alignment. It’s a slower, more methodical yoga practice.
Who should try it:
Iyengar is great for those who are more prone to injury, since it’s more difficult to overstrain yourself. It’s also great if you’re a perfectionist, are really into proper body mechanics, or want to improve your posture.
Hot and Bikram yoga
Many people think hot yoga and Bikram are one and the same — they’re not. “With a hot yoga class, you’re looking at a Vinyasa class or a power class with heat,” says DeSisto. Think: flowing through poses in coordination with your breath.
The room is typically heated to anywhere from 95 to 105 degrees, depending on the studio. Expect to move and sweat A LOT. You’ll leave feeling longer, looser, and relaxed.
“The heat does help you get deeper into a pose,” says Burns. “And if you want a really intense physical challenge, working out in a hot room will do it.”
Bikram is a branded type of yoga that was created by Bikram Choudhury. With this type of yoga, the room is heated to 105 degrees and you move through the same specific sequence of 26 poses and two breathing exercises every class.
It’s not as “flowy” as a Vinyasa-esque hot yoga class, but it’s a mega-workout nonetheless. (It’s become a smidge less popular over the years as a result of controversy surrounding its founder.)
Who should try it:
Anyone who wants an intense physical challenge. For a more regimented experience, opt for Bikram. If you want more of a flow, general hot yoga is for you.
Skip this type of class if you have high blood pressure or are prone to fainting.
Yin yoga
Yin is a slow, gentle, more restorative style of yoga that can help balance out rigorous workouts.
Yin yoga doesn’t focus on large muscle groups. Instead, it targets deep connective tissues like ligaments, fascia, and joints through nonmuscular postures you hold for up to 5 minutes (like forward folds, hip openers, and seated twists). “This type of yoga is really, really good for your flexibility,” says Burns.
You’re not likely to sweat in a Yin yoga class. It’s practiced on the floor, and over the course of an hour, you might do as few as five poses. Yin can be meditative, allowing ample time to focus and sit with any physical sensations or emotions that pop up.
Who should try it:
Anyone who wants to slow down and chill out, particularly if you want to balance out a more rigorous exercise routine or increase flexibility or if you have a condition that limits mobility.
Restorative yoga
Yin yoga and restorative yoga sometimes get confused, but you can consider restorative the more passive of the two — meaning you don’t do a whole lot.
This style of yoga uses blankets, bolsters, and blocks to prop you into long, comfortable poses, allowing for a deeper state of mind-body relaxation.
“I like to think of it as professional napping,” says DeSisto. “The idea isn’t to fall asleep, but you shouldn’t really feel anything happening other than relaxation.”
Who should try it:
Burned out? Everything aches? Anyone who needs to de-stress and turn off the world for a while, for whatever reason, can benefit from restorative yoga.
Prenatal yoga
Prenatal yoga addresses particular issues that may arise during pregnancy.
“In a prenatal class we’ll do a lot for relieving pressure in your back, in your hips where you’ll generally feel some discomfort,” says Burns. “You’ll see a lot of poses you’d see in a regular class, but designed specifically to help modify the body. Things like Pigeon Pose, which is modified with pillows to keep weight off the stomach.”
Prenatal yoga will typically include fewer inversions, more props, some gentler flowing, and work that helps with balance.
Who should try it:
Pregnant women — but always check with your doc if you have concerns about whether you should do a certain type of exercise.
Chair-based yoga
While it’s not super common at studios or gyms, chair-based yoga is becoming increasingly popular at community centers (you can find plenty of online
chair yoga videos
too).
You use a chair as a tool to perform postures that might not otherwise be possible if you have an injury or limited mobility. You might hold the back of a chair during standing lunges or do Warrior I
over
a chair if you have weak ankles.
“Think Hatha yoga with the support of a chair,” says DeSisto. “It makes things really accessible if you’re worried about injury.”
Who should try it:
While it’s a good option for older, less active folks, chair yoga is also great for anyone looking to stay active while recovering from an injury.
Aerial yoga
Swap the yoga mat for a silk hammock suspended from the ceiling. Aerial yoga classes look a lot like a standard yoga class — but suspended from a hammock.
“You may do a lunge or some take on sun salutations while partially suspended in the hammock,” says DeSisto, who’s a certified aerial yoga teacher. Other classes might look a bit more circus-y.
This type of yoga helps extend your spine and relieves pressure on your joints. “Aerial yogis like to joke that you’ll never go to a chiropractor again,” says DeSisto. “You’re kind of letting gravity do things for you.”
Aerial yoga helps balance out a mat-based yoga practice. “In mat practice, you’re using pushing muscles all the time in poses like Downward Dog, but in aerial you get to use your pulling muscles,” DeSisto says.
Who should try it:
Anyone who wants to lengthen and elongate their body (Hint: all you desk jockeys) or balance a mat practice — or anyone who has ever dreamt of being in Cirque du Soleil.
Stand up paddle board (SUP) yoga
New to the yoga scene, SUP yoga is gaining popularity among the outdoorsy crowd. If you’re having a hard time picturing this, basically “take a Hatha or a Vinyasa class, put it on a paddleboard in the middle of the water, and that’s SUP yoga,” says DeSisto, who’s also a certified SUP yoga instructor.
“It’s really fantastic for developing balance, more than any other type of yoga, plus it gets you outside.” (Some gyms offer it in their indoor pools as well.)
Don’t worry about floating away. Boards are anchored so you stay (relatively) put. Teachers can offer a variety of modifications to suit your level of balance.
Who should try it:
Nature lovers or anyone who wants to take their yoga practice outside and seriously work their balance.
Kundalini yoga
Kundalini is for those who want to experience the spiritual side of yoga. It’s about awakening and releasing
cosmic energy that’s trapped in the base of the spine
through a combination of quick repetitive movements, breath work, chanting (aka mantras), and meditation.
It doesn’t look like your typical yoga class, either. Kundalini classes are composed of an opening chant, a spine warmup, a
kriya
(a specific series of poses paired with breath work and chanting), and a closing meditation or song.
It can bring up a lot of emotions. “I’ve seen lots of people cry,” says DeSisto. “It stirs everything up in your body to the point that sh*t just comes out.”
Who should try it:
Anyone who wants a blended physical and spiritual practice or wants to dive deeper into breath work.
tl;dr
Yoga is about connecting your mind, breath, and body — all while tuning in to what you’re feeling, both physically and emotionally.
It can be deeply relaxing (restorative) or deeply invigorating (power or Vinyasa flow). It can be regimented (Iyengar) or free-flowing (Vinyasa). It can be done in a silk hammock (aerial) or even with the support of a chair. Yoga can be anything you need, once you know your options.
Keep in mind: Depending on the individual instructor or studio, there will be subtle variations even within each type of yoga, so don’t knock one type until you’ve tried it at least twice.

Bottom line
You’ve likely heard a friend or two extol the virtues of yoga. Among the many potential benefits of yoga are improved
flexibility
,
reduced anxiety and depression
,
reduced chronic pain
, and even
lowered blood pressure
.
But this doesn’t mean that yoga, if performed incorrectly, can’t also cause harm. Let’s dive into the most common yoga injuries and how we can prevent them.

Overstretching: A true pain in the asana
While most
yoga
injuries aren’t severe and go unreported, more serious issues
can occur
, including strains and sprains, fractures, and dislocations.
The truth is, injuries can happen any time, in any sport, or even while walking down the sidewalk — but scary injuries are rare. Most yoga injuries develop gradually over years of consistent overstretching and misalignment.
As with any physical activity, the safest approach to yoga is to learn how to practice the
poses correctly
and stay in tune with your body to avoid overdoing it.
To get the lowdown on common yoga injuries and specific tips for addressing them, we spoke to yoga instructors Steven Cheng of
Simha Yoga Lab
in Jersey City, New Jersey, and Julie Skaarup of
Sol Yoga
in Frederick, Maryland, as well as Jeni Livingston, a personal trainer and yoga instructor in New York.
Read on for their injury RX — from head to toe.
Most common yoga injuries and fixes
1. Wrists
Share on Pinterest
When it comes to your wrists, it’s all about leverage. Placing all your weight in your wrists when your hands are on the mat can lead to muscle and joint injuries.
How to find relief
In any pose where weight is placed on your hands, distribute your body’s weight through both hands by spreading them wide and pressing through your fingers.
In
Downward-Facing Dog
(Adho Muka Svanasana), push your hips back to decrease the angle of your wrists to the floor. In arm balances, such as Crow Pose (Bakasana), look to see that your elbows are stacked directly over your wrists, Cheng says.
2. Elbows
Pain in your elbows can result from bending them out to the sides in poses like
Low Plank
(Chaturanga Dandasana). While it may be easier to execute, lowering down with outward-pointing elbows can put stress on both your elbows and your wrists.
How to find relief
When bending your elbows in a pose (particularly Plank or Chaturanga), keep them tucked alongside your ribs as you bend them. Also, make sure your elbows’ creases face forward, Cheng says.
If this is difficult (yes, it’s a serious test of triceps strength), start with your knees on the floor. Remember, you can always work up to the unmodified version through regular practice.
3. Shoulders
Beware the shrug. By raising your shoulders up toward your ears (like when moving into
Upward-Facing Dog
, aka Urdhva Mukha Shvanasana), you stop using the supporting muscles in your arms, shoulders, and neck.
Shrugging also compresses your shoulders, which can cause muscle injuries, Cheng says. Even worse: It’s easy to injure your shoulder girdle or rotator cuff (and even dislocate the joint) by overextending or overstretching.
How to find relief
Let go. Be careful not to pull too hard on your shoulders in stretches, and always keep them held back and down away from your ears, Livingston says.
4. Ribs
Twists are awesome for releasing tension, but if done improperly they can overextend or bruise the intercostal muscles (the muscles in between your ribs).
How to find relief
Lengthen upward through your spine before twisting. Imagine that someone has a string attached to the crown of your head and is very gently pulling you up toward the ceiling. Twist to the point of feeling a stretch but not past it, even if you’re flexible, Cheng says.
5. Lower back
Share on Pinterest
Lower back pain
is a frequently cited yoga injury, and teachers speculate that it’s likely the result of rounding through the spine in poses like
Forward Fold
(Uttanasana) and Downward-Facing Dog.
Rounding causes your spine to flex the opposite way than it’s supposed to, Livingston says, which can cause disc problems in addition to that achy feeling post-class.
How to find relief
Before hinging at the hips and bending down, imagine lengthening your spine up and away from your hips. This will help you avoid rounding in your spine.
If you’re still struggling to stay on the straight and narrow, try bending your knees in poses like Forward Fold and Downward-Facing Dog, Livingston says, since the culprit could be tight hamstrings.
During Seated Forward Fold (Paschimottanasana), try sitting on a blanket or block to take pressure off your lower back. This will also help you hinge forward even more.
6. Hamstrings
Spend most days
sitting in front of a computer
, in class, or in a car? Guilty as charged. As a result, many of us have tight hamstrings, so it’s easy to pull or overstretch them in poses like Forward Bend, Cheng says.
How to find relief
Downward-Facing Dog,
Warrior I
(Virabhadrasana I), and
Crescent Lunge
(Anjaneyasana) are great ways to stretch out your hamstrings. Just remember to go slowly and work at your own pace.
If you have any kind of hamstring injury, try laying off poses that extend through the back of your body until the injury heals.
7. Hips
Share on Pinterest
It’s easy to overextend the range of motion in your hips in Split (Hanumanasana),
Warrior II
(Virabhadrasana II), and Wide-Legged Forward Fold (Prasarita Padottasana), Cheng says, which might tear the muscles of your inner groin or inner thighs.
How to find relief
A good general rule is to make sure your toes are pointed forward in any pose where your hips are squared off in the same direction (think: Warrior I).
Imagine there are headlights attached to the front of your hips and you’re trying to keep the area straight ahead of you illuminated at all times.
8. Knee
Knee issues
can plague even experienced yogis well after class. A common culprit of pain is the cross-legged position, Livingston says. Flexibility carries from your hips first — if your hips are tight in the pose, your knees will be the first place to feel pain or tension.
How to find relief
If you’re regularly bothered by knee pain, avoid sitting in cross-legged position or
Full Lotus
(Padmasana) for long periods unless your hips are already very flexible, Livingston says. Placing a block or rolled-up blanket under your knees in cross-legged positions can also help reduce strain.
For low lunges, place a blanket under your knees. Any time your knee is bent in a standing pose (such as in Warrior I and Warrior II), look to see that there’s a vertical line from your bent knee to your heel, Cheng says. This ensures that your body is bearing weight properly.
9. Neck
Headstand
(Sirsasana) and Shoulder Stand (Sarvangasana) can be the worst culprits for neck pain and injury, says Skaarup.
Repeatedly and incorrectly placing pressure on your neck leads to compression and puts pressure on your cervical vertebrae. This can result in joint issues and, in some cases, loss of neck flexion.
How to find relief
For starters, always arrive with a beginner’s mind. When you see others doing cool upside-down postures, it can be tempting to give them a shot well before you’re ready. If you’re newer to yoga, master the modifications and build up your core and shoulder strength before trying these poses.
If you already have chronic neck or shoulder issues, it might be best to avoid full inversions altogether, Cheng says. If you really want to advance your practice, attempt them only with close supervision and using props that elevate your neck away from the floor.
If you already practice the pose without
props
, make sure your shoulder blades are drawn down and back so they’re safely supporting your body. Most importantly, never jerk your head once you’re up in the pose, Skaarup says, because it can destabilize your body, possibly causing a fall.
How to prevent yoga injuries
Share on Pinterest
Proper alignment in poses is key, but it’s not the only factor in a safe yoga practice. To stay blissed out instead of
stressed out
over injury, follow the basic guidelines below.
Leave your ego outside
It can be tempting to rush into more advanced poses (how tough can handstands be, right?), but pushing your body is a recipe for injury. Yoga is “about finding where you are,” Skaarup says, “not trying to push to a place where your body may never be able to go.”
Warm up
Warming up is an important part of any physical activity, and yoga is no exception.
Basic stretches
(like neck rolls, shoulder rolls, and gentle twists) help prepare your body for more challenging poses later on in a sequence, Cheng says.
And remember to give your
mind
a chance to warm up to the practice: Take a
few breaths
to get centered at the beginning of class, or establish a pre-flow ritual (such as
chanting some oms
) to get grounded.
Ease in
No one would expect to run a marathon the first time they lace up their sneakers. Don’t expect to do Headstand or even get your heels to the floor in Downward-Facing Dog the first time you hit the mat, Livingston says.
Instead, opt for beginner-friendly or all-levels classes that will develop the foundation for more advanced moves. Even if you’ve been doing yoga for a long time, it’s always good to take a refresher once in a while.
Communicate
Get to know the teacher and be sure to share any preexisting issues that might require modifications in certain poses, Cheng says. At the beginning of class, mention things like slipped discs, fractures, tears, or joint issues.
If you don’t know how to modify or use props in a certain pose, politely raise your hand and make eye contact with the teacher so you can get support. When the teacher comes over, keep it to a whisper so as not to disrupt the flow of class.
And if a pose just isn’t working, don’t be embarrassed to simply… not do it. Rest and take a
Child’s Pose
(Balasana) instead or focus on the poses that provide benefit and release to you.
Come out of postures slowly
This is particularly important if you’ve been holding a certain pose for several minutes, Skaarup says, like
Pigeon Pose
(Kapotasana) or Frog Pose (Mandukasana). A good general rule is to move out of a pose as gradually as you moved into it.
Use props and modifications
There’s no shame in not being ready to hold a pose completely on your own. If there’s tightness somewhere in your body, other parts of you will have to accommodate it, Livingston says, which is why it’s so important not to push your body past what it’s able to do on a given day.
Props and
modifications
allow your body to get a feel for a pose and gradually work up to its full variation without injury. It’s never a bad idea to grab a blanket and a couple of blocks at the beginning of class, and maybe even a strap for supine (floor) postures.
Never lock your joints
Hyperextension (locking) is a surefire way to wear out joints and cause injury down the road. Focus on engaging the muscles
around
the joints to gain stability, Cheng says.
In standing or balancing postures, like
Tree Pose
(Vrksasana), keep a microbend in the knee of your straight leg. In poses with one or both arms straightened out, like Warrior II, keep a gentle bend in those elbows as well.
Stay for Savasana
It’s easy to head for the door as soon as the instructor calls for
Corpse Pose
(Savasana), the final resting pose of a yoga flow. But sticking around is good for your health.
Savasana allows your nervous system to slow down and brings closure to the practice. Even just 2 or 3 minutes can have an effect, Cheng says.
If you do get injured, take care
If you tweak, pull, or tear something during a yoga flow, don’t be afraid to step out of class early. Care for it like any other sports injury and seek a doctor’s opinion if the pain persists.
Above all: listen to your body
At all stages of yoga practice, stay mindful
.
Really listen to your body so you can be sensitive to any tightness or strain. Even if you did a particular pose one day, that doesn’t mean your body will be able to do it the next.
“In our yoga practice,” Skaarup says, “we are building a relationship with our bodies the same way we build them with other people: by listening.”

Bottom line
You’ve likely heard a friend or two extol the virtues of yoga. Among the many potential benefits of yoga are improved
flexibility
,
reduced anxiety and depression
,
reduced chronic pain
, and even
lowered blood pressure
.
But this doesn’t mean that yoga, if performed incorrectly, can’t also cause harm. Let’s dive into the most common yoga injuries and how we can prevent them.

Overstretching: A true pain in the asana
While most
yoga
injuries aren’t severe and go unreported, more serious issues
can occur
, including strains and sprains, fractures, and dislocations.
The truth is, injuries can happen any time, in any sport, or even while walking down the sidewalk — but scary injuries are rare. Most yoga injuries develop gradually over years of consistent overstretching and misalignment.
As with any physical activity, the safest approach to yoga is to learn how to practice the
poses correctly
and stay in tune with your body to avoid overdoing it.
To get the lowdown on common yoga injuries and specific tips for addressing them, we spoke to yoga instructors Steven Cheng of
Simha Yoga Lab
in Jersey City, New Jersey, and Julie Skaarup of
Sol Yoga
in Frederick, Maryland, as well as Jeni Livingston, a personal trainer and yoga instructor in New York.
Read on for their injury RX — from head to toe.
Most common yoga injuries and fixes
1. Wrists
Share on Pinterest
When it comes to your wrists, it’s all about leverage. Placing all your weight in your wrists when your hands are on the mat can lead to muscle and joint injuries.
How to find relief
In any pose where weight is placed on your hands, distribute your body’s weight through both hands by spreading them wide and pressing through your fingers.
In
Downward-Facing Dog
(Adho Muka Svanasana), push your hips back to decrease the angle of your wrists to the floor. In arm balances, such as Crow Pose (Bakasana), look to see that your elbows are stacked directly over your wrists, Cheng says.
2. Elbows
Pain in your elbows can result from bending them out to the sides in poses like
Low Plank
(Chaturanga Dandasana). While it may be easier to execute, lowering down with outward-pointing elbows can put stress on both your elbows and your wrists.
How to find relief
When bending your elbows in a pose (particularly Plank or Chaturanga), keep them tucked alongside your ribs as you bend them. Also, make sure your elbows’ creases face forward, Cheng says.
If this is difficult (yes, it’s a serious test of triceps strength), start with your knees on the floor. Remember, you can always work up to the unmodified version through regular practice.
3. Shoulders
Beware the shrug. By raising your shoulders up toward your ears (like when moving into
Upward-Facing Dog
, aka Urdhva Mukha Shvanasana), you stop using the supporting muscles in your arms, shoulders, and neck.
Shrugging also compresses your shoulders, which can cause muscle injuries, Cheng says. Even worse: It’s easy to injure your shoulder girdle or rotator cuff (and even dislocate the joint) by overextending or overstretching.
How to find relief
Let go. Be careful not to pull too hard on your shoulders in stretches, and always keep them held back and down away from your ears, Livingston says.
4. Ribs
Twists are awesome for releasing tension, but if done improperly they can overextend or bruise the intercostal muscles (the muscles in between your ribs).
How to find relief
Lengthen upward through your spine before twisting. Imagine that someone has a string attached to the crown of your head and is very gently pulling you up toward the ceiling. Twist to the point of feeling a stretch but not past it, even if you’re flexible, Cheng says.
5. Lower back
Share on Pinterest
Lower back pain
is a frequently cited yoga injury, and teachers speculate that it’s likely the result of rounding through the spine in poses like
Forward Fold
(Uttanasana) and Downward-Facing Dog.
Rounding causes your spine to flex the opposite way than it’s supposed to, Livingston says, which can cause disc problems in addition to that achy feeling post-class.
How to find relief
Before hinging at the hips and bending down, imagine lengthening your spine up and away from your hips. This will help you avoid rounding in your spine.
If you’re still struggling to stay on the straight and narrow, try bending your knees in poses like Forward Fold and Downward-Facing Dog, Livingston says, since the culprit could be tight hamstrings.
During Seated Forward Fold (Paschimottanasana), try sitting on a blanket or block to take pressure off your lower back. This will also help you hinge forward even more.
6. Hamstrings
Spend most days
sitting in front of a computer
, in class, or in a car? Guilty as charged. As a result, many of us have tight hamstrings, so it’s easy to pull or overstretch them in poses like Forward Bend, Cheng says.
How to find relief
Downward-Facing Dog,
Warrior I
(Virabhadrasana I), and
Crescent Lunge
(Anjaneyasana) are great ways to stretch out your hamstrings. Just remember to go slowly and work at your own pace.
If you have any kind of hamstring injury, try laying off poses that extend through the back of your body until the injury heals.
7. Hips
Share on Pinterest
It’s easy to overextend the range of motion in your hips in Split (Hanumanasana),
Warrior II
(Virabhadrasana II), and Wide-Legged Forward Fold (Prasarita Padottasana), Cheng says, which might tear the muscles of your inner groin or inner thighs.
How to find relief
A good general rule is to make sure your toes are pointed forward in any pose where your hips are squared off in the same direction (think: Warrior I).
Imagine there are headlights attached to the front of your hips and you’re trying to keep the area straight ahead of you illuminated at all times.
8. Knee
Knee issues
can plague even experienced yogis well after class. A common culprit of pain is the cross-legged position, Livingston says. Flexibility carries from your hips first — if your hips are tight in the pose, your knees will be the first place to feel pain or tension.
How to find relief
If you’re regularly bothered by knee pain, avoid sitting in cross-legged position or
Full Lotus
(Padmasana) for long periods unless your hips are already very flexible, Livingston says. Placing a block or rolled-up blanket under your knees in cross-legged positions can also help reduce strain.
For low lunges, place a blanket under your knees. Any time your knee is bent in a standing pose (such as in Warrior I and Warrior II), look to see that there’s a vertical line from your bent knee to your heel, Cheng says. This ensures that your body is bearing weight properly.
9. Neck
Headstand
(Sirsasana) and Shoulder Stand (Sarvangasana) can be the worst culprits for neck pain and injury, says Skaarup.
Repeatedly and incorrectly placing pressure on your neck leads to compression and puts pressure on your cervical vertebrae. This can result in joint issues and, in some cases, loss of neck flexion.
How to find relief
For starters, always arrive with a beginner’s mind. When you see others doing cool upside-down postures, it can be tempting to give them a shot well before you’re ready. If you’re newer to yoga, master the modifications and build up your core and shoulder strength before trying these poses.
If you already have chronic neck or shoulder issues, it might be best to avoid full inversions altogether, Cheng says. If you really want to advance your practice, attempt them only with close supervision and using props that elevate your neck away from the floor.
If you already practice the pose without
props
, make sure your shoulder blades are drawn down and back so they’re safely supporting your body. Most importantly, never jerk your head once you’re up in the pose, Skaarup says, because it can destabilize your body, possibly causing a fall.
How to prevent yoga injuries
Share on Pinterest
Proper alignment in poses is key, but it’s not the only factor in a safe yoga practice. To stay blissed out instead of
stressed out
over injury, follow the basic guidelines below.
Leave your ego outside
It can be tempting to rush into more advanced poses (how tough can handstands be, right?), but pushing your body is a recipe for injury. Yoga is “about finding where you are,” Skaarup says, “not trying to push to a place where your body may never be able to go.”
Warm up
Warming up is an important part of any physical activity, and yoga is no exception.
Basic stretches
(like neck rolls, shoulder rolls, and gentle twists) help prepare your body for more challenging poses later on in a sequence, Cheng says.
And remember to give your
mind
a chance to warm up to the practice: Take a
few breaths
to get centered at the beginning of class, or establish a pre-flow ritual (such as
chanting some oms
) to get grounded.
Ease in
No one would expect to run a marathon the first time they lace up their sneakers. Don’t expect to do Headstand or even get your heels to the floor in Downward-Facing Dog the first time you hit the mat, Livingston says.
Instead, opt for beginner-friendly or all-levels classes that will develop the foundation for more advanced moves. Even if you’ve been doing yoga for a long time, it’s always good to take a refresher once in a while.
Communicate
Get to know the teacher and be sure to share any preexisting issues that might require modifications in certain poses, Cheng says. At the beginning of class, mention things like slipped discs, fractures, tears, or joint issues.
If you don’t know how to modify or use props in a certain pose, politely raise your hand and make eye contact with the teacher so you can get support. When the teacher comes over, keep it to a whisper so as not to disrupt the flow of class.
And if a pose just isn’t working, don’t be embarrassed to simply… not do it. Rest and take a
Child’s Pose
(Balasana) instead or focus on the poses that provide benefit and release to you.
Come out of postures slowly
This is particularly important if you’ve been holding a certain pose for several minutes, Skaarup says, like
Pigeon Pose
(Kapotasana) or Frog Pose (Mandukasana). A good general rule is to move out of a pose as gradually as you moved into it.
Use props and modifications
There’s no shame in not being ready to hold a pose completely on your own. If there’s tightness somewhere in your body, other parts of you will have to accommodate it, Livingston says, which is why it’s so important not to push your body past what it’s able to do on a given day.
Props and
modifications
allow your body to get a feel for a pose and gradually work up to its full variation without injury. It’s never a bad idea to grab a blanket and a couple of blocks at the beginning of class, and maybe even a strap for supine (floor) postures.
Never lock your joints
Hyperextension (locking) is a surefire way to wear out joints and cause injury down the road. Focus on engaging the muscles
around
the joints to gain stability, Cheng says.
In standing or balancing postures, like
Tree Pose
(Vrksasana), keep a microbend in the knee of your straight leg. In poses with one or both arms straightened out, like Warrior II, keep a gentle bend in those elbows as well.
Stay for Savasana
It’s easy to head for the door as soon as the instructor calls for
Corpse Pose
(Savasana), the final resting pose of a yoga flow. But sticking around is good for your health.
Savasana allows your nervous system to slow down and brings closure to the practice. Even just 2 or 3 minutes can have an effect, Cheng says.
If you do get injured, take care
If you tweak, pull, or tear something during a yoga flow, don’t be afraid to step out of class early. Care for it like any other sports injury and seek a doctor’s opinion if the pain persists.
Above all: listen to your body
At all stages of yoga practice, stay mindful
.
Really listen to your body so you can be sensitive to any tightness or strain. Even if you did a particular pose one day, that doesn’t mean your body will be able to do it the next.
“In our yoga practice,” Skaarup says, “we are building a relationship with our bodies the same way we build them with other people: by listening.”

Overstretching: A true pain in the asana

The truth is, injuries can happen any time, in any sport, or even while walking down the sidewalk — but scary injuries are rare. Most yoga injuries develop gradually over years of consistent overstretching and misalignment.

Read on for their injury RX — from head to toe.
Most common yoga injuries and fixes
1. Wrists

Lower back pain

During Seated Forward Fold (Paschimottanasana), try sitting on a blanket or block to take pressure off your lower back. This will also help you hinge forward even more.
6. Hamstrings
Spend most days
sitting in front of a computer
, in class, or in a car? Guilty as charged. As a result, many of us have tight hamstrings, so it’s easy to pull or overstretch them in poses like Forward Bend, Cheng says.
How to find relief
Downward-Facing Dog,
Warrior I

Crescent Lunge
(Anjaneyasana) are great ways to stretch out your hamstrings. Just remember to go slowly and work at your own pace.
If you have any kind of hamstring injury, try laying off poses that extend through the back of your body until the injury heals.
7. Hips
Share on Pinterest
It’s easy to overextend the range of motion in your hips in Split (Hanumanasana),
Warrior II
(Virabhadrasana II), and Wide-Legged Forward Fold (Prasarita Padottasana), Cheng says, which might tear the muscles of your inner groin or inner thighs.
How to find relief
A good general rule is to make sure your toes are pointed forward in any pose where your hips are squared off in the same direction (think: Warrior I).
Imagine there are headlights attached to the front of your hips and you’re trying to keep the area straight ahead of you illuminated at all times.

Knee issues
can plague even experienced yogis well after class. A common culprit of pain is the cross-legged position, Livingston says. Flexibility carries from your hips first — if your hips are tight in the pose, your knees will be the first place to feel pain or tension.
How to find relief
If you’re regularly bothered by knee pain, avoid sitting in cross-legged position or
Full Lotus
(Padmasana) for long periods unless your hips are already very flexible, Livingston says. Placing a block or rolled-up blanket under your knees in cross-legged positions can also help reduce strain.
For low lunges, place a blanket under your knees. Any time your knee is bent in a standing pose (such as in Warrior I and Warrior II), look to see that there’s a vertical line from your bent knee to your heel, Cheng says. This ensures that your body is bearing weight properly.
9. Neck
Headstand
(Sirsasana) and Shoulder Stand (Sarvangasana) can be the worst culprits for neck pain and injury, says Skaarup.
Repeatedly and incorrectly placing pressure on your neck leads to compression and puts pressure on your cervical vertebrae. This can result in joint issues and, in some cases, loss of neck flexion.
How to find relief
For starters, always arrive with a beginner’s mind. When you see others doing cool upside-down postures, it can be tempting to give them a shot well before you’re ready. If you’re newer to yoga, master the modifications and build up your core and shoulder strength before trying these poses.

It can be tempting to rush into more advanced poses (how tough can handstands be, right?), but pushing your body is a recipe for injury. Yoga is “about finding where you are,” Skaarup says, “not trying to push to a place where your body may never be able to go.”

There’s no shame in not being ready to hold a pose completely on your own. If there’s tightness somewhere in your body, other parts of you will have to accommodate it, Livingston says, which is why it’s so important not to push your body past what it’s able to do on a given day.
Props and
modifications
allow your body to get a feel for a pose and gradually work up to its full variation without injury. It’s never a bad idea to grab a blanket and a couple of blocks at the beginning of class, and maybe even a strap for supine (floor) postures.
Never lock your joints
Hyperextension (locking) is a surefire way to wear out joints and cause injury down the road. Focus on engaging the muscles
around
the joints to gain stability, Cheng says.
In standing or balancing postures, like
Tree Pose
(Vrksasana), keep a microbend in the knee of your straight leg. In poses with one or both arms straightened out, like Warrior II, keep a gentle bend in those elbows as well.
Stay for Savasana
It’s easy to head for the door as soon as the instructor calls for
Corpse Pose
(Savasana), the final resting pose of a yoga flow. But sticking around is good for your health.
Savasana allows your nervous system to slow down and brings closure to the practice. Even just 2 or 3 minutes can have an effect, Cheng says.
If you do get injured, take care
If you tweak, pull, or tear something during a yoga flow, don’t be afraid to step out of class early. Care for it like any other sports injury and seek a doctor’s opinion if the pain persists.
Above all: listen to your body
At all stages of yoga practice, stay mindful
.
Really listen to your body so you can be sensitive to any tightness or strain. Even if you did a particular pose one day, that doesn’t mean your body will be able to do it the next.
“In our yoga practice,” Skaarup says, “we are building a relationship with our bodies the same way we build them with other people: by listening.”

What is it?
Is it different from other yoga?
Benefits
Yoga and depression
Can yoga be used as therapy?
Pros and cons
You don’t have to be the Yoda of yoga to reap major mental health benefits. Yoga can be an amazing form of therapy for beginners, experts, and everyone in between. Here’s how yoga therapy can help you feel better inside and out.

What is yoga therapy?
Yoga
is pretty much the PB&J of workouts — it’s the perfect combo. The blend of exercise and
meditation
can help you exercise your body and mind at the same time.
Exercise
is a natural way to pump up the volume on your
serotonin
production. Some research, including a
small 2011 study
, suggests this can help ease depression symptoms.
Meditation
can slow down your thoughts and clear your mind, and
research
suggests it has mental health benefits.
Yoga therapy uses the same tools as other forms of yoga. It just focuses more on each person’s individual needs. The practice can help address your unique physical, emotional, or mental concerns.
Yoga therapy can help with:
mind-body connection
overall well-being
physical pain
depression
anxiety
stress
Where can I do yoga therapy?
You can do yoga therapy solo or in a group setting. If an in-person sesh isn’t your thing, you can opt for
virtual yoga
or connect with a yoga therapist online. You can also check out yoga or
meditation apps
to see if they offer yoga therapy.
How is it different from regular yoga?
Traditional yoga and yoga therapy can both be super soothing and beneficial, but there are some big differences between the two. It really comes down to individual results.
A traditional yoga instructor will focus on the methods and practices of yoga. These classes tend to be geared to a general audience. But in yoga therapy, the therapist will focus on your individual emotional and physical needs.
A yoga therapist will assess your needs before a session so they can optimize your experience. They’ll also go over various healing tools, such as:
yoga postures
guided energy work
meditation techniques
breath awareness and control
The therapist will pick the right balance of these tools based on your needs, says certified yoga therapist Sadie Grossman.
A yoga therapist will also give you advice on how to practice on your own.
“I’m a firm believer in patients leaving a session with a tangible intervention that they can practice on their own, making them feel empowered,” says Grossman.
What are the benefits?
Stress reduction
Life is often a stress fest, and yoga therapy is here to help. A consistent practice can help you stay calm, focused, and positive.
In a
small 2012 study
of 72 “distressed” women, those who practiced yoga once or twice per week for 3 months showed greater improvements in measures of stress and quality of life than those who didn’t do yoga.
Anxiety relief
Many people turn to yoga to reduce anxiety. And with good reason! The calming sensations, focused breathing, and slow movements can help lower anxiety levels.
In a
small 2009 study
, 34 women who were referred to a yoga clinic for anxiety practiced yoga twice a week for 2 months, while a control group of 31 women didn’t practice yoga. Afterward, the yoga group showed greater decreases in anxiety levels than the control group.
Improved eating habits
Meditation and
yoga
both encourage
mindfulness
, and some
research
suggests that mindfulness can contribute to healthier eating habits and overall lifestyle improvements. This is why yoga is often used in
eating disorder recovery
— it can help you have a healthier relationship with food and your body.
Bonus:
Mindful eating
can also help you regulate your blood sugar levels and keep your weight in a healthy range.
Better mood
It’s 100 percent OK to have a crappy day. It happens. Thankfully, yoga therapy can help you nip those bad vibes in the bud. It can help you slay those endorphins and leave you feeling a heckuvalot better.
A
2017 study
found that certain yoga poses can increase energy and self-esteem. A full-on yoga therapy sesh? Even better.
Does yoga therapy help depression?
Depression can make anyone feel cut off and isolated. But remember: You are not alone. About
17.3 million
adults in the United States are affected by depression every year.
Studies
suggest that yoga could help you feel better. Here’s how.
Depression can really take a toll on your energy level and ability to concentrate. Yoga might give you the boost you need to get back to business.
Yoga can also help on a chemical level — it can decrease your levels of the stress hormone
cortisol
, which is also linked to
depression
.
Pro tip:
Grossman suggests group sessions if you’re experiencing depression, since the group setting can help combat a sense of isolation.
Can you practice regular yoga as a form of therapy?
Yes! Yoga can be used as a type of therapy. But keep in mind that it’s not a cure-all. Yoga therapy might not replace the effects of other treatments (like medication or psychotherapy), but it’s def worth a shot!
PSA:
Yoga therapy might work best when combined with other forms of treatment.
Takeaway: Pros and cons of yoga therapy
Yoga therapy can give your mental and physical health a major glow-up. Here’s a deep dive into all the pros and cons to help you decide if it’s right for you.
Pros:
helps you establish goals
friendly for all fitness levels
can improve overall health
works out your mind
and
body
can reduce stress and anxiety
can ease symptoms of depression
Cons:
not the right fit for everyone
might be challenging on a physical and emotional level
can be pricey (but this depends on the studio or therapist)

What is it?
Is it different from other yoga?
Benefits
Yoga and depression
Can yoga be used as therapy?
Pros and cons
You don’t have to be the Yoda of yoga to reap major mental health benefits. Yoga can be an amazing form of therapy for beginners, experts, and everyone in between. Here’s how yoga therapy can help you feel better inside and out.

What is yoga therapy?
Yoga
is pretty much the PB&J of workouts — it’s the perfect combo. The blend of exercise and
meditation
can help you exercise your body and mind at the same time.
Exercise
is a natural way to pump up the volume on your
serotonin
production. Some research, including a
small 2011 study
, suggests this can help ease depression symptoms.
Meditation
can slow down your thoughts and clear your mind, and
research
suggests it has mental health benefits.
Yoga therapy uses the same tools as other forms of yoga. It just focuses more on each person’s individual needs. The practice can help address your unique physical, emotional, or mental concerns.
Yoga therapy can help with:
mind-body connection
overall well-being
physical pain
depression
anxiety
stress
Where can I do yoga therapy?
You can do yoga therapy solo or in a group setting. If an in-person sesh isn’t your thing, you can opt for
virtual yoga
or connect with a yoga therapist online. You can also check out yoga or
meditation apps
to see if they offer yoga therapy.
How is it different from regular yoga?
Traditional yoga and yoga therapy can both be super soothing and beneficial, but there are some big differences between the two. It really comes down to individual results.
A traditional yoga instructor will focus on the methods and practices of yoga. These classes tend to be geared to a general audience. But in yoga therapy, the therapist will focus on your individual emotional and physical needs.
A yoga therapist will assess your needs before a session so they can optimize your experience. They’ll also go over various healing tools, such as:
yoga postures
guided energy work
meditation techniques
breath awareness and control
The therapist will pick the right balance of these tools based on your needs, says certified yoga therapist Sadie Grossman.
A yoga therapist will also give you advice on how to practice on your own.
“I’m a firm believer in patients leaving a session with a tangible intervention that they can practice on their own, making them feel empowered,” says Grossman.
What are the benefits?
Stress reduction
Life is often a stress fest, and yoga therapy is here to help. A consistent practice can help you stay calm, focused, and positive.
In a
small 2012 study
of 72 “distressed” women, those who practiced yoga once or twice per week for 3 months showed greater improvements in measures of stress and quality of life than those who didn’t do yoga.
Anxiety relief
Many people turn to yoga to reduce anxiety. And with good reason! The calming sensations, focused breathing, and slow movements can help lower anxiety levels.
In a
small 2009 study
, 34 women who were referred to a yoga clinic for anxiety practiced yoga twice a week for 2 months, while a control group of 31 women didn’t practice yoga. Afterward, the yoga group showed greater decreases in anxiety levels than the control group.
Improved eating habits
Meditation and
yoga
both encourage
mindfulness
, and some
research
suggests that mindfulness can contribute to healthier eating habits and overall lifestyle improvements. This is why yoga is often used in
eating disorder recovery
— it can help you have a healthier relationship with food and your body.
Bonus:
Mindful eating
can also help you regulate your blood sugar levels and keep your weight in a healthy range.
Better mood
It’s 100 percent OK to have a crappy day. It happens. Thankfully, yoga therapy can help you nip those bad vibes in the bud. It can help you slay those endorphins and leave you feeling a heckuvalot better.
A
2017 study
found that certain yoga poses can increase energy and self-esteem. A full-on yoga therapy sesh? Even better.
Does yoga therapy help depression?
Depression can make anyone feel cut off and isolated. But remember: You are not alone. About
17.3 million
adults in the United States are affected by depression every year.
Studies
suggest that yoga could help you feel better. Here’s how.
Depression can really take a toll on your energy level and ability to concentrate. Yoga might give you the boost you need to get back to business.
Yoga can also help on a chemical level — it can decrease your levels of the stress hormone
cortisol
, which is also linked to
depression
.
Pro tip:
Grossman suggests group sessions if you’re experiencing depression, since the group setting can help combat a sense of isolation.
Can you practice regular yoga as a form of therapy?
Yes! Yoga can be used as a type of therapy. But keep in mind that it’s not a cure-all. Yoga therapy might not replace the effects of other treatments (like medication or psychotherapy), but it’s def worth a shot!
PSA:
Yoga therapy might work best when combined with other forms of treatment.
Takeaway: Pros and cons of yoga therapy
Yoga therapy can give your mental and physical health a major glow-up. Here’s a deep dive into all the pros and cons to help you decide if it’s right for you.
Pros:
helps you establish goals
friendly for all fitness levels
can improve overall health
works out your mind
and
body
can reduce stress and anxiety
can ease symptoms of depression
Cons:
not the right fit for everyone
might be challenging on a physical and emotional level
can be pricey (but this depends on the studio or therapist)

5 benefits of walking on the beach
1. Good exercise
Beach strolls are a fab form of exercise.
Walking
in sand requires more effort than
walking
on a hard surface. This can help you burn extra calories and strengthen the
ankles
,
hips
, and
core
.
Beachy bonus
: Walking is a
low impact
activity. That means there’s a lower injury risk when compared to
high impact
sports like
running
.
2. Stress relief
Walking on the beach can be uber-beneficial for your mind and
mental health
.
“Taking regular walks on the beach is a fantastic way to calm the cortisol response in the brain, allowing you to feel more awake, alive, and alert,” says holistic health expert
Mindy Pelz
.
A
2019 study
backs this up. Researchers found that spending at least 2 hours in nature per week can lower levels of the stress hormone cortisol. It may also increase feelings of well-being and good health.
3. Vitamin D
Unlike built-up urban areas, beaches are a great source of natural sunlight. This is great news since
50 to 90 percent
of your vitamin D comes from sunshine.
BTW, Vitamin D plays a big part in your overall health. Getting enough of this nutrient can help:
promote
healthy bones
bolster the
immune system
benefit the
nervous system
support
heart health
“If you take a walk on the beach and it’s a sunny day, you’ll get a much bigger vitamin D hit, which is super important if you spend a lot of time indoors,” says fitness instructor
Joe Johnson
.
4. Burns calories
Walking on uneven beach terrain makes muscles work up to 28 percent harder than walking on flat surfaces, according to a
2013 study
.
“The instability means you need to push away from the surface a little harder with your legs,” says Johnson. “While this may seem negligible if you think about a couple of steps, this compounds over time.”
That said, beach walks are a great way to
burn calories
. Here’s a rough
estimate
of how many calories you can burn walking for 1 hour, based on weight and pace.
Weight
2.0 mph
(casual pace)
3.0 mph
(moderate pace)
3.5 mph
(brisk pace)
4.0 mph
(very brisk pace)
130 lbs.

150 lbs.

210 lbs.
190
312
361
476
230 lbs.
208
344
397
523
FYI
: The exact number of calories you burn also depends on your weight, pace, terrain, incline, and other factors.
5. Good for feet and back
Beach walking can help build strength in your feet and back. It may also reduce your risk of muscle damage and soreness over the long term, according to a
2013 study
.
Just keep in mind, you might feel the burn if you’re new to walking or if you walk long distances. So def don’t push past your limits.
Tips to make the most of walking on the beach
Walking
on the beach tends to be super safe, but there are still a few risks to watch out for. Here are some tips to help you make the most of your next sandy sweat sesh.
Start solid.
You might want to
walk
on solid ground for a few minutes before you hit the sand. This can help you prep for less even terrain.
Warm up and cool down.
You should always start and end your beach
walks
with stretches. Some great options include standing calf stretches, ankle rolls, standing quadricep stretches, and bent-over hamstring stretches.
Find firm sand.
You may also want to walk closer to the water where the sand is firmer and easier to tread on.
Incline.
Beaches tend to slope toward the water — sometimes gently, sometimes dramatically. Walking on a sloped surface can increase the risk of muscle strain. A way to get around this is walking in a zig-zag. It might feel a bit weird at first, but it demands equal output from both sides of the body.
Disadvantages of walking on the beach
Walking on the beach tends to be super safe. But there are still some risks to watch out for.
Injuries
Softer surfaces like sand tend to be easier on the joints than hard surfaces like concrete. But you should avoid walking on slopes if you have
ankle
,
back
, or
knee
pain.
“If you are already experiencing knee pain, have had a recent surgery, or are walking with a limp, then walking on the beach is not recommended,” says physical therapist
Nikki Clayton
.
According to Clayton, the unpredictable and uneven walking surface of sand can put extra stress and strain on your joints.
Shoes
Some peeps prefer to walk barefoot on the beach. But beginners might be better off wearing
shoes
. That means no flip-flops (trust us). A
2021 study
found that this type of
footwear
can increase your risk of injury. This is because they don’t provide enough support for your feet or ankles.
P.S. Some peeps dig the feel of sand beneath their
feet
. We’re right there with ya. Just be sure to watch out for pointy objects. A single sharp shell can turn your peaceful sunset stroll into a stressful (and painful) situation.
Sun damage
Beach strolls can make you feel like you’re
literally
walking on sunshine 😎. Just keep in mind, you have to be super careful about
sun damage
. Spending too much time in the sun can increase your risk of
skin cancer
. It can also lead to
dehydration
,
peeling
,
wrinkles
,
sun spots
, and
burns
.
You can avoid sun damage by applying sunscreen before each walk. Stick to
SPF 30
or higher even on cold or overcast days.
Psst
. You can also wear
UV protective clothing
and hats.
The bottom line
A walk on the beach is great for the body and mind. It’s a wonderful workout and is especially good for strengthening the
legs
,
knees
, and ankles. It also burns more calories than walking on flat surfaces like concrete or a treadmill. Just be sure to know your limits, especially on super steep slopes or rocky terrain.

2. Stress relief
Walking on the beach can be uber-beneficial for your mind and
mental health
.
“Taking regular walks on the beach is a fantastic way to calm the cortisol response in the brain, allowing you to feel more awake, alive, and alert,” says holistic health expert
Mindy Pelz
.
A
2019 study
backs this up. Researchers found that spending at least 2 hours in nature per week can lower levels of the stress hormone cortisol. It may also increase feelings of well-being and good health.
3. Vitamin D
Unlike built-up urban areas, beaches are a great source of natural sunlight. This is great news since
50 to 90 percent
of your vitamin D comes from sunshine.
BTW, Vitamin D plays a big part in your overall health. Getting enough of this nutrient can help:
promote
healthy bones
bolster the
immune system
benefit the
nervous system
support
heart health
“If you take a walk on the beach and it’s a sunny day, you’ll get a much bigger vitamin D hit, which is super important if you spend a lot of time indoors,” says fitness instructor
Joe Johnson
.
4. Burns calories
Walking on uneven beach terrain makes muscles work up to 28 percent harder than walking on flat surfaces, according to a
2013 study
.
“The instability means you need to push away from the surface a little harder with your legs,” says Johnson. “While this may seem negligible if you think about a couple of steps, this compounds over time.”
That said, beach walks are a great way to
burn calories
. Here’s a rough
estimate
of how many calories you can burn walking for 1 hour, based on weight and pace.
Weight
2.0 mph
(casual pace)
3.0 mph
(moderate pace)
3.5 mph
(brisk pace)
4.0 mph
(very brisk pace)
130 lbs.

FYI
: The exact number of calories you burn also depends on your weight, pace, terrain, incline, and other factors.
5. Good for feet and back
Beach walking can help build strength in your feet and back. It may also reduce your risk of muscle damage and soreness over the long term, according to a
2013 study
.
Just keep in mind, you might feel the burn if you’re new to walking or if you walk long distances. So def don’t push past your limits.
Tips to make the most of walking on the beach
Walking
on the beach tends to be super safe, but there are still a few risks to watch out for. Here are some tips to help you make the most of your next sandy sweat sesh.
Start solid.
You might want to
walk
on solid ground for a few minutes before you hit the sand. This can help you prep for less even terrain.
Warm up and cool down.
You should always start and end your beach
walks
with stretches. Some great options include standing calf stretches, ankle rolls, standing quadricep stretches, and bent-over hamstring stretches.
Find firm sand.
You may also want to walk closer to the water where the sand is firmer and easier to tread on.
Incline.
Beaches tend to slope toward the water — sometimes gently, sometimes dramatically. Walking on a sloped surface can increase the risk of muscle strain. A way to get around this is walking in a zig-zag. It might feel a bit weird at first, but it demands equal output from both sides of the body.
Disadvantages of walking on the beach
Walking on the beach tends to be super safe. But there are still some risks to watch out for.
Injuries
Softer surfaces like sand tend to be easier on the joints than hard surfaces like concrete. But you should avoid walking on slopes if you have
ankle
,
back
, or
knee
pain.
“If you are already experiencing knee pain, have had a recent surgery, or are walking with a limp, then walking on the beach is not recommended,” says physical therapist
Nikki Clayton
.
According to Clayton, the unpredictable and uneven walking surface of sand can put extra stress and strain on your joints.
Shoes
Some peeps prefer to walk barefoot on the beach. But beginners might be better off wearing
shoes
. That means no flip-flops (trust us). A
2021 study
found that this type of
footwear
can increase your risk of injury. This is because they don’t provide enough support for your feet or ankles.
P.S. Some peeps dig the feel of sand beneath their
feet
. We’re right there with ya. Just be sure to watch out for pointy objects. A single sharp shell can turn your peaceful sunset stroll into a stressful (and painful) situation.
Sun damage
Beach strolls can make you feel like you’re
literally
walking on sunshine 😎. Just keep in mind, you have to be super careful about
sun damage
. Spending too much time in the sun can increase your risk of
skin cancer
. It can also lead to
dehydration
,
peeling
,
wrinkles
,
sun spots
, and
burns
.
You can avoid sun damage by applying sunscreen before each walk. Stick to
SPF 30
or higher even on cold or overcast days.
Psst
. You can also wear
UV protective clothing
and hats.
The bottom line
A walk on the beach is great for the body and mind. It’s a wonderful workout and is especially good for strengthening the
legs
,
knees
, and ankles. It also burns more calories than walking on flat surfaces like concrete or a treadmill. Just be sure to know your limits, especially on super steep slopes or rocky terrain.

5 benefits of walking on the beach
1. Good exercise
Beach strolls are a fab form of exercise.
Walking
in sand requires more effort than
walking
on a hard surface. This can help you burn extra calories and strengthen the
ankles
,
hips
, and
core
.
Beachy bonus
: Walking is a
low impact
activity. That means there’s a lower injury risk when compared to
high impact
sports like
running
.

Movin’ on the Move: The Ultimate Road Trip Workout
Written by
Katie Dunlop
—
Updated on July 6, 2021
Rear-ender
Suitcase swing
Bumper push-up
Reverse leg lift
Parking lot sprint
Freeway crunch
Taking a vacation from work doesn’t mean you have to take a break from your health and
fitness goals
. Whether you’re road-tripping across the country or just driving a few hours out of town, this workout will help you stretch your legs… and
burn some serious calories
.
So pack your bags, grab your sneakers, and throw on a
pair of leggings
(if you’re not already wearing a pair of leggings, that is).
Best workout for road trips
On the road again? Make the most of it by getting a
workout
in along the way. You can easily do these moves all at once, or you can split them up throughout your trip.
Rear-ender
Suitcase swing
(or modify with
suitcase deadlift
)
Bumper push-up
Reverse leg lift
Parking lot sprint
(or modify with
tire tap
)
Freeway crunch
1. Rear-ender
Hitting the road early in the morning typically requires a
coffee
to wake you up and get you moving. But before you head in for your
caffeine
fix, try a few of these rear-enders for a cardio burst that will help
wake up
your body.
Share on Pinterest
How to do it:
Stand about a foot away from the back of your car.
Keeping your chest lifted and core tight, lift right knee high and tap right toe on the bumper of your car.
As you bring your right foot back to the ground, pick up your left knee and tap bumper with left toe.
Move quickly and aim for 3 sets of 20 reps, alternating legs.

2. Suitcase swing
Ugh — the struggle is real. To avoid thinking about the
$$$
pouring into your car on a gas stop, grab your suitcase and focus on your
booty
, legs, and lower belly instead.
Share on Pinterest
How to do it:
Stand with feet wider than hip width.
Grab your bag with both hands and place it between your legs.
Take a slight bend in knees as you push your booty back.
Drive through your heels, squeezing your glutes forward, and allow the bag to rise to about shoulder height. (Just like
a kettlebell swing
!)
Try 3 sets of 15 reps.
Modification: Suitcase deadlift
If you’re on the shorter side (or if you packed your whole wardrobe for a one-night vacay), your bag might not fit between your legs. Try some
deadlifts
instead.
Share on Pinterest
How to do it:
Stand with feet slightly wider than hip-width apart. Hold your suitcase just in front of your body with both hands.
Keeping spine neutral and knees slightly bent, push your hips back and slowly lower the suitcase until it just touches the ground.
Bring hips toward the suitcase as you raise back up to the starting position.
Do 15 reps. Try 3 sets.
3. Bumper push-up
On a long drive, trail mix and water just aren’t gonna cut it. But before you pull into a
drive-thru
, think twice. See if you can find a spot with
healthy(ish) options
made from real ingredients. And before you dine, why not take the opportunity to hit the bumper and push it (real good)?
Share on Pinterest
How to do it:
Place your hands about shoulder-width apart and step feet back into an elevated plank.
Bend elbows to 90 degrees as you lower your chest.
Exhale as you press away from the car and repeat.
Shoot for 3 sets of 15 reps, as long as your
form feels strong

4. Windshield wiper reverse leg lift
Did your windshield become a bug graveyard? You can’t roll into your vacay destination with that mess on your windshield, so when you stop to clean it up, try these reverse leg lifts. Your butt will thank you after all those hours on the road.
Share on Pinterest
How to do it:
Take a slight bend in your standing leg as you reach forward with the squeegee.
Lift the opposite leg behind you, squeezing to engage your glutes.
Return your leg and arm to the starting position.
Try 3 sets of 15 reps on each leg.
5. Parking lot sprint
Your friend
swore
they didn’t have to
pee
at the last stop, but they’re crossing their knees 15 minutes later, right? Here’s how to make this (extra) pit stop worth it.
Share on Pinterest
How to do it:
Find a safe, open space and set a distance about six cars long.
Sprint down and back 5 times to get a little
HIIT
action in and boost your metabolism!
Modification: Tire tap
Short on space? Try tire taps instead! The combination of a plyometric leap and curtsy lunge will work those glutes and quads and get your
heart rate
up.
Share on Pinterest
How to do it:
Start at your driver’s side front tire in a crouched position. Position your right foot behind and to the left of your left foot.
Jump off left foot, using arms and right leg to propel your body toward the back tire.
Land softly on the ball of your right foot, letting left foot pass behind it before touching down.
Repeat on the other side.
Try to complete 20 jumps.
6. Freeway crunch
Don’t have any stops for a while? You can do freeway crunches from the passenger seat! Think:
bicycle crunches
, but sitting down.
Share on Pinterest
How to do it:
While seated, place your hands behind your head, with elbows out to the sides.
Lift left knee and lower right elbow, rotating at your core so they meet each other.
Return to the starting position, and then repeat on the other side. Continue to alternate sides.
Aim for 50 double-count crunches every 5 minutes
tl;dr
Not too bad for being in a car all day. Try these moves on your next road trip when you’re tempted to ask “Are we there yet?”

Movin’ on the Move: The Ultimate Road Trip Workout
Written by
Katie Dunlop
—
Updated on July 6, 2021
Rear-ender
Suitcase swing
Bumper push-up
Reverse leg lift
Parking lot sprint
Freeway crunch
Taking a vacation from work doesn’t mean you have to take a break from your health and
fitness goals
. Whether you’re road-tripping across the country or just driving a few hours out of town, this workout will help you stretch your legs… and
burn some serious calories
.
So pack your bags, grab your sneakers, and throw on a
pair of leggings
(if you’re not already wearing a pair of leggings, that is).
Best workout for road trips
On the road again? Make the most of it by getting a
workout
in along the way. You can easily do these moves all at once, or you can split them up throughout your trip.
Rear-ender
Suitcase swing
(or modify with
suitcase deadlift
)
Bumper push-up
Reverse leg lift
Parking lot sprint
(or modify with
tire tap
)
Freeway crunch
1. Rear-ender
Hitting the road early in the morning typically requires a
coffee
to wake you up and get you moving. But before you head in for your
caffeine
fix, try a few of these rear-enders for a cardio burst that will help
wake up
your body.
Share on Pinterest
How to do it:
Stand about a foot away from the back of your car.
Keeping your chest lifted and core tight, lift right knee high and tap right toe on the bumper of your car.
As you bring your right foot back to the ground, pick up your left knee and tap bumper with left toe.
Move quickly and aim for 3 sets of 20 reps, alternating legs.

2. Suitcase swing
Ugh — the struggle is real. To avoid thinking about the
$$$
pouring into your car on a gas stop, grab your suitcase and focus on your
booty
, legs, and lower belly instead.
Share on Pinterest
How to do it:
Stand with feet wider than hip width.
Grab your bag with both hands and place it between your legs.
Take a slight bend in knees as you push your booty back.
Drive through your heels, squeezing your glutes forward, and allow the bag to rise to about shoulder height. (Just like
a kettlebell swing
!)
Try 3 sets of 15 reps.
Modification: Suitcase deadlift
If you’re on the shorter side (or if you packed your whole wardrobe for a one-night vacay), your bag might not fit between your legs. Try some
deadlifts
instead.
Share on Pinterest
How to do it:
Stand with feet slightly wider than hip-width apart. Hold your suitcase just in front of your body with both hands.
Keeping spine neutral and knees slightly bent, push your hips back and slowly lower the suitcase until it just touches the ground.
Bring hips toward the suitcase as you raise back up to the starting position.
Do 15 reps. Try 3 sets.
3. Bumper push-up
On a long drive, trail mix and water just aren’t gonna cut it. But before you pull into a
drive-thru
, think twice. See if you can find a spot with
healthy(ish) options
made from real ingredients. And before you dine, why not take the opportunity to hit the bumper and push it (real good)?
Share on Pinterest
How to do it:
Place your hands about shoulder-width apart and step feet back into an elevated plank.
Bend elbows to 90 degrees as you lower your chest.
Exhale as you press away from the car and repeat.
Shoot for 3 sets of 15 reps, as long as your
form feels strong
.
4. Windshield wiper reverse leg lift
Did your windshield become a bug graveyard? You can’t roll into your vacay destination with that mess on your windshield, so when you stop to clean it up, try these reverse leg lifts. Your butt will thank you after all those hours on the road.

How the plan works
Info for beginners
Week-by-week
10K training calendar
Discover a 10k running plan that may transform your fitness journey. Whether you’re a beginner or a seasoned runner, our 4-week guide offers expert tips and motivation to help you reach your 10k goals. Start your journey today.
For a lot of folks, the
pandemic
brought running front and center. When
gyms
shut down and we said “see ya later” to
group fitness
, running was an accessible form of exercise with serious
mental health benefits
.
To celebrate the
joys of running
, the slow-but-steady return of race season, and all that we’ve survived over the last year, we put together a kick-ass training plan to help you reach new heights, distances, and milestones —
no matter your fitness level
.
Whether you’re a seasoned
marathoner
, a casual
jogger
, or someone who’s never even run a mile, we’re challenging you to take on a
10K
(say it with us: YES 👏 YOU 👏 CAN 👏). Sign up for an event. Run a virtual race. Grab some friends or hit the road solo — however you decide to hit the pavement, we’re here for you every step of the way.
Ready to dig in? Here’s how to get in amazing 10K shape in just 4 weeks.

How the plan works
Meet your coaches
You deserve the best, so we tapped three running pros to build out this training plan. Consistency is key, so stick to our 4-week schedule and you’ll crush it on race day.
The calendar features 6 days of training, 1 day of rest, but there’s room for customization to make it work for you.
Meet your coaches
Becky Wade.
Becky
is a professional runner, Team USA qualifier, cross country coach, and
author
. She has created a run program that’ll get you from couch to PR in no time.
Ben Lauder-Dykes.
Every run training plan should have a strength and mobility component.
Ben
— a
Fhitting Room instructor
and run coach — has your back with movement drills, supersets, and strength circuits designed to support your runs.
Angie Asche.
If you’re gonna train hard, you need to fuel up.
Angie
is a sports nutritionist (MS, RD, CSSD — all the certs!) and
cookbook author
who works with elite endurance athletes to create meal plans that power performance. Look for her weekly nutrition tips that’ll get you to the finish line.
5 quick steps to start you off
To start this plan, you’ll need to brush up on some basic running lingo, along with essential strength-training movements and stretches. Don’t worry — we’ve gathered everything you need to know!
Step 1:
Our
all-in-one guide
explains how to start running at any level, from form and pacing, to tracking your progress.
Step 2:
Brush up on
running lingo
— and check out the short list of terms below that we’ll be using in our 10k training program.
Step 3:
Bookmark
this visual reference guide
for all the strength training exercises and stretches we’ll be doing.
Step 4:
Gear up! The only essential equipment you need is a good pair of
running shoes
(and no, they don’t have to cost a fortune!). If your 10k includes
trail running

Running Lingo for Beginners
Strides
(or “striders”) refer to a series of short sprints, usually between 50 and 200 meters.
Easy run.
These light runs are best done at a conversational pace. (That means if you can’t run and recap last night’s episode of “The Bachelor” at the same time, you’re going too fast!)
Recovery run.
Also lovingly referred to as “junk miles,” a recovery run is a short, slow run that takes place within a day after a long, harder run. This teaches your body how to work through a fatigued state.
Interval training.
Here you’ll be alternating specific time periods of specific
high and low intensity
during a run.
Tempo run.
Usually done only once per week, tempo runs are a tougher form of speed training. Runners challenge themselves to hold a “threshold” (or comfortably difficult) pace for a 20-minute period during a run. (Don’t forget a good warmup and cooldown, too).

How the plan works
Info for beginners
Week-by-week
10K training calendar
Discover a 10k running plan that may transform your fitness journey. Whether you’re a beginner or a seasoned runner, our 4-week guide offers expert tips and motivation to help you reach your 10k goals. Start your journey today.
For a lot of folks, the
pandemic
brought running front and center. When
gyms
shut down and we said “see ya later” to
group fitness
, running was an accessible form of exercise with serious
mental health benefits
.
To celebrate the
joys of running
, the slow-but-steady return of race season, and all that we’ve survived over the last year, we put together a kick-ass training plan to help you reach new heights, distances, and milestones —
no matter your fitness level
.
Whether you’re a seasoned
marathoner
, a casual
jogger
, or someone who’s never even run a mile, we’re challenging you to take on a
10K
(say it with us: YES 👏 YOU 👏 CAN 👏). Sign up for an event. Run a virtual race. Grab some friends or hit the road solo — however you decide to hit the pavement, we’re here for you every step of the way.
Ready to dig in? Here’s how to get in amazing 10K shape in just 4 weeks.

How the plan works
Meet your coaches
You deserve the best, so we tapped three running pros to build out this training plan. Consistency is key, so stick to our 4-week schedule and you’ll crush it on race day.
The calendar features 6 days of training, 1 day of rest, but there’s room for customization to make it work for you.
Meet your coaches
Becky Wade.
Becky
is a professional runner, Team USA qualifier, cross country coach, and
author
. She has created a run program that’ll get you from couch to PR in no time.
Ben Lauder-Dykes.
Every run training plan should have a strength and mobility component.
Ben
— a
Fhitting Room instructor
and run coach — has your back with movement drills, supersets, and strength circuits designed to support your runs.
Angie Asche.
If you’re gonna train hard, you need to fuel up.
Angie
is a sports nutritionist (MS, RD, CSSD — all the certs!) and
cookbook author
who works with elite endurance athletes to create meal plans that power performance. Look for her weekly nutrition tips that’ll get you to the finish line.
5 quick steps to start you off
To start this plan, you’ll need to brush up on some basic running lingo, along with essential strength-training movements and stretches. Don’t worry — we’ve gathered everything you need to know!
Step 1:
Our
all-in-one guide
explains how to start running at any level, from form and pacing, to tracking your progress.
Step 2:
Brush up on
running lingo
— and check out the short list of terms below that we’ll be using in our 10k training program.
Step 3:
Bookmark
this visual reference guide
for all the strength training exercises and stretches we’ll be doing.
Step 4:
Gear up! The only essential equipment you need is a good pair of
running shoes
(and no, they don’t have to cost a fortune!). If your 10k includes
trail running
, you’ll want a few extras for hydration and protection against the elements. Training for a winter 10k? You’ll want to invest in some
cold-weather running gear

Step 5:
Load up on

Climbing is a sport that boasts beaucoup benefits for your body and mind. NGL though, it can be a bit intimidating if you’re a beginner.
But don’t worry! We have the inside scoop on everything you need to know before you go. That includes all the deets on trip prep, safety, and of course, gear. Let’s get ready to rock!
First Gear
Climbing kit essentials
Before you set off on a rockin’ adventure, you need to grab the right gear. Here are the essentials:
climbing shoes
helmet
harness
locking carabiner
climbing ropes
chalk and chalk bag
first aid kit
FYI
: Lots of indoor
rock climbing
gyms let you rent essential gear like harnesses, helmets, chalk, and shoes. But you should still call ahead of time to make sure.
Mind these steps before you climb
Pre-climb research is really important before things get rocky. Here’s where to start.
Trip prep and research
Most indoor climbing spots will have staff that can help you gear up. They can also provide support as you get your climb on. Another perk of indoor climbing is that you don’t have to worry about weather conditions.
Prepping for an outdoor climbing trip is another story. Here’s a pre-climb checklist for beginners:
Narrow it down.
Consider the desired duration and intensity of your climb. This can help you pinpoint the right route for you. You should also think about how many people you’re going with and the type of weather you want.
Find a route.
There are tons of online resources to help you find a rad route. Check out online forums or social media groups in your area. A lot of climbing routes are organized by duration and experience level. You can also hit up your local indoor climbing gym and ask if they have any insider info.
Know before you go.
Even expert climbers should never just wing it. Come up with a detailed schedule for your trip. This should include the amount of miles you want to hike, the type of rocks you want to climb, and how many feet of elevation you want to tackle.
Do a final review.
A lot can change in the days before a trip. The night before your climb, review the itinerary, check the weather forecast, and go over your gear. When in doubt, don’t head out.
P.S. Be realistic about your
goals
! Start slow and work your way up to more advanced routes over time.
Weather
Like all outdoor sports, climbing can be weather dependent. So, def check the forecast in advance. Some folks love climbing in the rain. But this prob isn’t best for beginners. Rocks can get slippery, y’all. You should also avoid hella hot or super cold temps.
Dehydration
and
frostbite
are NOT a good time.
Keep in mind, working around the weather can get tricky if you plan a trip several months out. In that case, look up the weather statistics for that area. Then pick a window of dates that will likely have your average weather. While it can still be hit or miss, you
might
have better luck.
Physical condition
You don’t have to be in tip-top shape to enjoy a sweet climbing sesh. But it’s uber important to know your limits. Start with an easy, beginner’s course that you know you’ll likely get through. You should also take the time to do a
warmup
and
stretch
before each climb. Here are some great movement options:
Gorilla Pose
Standing hamstring stretch
Posterior rotator cuff stretch
Squatting leg-out groin stretch
Rotating wrist and forearm stretch
Tabletop Pose with a wrist variation
BTW, don’t forget the
cooldown
!
How to stay safe up there
In general, climbing is super safe if you follow the rules and know your limits. But there are still some risks to keep in mind. Here are some safety dos and don’ts.
Don’t climb alone.
Beginner climbers should never go it alone. Always have at least one buddy with you at all times.
Don’t get too high.
Stick to beginner indoor routes if you’re new to climbing. You can level up once you get some experience points under your belt,
erm
, harness.
Don’t get distracted.
Don’t let the beautiful views distract you. It’s also a good idea to keep the chit-chat at the minimum. Instead, keep your focus on your hand and foot placement and take things one hold at a time.
Do get a climbing guide.
There’s no shame in the guide game! Lots of indoor climbing gyms offer lessons. You can also ask around for a trusted climbing pro that can take you out on an outdoor route. Just make sure they’re legit.
Do always check your gear.
Never climb with rusted, frayed, or damaged gear. Also, you should do routine safety checks throughout your climb. Make sure your knots are secure, and your harness fits comfortably.
Your climbing gear

Can you climb in jeans, a t-shirt, and sneakers? Maybe. Should you? NO. Climbing requires specific shoes, clothing, and equipment. Here’s the 411.
Clothing
You don’t need to deck yourself out for a Mount Everest-style trek. But you should follow these dress code tips for a safe, comfortable climb.
Find your fit.
Avoid super baggy clothes that can get in the way. Also make sure your shorts or pants can easily fit under your climbing harness.
Flexibility.
Don’t wear anything that can constrict your movement. You’ll need a full range of motion so you can fully extend your arms and legs.
Durability.
Rough surfaces and rocks can take their toll on clothes. So, opt for fabrics that won’t snag or rip easily. You can prob wear more standard gym gear for an indoor climbing course.
Dress for the weather.
Climbing in the cold requires extra layers of protection. Polyester blends are great for insulation. They can keep you warm and don’t absorb moisture like cotton. Wool is also a solid choice but can be a bit heavy.
Climbing shoes
The ideal climbing shoes depend on your terrain and skill level. Here are the footwear facts.
Neutral.
These sweet shoes offer a relaxed, comfortable fit. They’re a top choice for beginner climbers and are great for transitioning to hiking trails. Even experienced climbers like them for longer, multipitch climbs. Neutral shoes tend to have thick rubber soles and medium-to-stiff midsoles for solid support. The downside is that the thickness and relaxed fit aren’t ideal for tough overhanging routes.
Moderate.
Moderate climbing shoes have a downturned shape (aka a camber). They also have a slightly sticky rubber sole that’s thinner than neutral shoes. This makes them good for more technical routes and can help you slab routes and longer multipitch climbs. Just keep in mind, they’re not best for super overhang spots or challenging boulder routes.
Aggressive.
Aggressive shoes have a super snug fit and a downturned shape. They’re usually worn for single-pitch sport climbs and challenging indoor routes. The cons? They tend to be a lot less comfortable than neutral or moderate options. The downturned shape is also less flexible and won’t fit into cracks as easily.
P.S. Most climbing shoes are meant to be worn
sans socks. But if you’re renting your shoes, you might want to wear some ultra-thin socks. You can also ask the vendor to spray the shoes with disinfectant before use.
Foot fungus
isn’t fun, fam.
Helmet
A high quality helmet is a must for any climb, even the easy indoor routes. It can protect you from serious head injuries caused by dropped equipment or falling rocks.
Harness
A harness helps secure you to your rope throughout your climb. It connects from the front to back and usually has a padded waist belt with two leg loops. The ideal harness should be snug but not so tight that it cuts off circulation to your lower body.
Locking carabiner
Carabiners connect you to your rope and gear. They come in four main shapes:
Oval.
Oval carabiners are the OG. They’re affordable, versatile, and can hold more gear than D-shape varieties. The downside is that they may not be as strong as other shapes.
D shape.
These are the strongest shape and can hold heavier loads. They have a larger gate opening than oval shaped varieties but tend to be a bit pricier.
Pear shape.
Like systematic D shapes, the pear shape has a large gate opening. This makes it easy to clip knots, gear, and ropes. The main cons are that they’re heavier and (generally) more expensive than other shapes.
Asymmetric D.
These uber-popular carabiners are slightly smaller than the regular D shape. They have a larger gate opening but may not have as much room as other carabiners.
Carabiners also have different gate (opening) types:
Straight.
Straight gates are the standard. They’re strong, durable, and versatile.
Bent.
These are great because they’re durable and can feature a key lock. They’re usually used at the rope end of quickdraws.
Wire.
Wire gates, which are non-locking, are made with a loop of stainless steel wire, which makes for a lightweight carabiner. They can help reduce gate lash and are less likely to freeze in cold temps. One con is that they tend to be less durable than bent or solid gates.
Climbing ropes
Climbing ropes are essential for keeping your climbs safe. The core layer provides the rope’s strength while an outer sheath makes it easier to grip and handle. They come in a huge variety of lengths and diameters. It all comes down to what you need them for.
A climbing rope is divided into two main categories: static and dynamic. Static ropes are used with anchoring systems, which can help haul gear up a wall. They’re also good for rappelling. Dynamic ropes have elasticity, which helps absorb your energy if you put pressure on it.
In general, a 70-meter climbing rope should be long enough for most climbs. But you should always bring extra rope just in case. You never want to run out midclimb.
Chalk and chalk bag
Chalk helps absorb moisture from your hands. This can help stop you from losing your grip or slipping. Most folks carry it as a powder and keep it in a bag. This can be attached to your harness for easy access.
First aid kit
A first aid kit is vital, especially if you’re climbing in the
great outdoors
. You can totes buy a prepackaged first aid kit online or at your local pharmacy. But a DIY pack might be best. That way you know you’ll have everything you need. This includes:
gauze
antiseptic wipes
nonlatex gloves
sterile gauze pads
antibiotic ointment
adhesive cloth tape
absorbent compress dressings
adhesive bandages in assorted sizes
compression wrap (this is great for sprains and strains)
any prescription or over-the-counter (OTC) medication you might need during the trip

Most indoor climbing spots will have staff that can help you gear up. They can also provide support as you get your climb on. Another perk of indoor climbing is that you don’t have to worry about weather conditions.
Prepping for an outdoor climbing trip is another story. Here’s a pre-climb checklist for beginners:
Narrow it down.
Consider the desired duration and intensity of your climb. This can help you pinpoint the right route for you. You should also think about how many people you’re going with and the type of weather you want.
Find a route.
There are tons of online resources to help you find a rad route. Check out online forums or social media groups in your area. A lot of climbing routes are organized by duration and experience level. You can also hit up your local indoor climbing gym and ask if they have any insider info.
Know before you go.
Even expert climbers should never just wing it. Come up with a detailed schedule for your trip. This should include the amount of miles you want to hike, the type of rocks you want to climb, and how many feet of elevation you want to tackle.
Do a final review.
A lot can change in the days before a trip. The night before your climb, review the itinerary, check the weather forecast, and go over your gear. When in doubt, don’t head out.
P.S. Be realistic about your
goals
! Start slow and work your way up to more advanced routes over time.
Weather
Like all outdoor sports, climbing can be weather dependent. So, def check the forecast in advance. Some folks love climbing in the rain. But this prob isn’t best for beginners. Rocks can get slippery, y’all. You should also avoid hella hot or super cold temps.
Dehydration
and
frostbite
are NOT a good time.
Keep in mind, working around the weather can get tricky if you plan a trip several months out. In that case, look up the weather statistics for that area. Then pick a window of dates that will likely have your average weather. While it can still be hit or miss, you
might
have better luck.
Physical condition
You don’t have to be in tip-top shape to enjoy a sweet climbing sesh. But it’s uber important to know your limits. Start with an easy, beginner’s course that you know you’ll likely get through. You should also take the time to do a
warmup
and
stretch
before each climb. Here are some great movement options:
Gorilla Pose
Standing hamstring stretch
Posterior rotator cuff stretch
Squatting leg-out groin stretch
Rotating wrist and forearm stretch
Tabletop Pose with a wrist variation
BTW, don’t forget the
cooldown
!
How to stay safe up there
In general, climbing is super safe if you follow the rules and know your limits. But there are still some risks to keep in mind. Here are some safety dos and don’ts.
Don’t climb alone.
Beginner climbers should never go it alone. Always have at least one buddy with you at all times.
Don’t get too high.
Stick to beginner indoor routes if you’re new to climbing. You can level up once you get some experience points under your belt,
erm
, harness.
Don’t get distracted.
Don’t let the beautiful views distract you. It’s also a good idea to keep the chit-chat at the minimum. Instead, keep your focus on your hand and foot placement and take things one hold at a time.
Do get a climbing guide.
There’s no shame in the guide game! Lots of indoor climbing gyms offer lessons. You can also ask around for a trusted climbing pro that can take you out on an outdoor route. Just make sure they’re legit.
Do always check your gear.
Never climb with rusted, frayed, or damaged gear. Also, you should do routine safety checks throughout your climb. Make sure your knots are secure, and your harness fits comfortably.
Your climbing gear
Share on Pinterest
Illustration by Maya Chastain
Can you climb in jeans, a t-shirt, and sneakers? Maybe. Should you? NO. Climbing requires specific shoes, clothing, and equipment. Here’s the 411.
Clothing
You don’t need to deck yourself out for a Mount Everest-style trek. But you should follow these dress code tips for a safe, comfortable climb.
Find your fit.
Avoid super baggy clothes that can get in the way. Also make sure your shorts or pants can easily fit under your climbing harness.
Flexibility.
Don’t wear anything that can constrict your movement. You’ll need a full range of motion so you can fully extend your arms and legs.
Durability.
Rough surfaces and rocks can take their toll on clothes. So, opt for fabrics that won’t snag or rip easily. You can prob wear more standard gym gear for an indoor climbing course.
Dress for the weather.
Climbing in the cold requires extra layers of protection. Polyester blends are great for insulation. They can keep you warm and don’t absorb moisture like cotton. Wool is also a solid choice but can be a bit heavy.
Climbing shoes
The ideal climbing shoes depend on your terrain and skill level. Here are the footwear facts.
Neutral.
These sweet shoes offer a relaxed, comfortable fit. They’re a top choice for beginner climbers and are great for transitioning to hiking trails. Even experienced climbers like them for longer, multipitch climbs. Neutral shoes tend to have thick rubber soles and medium-to-stiff midsoles for solid support. The downside is that the thickness and relaxed fit aren’t ideal for tough overhanging routes.
Moderate.
Moderate climbing shoes have a downturned shape (aka a camber). They also have a slightly sticky rubber sole that’s thinner than neutral shoes. This makes them good for more technical routes and can help you slab routes and longer multipitch climbs. Just keep in mind, they’re not best for super overhang spots or challenging boulder routes.
Aggressive.
Aggressive shoes have a super snug fit and a downturned shape. They’re usually worn for single-pitch sport climbs and challenging indoor routes. The cons? They tend to be a lot less comfortable than neutral or moderate options. The downturned shape is also less flexible and won’t fit into cracks as easily.
P.S. Most climbing shoes are meant to be worn
sans socks. But if you’re renting your shoes, you might want to wear some ultra-thin socks. You can also ask the vendor to spray the shoes with disinfectant before use.
Foot fungus
isn’t fun, fam.
Helmet
A high quality helmet is a must for any climb, even the easy indoor routes. It can protect you from serious head injuries caused by dropped equipment or falling rocks.
Harness
A harness helps secure you to your rope throughout your climb. It connects from the front to back and usually has a padded waist belt with two leg loops. The ideal harness should be snug but not so tight that it cuts off circulation to your lower body.
Locking carabiner
Carabiners connect you to your rope and gear. They come in four main shapes:
Oval.
Oval carabiners are the OG. They’re affordable, versatile, and can hold more gear than D-shape varieties. The downside is that they may not be as strong as other shapes.
D shape.
These are the strongest shape and can hold heavier loads. They have a larger gate opening than oval shaped varieties but tend to be a bit pricier.
Pear shape.
Like systematic D shapes, the pear shape has a large gate opening. This makes it easy to clip knots, gear, and ropes. The main cons are that they’re heavier and (generally) more expensive than other shapes.
Asymmetric D.
These uber-popular carabiners are slightly smaller than the regular D shape. They have a larger gate opening but may not have as much room as other carabiners.
Carabiners also have different gate (opening) types:
Straight.
Straight gates are the standard. They’re strong, durable, and versatile.
Bent.
These are great because they’re durable and can feature a key lock. They’re usually used at the rope end of quickdraws.
Wire.
Wire gates, which are non-locking, are made with a loop of stainless steel wire, which makes for a lightweight carabiner. They can help reduce gate lash and are less likely to freeze in cold temps. One con is that they tend to be less durable than bent or solid gates.
Climbing ropes
Climbing ropes are essential for keeping your climbs safe. The core layer provides the rope’s strength while an outer sheath makes it easier to grip and handle. They come in a huge variety of lengths and diameters. It all comes down to what you need them for.
A climbing rope is divided into two main categories: static and dynamic. Static ropes are used with anchoring systems, which can help haul gear up a wall. They’re also good for rappelling. Dynamic ropes have elasticity, which helps absorb your energy if you put pressure on it.
In general, a 70-meter climbing rope should be long enough for most climbs. But you should always bring extra rope just in case. You never want to run out midclimb.
Chalk and chalk bag
Chalk helps absorb moisture from your hands. This can help stop you from losing your grip or slipping. Most folks carry it as a powder and keep it in a bag. This can be attached to your harness for easy access.
First aid kit
A first aid kit is vital, especially if you’re climbing in the
great outdoors
. You can totes buy a prepackaged first aid kit online or at your local pharmacy. But a DIY pack might be best. That way you know you’ll have everything you need. This includes:
gauze
antiseptic wipes
nonlatex gloves
sterile gauze pads
antibiotic ointment
adhesive cloth tape
absorbent compress dressings
adhesive bandages in assorted sizes
compression wrap (this is great for sprains and strains)
any prescription or over-the-counter (OTC) medication you might need during the trip

Bottom line
Climbing is a super fun sport that’s great for your body and mind. It can boost confidence, increase strength, and is a darn good time. Just be sure to do your research ahead of time and remember safety protocols. Never climb alone, especially as a beginner. You should also stick to indoor routes only until you’re 10/10 sure you’re up for a bigger challenge outdoors.

11 Unique Moves That Stretch and Massage Hard-to-Reach Muscles *So Good*

Whether or not you’re crushing HIIT workouts as often as you’re tossing back summer beers, stretching and self-myofascial release are
so important
for a body that runs smoothly.
Since most of our days are spent hunched over a computer in our living rooms (or offices, if you’re one of the few that still rock up there), stiff joints and tight muscles are part of the norm. That’s where mobility comes in.
“Mobility is something that will improve your overall fitness goals and daily activities,” says
Daury Dross
, lead instructor at the
Fhitting Room
in NYC.
“I myself have three bulging discs in my back from a car accident and was told I could never again do back-loaded squats,” says Dross. “But incorporating exercises like these into my daily stretching routine changed that and made me feel great again.”
Bonus? Dynamic stretching amps up blood flow and may even help power muscles for better performance.

10.1519/JSC.0b013e31817b0433
We tapped Dross for some unique moves that’ll reach those hard-to-hit (but always sore) muscles. Check them out to limber up.
Upper body and back
Sometimes, it’s about way more than just getting up to stretch your legs.
1. Blackburn
Targets:
Shoulders and lats
Share on Pinterest
Imagine trying to take flight, but horizontally.
Lie facedown with arms at your sides, elevated above your glutes, with palms facing up.
Swing arms toward the top of your head, rotating palms during the movement so they’re facing down at the top.
Return to the starting position. That’s 1 rep. Repeat for 4 sets of 12 reps.
Here are
16 more stretches
that can bring mobility to your shoulders.
2. Origami stretch
Targets:
Chest, shoulders, lower back, and quads
Share on Pinterest
Fold yourself into new shapes to feel a deep stretch.
Start seated with legs extended in front of you.
Cross right leg over left knee, placing left foot on the floor.
Grab hold of right knee, then lean back to lie down, pulling right knee with you (you can drop right shoulder for a deeper stretch).
Bend at knee to grab left ankle and bring it toward your glutes for a quad stretch. Hold for 30 seconds, then repeat on the other side — and voila, that’s 1 set. Do 2 sets.
If you’re into full-body stretches that engage a bunch of different areas, yoga may well be your bag — we rounded up
a few poses
to get you started.
3. Lower back knee drop
Targets:
Lower back
Share on Pinterest
Back stretch’s back, alright?
Start seated with knees bent and heels on the floor in front of you.
Place hands behind you, with palms facing down and fingertips facing your glutes, keeping a slight bend in elbows.
Drop both knees to the left, stacking them at the bottom of the movement.
Hold for 30 seconds, then repeat on the other side. That’s 1 set. Do 2 sets.
Need more lower-back stretches?
We’ve got your back.
4. Piriformis massage
Targets:
Piriformis
Share on Pinterest
The piriformis is a small muscle located deep behind your glutes that connects your lower spine to your femur, functioning at your hip. It’s a hard spot to reach — but this massage may help.
Start seated with legs extended in front of you.
Using right hand, pull left knee up toward chest and cradle it in your right arm like a baby (there, there). Your shin should be parallel to the floor.
Stretch left arm straight out to the left and rest fingertips on the floor as you gently lean back and to the left, putting weight onto the upper/outer portion of your glutes.
Roll around in a circular motion here until you feel pressure on your piriformis. If you’re tight, you’ll know it when you feel it!
Once you find your piriformis, roll around on it for 30 seconds, then repeat on the other side to complete 1 set. Do 2 sets.
Not sure how flexible you are? Here’s
how to work it out
.
Lower body and hips
For when it’s pain-in-different-bits-of-your-leg day.
5. Calf massage
Targets:
Calves (duh!)
Share on Pinterest
Forget the typical lean-against-a-wall calf stretch: That’s old moos. The next time your calves are screaming, try this instead.
Start in tabletop position, with wrists under shoulders and knees under hips.
Place left knee on top of right calf.
Gently press knee into calf muscle and make small circles to massage, starting clockwise. Then switch directions.
Repeat these steps for 3 sets of 30 seconds on each leg.
Here are
the best ways
not to skip leg day at home.
6. Dynamic side lunge
Targets:
Hips and hamstrings
Share on Pinterest
Tight hamstrings are no fun at all. Loosen them up with this deft maneuver.
Start in a wide stance with toes angled outward.
Send hips back and shift all your weight to the right side, lowering into a side lunge. Allow left toes to come off the floor and point up.
Push through right heel and shift your weight to the left, then repeat on the opposite side for 1 rep.
Repeat this for 30 seconds of continuous movement — that’s 1 set. Do 3 sets.
Get to know lunges.
They’re a beast, but they can really boost your fitness game.
7. Cross-leg stretch
Targets:
Hip flexors and inner thighs
Share on Pinterest
It may look a little funny, but it works.
Start lying faceup.
Draw knees to chest, then cross one leg over the other while simultaneously grabbing your ankles with opposite hands.
Pull both legs toward chest and out again until you feel the stretch in your hips and legs.
Hold the position for 30 seconds for 1 set. Do 3 sets.
8. Frog stretch
Targets:
Hips
Share on Pinterest
If you’ve got tight hips, this one can be a killer — in a good way.
Start on all fours on a cushioned surface, like a yoga mat, rug, or grass, with wrists under shoulders and knees under hips.
Spread knees wider than hip width, turning toes out. Slowly send hips back between your feet to feel a stretch deep in your hips.
If it’s too intense, support more of your body weight with hands and upper body and ease back slowly until you gain more flexibility.
Hold for 30 seconds for 1 set. Do 3 sets.
You might be feeling hip pain (and no, they don’t lie). We rounded up
14 ways
to stretch them out and strengthen them.
9. Hamstring sit-back
Targets:
Hamstrings, calves, and hips
Share on Pinterest
Yes, this is a “sit-back,” but without the “and relax” attached.
Start on all fours, with wrists under shoulders and knees under hips.
Extend left leg straight out to the left, with toes pointing up.
Send hips back to your right heel, shifting all your weight to the right side. You should feel a stretch along the back of left leg.
Hold for 30 seconds, then repeat the whole shebang on the other side to complete 1 set. Do 2 sets.
If you’re a gym bunny, avoid
these four machines
, including the seated hamstring curl.
10. Hip opener
Targets:
Hips
Share on Pinterest
Loose lips sink ships, but loose hips mean you can saunter down the road feeling great. We know which one we prefer.
Start in a high plank position, with wrists under shoulders and core tight.
Bring left foot to the outside of left hand, then weave hand around the back of foot, placing it on the left side (this helps you go deeper than a traditional hip-opening stretch).
Lean into your left hip by shifting your weight to the left while keeping right foot in place.
Hold for 30 seconds, then repeat on the other side. That’s 1 set. Do 2 sets.
We rounded up
11 more ways
to keep those hips nice and open.
11. Wide-step hamstring stretch
Targets:
Hamstrings
Share on Pinterest
Like your usual hamstring stretch but with a twist — quite literally.
Stand with feet slightly wider than hip width.
Cross right foot over to the left as far as possible (there should be a gap between your feet).
Hinge at hips to bend over and reach for right toes.
Lower as far as possible. If you have the flexibility to keep your legs straight, do so — that will maximize the stretch.
Hold for 30 seconds, then repeat on the other side to complete 1 set. Do 2 sets.
A hamstring stretch can also help you with runner’s knee — learn more about runner’s knee

Takeaway
You can try these
stretches
anywhere. For improved mobility and flexibility, or even just to get rid of that soreness that can come from sitting at a desk all day, these will have you covered.

Hold for 30 seconds, then repeat on the other side. That’s 1 set. Do 2 sets.
Need more lower-back stretches?
We’ve got your back.
4. Piriformis massage
Targets:
Piriformis
Share on Pinterest
The piriformis is a small muscle located deep behind your glutes that connects your lower spine to your femur, functioning at your hip. It’s a hard spot to reach — but this massage may help.
Start seated with legs extended in front of you.
Using right hand, pull left knee up toward chest and cradle it in your right arm like a baby (there, there). Your shin should be parallel to the floor.
Stretch left arm straight out to the left and rest fingertips on the floor as you gently lean back and to the left, putting weight onto the upper/outer portion of your glutes.
Roll around in a circular motion here until you feel pressure on your piriformis. If you’re tight, you’ll know it when you feel it!
Once you find your piriformis, roll around on it for 30 seconds, then repeat on the other side to complete 1 set. Do 2 sets.
Not sure how flexible you are? Here’s
how to work it out
.
Lower body and hips
For when it’s pain-in-different-bits-of-your-leg day.
5. Calf massage
Targets:
Calves (duh!)
Share on Pinterest
Forget the typical lean-against-a-wall calf stretch: That’s old moos. The next time your calves are screaming, try this instead.
Start in tabletop position, with wrists under shoulders and knees under hips.
Place left knee on top of right calf.
Gently press knee into calf muscle and make small circles to massage, starting clockwise. Then switch directions.
Repeat these steps for 3 sets of 30 seconds on each leg.
Here are
the best ways
not to skip leg day at home.
6. Dynamic side lunge
Targets:
Hips and hamstrings
Share on Pinterest
Tight hamstrings are no fun at all. Loosen them up with this deft maneuver.
Start in a wide stance with toes angled outward.
Send hips back and shift all your weight to the right side, lowering into a side lunge. Allow left toes to come off the floor and point up.
Push through right heel and shift your weight to the left, then repeat on the opposite side for 1 rep.
Repeat this for 30 seconds of continuous movement — that’s 1 set. Do 3 sets.
Get to know lunges.
They’re a beast, but they can really boost your fitness game.
7. Cross-leg stretch
Targets:
Hip flexors and inner thighs
Share on Pinterest
It may look a little funny, but it works.
Start lying faceup.
Draw knees to chest, then cross one leg over the other while simultaneously grabbing your ankles with opposite hands.
Pull both legs toward chest and out again until you feel the stretch in your hips and legs.
Hold the position for 30 seconds for 1 set. Do 3 sets.
8. Frog stretch
Targets:
Hips
Share on Pinterest
If you’ve got tight hips, this one can be a killer — in a good way.
Start on all fours on a cushioned surface, like a yoga mat, rug, or grass, with wrists under shoulders and knees under hips.
Spread knees wider than hip width, turning toes out. Slowly send hips back between your feet to feel a stretch deep in your hips.
If it’s too intense, support more of your body weight with hands and upper body and ease back slowly until you gain more flexibility.
Hold for 30 seconds for 1 set. Do 3 sets.
You might be feeling hip pain (and no, they don’t lie). We rounded up
14 ways
to stretch them out and strengthen them.
9. Hamstring sit-back
Targets:
Hamstrings, calves, and hips
Share on Pinterest
Yes, this is a “sit-back,” but without the “and relax” attached.
Start on all fours, with wrists under shoulders and knees under hips.
Extend left leg straight out to the left, with toes pointing up.
Send hips back to your right heel, shifting all your weight to the right side. You should feel a stretch along the back of left leg.
Hold for 30 seconds, then repeat the whole shebang on the other side to complete 1 set. Do 2 sets.
If you’re a gym bunny, avoid
these four machines
, including the seated hamstring curl.
10. Hip opener
Targets:
Hips
Share on Pinterest
Loose lips sink ships, but loose hips mean you can saunter down the road feeling great. We know which one we prefer.
Start in a high plank position, with wrists under shoulders and core tight.
Bring left foot to the outside of left hand, then weave hand around the back of foot, placing it on the left side (this helps you go deeper than a traditional hip-opening stretch).
Lean into your left hip by shifting your weight to the left while keeping right foot in place.
Hold for 30 seconds, then repeat on the other side. That’s 1 set. Do 2 sets.
We rounded up
11 more ways
to keep those hips nice and open.
11. Wide-step hamstring stretch
Targets:
Hamstrings
Share on Pinterest
Like your usual hamstring stretch but with a twist — quite literally.
Stand with feet slightly wider than hip width.
Cross right foot over to the left as far as possible (there should be a gap between your feet).
Hinge at hips to bend over and reach for right toes.
Lower as far as possible. If you have the flexibility to keep your legs straight, do so — that will maximize the stretch.
Hold for 30 seconds, then repeat on the other side to complete 1 set. Do 2 sets.
A hamstring stretch can also help you with runner’s knee — learn more about runner’s knee

11 Unique Moves That Stretch and Massage Hard-to-Reach Muscles *So Good*

Upper body and back
Lower body and hips
tl;dr
Share on Pinterest
Whether or not you’re crushing HIIT workouts as often as you’re tossing back summer beers, stretching and self-myofascial release are
so important
for a body that runs smoothly.
Since most of our days are spent hunched over a computer in our living rooms (or offices, if you’re one of the few that still rock up there), stiff joints and tight muscles are part of the norm. That’s where mobility comes in.
“Mobility is something that will improve your overall fitness goals and daily activities,” says
Daury Dross
, lead instructor at the
Fhitting Room
in NYC.
“I myself have three bulging discs in my back from a car accident and was told I could never again do back-loaded squats,” says Dross. “But incorporating exercises like these into my daily stretching routine changed that and made me feel great again.”
Bonus? Dynamic stretching amps up blood flow and may even help power muscles for better performance.

We tapped Dross for some unique moves that’ll reach those hard-to-hit (but always sore) muscles. Check them out to limber up.
Upper body and back
Sometimes, it’s about way more than just getting up to stretch your legs.
1. Blackburn
Targets:
Shoulders and lats
Share on Pinterest
Imagine trying to take flight, but horizontally.
Lie facedown with arms at your sides, elevated above your glutes, with palms facing up.
Swing arms toward the top of your head, rotating palms during the movement so they’re facing down at the top.
Return to the starting position. That’s 1 rep. Repeat for 4 sets of 12 reps.
Here are
16 more stretches
that can bring mobility to your shoulders.
2. Origami stretch
Targets:
Chest, shoulders, lower back, and quads
Share on Pinterest
Fold yourself into new shapes to feel a deep stretch.
Start seated with legs extended in front of you.
Cross right leg over left knee, placing left foot on the floor.
Grab hold of right knee, then lean back to lie down, pulling right knee with you (you can drop right shoulder for a deeper stretch).
Bend at knee to grab left ankle and bring it toward your glutes for a quad stretch. Hold for 30 seconds, then repeat on the other side — and voila, that’s 1 set. Do 2 sets.
If you’re into full-body stretches that engage a bunch of different areas, yoga may well be your bag — we rounded up
a few poses
to get you started.
3. Lower back knee drop
Targets:
Lower back
Share on Pinterest
Back stretch’s back, alright?
Start seated with knees bent and heels on the floor in front of you.
Place hands behind you, with palms facing down and fingertips facing your glutes, keeping a slight bend in elbows.
Drop both knees to the left, stacking them at the bottom of the movement.
Hold for 30 seconds, then repeat on the other side. That’s 1 set. Do 2 sets.

What’s the Perfect Warmup? 5 Moves to Set You Up for Success

Warmup benefits
Action plan
tl;dr
We get it: Stretches are boring — but that’s no reason to skip them! Whether your fitness plan involves a weekly
bodyweight routine
in the park or
daily run
, you should always start with a warmup (or a
pre-workout
, if that’s your style!). Even humdrum warmup moves can set you up for major workout #gainz.
Keep scrolling for the deets on the benefits of warmups, suggested moves, and an action plan for your ideal warmup routine.

What makes an ideal warmup routine?
Loosening up
Getting your
blood pumping
Dynamic stretching
Tuning in
to your body
Prepping your body for action
What exactly is the point of a warmup?
When it comes to
strength training
and
sports conditioning
, coaches often think of warmups as performance preparation. They’re not wrong, but it’s also important to warm up your muscles for noncompetitive workouts like
spinning
and
yoga
.
Science
says warmup can benefit *every* body in several ways:
raising your temperature for
pliability
loosening
stiff muscles
and joints
priming your body for optimum performance
Plus, older
research
from the early 2000s (RIP iPods) found that warmups also help
prevent injury
.
A more recent
study
of 13 college athletes suggests that warmups might offer more psychological than physical benefits. Of course, a study of 13 humans is a *super* tiny study, so more research is necessary to prove this. But it makes sense that a blend of muscle loosening, blood flow, and psychological prep all contribute to better overall performance.
Your warmup action plan
Warmups can differ depending on your fitness level and goals. Build your ideal warmup routine by focusing on these five key elements.
1. Loosen those muscles
Think of your body as a car. It’s much easier to get to 60 miles per hour *gradually* instead of straight out of the garage. Turning on your car, reversing out of your spot, and cruising down the block helps get things warmed up and moving (especially in winter, amiright?).
Your warmup should be designed to loosen the muscles you’ll use during your workout. Warm ’em up and get ’em going, but
don’t
push them to the point of fatigue (the main event is later, remember?).
Here are a few fun ways to warm and loosen your muscles before your workout:
foam rolling
torso twists
a quick
massage gun
session
2. Get your heart pumping
Research
published in 2010 found that pumping up your heart rate helps warm your muscles and improves performance. The
American Heart Association
also reports that a heart-thumping warmup dilates your blood vessels to keep your muscles supplied with plenty of oxygen.
A few ideas:
5 to 10 minutes of
brisk walking
easy, breezy
jogging
spinning or
biking
on a low gear
3. Incorporate dynamic stretching
Muscles warmed? Heart pumping? Check, check! Now it’s time for active stretching.
Active stretching
— sometimes called dynamic stretching — is all the rage for a reason.
Experts
say that if some of your workout goals are more muscle power or better range of motion, you need to
*move*
through the stretch instead of holding it.
As you try these common stretches, remember to continuously move through the range of motion instead of holding your body in place:
walking lunges
toe touches
high knees
Feelin’ nostalgic for the static stretches of high school gym class? (We’re looking at you, one-legged
quad stretch
!) Save those for a post-workout cool down.
4. Tune in to your body
Remember how the study of college athletes suggested that a warmup is just as important for your mind as your body?
Mindless walking lunges will heat up your
butt
and quads, but checking in with your body (Are there tender spots? Is one leg stiffer than the other?) will help you take your warmup to the next level.
A recent
study
even suggests that both
meditation
and exercise can improve the way you adapt to stressors. What if
combining
them could turbocharge your
mental focus
and stamina?
5. Prep your bod for movement
Have you ever visualized a tough conversation with your boss before actually confronting them? Or motivated yourself to push through a run by imagining the finish line?
A 2016
study
found that pairing positive mental images with
physical training
can improve athletic prowess. So think of your ideal warmup as getting your head in the game. You can mentally
plan out your workout
or even slowly move through the day’s workout at a lower intensity.
We need more research to understand the intricacies of how a mental warmup affects physical stamina. But if high level athletes can benefit from visualization before a big competition, why can’t you?
The bottom line
Warming up before your workouts can help prime your muscles, improve performance, prevent injury, and boost motivation. Your warmup should include dynamic stretching and enough movement to get your heart pumping.
An ideal warmup routine will prep you for your workout, not exhaust you. Plan accordingly, and don’t forget to
cool down
after the main event!

Action plan
tl;dr
We get it: Stretches are boring — but that’s no reason to skip them! Whether your fitness plan involves a weekly
bodyweight routine
in the park or
daily run
, you should always start with a warmup (or a
pre-workout
, if that’s your style!). Even humdrum warmup moves can set you up for major workout #gainz.
Keep scrolling for the deets on the benefits of warmups, suggested moves, and an action plan for your ideal warmup routine.

What makes an ideal warmup routine?
Loosening up
Getting your
blood pumping
Dynamic stretching
Tuning in
to your body
Prepping your body for action
What exactly is the point of a warmup?
When it comes to
strength training
and
sports conditioning
, coaches often think of warmups as performance preparation. They’re not wrong, but it’s also important to warm up your muscles for noncompetitive workouts like
spinning
and
yoga
.
Science
says warmup can benefit *every* body in several ways:
raising your temperature for
pliability
loosening
stiff muscles
and joints
priming your body for optimum performance
Plus, older
research
from the early 2000s (RIP iPods) found that warmups also help
prevent injury
.
A more recent
study
of 13 college athletes suggests that warmups might offer more psychological than physical benefits. Of course, a study of 13 humans is a *super* tiny study, so more research is necessary to prove this. But it makes sense that a blend of muscle loosening, blood flow, and psychological prep all contribute to better overall performance.
Your warmup action plan
Warmups can differ depending on your fitness level and goals. Build your ideal warmup routine by focusing on these five key elements.
1. Loosen those muscles
Think of your body as a car. It’s much easier to get to 60 miles per hour *gradually* instead of straight out of the garage. Turning on your car, reversing out of your spot, and cruising down the block helps get things warmed up and moving (especially in winter, amiright?).
Your warmup should be designed to loosen the muscles you’ll use during your workout. Warm ’em up and get ’em going, but
don’t
push them to the point of fatigue (the main event is later, remember?).
Here are a few fun ways to warm and loosen your muscles before your workout:
foam rolling
torso twists
a quick
massage gun
session
2. Get your heart pumping
Research
published in 2010 found that pumping up your heart rate helps warm your muscles and improves performance. The
American Heart Association
also reports that a heart-thumping warmup dilates your blood vessels to keep your muscles supplied with plenty of oxygen.
A few ideas:
5 to 10 minutes of
brisk walking
easy, breezy
jogging
spinning or
biking
on a low gear
3. Incorporate dynamic stretching
Muscles warmed? Heart pumping? Check, check! Now it’s time for active stretching.
Active stretching
— sometimes called dynamic stretching — is all the rage for a reason.
Experts
say that if some of your workout goals are more muscle power or better range of motion, you need to
*move*
through the stretch instead of holding it.
As you try these common stretches, remember to continuously move through the range of motion instead of holding your body in place:
walking lunges
toe touches
high knees
Feelin’ nostalgic for the static stretches of high school gym class? (We’re looking at you, one-legged
quad stretch
!) Save those for a post-workout cool down.
4. Tune in to your body
Remember how the study of college athletes suggested that a warmup is just as important for your mind as your body?
Mindless walking lunges will heat up your
butt
and quads, but checking in with your body (Are there tender spots? Is one leg stiffer than the other?) will help you take your warmup to the next level.
A recent
study
even suggests that both
meditation
and exercise can improve the way you adapt to stressors. What if
combining
them could turbocharge your
mental focus
and stamina?
5. Prep your bod for movement
Have you ever visualized a tough conversation with your boss before actually confronting them? Or motivated yourself to push through a run by imagining the finish line?
A 2016
study
found that pairing positive mental images with
physical training
can improve athletic prowess. So think of your ideal warmup as getting your head in the game. You can mentally
plan out your workout
or even slowly move through the day’s workout at a lower intensity.
We need more research to understand the intricacies of how a mental warmup affects physical stamina. But if high level athletes can benefit from visualization before a big competition, why can’t you?
The bottom line
Warming up before your workouts can help prime your muscles, improve performance, prevent injury, and boost motivation. Your warmup should include dynamic stretching and enough movement to get your heart pumping.
An ideal warmup routine will prep you for your workout, not exhaust you. Plan accordingly, and don’t forget to
cool down
after the main event!

6 Reasons to Bust Out Your Foam Roller RN

How to foam roll
Bottom line
Foam rollers are having a moment. These handy stretch-sesh buddies from the ’80s now come in a variety of colors, types, and sizes. And in a world of fitness apps and gym gizmos, it’s sort of refreshing to use such a simple device.

What is foam rolling?
Exactly what you think it is: You grab a little foam log and roll on it to relieve muscle tightness, inflammation, and post-workout soreness. Used consistently, your foam roller can also
increase
your joints’ range of motion.
Foam rolling
is a kind of
myofascial release
, a massage style that involves applying sustained pressure to sore or tight muscles. Fans say it’s great for both workout warmups and cooldowns.
Foam rollers are light and small enough to keep handy in a car or backpack for outdoor hiking or biking adventures too.
Scroll on for the six ways foam rolling could be making your day better.
1. Calms sore muscles
Feeling a little tender after leg day? Break out the foam roller!
A
small 2015 study
on young male athletes found that 20 minutes of foam rolling immediately after exercise (and then once a day for 2 days) resulted in significantly less post-workout muscle soreness than workouts without foam rolling.
And
a recent study
of 80 young adult men found that foam rolling after a workout soothed their muscles and helped them recover joint stability quickly.
More research is needed on how foam rolling affects women, older folks, and less active people. But for now, we can confidently say foam rolling
probably
has muscle-calming powers for all.
2. Improves flexibility
Devotees say their foam rollers boost their range of motion. Science says more evidence is needed.
Still, one teensy
2015 study
of 11 teen boys found that a routine of foam rolling *plus* static stretching increased their range of motion more than stretching or foam rolling alone.
Obvs, we need more research on how foam rolling affects different types of bodies. 🤷 But if you’re hoping to feel a little looser, there’s no harm in incorporating foam rolling into your pre- and post-workout stretch routines.
3. Smoothes your skin and (possibly) cellulite
Some folks claim their foam rollers massage away
cellulite
, but there’s no proof (womp womp).
So, what’s going on? Generally speaking, cellulite happens when fat collects between surface-level fascia and collagen fibers. And your roller does
massage
your body’s
fascia
(the net of connective tissues that hold your muscles together).
Just like
dry brushing
, foam rolling can *temporarily* increase circulation so your skin looks plumper and smoother, but it prob won’t banish cellulite.
4. Reduces tension and back pain
A
small 2014 study
suggests that self-myofascial release (foam rolling) can ease tension to help you reach peak performance during your workout.
It makes sense that relaxing your muscles and joints could also relieve tension-related back pain. But this study included only 11 participants, and more research is needed.
Be careful, though:
Back pain
is no joke. You’ll want to roll with proper form so you don’t make things worse.
To avoid straining your lower back, try flipping your foam roller so it’s parallel with your spine. Roll slowly from side to side to work out the knots in your lower back and shoulder blades until the tension melts away.
5. Relieves fibromyalgia pain
Anyone with
fibromyalgia
knows fibro symptoms can interfere with the simplest of daily activities. From fatigue to stiffness and pain, the reminders of the disease are constant.
One
small study
of 66 folks with fibromyalgia found that those who used a foam roller on the reg for 20 weeks or more seem to have less:
stiffness
exhaustion
pain
depression
There haven’t been many scientific trials on how foam rolling affects people with fibromyalgia, but the preliminary research is promising.
6. Helps you chill TF out
Tension headaches, achy backs, jelly legs — tight muscles make us cranky AF.
Foam rolling fans say the activity helps them relax, which makes sense. It’s a form of self-massage, after all.
But research linking foam rolling with relaxation *is* pretty limited. One
small study
concluded that foam rolling reduces stress hormones only slightly more than just resting on your back.
How safe is foam rolling, really?
Pretty safe! If you’re moving your muscles regularly, it’s probably also OK to put some massaging pressure on them.
Here’s when to avoid foam rolling:
if you have a muscle tear
if you have a broken bone
if you’re in your third tri of pregnancy
If you have any kind of serious injury, it’s best to talk to your doctor before busting out your foam roller.
And if you’re preggo, there’s a slight chance that leg massages could cause premature labor or
dislodge a life threatening blood clot
. This situation is rare, but we still recommend getting cleared by your doc before using a foam roller.
Safety tips
Use gentle pressure if you’re new to foam rolling.
Avoid rolling over your joints — knees, elbows, and ankles.
Use the foam roller on your legs in sections — for instance, quads first, then calves. This keeps you from rolling over the backs of your knees.
So, which foam roller is the *best*?
The answer depends on your workout goals and personal preferences.
Some foam rollers are soft, and some are firm. Some foam rollers are textured, while some are smooth. Here’s the breakdown of the pros and cons of each kind.
The deets
Yeah!
👍
Nah 👎
Soft rollers
The OG foam roller.
Soft foam rollers
are smooth and durable without being rock-hard.
So perfect for self-myofascial release newbies. They’re also the most affordable of the bunch.
If you’ve got uber-tight quads or hammies, a soft foam roller might not give you the deep massage you crave.
Hard rollers
Hard foam rollers
= a hard plastic core wrapped in soft foam. Ahhh…
Planning to use your foam roller daily? These will hold up longer than soft rollers. You can also apply more pressure.
Sensitive areas? Ouch! Hard rollers don’t mess around.
Textured rollers
Say hello to ridges, bumps, and knobs.
The grooves let you vary your pressure for optimum circulation and trigger point release potential.
More pressure isn’t always better. Proceed with caution to avoid bruises.
Massage sticks
These are handheld sticks covered in foam.
Small and packable, these’ll help you give your legs or upper back a deep massage on the go.
Massage sticks are hella awkward for leg massages. If you need the full-body treatment, go with a roller.
Massage balls
Massage balls are often covered in foam or rubber nubs.
Compact and cheap, massage balls are great for working out shoulder knots at your desk.
They’re too small for a full-body myofascial release sesh.
Vibrating rollers
Why, yes, there are foam rollers that vibrate. Enjoy!
Promoters say the vibration encourages total tension release in your muscles and tissues.
Necessary? Nope. Expensive? Yep.
Your first foam roller might not be your fave foam roller. Sometimes it takes a few tries, so you might want to try them out at the gym or in a store before dishing out a chunk of change.
How to foam roll like a pro
Are you ready for this?
4 steps to the perfect foam roll
Sit on the floor with your legs out in front of you.
Position one area of your body on top of the roller. It’s easy to start with your calves, for instance. To adjust the pressure, prop yourself up so you’re putting less weight on the roller.
Using light pressure, slowly roll sore areas for 10 seconds. (Unlock pro status by eventually working up to a full minute!)
Chug lots of H
2
O after rolling. This helps with muscle recovery.
Still feeling unsure? Chat with a physical therapist or trainer at the gym for step-by-step instructions.
Let’s sum it up
Foam rollers can be super helpful for pre- or post-workout muscle tension.
They’re also great for working out aches and pains from sitting for too long or sleeping in the wrong position.
Using a foam roller can also improve your range of motion.
Though some folks claim their foam rollers reduce cellulite or overall stress, there’s little scientific proof of those benefits.
If you’ve had a major injury or are pregnant, talk to your doc before adding a foam roller to your daily routine.

How to foam roll
Bottom line
Foam rollers are having a moment. These handy stretch-sesh buddies from the ’80s now come in a variety of colors, types, and sizes. And in a world of fitness apps and gym gizmos, it’s sort of refreshing to use such a simple device.

What is foam rolling?
Exactly what you think it is: You grab a little foam log and roll on it to relieve muscle tightness, inflammation, and post-workout soreness. Used consistently, your foam roller can also
increase
your joints’ range of motion.
Foam rolling
is a kind of
myofascial release
, a massage style that involves applying sustained pressure to sore or tight muscles. Fans say it’s great for both workout warmups and cooldowns.
Foam rollers are light and small enough to keep handy in a car or backpack for outdoor hiking or biking adventures too.
Scroll on for the six ways foam rolling could be making your day better.
1. Calms sore muscles
Feeling a little tender after leg day? Break out the foam roller!
A
small 2015 study
on young male athletes found that 20 minutes of foam rolling immediately after exercise (and then once a day for 2 days) resulted in significantly less post-workout muscle soreness than workouts without foam rolling.
And
a recent study
of 80 young adult men found that foam rolling after a workout soothed their muscles and helped them recover joint stability quickly.
More research is needed on how foam rolling affects women, older folks, and less active people. But for now, we can confidently say foam rolling
probably
has muscle-calming powers for all.
2. Improves flexibility
Devotees say their foam rollers boost their range of motion. Science says more evidence is needed.
Still, one teensy
2015 study
of 11 teen boys found that a routine of foam rolling *plus* static stretching increased their range of motion more than stretching or foam rolling alone.

, foam rolling can *temporarily* increase circulation so your skin looks plumper and smoother, but it prob won’t banish cellulite.
4. Reduces tension and back pain
A
small 2014 study
suggests that self-myofascial release (foam rolling) can ease tension to help you reach peak performance during your workout.
It makes sense that relaxing your muscles and joints could also relieve tension-related back pain. But this study included only 11 participants, and more research is needed.
Be careful, though:
Back pain
is no joke. You’ll want to roll with proper form so you don’t make things worse.
To avoid straining your lower back, try flipping your foam roller so it’s parallel with your spine. Roll slowly from side to side to work out the knots in your lower back and shoulder blades until the tension melts away.
5. Relieves fibromyalgia pain
Anyone with
fibromyalgia
knows fibro symptoms can interfere with the simplest of daily activities. From fatigue to stiffness and pain, the reminders of the disease are constant.
One
small study
of 66 folks with fibromyalgia found that those who used a foam roller on the reg for 20 weeks or more seem to have less:
stiffness
exhaustion
pain
depression
There haven’t been many scientific trials on how foam rolling affects people with fibromyalgia, but the preliminary research is promising.
6. Helps you chill TF out
Tension headaches, achy backs, jelly legs — tight muscles make us cranky AF.
Foam rolling fans say the activity helps them relax, which makes sense. It’s a form of self-massage, after all.
But research linking foam rolling with relaxation *is* pretty limited. One
small study
concluded that foam rolling reduces stress hormones only slightly more than just resting on your back.
How safe is foam rolling, really?
Pretty safe! If you’re moving your muscles regularly, it’s probably also OK to put some massaging pressure on them.
Here’s when to avoid foam rolling:
if you have a muscle tear
if you have a broken bone
if you’re in your third tri of pregnancy
If you have any kind of serious injury, it’s best to talk to your doctor before busting out your foam roller.
And if you’re preggo, there’s a slight chance that leg massages could cause premature labor or
dislodge a life threatening blood clot
. This situation is rare, but we still recommend getting cleared by your doc before using a foam roller.
Safety tips
Use gentle pressure if you’re new to foam rolling.
Avoid rolling over your joints — knees, elbows, and ankles.
Use the foam roller on your legs in sections — for instance, quads first, then calves. This keeps you from rolling over the backs of your knees.
So, which foam roller is the *best*?
The answer depends on your workout goals and personal preferences.
Some foam rollers are soft, and some are firm. Some foam rollers are textured, while some are smooth. Here’s the breakdown of the pros and cons of each kind.
The deets
Yeah!
👍
Nah 👎
Soft rollers
The OG foam roller.
Soft foam rollers
are smooth and durable without being rock-hard.
So perfect for self-myofascial release newbies. They’re also the most affordable of the bunch.
If you’ve got uber-tight quads or hammies, a soft foam roller might not give you the deep massage you crave.
Hard rollers
Hard foam rollers
= a hard plastic core wrapped in soft foam. Ahhh…
Planning to use your foam roller daily? These will hold up longer than soft rollers. You can also apply more pressure.
Sensitive areas? Ouch! Hard rollers don’t mess around.
Textured rollers
Say hello to ridges, bumps, and knobs.
The grooves let you vary your pressure for optimum circulation and trigger point release potential.
More pressure isn’t always better. Proceed with caution to avoid bruises.
Massage sticks
These are handheld sticks covered in foam.
Small and packable, these’ll help you give your legs or upper back a deep massage on the go.
Massage sticks are hella awkward for leg massages. If you need the full-body treatment, go with a roller.
Massage balls
Massage balls are often covered in foam or rubber nubs.
Compact and cheap, massage balls are great for working out shoulder knots at your desk.
They’re too small for a full-body myofascial release sesh.
Vibrating rollers
Why, yes, there are foam rollers that vibrate. Enjoy!
Promoters say the vibration encourages total tension release in your muscles and tissues.
Necessary? Nope. Expensive? Yep.
Your first foam roller might not be your fave foam roller. Sometimes it takes a few tries, so you might want to try them out at the gym or in a store before dishing out a chunk of change.
How to foam roll like a pro
Are you ready for this?
4 steps to the perfect foam roll
Sit on the floor with your legs out in front of you.
Position one area of your body on top of the roller. It’s easy to start with your calves, for instance. To adjust the pressure, prop yourself up so you’re putting less weight on the roller.
Using light pressure, slowly roll sore areas for 10 seconds. (Unlock pro status by eventually working up to a full minute!)
Chug lots of H
2
O after rolling. This helps with muscle recovery.
Still feeling unsure? Chat with a physical therapist or trainer at the gym for step-by-step instructions.
Let’s sum it up
Foam rollers can be super helpful for pre- or post-workout muscle tension.
They’re also great for working out aches and pains from sitting for too long or sleeping in the wrong position.
Using a foam roller can also improve your range of motion.
Though some folks claim their foam rollers reduce cellulite or overall stress, there’s little scientific proof of those benefits.
If you’ve had a major injury or are pregnant, talk to your doc before adding a foam roller to your daily routine.

Gif by Dima Bazak.
Mooove over, stiff muscles. This classic
yoga pose
will relieve tension in your spine, abs, and back. Here’s how to do it:
Start on all fours in a tabletop position with your spine straight and shoulders over your wrists. Relax your shoulders from your ears and look straight at the floor.
Curl your toes under, tilt your pelvis back, and gaze gently upward to move into Cow.
Release the tops of your feet to the floor as you tuck your tailbone under. Round your spine like a feline to flow into Cat.
Draw your belly button toward your spine. Drop your head and look toward your tummy.
Move back into Cow and repeat 5 times.
2. Seated side stretch
Share on Pinterest
Gif by Dima Bazak.
Here’s a simple way to open up your chest and
shoulders
while stretching out your neck,
arms
, torso, and
hips
.
While sitting, reach for the sky with your left arm.
Place your right hand next to your right hip on the floor. Gently lean toward your right hand, pulling your left arm over your head as you bend your right elbow. Your torso should slightly bend with you.
Hold the
stretch
for 5 deep breaths.

Pro tip
: You can also do this stretch standing.
3. Standing Forward Bend
Share on Pinterest
Gif by Dima Bazak.
Time to stretch out your spine,
glutes
, hams, quads while you basically give yourself a hug — ‘cause you deserve some love. ❣️
Stand with feet hip-width apart.
Hinge at your hips, keeping your torso long and lifted.
Keep your legs straight (slightly bent knees are OK to reduce strain) and let your hands fall wherever it’s comfy. This could be your shins, ankles, feet, or floor. You can also hold opposite elbows.
Root your feet to the ground and let your head hang as you relax here for 5 breaths.
Release your arms and slowly rise back up using the strength of your core and glutes.
4. Tricep stretch
Share on Pinterest
Gif by Dima Bazak.
Get your arms ready for the day. This one will
stretch
out your triceps and shoulders.
While standing with your feet shoulder-width apart, extend your right arm across your body.

5. Standing quad stretch
Share on Pinterest
Gif by Dima Bazak.
Now loosen up those
legs
and hips with the standing quad stretch.
Stand up with feet hip-width apart.
Grab your left foot behind you with your left hand. Keep your thighs aligned and your left leg parallel with your hip.
Feel that stretch in your left thigh and hips for 5 deep breaths.
Repeat on the opposite side.
Morning stretches in bed
Just can’t in the morning? You can do these stretches in the comfort of your bed while your
coffee
is brewing.
1. Knees-to-chest
Share on Pinterest
Gif by Dima Bazak.
No need to even get out of bed to
stretch
. (Thank gawd.) This one’s perf for your hips,
lower back
, and spine.
Lie on your back with your knees bent and arms at your sides.
Slowly lift your knee and bring them as close to your chest as possible.
Grasp your knees with both hands. If you want a deeper stretch, try to place your forehead on your knees.
Take 5 deep breaths, and then return to start.
2. Two knee spinal twist
Share on Pinterest
Gif by Dima Bazak.
Time to twist and shout — ‘cause your spine,
glutes
, obliques, back, chest, shoulders, and
neck
are about to feel freakin’ amazing.
Lie on your back with your knees bent. Outstretch your arms so they make a “T”.
Bring your knees together and raise them toward the sky. Then slowly lower your knees across the left side of your body until they rest on the bed.
Keep your shoulders grounded on the bed as you turn your head to the right.
Hold the stretch and breathe deeply for 5 breaths.
Slowly return to start and repeat on the opposite side.
3. Child’s Pose
Share on Pinterest
Gif by Dima Bazak.
Sliding into
Child’s Pose
is a great way to start your day with a soft, gentle stretch of the back, hips, pelvis, glutes,
hams
, spinal extensors, shoulders, and arms.
Kneel on your bed with your toes, knees hip-width apart, palms resting on your thighs.
Slowly lower your torso between your knees.
Extend your arms out by your ears, palms facing down. Relax your shoulders to the ground.
You can make this one active by locking your arms and extending them long, or more passive, by letting them fall loosely to the floor. Whatever feels right.
Hold for 5 deep breaths.
4. Cobra Pose
Share on Pinterest
Gif by Dima Bazak.
This
yoga pose
will stretch you right out like a snake by targeting your lower back, arms, glutes, and torso.
Lie on your stomach with your hands pressed beneath your shoulders.
Tuck your elbows in by your sides. Gently raise your head and chest while keeping your hips and pelvis glued to the bed.
If everything feels good, you can go a little deeper by lifting your stomach off the bed. (This means moving from “Baby Cobra” to Full Cobra.) Keep your neck and shoulders relaxed.
Hold for 5 breathes, lower back down, and repeat a few more times if you’d like.
5. Happy Baby Pose
Share on Pinterest
Gif by Dima Bazak
When you wake up, you deserve to baby yourself. This yoga pose will release tension in your thighs, hips, groin, and entire back.
Lie on your back. Bring both knees to your chest.
Grab both feet from the outside. With your knees bent, pull your feet toward your armpits so your knees are wide.
Press your shoulders and back of the neck into the bed. Try to get your spine as flat as possible.
Breathe for 5 breaths and rock from side to side a little.
Tips for stretching safely
Stretching is supposed to prevent probs — not cause them. To stay safe while
stretching
every morning, keep the following tips in mind:
Listen to your body.
If your muscles are screaming, stop right there! Overstretching can lead to injury, so aim for a gentle release, *not* sharp pain.
Watch your posture.
Prioritize proper form over going super deep in the stretch. We’re shooting for better health, not Cirque du Soleil-level contortions. (And even if you *do* want to get mind-bendingly bendy, these things take time!)
Breathe.
Stretching already boosts circulation but breathing while your stretch helps your muscles and body relax into the move.
Talk with a pro.
If you have an
injury
or aren’t sure where to begin with your
stretching routine
, talk with your doctor or a physical therapist. Together, you can find a routine that works for your needs. Remember, your stretching routine should never cause you
pain
. If it does, head to a pro.
Bottom line
Morning stretching isn’t just a
TikTok
trend — it’s a legit way to boost your
flexibility
, reduce tension and tightness, and start your day off right.
Remember, if your muscles are screaming, stop right there! When it comes to stretching, pain equals
no
gain. If you have injuries or are unsure how to stretch safely, talk with a doc or certified PT.

Sliding into
Child’s Pose
is a great way to start your day with a soft, gentle stretch of the back, hips, pelvis, glutes,
hams
, spinal extensors, shoulders, and arms.
Kneel on your bed with your toes, knees hip-width apart, palms resting on your thighs.
Slowly lower your torso between your knees.
Extend your arms out by your ears, palms facing down. Relax your shoulders to the ground.
You can make this one active by locking your arms and extending them long, or more passive, by letting them fall loosely to the floor. Whatever feels right.
Hold for 5 deep breaths.
4. Cobra Pose
Share on Pinterest
Gif by Dima Bazak.
This
yoga pose
will stretch you right out like a snake by targeting your lower back, arms, glutes, and torso.
Lie on your stomach with your hands pressed beneath your shoulders.
Tuck your elbows in by your sides. Gently raise your head and chest while keeping your hips and pelvis glued to the bed.
If everything feels good, you can go a little deeper by lifting your stomach off the bed. (This means moving from “Baby Cobra” to Full Cobra.) Keep your neck and shoulders relaxed.
Hold for 5 breathes, lower back down, and repeat a few more times if you’d like.
5. Happy Baby Pose
Share on Pinterest
Gif by Dima Bazak
When you wake up, you deserve to baby yourself. This yoga pose will release tension in your thighs, hips, groin, and entire back.
Lie on your back. Bring both knees to your chest.
Grab both feet from the outside. With your knees bent, pull your feet toward your armpits so your knees are wide.
Press your shoulders and back of the neck into the bed. Try to get your spine as flat as possible.
Breathe for 5 breaths and rock from side to side a little.
Tips for stretching safely
Stretching is supposed to prevent probs — not cause them. To stay safe while
stretching
every morning, keep the following tips in mind:
Listen to your body.
If your muscles are screaming, stop right there! Overstretching can lead to injury, so aim for a gentle release, *not* sharp pain.
Watch your posture.
Prioritize proper form over going super deep in the stretch. We’re shooting for better health, not Cirque du Soleil-level contortions. (And even if you *do* want to get mind-bendingly bendy, these things take time!)
Breathe.
Stretching already boosts circulation but breathing while your stretch helps your muscles and body relax into the move.
Talk with a pro.
If you have an
injury
or aren’t sure where to begin with your
stretching routine
, talk with your doctor or a physical therapist. Together, you can find a routine that works for your needs. Remember, your stretching routine should never cause you
pain
. If it does, head to a pro.
Bottom line
Morning stretching isn’t just a
TikTok
trend — it’s a legit way to boost your
flexibility
, reduce tension and tightness, and start your day off right.
Remember, if your muscles are screaming, stop right there! When it comes to stretching, pain equals
no
gain. If you have injuries or are unsure how to stretch safely, talk with a doc or certified PT.

1. Cat-Cow Pose
Share on Pinterest
Gif by Dima Bazak.
Mooove over, stiff muscles. This classic
yoga pose
will relieve tension in your spine, abs, and back. Here’s how to do it:
Start on all fours in a tabletop position with your spine straight and shoulders over your wrists. Relax your shoulders from your ears and look straight at the floor.
Curl your toes under, tilt your pelvis back, and gaze gently upward to move into Cow.
Release the tops of your feet to the floor as you tuck your tailbone under. Round your spine like a feline to flow into Cat.
Draw your belly button toward your spine. Drop your head and look toward your tummy.
Move back into Cow and repeat 5 times.
2. Seated side stretch
Share on Pinterest
Gif by Dima Bazak.
Here’s a simple way to open up your chest and
shoulders
while stretching out your neck,
arms
, torso, and
hips
.
While sitting, reach for the sky with your left arm.
Place your right hand next to your right hip on the floor. Gently lean toward your right hand, pulling your left arm over your head as you bend your right elbow. Your torso should slightly bend with you.
Hold the
stretch
for 5 deep breaths.
Return to start and repeat on the opposite side.
Pro tip
: You can also do this stretch standing.
3. Standing Forward Bend
Share on Pinterest
Gif by Dima Bazak.
Time to stretch out your spine,
glutes
, hams, quads while you basically give yourself a hug — ‘cause you deserve some love. ❣️
Stand with feet hip-width apart.
Hinge at your hips, keeping your torso long and lifted.
Keep your legs straight (slightly bent knees are OK to reduce strain) and let your hands fall wherever it’s comfy. This could be your shins, ankles, feet, or floor. You can also hold opposite elbows.
Root your feet to the ground and let your head hang as you relax here for 5 breaths.
Release your arms and slowly rise back up using the strength of your core and glutes.
4. Tricep stretch
Share on Pinterest
Gif by Dima Bazak.
Get your arms ready for the day. This one will
stretch
out your triceps and shoulders.
While standing with your feet shoulder-width apart, extend your right arm across your body.
Hook your left arm around your right elbow. Gently pull the right arm closer to you.
Hold while taking 5 deep breaths.
Return to a neutral standing position and repeat on the opposite side.
5. Standing quad stretch
Share on Pinterest
Gif by Dima Bazak.
Now loosen up those
legs
and hips with the standing quad stretch.
Stand up with feet hip-width apart.
Grab your left foot behind you with your left hand. Keep your thighs aligned and your left leg parallel with your hip.
Feel that stretch in your left thigh and hips for 5 deep breaths.
Repeat on the opposite side.
Morning stretches in bed

Share on Pinterest
Gif by Dima Bazak.

stretch
. (Thank gawd.) This one’s perf for your hips,
lower back
, and spine.
Lie on your back with your knees bent and arms at your sides.
Slowly lift your knee and bring them as close to your chest as possible.

Share on Pinterest
Gif by Dima Bazak.

glutes
, obliques, back, chest, shoulders, and
neck

The Straight Facts on Protein

How is protein made?
Why is protein important?
Intake
Protein foods
Protein powder
High protein diets
Protein meals
Protein, like its controversy-mired counterparts
carbs
and
fat
, is a macronutrient. That means your body needs adequate amounts of it, and it provides much-needed calories (4 calories per gram, to be exact).
And in the Great Macro Debate, everyone pretty much agrees: Protein is really good for you.
Protein fast facts:
What is protein?
Protein is an essential macronutrient that provides amino acids, which are the building blocks of many body tissues.
Why do you need protein?
It’s really important for proper growth, exercise recovery, strength building, and cell repair. And protein has tons of other health benefits too.
Best sources of protein?
Animal products like red meat, poultry, fish, and shellfish are great sources of protein. But you can also get protein from plant sources like nuts, seeds, beans, and legumes.
Grab a
protein bar
and put your learning cap on — it’s time to become a protein pro.

What is protein made of?
Proteins are made of long chains of amino acids — or, as you may remember them from middle school bio, “the building blocks of life.”
Humans use 20 different amino acids, but your bod can’t manufacture 9 of them. So you have to get these nine essential amino acids from food:
Histidine
Isoleucine
Leucine
Lysine
Methionine
Phenylalanine
Threonine
Tryptophan
Valine
Other amino acids are
conditionally essential
, meaning you need more of them when your body is under stress (like when you’re sick or recovering from an injury).
Under a microscope, proteins look like tangled balls of string because these chains fold over themselves repeatedly, forming a matrix that is
denatured
(unwound) during digestion. This lets your body lop off amino acids and add them to your amino acid “bank.”
Your bod can then pull amino acids from this nutrient bank when it’s time to make new proteins.
Animal products are the amino acid kings
Animal proteins like
meat
,
eggs
, and
milk
contain all the essential amino acids in the right ratios.
Unfortunately, this isn’t the case for most
plant-based
protein foods. That’s why it’s *super* important to include a variety of protein sources if you follow a
vegan
or
vegetarian diet
. You don’t want to miss out on those precious aminos.
Why is protein important?
For the sweet, sweet gainz, obviously.
But really: Your body is constantly creating new cells and tissues and recycling the old ones. For this to work, you need protein from your diet — or, more specifically, those essential amino acids.
Your body uses amino acids to build new proteins for cell growth and repair, muscle recovery, and recovery from injury and illness. In fact, getting enough protein in your diet can help with all kinds of stuff.
Here’s a sampling:
Diabetes risk.
Although other factors (like weight and body fat) play a larger role in the development of diabetes,
research
suggests higher protein intake may slightly reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes.
Cancer odds.
Among people with breast cancer, those with the highest protein intake appear to have a slightly higher chance of survival, according to a
2017 study
.
Bone health.
More research is needed, but a higher protein intake may be linked to better bone density — particularly in the
lumbar spine
. And um… that sounds pretty important to us when dealing with the
WFH posture
struggle.
Muscle growth.
Want muscles? Eat protein. Your body needs tons of it (and the amino acid
leucine
, in particular) to build new muscle.
Weight management.
Protein is
more filling
than fat and carbs (with the exception of our pal
fiber
), which is why high protein diets are often recommended for weight loss.
Amino acids are unique AF
Each individual amino acid has its own benefits too. Here are some examples:
Leucine.
This is the most important amino acid for muscle building. It’s what muscles crave.
Lysine.
This is a precursor to
carnitine
, which helps your mitochondria (the “powerhouse of the cell” — you know the drill) make more energy.
Arginine.
This amino acid may help with
blood sugar regulation
, and it’s important for wound healing. It’s also used as a supplement to help boost
blood flow
and energy production.
Tryptophan.
It won’t directly make you sleepy (exception: Thanksgiving turkey), but it does help your body make
serotonin
, which promotes good sleep and relaxation.
How much protein do you need?
The
FDA
generally recommends that adults eat about 50 grams of protein erry day. Your specific needs may be a little lower or higher based on how many calories your bod needs.
You can also look at the
recommended dietary allowances
for protein based on your sex and age group:
Age and sex
Protein intake
children ages 6–11 months
11 g
children ages 1–3
13 g
children ages 4–8
19 g
children ages 9–13
34 g
females ages 14+
46 g
males ages 14–18
52 g
males ages 19+
56 g
If you want a more individualized way to calculate how much protein you need, you can base your intake on your weight and activity level. The
protein recommendations
based on activity level and weight would look something like this:
Activity level
Protein intake
sedentary
0.4 g per lb (0.8 g per kg)
moderately active
0.6 g per lb (1.3 g per kg)
very active
0.7 g per lb (1.6 g per kg)
The
USDA
also offers a handy protein intake calculator.
Is protein deficiency really a thing?
Um, YES. In fact, there’s a name for it:
kwashiorkor
. It’s rare and typically occurs only in malnourished children living in low income countries. The condition is characterized by stunted growth and abdominal swelling.
Stateside, protein deficiency is super rare. But loss of muscle mass and getting sick all the time may be signs that you’re not getting enough.
What are good sources of protein?
Whether you’re a vegan, a carnivore, or somewhere in between, there are plenty of protein-rich options that can fit into your diet.
Wanna make sure you’re hitting your protein goals? Here are the protein-rich foods to chow down on:
red meat, poultry,
fish
, and shellfish
nuts
and seeds
beans and
legumes
soybeans and soy products like
tofu
and
tempeh
dairy products like
milk
, cheese, and
yogurt
certain
whole grains
like kamut, teff, and
quinoa
Don’t overdo the processed meats
Think
bacon
, ham, sausage,
hot dogs
, and lunch meats.
Processed meats
have been linked to an increased risk of certain cancers, particularly
colon
and stomach cancers.
While there’s no need to totally avoid these foods (hello… it’s bacon 🥓 ), they shouldn’t be the cornerstones of your diet.
What about protein powders?
While it’s best to meet your protein needs by eating whole foods,
protein powders
definitely have their place.
Protein powder
is a super easy and convenient way to make sure you’re getting enough of this vital nutrient. Some populations may need more protein, such as athletes, people who are pregnant or breastfeeding, vegans or vegetarians, and older adults.
Supplementing with
protein powder
can also be helpful if you have trouble getting enough protein, which might happen if you have certain food allergies or intolerances or if you’re recovering from an injury or illness.
Several types of protein powder are available to help meet every dietary need under the sun (including
plant-based
and
keto
options).
Before you get your protein shake on
If you’re taking meds (like antibiotics) or have medical conditions, get the OK from your doc first. Some protein powders can cause adverse reactions.
It’s also not a bad idea to double-check that your protein powder contains quality ingredients and has been verified by third-party testing.
Are high protein diets good for you?
It’s an
exaggeration
to say that eating too much protein can demolish your kidneys (unless you already have kidney issues). But there really isn’t any clear benefit to eating
way
more protein than your body needs.
If you’re trying to
lose weight
, upping your protein intake a little bit could keep you feeling full on fewer calories. Some
low carb diets
may be higher in protein, which can help provide similar weight loss benefits.
BTW,
keto
is actually not a high protein diet — it’s high fat, low carb, and moderate protein (the more you know 💫 ).
Most people who aren’t very active will get plenty of protein by aiming for 0.5 grams of protein per pound (1 gram per kilogram) of body weight.
It’s generally safe to eat up to 0.9 grams per pound (2 grams per kilogram), but there’s really no need to top off that much unless you’re doing some serious Lou Ferrigno-style workouts.
Is a low protein diet ever necessary?
SOME people, such as those with
chronic kidney disease
, may need to follow a low or very low protein diet. But don’t just decide to start a low protein diet without first consulting a medical professional or dietitian.
Tips to get enough protein
Make sure you’re adding a protein source to every
meal
and, ideally, every
snack
.
As far as meat goes, aim for a piece that’s at least the size of a deck of cards once it’s cooked. In the case of plant-based protein sources, aim for 1/2 cup.
Here are some other tips to help you meet that protein goal:
Beans, beans, beans.
Protein-rich and super versatile,
beans
are great in soups and salads, as a main dish or a side, and they make a great snack too.
Hummus
, anyone?
Sprinkle seeds like confetti.
Like beans,
seeds
can go with pretty much everything. You can even use seeds to make
protein-rich crackers
(or just buy seed crackers) for that aforementioned
hummus
.
(Nut) butter it up.
Nut
and seed butters are a tasty way to add some
extra protein
to your meals. You can make
energy bites
, whip up a flavorful
Asian-inspired sauce
, or keep it classic on
toast
.
Make Greek yogurt your BFF.
Use
plain Greek yogurt
instead of mayo in chicken, tuna, or egg salad. Or add it to
overnight oats
or baked goods to level up your protein.
Put an egg on it!
A fried or hard-boiled
egg
is a tasty way to add an extra 7 or so grams of protein. Add eggs to
salads
,
ramen
,
stir-fries
, or
sandwiches
. Or simply
scramble up eggs
for brekkie.
If you still have trouble getting enough protein, add some protein powder or a ready-to-drink protein shake. This can give you an extra 20 to 30 grams of protein easily.
tl;dr
Protein contains amino acids your body needs to make new proteins. There are 9 essential amino acids that you must get through your diet.
Eating enough protein can also promote muscle growth and help with weight management.
Aim for 0.5 to 0.8 grams of protein per pound of body weight, depending on your activity level.
Meat, dairy, nuts, seeds, beans, and certain grains are all great sources of protein. Protein powder is also a good way to get some extra protein if you’re having trouble getting enough from food.
High protein diets aren’t typically harmful, but there’s also no benefit to eating way more protein than you need.

How is protein made?
Why is protein important?

Protein foods

High protein diets
Protein meals
Protein, like its controversy-mired counterparts
carbs
and
fat
, is a macronutrient. That means your body needs adequate amounts of it, and it provides much-needed calories (4 calories per gram, to be exact).
And in the Great Macro Debate, everyone pretty much agrees: Protein is really good for you.
Protein fast facts:
What is protein?
Protein is an essential macronutrient that provides amino acids, which are the building blocks of many body tissues.
Why do you need protein?
It’s really important for proper growth, exercise recovery, strength building, and cell repair. And protein has tons of other health benefits too.
Best sources of protein?
Animal products like red meat, poultry, fish, and shellfish are great sources of protein. But you can also get protein from plant sources like nuts, seeds, beans, and legumes.
Grab a
protein bar
and put your learning cap on — it’s time to become a protein pro.

What is protein made of?
Proteins are made of long chains of amino acids — or, as you may remember them from middle school bio, “the building blocks of life.”
Humans use 20 different amino acids, but your bod can’t manufacture 9 of them. So you have to get these nine essential amino acids from food:
Histidine
Isoleucine
Leucine
Lysine
Methionine
Phenylalanine
Threonine
Tryptophan
Valine
Other amino acids are
conditionally essential
, meaning you need more of them when your body is under stress (like when you’re sick or recovering from an injury).
Under a microscope, proteins look like tangled balls of string because these chains fold over themselves repeatedly, forming a matrix that is
denatured
(unwound) during digestion. This lets your body lop off amino acids and add them to your amino acid “bank.”
Your bod can then pull amino acids from this nutrient bank when it’s time to make new proteins.
Animal products are the amino acid kings
Animal proteins like
meat
,
eggs
, and
milk
contain all the essential amino acids in the right ratios.
Unfortunately, this isn’t the case for most
plant-based
protein foods. That’s why it’s *super* important to include a variety of protein sources if you follow a
vegan
or
vegetarian diet
. You don’t want to miss out on those precious aminos.
Why is protein important?
For the sweet, sweet gainz, obviously.
But really: Your body is constantly creating new cells and tissues and recycling the old ones. For this to work, you need protein from your diet — or, more specifically, those essential amino acids.
Your body uses amino acids to build new proteins for cell growth and repair, muscle recovery, and recovery from injury and illness. In fact, getting enough protein in your diet can help with all kinds of stuff.
Here’s a sampling:
Diabetes risk.
Although other factors (like weight and body fat) play a larger role in the development of diabetes,
research
suggests higher protein intake may slightly reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes.
Cancer odds.
Among people with breast cancer, those with the highest protein intake appear to have a slightly higher chance of survival, according to a
2017 study
.
Bone health.
More research is needed, but a higher protein intake may be linked to better bone density — particularly in the
lumbar spine
. And um… that sounds pretty important to us when dealing with the
WFH posture
struggle.
Muscle growth.
Want muscles? Eat protein. Your body needs tons of it (and the amino acid
leucine
, in particular) to build new muscle.
Weight management.
Protein is
more filling
than fat and carbs (with the exception of our pal
fiber
), which is why high protein diets are often recommended for weight loss.
Amino acids are unique AF
Each individual amino acid has its own benefits too. Here are some examples:
Leucine.
This is the most important amino acid for muscle building. It’s what muscles crave.
Lysine.
This is a precursor to
carnitine
, which helps your mitochondria (the “powerhouse of the cell” — you know the drill) make more energy.
Arginine.
This amino acid may help with
blood sugar regulation
, and it’s important for wound healing. It’s also used as a supplement to help boost
blood flow
and energy production.
Tryptophan.
It won’t directly make you sleepy (exception: Thanksgiving turkey), but it does help your body make
serotonin
, which promotes good sleep and relaxation.
How much protein do you need?
The
FDA
generally recommends that adults eat about 50 grams of protein erry day. Your specific needs may be a little lower or higher based on how many calories your bod needs.
You can also look at the
recommended dietary allowances
for protein based on your sex and age group:
Age and sex
Protein intake
children ages 6–11 months
11 g
children ages 1–3
13 g
children ages 4–8
19 g
children ages 9–13
34 g
females ages 14+
46 g
males ages 14–18
52 g
males ages 19+
56 g
If you want a more individualized way to calculate how much protein you need, you can base your intake on your weight and activity level. The
protein recommendations
based on activity level and weight would look something like this:
Activity level
Protein intake
sedentary
0.4 g per lb (0.8 g per kg)
moderately active
0.6 g per lb (1.3 g per kg)
very active
0.7 g per lb (1.6 g per kg)
The
USDA
also offers a handy protein intake calculator.
Is protein deficiency really a thing?
Um, YES. In fact, there’s a name for it:
kwashiorkor
. It’s rare and typically occurs only in malnourished children living in low income countries. The condition is characterized by stunted growth and abdominal swelling.
Stateside, protein deficiency is super rare. But loss of muscle mass and getting sick all the time may be signs that you’re not getting enough.
What are good sources of protein?
Whether you’re a vegan, a carnivore, or somewhere in between, there are plenty of protein-rich options that can fit into your diet.
Wanna make sure you’re hitting your protein goals? Here are the protein-rich foods to chow down on:
red meat, poultry,
fish
, and shellfish
nuts
and seeds
beans and
legumes
soybeans and soy products like
tofu
and
tempeh
dairy products like
milk
, cheese, and
yogurt
certain
whole grains
like kamut, teff, and
quinoa
Don’t overdo the processed meats
Think
bacon
, ham, sausage,
hot dogs
, and lunch meats.
Processed meats
have been linked to an increased risk of certain cancers, particularly
colon
and stomach cancers.
While there’s no need to totally avoid these foods (hello… it’s bacon 🥓 ), they shouldn’t be the cornerstones of your diet.
What about protein powders?
While it’s best to meet your protein needs by eating whole foods,
protein powders
definitely have their place.
Protein powder
is a super easy and convenient way to make sure you’re getting enough of this vital nutrient. Some populations may need more protein, such as athletes, people who are pregnant or breastfeeding, vegans or vegetarians, and older adults.
Supplementing with
protein powder
can also be helpful if you have trouble getting enough protein, which might happen if you have certain food allergies or intolerances or if you’re recovering from an injury or illness.
Several types of protein powder are available to help meet every dietary need under the sun (including
plant-based
and
keto
options).
Before you get your protein shake on
If you’re taking meds (like antibiotics) or have medical conditions, get the OK from your doc first. Some protein powders can cause adverse reactions.
It’s also not a bad idea to double-check that your protein powder contains quality ingredients and has been verified by third-party testing.
Are high protein diets good for you?
It’s an
exaggeration
to say that eating too much protein can demolish your kidneys (unless you already have kidney issues). But there really isn’t any clear benefit to eating
way
more protein than your body needs.
If you’re trying to
lose weight
, upping your protein intake a little bit could keep you feeling full on fewer calories. Some
low carb diets
may be higher in protein, which can help provide similar weight loss benefits.
BTW,
keto
is actually not a high protein diet — it’s high fat, low carb, and moderate protein (the more you know 💫 ).
Most people who aren’t very active will get plenty of protein by aiming for 0.5 grams of protein per pound (1 gram per kilogram) of body weight.
It’s generally safe to eat up to 0.9 grams per pound (2 grams per kilogram), but there’s really no need to top off that much unless you’re doing some serious Lou Ferrigno-style workouts.
Is a low protein diet ever necessary?
SOME people, such as those with
chronic kidney disease
, may need to follow a low or very low protein diet. But don’t just decide to start a low protein diet without first consulting a medical professional or dietitian.
Tips to get enough protein
Make sure you’re adding a protein source to every
meal
and, ideally, every
snack
.
As far as meat goes, aim for a piece that’s at least the size of a deck of cards once it’s cooked. In the case of plant-based protein sources, aim for 1/2 cup.

Protein, like its controversy-mired counterparts
carbs
and
fat
, is a macronutrient. That means your body needs adequate amounts of it, and it provides much-needed calories (4 calories per gram, to be exact).
And in the Great Macro Debate, everyone pretty much agrees: Protein is really good for you.
Protein fast facts:
What is protein?
Protein is an essential macronutrient that provides amino acids, which are the building blocks of many body tissues.
Why do you need protein?
It’s really important for proper growth, exercise recovery, strength building, and cell repair. And protein has tons of other health benefits too.
Best sources of protein?
Animal products like red meat, poultry, fish, and shellfish are great sources of protein. But you can also get protein from plant sources like nuts, seeds, beans, and legumes.
Grab a
protein bar
and put your learning cap on — it’s time to become a protein pro.

What is protein made of?
Proteins are made of long chains of amino acids — or, as you may remember them from middle school bio, “the building blocks of life.”
Humans use 20 different amino acids, but your bod can’t manufacture 9 of them. So you have to get these nine essential amino acids from food:
Histidine
Isoleucine
Leucine
Lysine
Methionine
Phenylalanine
Threonine
Tryptophan
Valine
Other amino acids are
conditionally essential
, meaning you need more of them when your body is under stress (like when you’re sick or recovering from an injury).
Under a microscope, proteins look like tangled balls of string because these chains fold over themselves repeatedly, forming a matrix that is
denatured
(unwound) during digestion. This lets your body lop off amino acids and add them to your amino acid “bank.”
Your bod can then pull amino acids from this nutrient bank when it’s time to make new proteins.
Animal products are the amino acid kings
Animal proteins like
meat
,
eggs
, and
milk
contain all the essential amino acids in the right ratios.
Unfortunately, this isn’t the case for most
plant-based
protein foods. That’s why it’s *super* important to include a variety of protein sources if you follow a
vegan
or
vegetarian diet
. You don’t want to miss out on those precious aminos.
Why is protein important?
For the sweet, sweet gainz, obviously.
But really: Your body is constantly creating new cells and tissues and recycling the old ones. For this to work, you need protein from your diet — or, more specifically, those essential amino acids.
Your body uses amino acids to build new proteins for cell growth and repair, muscle recovery, and recovery from injury and illness. In fact, getting enough protein in your diet can help with all kinds of stuff.
Here’s a sampling:
Diabetes risk.
Although other factors (like weight and body fat) play a larger role in the development of diabetes,
research
suggests higher protein intake may slightly reduce the risk of type 2 diabetes.
Cancer odds.
Among people with breast cancer, those with the highest protein intake appear to have a slightly higher chance of survival, according to a
2017 study
.
Bone health.
More research is needed, but a higher protein intake may be linked to better bone density — particularly in the
lumbar spine
. And um… that sounds pretty important to us when dealing with the
WFH posture
struggle.
Muscle growth.
Want muscles? Eat protein. Your body needs tons of it (and the amino acid
leucine
, in particular) to build new muscle.
Weight management.
Protein is
more filling
than fat and carbs (with the exception of our pal
fiber
), which is why high protein diets are often recommended for weight loss.
Amino acids are unique AF
Each individual amino acid has its own benefits too. Here are some examples:
Leucine.
This is the most important amino acid for muscle building. It’s what muscles crave.
Lysine.
This is a precursor to
carnitine
, which helps your mitochondria (the “powerhouse of the cell” — you know the drill) make more energy.
Arginine.
This amino acid may help with
blood sugar regulation
, and it’s important for wound healing. It’s also used as a supplement to help boost
blood flow
and energy production.
Tryptophan.
It won’t directly make you sleepy (exception: Thanksgiving turkey), but it does help your body make
serotonin
, which promotes good sleep and relaxation.
How much protein do you need?
The
FDA
generally recommends that adults eat about 50 grams of protein erry day. Your specific needs may be a little lower or higher based on how many calories your bod needs.
You can also look at the
recommended dietary allowances
for protein based on your sex and age group:
Age and sex
Protein intake
children ages 6–11 months
11 g
children ages 1–3
13 g
children ages 4–8
19 g
children ages 9–13
34 g
females ages 14+
46 g
males ages 14–18
52 g
males ages 19+
56 g
If you want a more individualized way to calculate how much protein you need, you can base your intake on your weight and activity level. The
protein recommendations
based on activity level and weight would look something like this:
Activity level
Protein intake
sedentary
0.4 g per lb (0.8 g per kg)
moderately active
0.6 g per lb (1.3 g per kg)
very active
0.7 g per lb (1.6 g per kg)
The
USDA
also offers a handy protein intake calculator.
Is protein deficiency really a thing?
Um, YES. In fact, there’s a name for it:
kwashiorkor
. It’s rare and typically occurs only in malnourished children living in low income countries. The condition is characterized by stunted growth and abdominal swelling.
Stateside, protein deficiency is super rare. But loss of muscle mass and getting sick all the time may be signs that you’re not getting enough.
What are good sources of protein?
Whether you’re a vegan, a carnivore, or somewhere in between, there are plenty of protein-rich options that can fit into your diet.
Wanna make sure you’re hitting your protein goals? Here are the protein-rich foods to chow down on:
red meat, poultry,
fish
, and shellfish
nuts
and seeds
beans and
legumes
soybeans and soy products like
tofu
and
tempeh
dairy products like
milk
, cheese, and
yogurt
certain
whole grains
like kamut, teff, and
quinoa
Don’t overdo the processed meats
Think
bacon
, ham, sausage,
hot dogs
, and lunch meats.
Processed meats
have been linked to an increased risk of certain cancers, particularly
colon
and stomach cancers.
While there’s no need to totally avoid these foods (hello… it’s bacon 🥓 ), they shouldn’t be the cornerstones of your diet.
What about protein powders?
While it’s best to meet your protein needs by eating whole foods,
protein powders
definitely have their place.
Protein powder
is a super easy and convenient way to make sure you’re getting enough of this vital nutrient. Some populations may need more protein, such as athletes, people who are pregnant or breastfeeding, vegans or vegetarians, and older adults.
Supplementing with
protein powder
can also be helpful if you have trouble getting enough protein, which might happen if you have certain food allergies or intolerances or if you’re recovering from an injury or illness.
Several types of protein powder are available to help meet every dietary need under the sun (including
plant-based
and
keto
options).
Before you get your protein shake on
If you’re taking meds (like antibiotics) or have medical conditions, get the OK from your doc first. Some protein powders can cause adverse reactions.
It’s also not a bad idea to double-check that your protein powder contains quality ingredients and has been verified by third-party testing.
Are high protein diets good for you?
It’s an
exaggeration
to say that eating too much protein can demolish your kidneys (unless you already have kidney issues). But there really isn’t any clear benefit to eating
way
more protein than your body needs.
If you’re trying to
lose weight
, upping your protein intake a little bit could keep you feeling full on fewer calories. Some
low carb diets
may be higher in protein, which can help provide similar weight loss benefits.
BTW,
keto
is actually not a high protein diet — it’s high fat, low carb, and moderate protein (the more you know 💫 ).
Most people who aren’t very active will get plenty of protein by aiming for 0.5 grams of protein per pound (1 gram per kilogram) of body weight.
It’s generally safe to eat up to 0.9 grams per pound (2 grams per kilogram), but there’s really no need to top off that much unless you’re doing some serious Lou Ferrigno-style workouts.
Is a low protein diet ever necessary?
SOME people, such as those with
chronic kidney disease
, may need to follow a low or very low protein diet. But don’t just decide to start a low protein diet without first consulting a medical professional or dietitian.
Tips to get enough protein
Make sure you’re adding a protein source to every
meal
and, ideally, every
snack
.
As far as meat goes, aim for a piece that’s at least the size of a deck of cards once it’s cooked. In the case of plant-based protein sources, aim for 1/2 cup.
Here are some other tips to help you meet that protein goal:
Beans, beans, beans.
Protein-rich and super versatile,
beans
are great in soups and salads, as a main dish or a side, and they make a great snack too.
Hummus
, anyone?
Sprinkle seeds like confetti.
Like beans,
seeds
can go with pretty much everything. You can even use seeds to make
protein-rich crackers
(or just buy seed crackers) for that aforementioned
hummus
.
(Nut) butter it up.
Nut
and seed butters are a tasty way to add some
extra protein
to your meals. You can make
energy bites
, whip up a flavorful
Asian-inspired sauce
, or keep it classic on
toast
.
Make Greek yogurt your BFF.
Use
plain Greek yogurt
instead of mayo in chicken, tuna, or egg salad. Or add it to
overnight oats
or baked goods to level up your protein.
Put an egg on it!
A fried or hard-boiled
egg
is a tasty way to add an extra 7 or so grams of protein. Add eggs to
salads
,
ramen
,
stir-fries
, or
sandwiches
. Or simply
scramble up eggs
for brekkie.
If you still have trouble getting enough protein, add some protein powder or a ready-to-drink protein shake. This can give you an extra 20 to 30 grams of protein easily.
tl;dr
Protein contains amino acids your body needs to make new proteins. There are 9 essential amino acids that you must get through your diet.
Eating enough protein can also promote muscle growth and help with weight management.
Aim for 0.5 to 0.8 grams of protein per pound of body weight, depending on your activity level.
Meat, dairy, nuts, seeds, beans, and certain grains are all great sources of protein. Protein powder is also a good way to get some extra protein if you’re having trouble getting enough from food.
High protein diets aren’t typically harmful, but there’s also no benefit to eating way more protein than you need.

Weight loss tips
Curious about whats a good calorie deficit for weight loss? Learn to create a healthy deficit that fits your needs, why smaller ones might be better, and tips for sustainable weight loss without extreme dieting.
Generally, to lose weight, you have to create a calorie deficit by eating less or using more energy daily. And weight loss diets tend to tout big calorie deficits as the secret to slimming down.
But what
is
a calorie deficit? Is a bigger deficit better when it comes to
weight loss
? And how do you make sure you’re following a healthy calorie deficit? We’re getting to the bottom of these questions.
What’s a healthy calorie deficit?
Everyone’s calorie needs are different. A “healthy”
calorie intake
for you will depend on factors like your age, sex, and activity levels. Your doctor can help you find a healthy-for-you calorie deficit that’s based on your unique needs and goals. In general, many experts recommend keeping your calorie deficit as small as possible.
Minimizing this deficit helps minimize the changes your bod might make in response (like slowing your metabolism and increasing hunger). These counter-productive responses can make long-term
weight loss
maintenance difficult, so finding the right balance for you is key.
Understanding calorie deficits
A calorie deficit is how many more calories your body’s burning than you’re taking in. For example, if you eat 2,000 calories and burn 2,300 calories every day, you’d be in a calorie deficit of 300 calories per day.
A
calorie
is just a measure of energy. When you eat calories, your bod will either use them immediately, or it will store them as glycogen or
fat
to use as energy later.
You can achieve a
calorie
deficit by taking in fewer calories. This can be done by eating less or by burning more calories when
using more energy
. If you’re taking in fewer calories than you burn, you’ll lose weight. This is why most weight loss diets recommend cutting calories.
But even though this whole calorie deficit concept is pretty straightforward, weight loss isn’t.
It’s important to understand that although a calorie deficit created through eating less or burning more calories will typically result in weight loss, certain factors can make it more difficult. Several things affect your body weight, weight loss, and energy needs, including:
changes in hormones
body composition
age
sleep
stress
food quality
Calorie deficits and weight loss
If you want to lose weight, you’ll need to create some level of calorie deficit. Most diets that are
promoted for weight loss
, like
low calorie
diets, slash calorie intake by 500 or even 1,000 calories per day.
That’s a lot for most people. For example, if you’re creating a 500 calorie deficit by cutting calories (cals) alone, this means you’ll be cutting out an entire meal’s worth of calories every day.
Low and very low calorie diets typically result in rapid weight loss, but are almost impossible to follow long-term. Most peeps need way more calories per day to feel their best and have the
energy
they need to get through their day.
Super low calorie diets can have serious downsides
Although greater calorie deficits result in more significant weight loss, cutting cals too drastically can lead to a number of issues like:
low energy
nutrient deficiencies
extreme hunger, dizziness
mood disturbance
Super low calorie diets also *are not* sustainable. So, even if you notice significant weight loss following an extreme low calorie diet,
chances are
, it won’t last.
Additionally, calorie restriction leads to
changes
in your bod, including:
loss of muscle mass
increased appetite
reductions in your resting metabolic rate (the calories you burn at rest)
These changes make long-term weight maintenance difficult.
Small calorie deficits are more sustainable
Even though any type of calorie reduction will result in some reactionary changes, many
health experts
recommend choosing smaller, more sustainable calorie deficits to minimize them.
For example, instead of choosing to cut cals by 500 or 750 per day, you could choose a more moderate calorie reduction of 250 cals per day. Or, you could reduce 150 calories per day and simply be
more active
, which will create a calorie reduction by increasing energy output.
Even though this smaller calorie deficit will result in slower weight loss, it will be much easier to sustain long-term and won’t make you feel hangry all the time.
How many calories should you consume per day?
There are *so* many variables when it comes to calorie needs.
If a person claims to know your exact calorie needs without knowing your size, sex, age, activity levels, wellness goals, and underlying medical conditions, be skeptical.
Even online calorie calculators that use formulas like the Mifflin-St Jeor equation to determine calorie needs aren’t 100 percent accurate and can only give you a general idea of how many calories you need each day.
On
average
, an adult woman needs around 2,000 calories to maintain weight, while a man needs around 2,500 to maintain weight. In order to promote weight loss, calorie intake would need to be lower. However, this is just an estimate.
A doctor or registered dietitian can provide guidance on finding a healthy-for-you calorie deficit based on your unique needs and goals.
Signs that you’re going too far
Big calorie deficits are unsustainable, dangerous, and most importantly, unnecessary.
But many peeps follow super low cal diets in hopes of losing lots of weight quickly. This can lead to a number of unpleasant side effects that impact your physical and mental health.
Here are a few symptoms, which show that your low cal diet is not healthy and that you’re cutting cals way too much:
extreme hunger
fatigue
and weakness
dizziness, especially upon standing
constipation
headaches
hair Loss
an obsession with calorie counting
preoccupation with low calorie foods and fear of high calorie foods
not being able to enjoy food because you’re concerned about the calorie count
These are just a few signs that your current diet isn’t right for you and may be harming your health.
Keep in mind that these symptoms could be caused by inadequate calorie intake, but they may also be related to underlying medical conditions. If these symptoms don’t resolve after you’ve increased your calorie intake, it’s important to call a healthcare professional to get checked out.
Sustainable weight loss tips
Cutting calories too severely can take a serious toll on your physical and mental health, which is why choosing less restrictive weight loss methods that you can follow long-term is always the best choice.
After all, the most important factor in any diet or weight loss plan is your ability to stick to it long-term.
Here are a few of the best ways to lose weight while supporting your overall health and well-being.
Eat whole, nutritious foods
. Whole foods like
vegetables
, fruits,
beans
, fish, nuts, and
eggs
are packed with nutrients your body needs to thrive. Plus, these foods are high in nutrients like protein and
fiber
that help you feel full.
Reduce your intake of ultra-processed foods and added sugar.
Cutting back on fast food, packaged snack foods, ice cream, candy, and
sugary
beverages (like
soda
and energy drinks) can help you reduce your calorie intake and lose weight.
Get active
.
Moving your body
on a daily basis can help promote weight loss by burning more calories and can also improve
cardiovascular
and respiratory health, reduce disease risk, and boost your
mood
.
Cut back on take out and fast food
. If you’re currently consuming most meals out of the house, try cooking more meals at home. Not only can this help save you money, but
cooking meals
at home can help improve your diet and may help you control your calorie intake.
Choose filling over low cal.
Many people choose foods that are low in calories when they’re trying to lose weight. (We’re looking at you rice cakes and fat-free cheese.) Although eating low cal foods like
fruits
and veggies can help curb your calorie intake, choosing filling foods high in protein and fiber is just as important and can help keep you feeling satisfied.
Get help from professionals
. A registered dietitian can help you develop a safe, healthy weight loss program that supports your overall health, allows you to enjoy food, and doesn’t make you feel deprived.
It is possible to lose weight while enjoying food, participating in activities you enjoy, and nourishing and respecting your body.
If your current weight loss program makes you feel restricted, tired, stressed, and out of control, it’s time for a new approach to weight loss.
Bottom line
Even though extreme calorie deficits are more likely to result in significant weight loss, they aren’t sustainable and they’re more likely to cause adverse side effects.
If you’re interested in losing weight in a healthy way, it’s best to create a small calorie deficit using sustainable methods like adding in more physical activity and choosing whole, nutrient-dense foods over ultra-processed foods.

Weight loss tips
Curious about whats a good calorie deficit for weight loss? Learn to create a healthy deficit that fits your needs, why smaller ones might be better, and tips for sustainable weight loss without extreme dieting.
Generally, to lose weight, you have to create a calorie deficit by eating less or using more energy daily. And weight loss diets tend to tout big calorie deficits as the secret to slimming down.
But what
is
a calorie deficit? Is a bigger deficit better when it comes to
weight loss
? And how do you make sure you’re following a healthy calorie deficit? We’re getting to the bottom of these questions.
What’s a healthy calorie deficit?
Everyone’s calorie needs are different. A “healthy”
calorie intake
for you will depend on factors like your age, sex, and activity levels. Your doctor can help you find a healthy-for-you calorie deficit that’s based on your unique needs and goals. In general, many experts recommend keeping your calorie deficit as small as possible.
Minimizing this deficit helps minimize the changes your bod might make in response (like slowing your metabolism and increasing hunger). These counter-productive responses can make long-term
weight loss
maintenance difficult, so finding the right balance for you is key.
Understanding calorie deficits
A calorie deficit is how many more calories your body’s burning than you’re taking in. For example, if you eat 2,000 calories and burn 2,300 calories every day, you’d be in a calorie deficit of 300 calories per day.
A
calorie
is just a measure of energy. When you eat calories, your bod will either use them immediately, or it will store them as glycogen or
fat
to use as energy later.
You can achieve a
calorie
deficit by taking in fewer calories. This can be done by eating less or by burning more calories when
using more energy
. If you’re taking in fewer calories than you burn, you’ll lose weight. This is why most weight loss diets recommend cutting calories.
But even though this whole calorie deficit concept is pretty straightforward, weight loss isn’t.
It’s important to understand that although a calorie deficit created through eating less or burning more calories will typically result in weight loss, certain factors can make it more difficult. Several things affect your body weight, weight loss, and energy needs, including:
changes in hormones
body composition
age
sleep
stress
food quality
Calorie deficits and weight loss
If you want to lose weight, you’ll need to create some level of calorie deficit. Most diets that are
promoted for weight loss
, like
low calorie
diets, slash calorie intake by 500 or even 1,000 calories per day.
That’s a lot for most people. For example, if you’re creating a 500 calorie deficit by cutting calories (cals) alone, this means you’ll be cutting out an entire meal’s worth of calories every day.
Low and very low calorie diets typically result in rapid weight loss, but are almost impossible to follow long-term. Most peeps need way more calories per day to feel their best and have the
energy
they need to get through their day.
Super low calorie diets can have serious downsides
Although greater calorie deficits result in more significant weight loss, cutting cals too drastically can lead to a number of issues like:
low energy
nutrient deficiencies
extreme hunger, dizziness
mood disturbance
Super low calorie diets also *are not* sustainable. So, even if you notice significant weight loss following an extreme low calorie diet,
chances are
, it won’t last.
Additionally, calorie restriction leads to
changes
in your bod, including:
loss of muscle mass
increased appetite
reductions in your resting metabolic rate (the calories you burn at rest)
These changes make long-term weight maintenance difficult.
Small calorie deficits are more sustainable
Even though any type of calorie reduction will result in some reactionary changes, many
health experts
recommend choosing smaller, more sustainable calorie deficits to minimize them.
For example, instead of choosing to cut cals by 500 or 750 per day, you could choose a more moderate calorie reduction of 250 cals per day. Or, you could reduce 150 calories per day and simply be
more active
, which will create a calorie reduction by increasing energy output.
Even though this smaller calorie deficit will result in slower weight loss, it will be much easier to sustain long-term and won’t make you feel hangry all the time.
How many calories should you consume per day?
There are *so* many variables when it comes to calorie needs.
If a person claims to know your exact calorie needs without knowing your size, sex, age, activity levels, wellness goals, and underlying medical conditions, be skeptical.
Even online calorie calculators that use formulas like the Mifflin-St Jeor equation to determine calorie needs aren’t 100 percent accurate and can only give you a general idea of how many calories you need each day.
On
average
, an adult woman needs around 2,000 calories to maintain weight, while a man needs around 2,500 to maintain weight. In order to promote weight loss, calorie intake would need to be lower. However, this is just an estimate.
A doctor or registered dietitian can provide guidance on finding a healthy-for-you calorie deficit based on your unique needs and goals.
Signs that you’re going too far
Big calorie deficits are unsustainable, dangerous, and most importantly, unnecessary.
But many peeps follow super low cal diets in hopes of losing lots of weight quickly. This can lead to a number of unpleasant side effects that impact your physical and mental health.
Here are a few symptoms, which show that your low cal diet is not healthy and that you’re cutting cals way too much:
extreme hunger
fatigue
and weakness
dizziness, especially upon standing
constipation
headaches
hair Loss
an obsession with calorie counting
preoccupation with low calorie foods and fear of high calorie foods
not being able to enjoy food because you’re concerned about the calorie count
These are just a few signs that your current diet isn’t right for you and may be harming your health.
Keep in mind that these symptoms could be caused by inadequate calorie intake, but they may also be related to underlying medical conditions. If these symptoms don’t resolve after you’ve increased your calorie intake, it’s important to call a healthcare professional to get checked out.
Sustainable weight loss tips
Cutting calories too severely can take a serious toll on your physical and mental health, which is why choosing less restrictive weight loss methods that you can follow long-term is always the best choice.
After all, the most important factor in any diet or weight loss plan is your ability to stick to it long-term.
Here are a few of the best ways to lose weight while supporting your overall health and well-being.
Eat whole, nutritious foods
. Whole foods like
vegetables
, fruits,
beans
, fish, nuts, and
eggs
are packed with nutrients your body needs to thrive. Plus, these foods are high in nutrients like protein and
fiber
that help you feel full.
Reduce your intake of ultra-processed foods and added sugar.
Cutting back on fast food, packaged snack foods, ice cream, candy, and
sugary
beverages (like
soda
and energy drinks) can help you reduce your calorie intake and lose weight.
Get active
.
Moving your body
on a daily basis can help promote weight loss by burning more calories and can also improve
cardiovascular
and respiratory health, reduce disease risk, and boost your
mood
.
Cut back on take out and fast food
. If you’re currently consuming most meals out of the house, try cooking more meals at home. Not only can this help save you money, but
cooking meals
at home can help improve your diet and may help you control your calorie intake.
Choose filling over low cal.
Many people choose foods that are low in calories when they’re trying to lose weight. (We’re looking at you rice cakes and fat-free cheese.) Although eating low cal foods like
fruits
and veggies can help curb your calorie intake, choosing filling foods high in protein and fiber is just as important and can help keep you feeling satisfied.
Get help from professionals
. A registered dietitian can help you develop a safe, healthy weight loss program that supports your overall health, allows you to enjoy food, and doesn’t make you feel deprived.
It is possible to lose weight while enjoying food, participating in activities you enjoy, and nourishing and respecting your body.
If your current weight loss program makes you feel restricted, tired, stressed, and out of control, it’s time for a new approach to weight loss.
Bottom line
Even though extreme calorie deficits are more likely to result in significant weight loss, they aren’t sustainable and they’re more likely to cause adverse side effects.
If you’re interested in losing weight in a healthy way, it’s best to create a small calorie deficit using sustainable methods like adding in more physical activity and choosing whole, nutrient-dense foods over ultra-processed foods.

Foods to avoid
tl;dr
When just getting dressed, squatting down to the toilet, or picking up your bag feels worse than the workout itself, you’re probably dealing with delayed onset muscle soreness (
DOMS
).
Working out causes little micro-tears in your muscles, and the process of those fibers rebuilding provides muscle strength and mass (i.e., those big gains).
Share on Pinterest
Soreness is part of the muscle-building process, but by complementing your workout with the right diet, you can minimize the pain and get moving again the next day. Here are the best and worst foods to help your aching muscles.
Foods that help sore muscles
Tart cherries
Research on professional athletes has shown that tart cherry juice can help improve recovery time,
Howatson G, et al. (2010). Influence of tart cherry juice on indices of recovery following marathon running.
pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19883392
decrease muscle pain,
Kuehl K, et al. (2010). Efficacy of tart cherry juice in reducing muscle pain during running: A randomized controlled trial. DOI:
10.1186/1550-2783-7-17
and reduce muscle damage
Connolly DAJ, et al. (2006). Efficacy of a tart cherry juice blend in preventing the symptoms of muscle damage.
ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2579450
compared with other beverages.
Throw a little into your post-workout smoothie or enjoy a small glass as a pre-workout snack.
Cottage cheese
With about
23 grams
of mighty protein per cup, cottage cheese is the go-to post-workout snack in the fitness community for a reason. It’s one of the best sources of casein protein, the slow-digesting fuel that is fantastic for rejuvenating sore muscles as you sleep.
One study found that when athletes worked out in the evening and were given casein protein shortly before bed, they saw a spike in muscle synthesis compared to a placebo.
Res P, et al. (2012). Protein ingestion before sleep improves postexercise overnight recovery.
pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22330017
Plus, cottage cheese contain an abundance of the unique branched-chain amino acid leucine, which has been specifically found to speed recovery from pain.
Ra S-G, et al. (2013). Combined effect of branched-chain amino acids and taurine supplementation on delayed onset muscle soreness and muscle damage in high-intensity eccentric exercise. DOI:
10.1186/1550-2783-10-51
Enjoy it as a parfait with fruit and nuts, purée it into smoothies, or use it as a protein-rich base for
pancakes or baked goods
.
Baking spices
While we’re not giving you the green light to eat a box of Cinnabons or gingerbread cookies post-workout, a sprinkle of spice may help those muscles calm down.
In a 2013 study, trained women who were given cinnamon or ginger described having significantly less muscle soreness after working out than those in the placebo group.
Mashhadi N, et al. (2013). Influence of ginger and cinnamon intake on inflammation and muscle soreness endued by exercise in Iranian female athletes.
ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3665015
Ceylon cinnamon
in particular has lots of potential health benefits as a pantry staple. Add a generous sprinkle to your morning oats, latte, toast, or sweet potatoes for a calorie-free flavor boost.
Turmeric
Early research
Nicol L, et al. (2015). Curcumin supplementation likely attenuates delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS).
pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25795285/
on turmeric’s active ingredient found that a curcumin supplement helped reduce the pain associated with delayed onset muscle soreness, reduced injury, and improved recovery of muscle performance.
Drobnic F, et al. (2014). Reduction of delayed onset muscle soreness by a novel curcumin delivery system (Meriva®): A randomised, placebo-controlled trial. DOI:
10.1186/1550-2783-11-31
Add a helping of curcumin-loaded turmeric to oatmeal, eggs, smoothies, coffee, or baked goods to get the effect (and
healthier skin
too.).
Coffee
Good news for coffee lovers: Research suggests that a moderate dose of caffeine (about a cup or two or coffee) about an hour before working out can significantly reduce pain afterward.
Hurley C, et al. (2013). The effect of caffeine ingestion on delayed onset muscle soreness.
pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24164961
Here are some tips
for making best cup o’ joe ever.
Salmon
Loaded with anti-inflammatory omega-3 fats, antioxidants, and muscle-building protein, salmon is a close-to-perfect post-workout food.
Research has linked nutrients in salmon to increased muscle protein synthesis, the process that repairs and grows muscles.
Paulussen K, et al. (2020). Effects of salmon ingestion on post-exercise muscle protein synthesis: exploration of whole protein foods versus isolated nutrients. DOI:
10.1093/cdn/nzaa049_043
Throw a can on a green salad,
grill up some fillets,
or mix salmon with potatoes for salmon cakes.
Watermelon
There’s nothing quite as satisfying as biting into a cold, juicy piece of watermelon after a serious sweat session. But research on watermelon’s key amino acid, l-citrulline, suggests it might also soothe those sore muscles.
One study found that giving athletes watermelon juice — which contains the rind, the highest source of l-citrulline — after a workout helped reduce recovery heart rate and muscle soreness after 24 hours.
Tarazona-Díaz, M, et al. (2013). Watermelon juice: Potential functional drink for sore muscle relief in athletes. DOI:
10.1021/jf400964r
The natural sugars will also help drive protein into your muscles and replenish low glycogen stores, and the high water content is essential in preventing muscle-cramping dehydration.
Cleary M, et al. (2006). Dehydration and symptoms of delayed-onset muscle soreness in normothermic men.
ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1421497
Throw a little watermelon into your smoothie (include some of the rind for a boost of l-citrulline!
Rimando AM, et al. (2005). Determination of citrulline in watermelon rind.
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16007998/
), add it to a crunchy salad, or
infuse it in some water
for refreshing post-workout hydration.
Eggs
Protein is the essential building block of muscles, so it’s not surprising that research has found that consuming a protein source, like eggs, after an intensive endurance exercise may help reduce the risk of DOMS.
Jäger R, et al. (2017). International Society of Sports Nutrition position stand: Protein and exercise. DOI:
10.1186/s12970-017-0177-8
Like cottage cheese, eggs are a source of leucine, which is linked to muscle recovery.
Ra S-G, et al. (2013). Combined effect of branched-chain amino acids and taurine supplementation on delayed onset muscle soreness and muscle damage in high-intensity eccentric exercise. DOI:
10.1186/1550-2783-10-51
Since each 80-calorie egg packs an impressive
6 grams
of protein, we suggest prepping a big batch of
hard-boiled eggs
at the start of the week for easy post-workout snacks.
Bananas
Bananas are an easy-to-digest source of complex carbs that can help spike your insulin just enough to drive protein into your muscle and stimulate muscle rebuilding and growth.
They’re also a great source of the electrolyte potassium, which research suggests may help reduce muscle soreness post-gym.
Nieman D, et al. (2018). Metabolic recovery from heavy exertion following banana compared to sugar beverage or water only ingestion: A randomized, crossover trial. DOI:
10.1371/journal.pone.0194843
Pop one into a smoothie, slice it onto oats, or simply enjoy it straight out of the peel for a quick snack.
Foods to avoid when you have sore muscles
Now that we’ve got the good stuff down, let’s review what we should probably avoid. Neither of these will likely be a surprise.
Sugar
Since muscle pain is considered a form of inflammation, it makes sense to cut back on inflammatory foods on days you work out — most notably refined carbs like sugar.
A 2017 study of more than 12,000 people found that those who consumed more added sugar (such as sugar found in soda or used in coffee or tea) had higher levels of inflammatory markers than people who consumed less sugar.
O’Connor L, et al. (2017). Intakes and sources of dietary sugars and their association with metabolic and inflammatory markers. DOI:
10.1016/j.clnu.2017.05.030
The good news is that natural forms of sugar in foods like fruits, milk, whole grains, and veggies don’t have the same effect.
Joseph S, et al. (2016). Fruit polyphenols: A review of anti-inflammatory effects in humans.
pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25616409
So get your sweetness from whole foods when you can.
Alcohol
For obvious reasons, it might not be a great idea to plan a workout after too many tequila shots — but even a little booze can cause post-workout pain or up your risk of injury.
Alcohol dehydrates your cells, resulting in soreness, cramps, and potential strains. Research has also shown that it can interfere with blood flow and muscle recovery from injuries.
Barnes M. (2014). Alcohol: Impact on sports performance and recovery in male athletes. DOI:
10.1007/s40279-014-0192-8
The bottom line
If you’re busy building lean muscle and getting those gains, don’t forget to stock up on whole foods with the right nutrition to fuel your body and soothe aching muscles. Fruits, veggies, and proteins are solid choices for pre- and post-workout noshing.

Foods to avoid
tl;dr
When just getting dressed, squatting down to the toilet, or picking up your bag feels worse than the workout itself, you’re probably dealing with delayed onset muscle soreness (
DOMS
).
Working out causes little micro-tears in your muscles, and the process of those fibers rebuilding provides muscle strength and mass (i.e., those big gains).
Share on Pinterest
Soreness is part of the muscle-building process, but by complementing your workout with the right diet, you can minimize the pain and get moving again the next day. Here are the best and worst foods to help your aching muscles.
Foods that help sore muscles
Tart cherries
Research on professional athletes has shown that tart cherry juice can help improve recovery time,
Howatson G, et al. (2010). Influence of tart cherry juice on indices of recovery following marathon running.
pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19883392
decrease muscle pain,
Kuehl K, et al. (2010). Efficacy of tart cherry juice in reducing muscle pain during running: A randomized controlled trial. DOI:
10.1186/1550-2783-7-17
and reduce muscle damage
Connolly DAJ, et al. (2006). Efficacy of a tart cherry juice blend in preventing the symptoms of muscle damage.
ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2579450
compared with other beverages.
Throw a little into your post-workout smoothie or enjoy a small glass as a pre-workout snack.
Cottage cheese
With about
23 grams
of mighty protein per cup, cottage cheese is the go-to post-workout snack in the fitness community for a reason. It’s one of the best sources of casein protein, the slow-digesting fuel that is fantastic for rejuvenating sore muscles as you sleep.
One study found that when athletes worked out in the evening and were given casein protein shortly before bed, they saw a spike in muscle synthesis compared to a placebo.
Res P, et al. (2012). Protein ingestion before sleep improves postexercise overnight recovery.
pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22330017
Plus, cottage cheese contain an abundance of the unique branched-chain amino acid leucine, which has been specifically found to speed recovery from pain.
Ra S-G, et al. (2013). Combined effect of branched-chain amino acids and taurine supplementation on delayed onset muscle soreness and muscle damage in high-intensity eccentric exercise. DOI:
10.1186/1550-2783-10-51
Enjoy it as a parfait with fruit and nuts, purée it into smoothies, or use it as a protein-rich base for
pancakes or baked goods
.
Baking spices
While we’re not giving you the green light to eat a box of Cinnabons or gingerbread cookies post-workout, a sprinkle of spice may help those muscles calm down.
In a 2013 study, trained women who were given cinnamon or ginger described having significantly less muscle soreness after working out than those in the placebo group.
Mashhadi N, et al. (2013). Influence of ginger and cinnamon intake on inflammation and muscle soreness endued by exercise in Iranian female athletes.
ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3665015
Ceylon cinnamon
in particular has lots of potential health benefits as a pantry staple. Add a generous sprinkle to your morning oats, latte, toast, or sweet potatoes for a calorie-free flavor boost.
Turmeric
Early research
Nicol L, et al. (2015). Curcumin supplementation likely attenuates delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS).
pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25795285/
on turmeric’s active ingredient found that a curcumin supplement helped reduce the pain associated with delayed onset muscle soreness, reduced injury, and improved recovery of muscle performance.
Drobnic F, et al. (2014). Reduction of delayed onset muscle soreness by a novel curcumin delivery system (Meriva®): A randomised, placebo-controlled trial. DOI:
10.1186/1550-2783-11-31
Add a helping of curcumin-loaded turmeric to oatmeal, eggs, smoothies, coffee, or baked goods to get the effect (and
healthier skin
too.).
Coffee
Good news for coffee lovers: Research suggests that a moderate dose of caffeine (about a cup or two or coffee) about an hour before working out can significantly reduce pain afterward.
Hurley C, et al. (2013). The effect of caffeine ingestion on delayed onset muscle soreness.
pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24164961
Here are some tips
for making best cup o’ joe ever.
Salmon
Loaded with anti-inflammatory omega-3 fats, antioxidants, and muscle-building protein, salmon is a close-to-perfect post-workout food.
Research has linked nutrients in salmon to increased muscle protein synthesis, the process that repairs and grows muscles.
Paulussen K, et al. (2020). Effects of salmon ingestion on post-exercise muscle protein synthesis: exploration of whole protein foods versus isolated nutrients. DOI:
10.1093/cdn/nzaa049_043
Throw a can on a green salad,
grill up some fillets,
or mix salmon with potatoes for salmon cakes.
Watermelon
There’s nothing quite as satisfying as biting into a cold, juicy piece of watermelon after a serious sweat session. But research on watermelon’s key amino acid, l-citrulline, suggests it might also soothe those sore muscles.
One study found that giving athletes watermelon juice — which contains the rind, the highest source of l-citrulline — after a workout helped reduce recovery heart rate and muscle soreness after 24 hours.
Tarazona-Díaz, M, et al. (2013). Watermelon juice: Potential functional drink for sore muscle relief in athletes. DOI:
10.1021/jf400964r
The natural sugars will also help drive protein into your muscles and replenish low glycogen stores, and the high water content is essential in preventing muscle-cramping dehydration.
Cleary M, et al. (2006). Dehydration and symptoms of delayed-onset muscle soreness in normothermic men.
ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1421497
Throw a little watermelon into your smoothie (include some of the rind for a boost of l-citrulline!
Rimando AM, et al. (2005). Determination of citrulline in watermelon rind.
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16007998/
), add it to a crunchy salad, or
infuse it in some water
for refreshing post-workout hydration.
Eggs
Protein is the essential building block of muscles, so it’s not surprising that research has found that consuming a protein source, like eggs, after an intensive endurance exercise may help reduce the risk of DOMS.
Jäger R, et al. (2017). International Society of Sports Nutrition position stand: Protein and exercise. DOI:
10.1186/s12970-017-0177-8
Like cottage cheese, eggs are a source of leucine, which is linked to muscle recovery.
Ra S-G, et al. (2013). Combined effect of branched-chain amino acids and taurine supplementation on delayed onset muscle soreness and muscle damage in high-intensity eccentric exercise. DOI:
10.1186/1550-2783-10-51
Since each 80-calorie egg packs an impressive
6 grams
of protein, we suggest prepping a big batch of
hard-boiled eggs
at the start of the week for easy post-workout snacks.
Bananas
Bananas are an easy-to-digest source of complex carbs that can help spike your insulin just enough to drive protein into your muscle and stimulate muscle rebuilding and growth.
They’re also a great source of the electrolyte potassium, which research suggests may help reduce muscle soreness post-gym.
Nieman D, et al. (2018). Metabolic recovery from heavy exertion following banana compared to sugar beverage or water only ingestion: A randomized, crossover trial. DOI:
10.1371/journal.pone.0194843
Pop one into a smoothie, slice it onto oats, or simply enjoy it straight out of the peel for a quick snack.
Foods to avoid when you have sore muscles
Now that we’ve got the good stuff down, let’s review what we should probably avoid. Neither of these will likely be a surprise.
Sugar
Since muscle pain is considered a form of inflammation, it makes sense to cut back on inflammatory foods on days you work out — most notably refined carbs like sugar.
A 2017 study of more than 12,000 people found that those who consumed more added sugar (such as sugar found in soda or used in coffee or tea) had higher levels of inflammatory markers than people who consumed less sugar.
O’Connor L, et al. (2017). Intakes and sources of dietary sugars and their association with metabolic and inflammatory markers. DOI:
10.1016/j.clnu.2017.05.030
The good news is that natural forms of sugar in foods like fruits, milk, whole grains, and veggies don’t have the same effect.
Joseph S, et al. (2016). Fruit polyphenols: A review of anti-inflammatory effects in humans.
pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25616409
So get your sweetness from whole foods when you can.
Alcohol
For obvious reasons, it might not be a great idea to plan a workout after too many tequila shots — but even a little booze can cause post-workout pain or up your risk of injury.
Alcohol dehydrates your cells, resulting in soreness, cramps, and potential strains. Research has also shown that it can interfere with blood flow and muscle recovery from injuries.
Barnes M. (2014). Alcohol: Impact on sports performance and recovery in male athletes. DOI:
10.1007/s40279-014-0192-8
The bottom line
If you’re busy building lean muscle and getting those gains, don’t forget to stock up on whole foods with the right nutrition to fuel your body and soothe aching muscles. Fruits, veggies, and proteins are solid choices for pre- and post-workout noshing.

How to hydrate
Dehydration symptoms
tl;dr
You need to hydrate! For once, the medical community is totally in agreement about something. Hydration is good, necessary, and (above all)
super
easy to do.
The best ways to hydrate when dehydrated
Here’s a quick rundown of the best ways to hydrate when you’re dehydrated:
Drink water.
No trickery here. It really is that simple!
Drink hydrating drinks that aren’t water.
Sports drinks, fruit juice, coconut water… plenty of drinks way more flavorful than water can rehydrate you quickly.
Enjoy some coffee or tea.
Even though coffee and tea contain caffeine, drinking them in moderation can help you stay hydrated.
Eat moisture-rich fruits and vegetables.
Many fruits and veggies are packed full of water.
Drink smoothies!
Fruits and vegetables, but drinkable.
Have soup.
Soup isn’t just nutritious and delicious — it can also have powerful hydrating effects.
Drink an oral hydration solution.
This will get your body back on track after significant fluid loss (like after diarrhea or puking).
There are a ton of ways to rehydrate that don’t require chugging H
2
O. Sports drinks, fruits and vegetables, soups — they all work to ease dehydration.
Let’s look at the science of staying hydrated, including the best ways to do it and how to spot dehydration.

How to hydrate
Staying hydrated isn’t difficult — but that doesn’t mean it’s simple. In addition to keeping the water levels in your body tip-top, it’s super important to consider electrolytes like sodium and potassium (especially in the long term).
Don’t worry, though — we’ve got you covered on
everything
hydration and hydration-adjacent. Here’s your one-stop definitive list of the best ways to hydrate.
1. Drink water
Water comes up a lot in the hydration conversation because hydration is all about making sure your body has enough of it.
Drinking enough water on the reg has a bunch of health benefits. It helps you:
have enough blood, since your body uses water to make blood
have a healthy brain, because your brain is about
73 percent water
regulate your body temperature, because you can’t sweat properly without enough water
digest nutrients smoothly, since water’s a crucial ingredient in both saliva and digestive fluids
develop healthy muscles, since they use water to do what they do
get a decent night’s sleep, because dehydration can cause leg cramps, dry cough, and loads of other sleep-interrupting issues
reduce your risk
of kidney stones, as water helps you flush out excess minerals via your pee
While it’s not the
only
way to hydrate, drinking water is the most efficient. It makes sense, doesn’t it? When you’re parched, your body is telling you it needs water. Putting H
2
O in your mouth is the most direct route.
High tide: Beware of overhydration
It’s important to remember that
overhydration is a thing
. Even water can be lethal if you drink too much of it.
But don’t run screaming from the faucet just yet. Overhydration has multiple stages:
First, you’ll take more frequent trips to the bathroom than usual.
Hyponatremia (low sodium levels in your blood) might occur later.
Overhydration leading to water intoxication or death is extremely rare.

points out, humans, like all other mammals, are actually pretty prone to overdrinking when we’re thirsty. It’s not as difficult to do as you might think. Your body gives you warning signs, though.
How to avoid overhydrating
The best way to avoid overhydration is to drink your water at a steady pace. It’s difficult to say exactly how much water is too much, because it varies not only from person to person but also from day to day.
If you’re exercising a lot, you’ll likely need to drink more water than people who don’t exercise as much. Most cases of overhydration involve people who have consumed more than a liter of water in less than an hour.
You’d have to drink
a lot
to trigger an acute case of water intoxication. Case in point: The
first reported death
from overhydration occurred in a person in a hospital who received an infusion of 9 liters of water in an hour. You’re unlikely to knock back that amount from a water bottle mid-run.
As with most things, your strongest defenses against overhydration are self-awareness and common sense. Stop drinking water if you experience a sudden onset of any of these symptoms:
nausea or vomiting
headache
disorientation, confusion, or irritation (any sudden/unexpected changes in mental state)
muscle cramps or spasms
seizures
How much water should I drink each day?
Your body is about
60 percent
water. When you do stuff like exercise or just exist, you use up your water reserves.
Proper hydration is critical for athletes and sporty types. But everybody should hydrate daily, no matter how much they move.
The more active you are, the more water you lose, so it’s especially important to hydrate during and after exercise. However, your heartbeat and breathing also require moisture. So do your blood, your brain, your digestive system… good golly, it’s a lot.
So the amount of water you need daily varies depending on the temperature, what you’re doing, your overall health, and the size of your body. As a
general rule
, most healthy folks can aim for a minimum of 8 cups (2 liters) per day without overhydrating.
A
2020 research review
suggests that drinking 2.5 to 3.5 liters per day can help you produce a healthy amount of urine. The authors note that this is a rough guideline, and they recommend judging your overall water intake by the color of your pee.
Medical conditions can affect your water needs
It’s also important to note that many medical conditions and medications can impact your recommended daily water intake.
If you take medication or have an underlying health condition, always speak with your doctor before changing your hydration plans.
2. Drink sports drinks, juice, or coconut water
Water is important and refreshing. Let’s be honest, though — it’s a little dull. Plus, if you’re drinking plain water, you’re missing out on other nutrients. This is where other refreshing beverages, like sports drinks and fruit juices, come in so darn handy.
Taste benefits aside, there are some advantages to rehydrating with a sports drink, coconut water, fruit juice, or another healthy, noncaffeinated, nonalcoholic beverage — especially if you’re trying to hydrate after exercise.
When you sweat, you don’t
only
lose water. Sweat also contains vast amounts of
electrolytes
, with the main three being:
sodium
potassium
chloride
Sodium is especially important when it comes to hydration, because one of its
key functions
is to regulate fluid levels in your cells and body.
Plain water doesn’t replenish any of these electrolytes.
Many drinks
, both natural and human-made, provide essential electrolytes, minerals, and vitamins. Since you also lose those during exercise (especially if you work out often), it’s important to keep your levels topped up.
The exact benefits depend on the drink. Many sports drinks will proudly advertise on the packaging how much sodium or general electrolyte goodness they’ll give you.
Pedialyte and Gatorade
are two widely available electrolyte-rich sports/medicinal drinks.
On the natural side, some fans of
coconut water
tout its higher-than-average electrolyte content, but there’s little to no scientific evidence to suggest it’s better for hydration than water or sports drinks.
In a
small 2012 study
with only 12 participants, researchers found no significant difference in hydration among those who drank coconut water, bottled water, and a typical sports drink after exercise.
3. Sip (a little) coffee or tea!
Caffeine makes you pee lots, so you might technically
lose
water if you consume a ton of it. But drinking coffee or tea in moderation can be effective for keeping you hydrated.
Research like this
small study from 2017
suggests that the levels of caffeine in an average cup of coffee or tea aren’t nearly enough to counteract the fact that the cup is also full of water.
As far as your body is concerned, a cup of hot tea/coffee is just water with a kick. So long as you’re not knocking back espressos all day, there’s no dehydration risk to sipping hot drinks. Your body will still get the hydrational benefits.
4. Eat some fruits and vegetables…
Drinking fluids isn’t the only way to hydrate yourself. Plenty of fruits (and some vegetables) are high in the water and electrolytes you need to keep dehydration at bay.
Spotting the fruits and veggies with high water content is easy. They’re the ones that leak a lot when you squash them, including:
melon (and watermelon, because obviously)
cucumber
orange
apple
raspberry
mango
kiwi
If it drips when you squeeze it hard, then chances are it’ll quench some thirst.
But remember that electrolytes are also pretty important. Some fruits and veg have a reputation for being hydration boosters, so including them in your diet might optimize your body’s management of H
2
O levels.
For example,
bananas
and dates aren’t the juiciest fruits in the store, but they
do
provide high levels of
potassium
. And supporting a healthy water balance in your bloodstream is one of potassium’s many
essential functions
.
Eating a banana won’t rehydrate you like drinking water will, but including potassium-rich foods like bananas in your diet will ensure you’re getting the most from every glass.
5. …or make them into a smoothie!
The hydration benefits of fresh fruits and vegetables also apply when they’re in
smoothie
form. Plus, by taking your fresh fruit or veg in liquid form, you can mash the best of Mother Nature together into a single electrolyte-dense, mega-hydrating super smoothie.
The other advantage of smoothies is that you can add supplements such as tablets and powders that boost your electrolyte intake, supporting your long-term hydration. Sure, you can add them to a glass of water. But, you know,
boring
.
You can find electrolyte supplements in most drugstores, and they’re also
available online
. Many larger stores also now stock them. Prices vary. And be sure to check the label for exact dosage and prep instructions.
It’s also important to check with a healthcare professional to discuss whether electrolyte supplements are right for you and to get advice on the right type and dosage for you.
The ingredients in your
hydrating smoothie
are obviously up to you. If you’re not sure where to start, why not try this electrolyte-packing glass of blended
blueberry banana
goodness?
6. Have some soup
Smoothies aren’t the only straddler of the food/drink fence when it comes to hydration benefits. Soup is also a great hydrator.
There are obviously
loads
of soups out there. Some will be more hydrating than others, but all are more hydrating than no soup at all. If you want a hearty soup that’s packed full of hydration-enabling electrolytes, why not try the
creamy vegan sweet potato soup
recipe below?
Electrolyte-packed creamy sweet potato soup
For this recipe, you’ll need sweet potato, kale, and white beans, all of which are great sources of electrolytes like sodium and potassium.
Ingredients
1 tablespoon
olive oil
or
avocado
oil
1/2 medium red onion, chopped
1 medium
carrot
, chopped
2 small
sweet potatoes
, chopped
1 medium red bell pepper, seeded and chopped
3 cloves
garlic
, minced
1 tablespoon fresh rosemary, finely chopped
2 cans cooked cannellini beans, drained and rinsed
4 cups vegetable broth
4 cups
kale
, chopped
2 tablespoons lemon juice
Pinch of red pepper flakes, for garnish
Instructions
Heat oil in a large pot over medium heat.
Add onion and cook for 5 minutes.
Add carrot and sweet potatoes and cook for 5 minutes.
Stir in bell pepper and cook for 3 minutes.
Add garlic and rosemary and cook for 1 more minute.
Add beans and broth, and then bring the whole shebang to a boil.
Spoon 2 cups of the soup into a blender and blend for 1 to 2 minutes (or until smooth).
Pour it back into the pot, add kale and lemon juice, and simmer for 5 minutes.
When serving, add red pepper flakes to taste.
7. Drink an oral rehydration solution
Oral rehydration solutions are medical products.
Dehydration
is a symptom and complication of many health conditions, especially ones that involve
excessive sweating
, vomiting, urination, or diarrhea.
Healthcare professionals may administer these solutions to people in hospitals or prescribe them for at-home use. Some oral rehydration solutions are available in drugstores, though, and there are also
recipes
to make them at home.
These solutions are used pretty much exclusively for medical-grade dehydration. If you’re just looking for a way to hydrate after exercise, it’s highly unlikely you’ll need one.
If you find that you can’t stay hydrated without an oral rehydration solution, it’s worth consulting a healthcare pro to find out whether you have an underlying health condition.
So what IS the fastest way to rehydrate?
Trick question. It’s not so much about what’s fastest but what’s best for your bod.
Unless you’ve lost a significant amount of fluid quickly (due to vomiting or diarrhea), drinking water is the way to go.
But drinking water won’t be as effective if you’re short on a few key electrolytes in your overall diet. If you find that water isn’t quite doing it for you, look into upping your electrolyte intake.
If you do need to rehydrate due to an illness, an oral rehydration solution may be more appropriate.
Symptoms of dehydration
So that’s the lowdown on rehydration, but what about
de
hydration?
Dehydration happens when your body isn’t hydrated enough (the clue is in the name, right?). If you’re worried that you may be dehydrated, here are some
symptoms
to look out for:
notable thirst
yellow/cloudy urine
dry mouth/lips/tongue
fatigue
disorientation, dizziness, or trouble focusing
shallow or rapid breathing
headache
muscle weakness/cramps
If you experience any of the above during your workout, it might be time to pause and top up your water levels.
If you’re not exercising and you feel dehydrated, then
definitely
go drink some water. It’s easy to dehydrate when exercising, but if you’re dehydrated when resting or not physically active, it’s a sign that you haven’t had enough fluids so far that day.
Complications of dehydration
Dehydration can lead to more serious health problems. Without treatment, even short-term dehydration can lead to
complications
, including:
dry or flaky skin
digestive issues like inflammation
constipation
constant
fatigue
frequent headaches
altered mental states
kidney failure
liver problems
low blood pressure
changes in acid-base balance throughout your body
swelling due to water retention (aka edema)
When to see a doctor about dehydration
Generally, you shouldn’t need to see a doctor about dehydration, because you can likely always rehydrate if you have access to water.
But if rehydrating doesn’t work or dehydration seems to set in quickly, contacting your doc becomes important, especially if you’re at rest when it happens.
Feeling a bit dehydrated on a hot day or after exercising is nothing to worry about. But if you find that you’re regularly dehydrated or that your attempts to rehydrate don’t alleviate your discomfort, seek medical attention ASAP.
Ultimately, you know your body best. If something feels wrong, it’s better to be safe than sorry, especially when it comes to water management.
How to hydrate: The final drops
Hydration is all about making sure your cells and organs have enough water. This is especially important during exercise, but all humans need to make proper hydration a priority.
On average, humans need to consume about 2 liters of water per day to stay hydrated. This varies hugely, though, and your exact hydration requirements will be based on a bunch of factors like your size, age, level of physical activity, general health, and diet.
Electrolytes like sodium and potassium are also critical for hydration. Drinking water is the most important factor, but making sure your body has enough electrolytes is just as important, especially if your active lifestyle means you lose a lot of your body’s water reserves through sweat.
The best way to hydrate is to drink water. This is far from the only way, and there are tastier alternatives (and some you don’t even have to drink, like melons and soup). Electrolyte supplements and tablets are also available and can make rehydration more efficient.
Dehydration can lead to serious complications, so it’s important to keep tabs on what your body is telling you about its water needs. If you start experiencing dehydration symptoms, don’t wait around. Get hydrated ASAP.

How to hydrate
Dehydration symptoms
tl;dr
You need to hydrate! For once, the medical community is totally in agreement about something. Hydration is good, necessary, and (above all)
super
easy to do.
The best ways to hydrate when dehydrated
Here’s a quick rundown of the best ways to hydrate when you’re dehydrated:
Drink water.
No trickery here. It really is that simple!
Drink hydrating drinks that aren’t water.
Sports drinks, fruit juice, coconut water… plenty of drinks way more flavorful than water can rehydrate you quickly.
Enjoy some coffee or tea.
Even though coffee and tea contain caffeine, drinking them in moderation can help you stay hydrated.
Eat moisture-rich fruits and vegetables.
Many fruits and veggies are packed full of water.
Drink smoothies!
Fruits and vegetables, but drinkable.
Have soup.
Soup isn’t just nutritious and delicious — it can also have powerful hydrating effects.
Drink an oral hydration solution.
This will get your body back on track after significant fluid loss (like after diarrhea or puking).
There are a ton of ways to rehydrate that don’t require chugging H
2
O. Sports drinks, fruits and vegetables, soups — they all work to ease dehydration.
Let’s look at the science of staying hydrated, including the best ways to do it and how to spot dehydration.

How to hydrate
Staying hydrated isn’t difficult — but that doesn’t mean it’s simple. In addition to keeping the water levels in your body tip-top, it’s super important to consider electrolytes like sodium and potassium (especially in the long term).
Don’t worry, though — we’ve got you covered on
everything
hydration and hydration-adjacent. Here’s your one-stop definitive list of the best ways to hydrate.
1. Drink water
Water comes up a lot in the hydration conversation because hydration is all about making sure your body has enough of it.
Drinking enough water on the reg has a bunch of health benefits. It helps you:
have enough blood, since your body uses water to make blood
have a healthy brain, because your brain is about
73 percent water
regulate your body temperature, because you can’t sweat properly without enough water
digest nutrients smoothly, since water’s a crucial ingredient in both saliva and digestive fluids
develop healthy muscles, since they use water to do what they do
get a decent night’s sleep, because dehydration can cause leg cramps, dry cough, and loads of other sleep-interrupting issues
reduce your risk
of kidney stones, as water helps you flush out excess minerals via your pee
While it’s not the
only
way to hydrate, drinking water is the most efficient. It makes sense, doesn’t it? When you’re parched, your body is telling you it needs water. Putting H
2
O in your mouth is the most direct route.
High tide: Beware of overhydration
It’s important to remember that
overhydration is a thing
. Even water can be lethal if you drink too much of it.
But don’t run screaming from the faucet just yet. Overhydration has multiple stages:
First, you’ll take more frequent trips to the bathroom than usual.
Hyponatremia (low sodium levels in your blood) might occur later.
Overhydration leading to water intoxication or death is extremely rare.
As this
2019 research review
points out, humans, like all other mammals, are actually pretty prone to overdrinking when we’re thirsty. It’s not as difficult to do as you might think. Your body gives you warning signs, though.
How to avoid overhydrating

So what IS the fastest way to rehydrate?
Trick question. It’s not so much about what’s fastest but what’s best for your bod.
Unless you’ve lost a significant amount of fluid quickly (due to vomiting or diarrhea), drinking water is the way to go.
But drinking water won’t be as effective if you’re short on a few key electrolytes in your overall diet. If you find that water isn’t quite doing it for you, look into upping your electrolyte intake.
If you do need to rehydrate due to an illness, an oral rehydration solution may be more appropriate.
Symptoms of dehydration
So that’s the lowdown on rehydration, but what about
de
hydration?
Dehydration happens when your body isn’t hydrated enough (the clue is in the name, right?). If you’re worried that you may be dehydrated, here are some
symptoms
to look out for:
notable thirst
yellow/cloudy urine
dry mouth/lips/tongue
fatigue
disorientation, dizziness, or trouble focusing
shallow or rapid breathing
headache
muscle weakness/cramps
If you experience any of the above during your workout, it might be time to pause and top up your water levels.
If you’re not exercising and you feel dehydrated, then
definitely
go drink some water. It’s easy to dehydrate when exercising, but if you’re dehydrated when resting or not physically active, it’s a sign that you haven’t had enough fluids so far that day.
Complications of dehydration
Dehydration can lead to more serious health problems. Without treatment, even short-term dehydration can lead to
complications
, including:
dry or flaky skin
digestive issues like inflammation
constipation
constant
fatigue
frequent headaches
altered mental states
kidney failure
liver problems
low blood pressure
changes in acid-base balance throughout your body
swelling due to water retention (aka edema)
When to see a doctor about dehydration
Generally, you shouldn’t need to see a doctor about dehydration, because you can likely always rehydrate if you have access to water.
But if rehydrating doesn’t work or dehydration seems to set in quickly, contacting your doc becomes important, especially if you’re at rest when it happens.
Feeling a bit dehydrated on a hot day or after exercising is nothing to worry about. But if you find that you’re regularly dehydrated or that your attempts to rehydrate don’t alleviate your discomfort, seek medical attention ASAP.
Ultimately, you know your body best. If something feels wrong, it’s better to be safe than sorry, especially when it comes to water management.
How to hydrate: The final drops
Hydration is all about making sure your cells and organs have enough water. This is especially important during exercise, but all humans need to make proper hydration a priority.
On average, humans need to consume about 2 liters of water per day to stay hydrated. This varies hugely, though, and your exact hydration requirements will be based on a bunch of factors like your size, age, level of physical activity, general health, and diet.
Electrolytes like sodium and potassium are also critical for hydration. Drinking water is the most important factor, but making sure your body has enough electrolytes is just as important, especially if your active lifestyle means you lose a lot of your body’s water reserves through sweat.
The best way to hydrate is to drink water. This is far from the only way, and there are tastier alternatives (and some you don’t even have to drink, like melons and soup). Electrolyte supplements and tablets are also available and can make rehydration more efficient.
Dehydration can lead to serious complications, so it’s important to keep tabs on what your body is telling you about its water needs. If you start experiencing dehydration symptoms, don’t wait around. Get hydrated ASAP.

How to hydrate
Dehydration symptoms
tl;dr
You need to hydrate! For once, the medical community is totally in agreement about something. Hydration is good, necessary, and (above all)
super
easy to do.
The best ways to hydrate when dehydrated
Here’s a quick rundown of the best ways to hydrate when you’re dehydrated:
Drink water.
No trickery here. It really is that simple!
Drink hydrating drinks that aren’t water.
Sports drinks, fruit juice, coconut water… plenty of drinks way more flavorful than water can rehydrate you quickly.
Enjoy some coffee or tea.
Even though coffee and tea contain caffeine, drinking them in moderation can help you stay hydrated.
Eat moisture-rich fruits and vegetables.
Many fruits and veggies are packed full of water.
Drink smoothies!
Fruits and vegetables, but drinkable.
Have soup.
Soup isn’t just nutritious and delicious — it can also have powerful hydrating effects.
Drink an oral hydration solution.
This will get your body back on track after significant fluid loss (like after diarrhea or puking).
There are a ton of ways to rehydrate that don’t require chugging H
2
O. Sports drinks, fruits and vegetables, soups — they all work to ease dehydration.
Let’s look at the science of staying hydrated, including the best ways to do it and how to spot dehydration.

How to hydrate
Staying hydrated isn’t difficult — but that doesn’t mean it’s simple. In addition to keeping the water levels in your body tip-top, it’s super important to consider electrolytes like sodium and potassium (especially in the long term).
Don’t worry, though — we’ve got you covered on
everything
hydration and hydration-adjacent. Here’s your one-stop definitive list of the best ways to hydrate.
1. Drink water
Water comes up a lot in the hydration conversation because hydration is all about making sure your body has enough of it.
Drinking enough water on the reg has a bunch of health benefits. It helps you:
have enough blood, since your body uses water to make blood
have a healthy brain, because your brain is about
73 percent water
regulate your body temperature, because you can’t sweat properly without enough water
digest nutrients smoothly, since water’s a crucial ingredient in both saliva and digestive fluids
develop healthy muscles, since they use water to do what they do
get a decent night’s sleep, because dehydration can cause leg cramps, dry cough, and loads of other sleep-interrupting issues
reduce your risk
of kidney stones, as water helps you flush out excess minerals via your pee
While it’s not the
only
way to hydrate, drinking water is the most efficient. It makes sense, doesn’t it? When you’re parched, your body is telling you it needs water. Putting H
2
O in your mouth is the most direct route.
High tide: Beware of overhydration
It’s important to remember that
overhydration is a thing
. Even water can be lethal if you drink too much of it.
But don’t run screaming from the faucet just yet. Overhydration has multiple stages:
First, you’ll take more frequent trips to the bathroom than usual.
Hyponatremia (low sodium levels in your blood) might occur later.
Overhydration leading to water intoxication or death is extremely rare.
As this
2019 research review
points out, humans, like all other mammals, are actually pretty prone to overdrinking when we’re thirsty. It’s not as difficult to do as you might think. Your body gives you warning signs, though.
How to avoid overhydrating
The best way to avoid overhydration is to drink your water at a steady pace. It’s difficult to say exactly how much water is too much, because it varies not only from person to person but also from day to day.
If you’re exercising a lot, you’ll likely need to drink more water than people who don’t exercise as much. Most cases of overhydration involve people who have consumed more than a liter of water in less than an hour.
You’d have to drink
a lot
to trigger an acute case of water intoxication. Case in point: The
first reported death
from overhydration occurred in a person in a hospital who received an infusion of 9 liters of water in an hour. You’re unlikely to knock back that amount from a water bottle mid-run.
As with most things, your strongest defenses against overhydration are self-awareness and common sense. Stop drinking water if you experience a sudden onset of any of these symptoms:
nausea or vomiting
headache
disorientation, confusion, or irritation (any sudden/unexpected changes in mental state)
muscle cramps or spasms
seizures
How much water should I drink each day?
Your body is about
60 percent
water. When you do stuff like exercise or just exist, you use up your water reserves.
Proper hydration is critical for athletes and sporty types. But everybody should hydrate daily, no matter how much they move.
The more active you are, the more water you lose, so it’s especially important to hydrate during and after exercise. However, your heartbeat and breathing also require moisture. So do your blood, your brain, your digestive system… good golly, it’s a lot.
So the amount of water you need daily varies depending on the temperature, what you’re doing, your overall health, and the size of your body. As a
general rule
, most healthy folks can aim for a minimum of 8 cups (2 liters) per day without overhydrating.
A
2020 research review
suggests that drinking 2.5 to 3.5 liters per day can help you produce a healthy amount of urine. The authors note that this is a rough guideline, and they recommend judging your overall water intake by the color of your pee.
Medical conditions can affect your water needs
It’s also important to note that many medical conditions and medications can impact your recommended daily water intake.
If you take medication or have an underlying health condition, always speak with your doctor before changing your hydration plans.
2. Drink sports drinks, juice, or coconut water
Water is important and refreshing. Let’s be honest, though — it’s a little dull. Plus, if you’re drinking plain water, you’re missing out on other nutrients. This is where other refreshing beverages, like sports drinks and fruit juices, come in so darn handy.
Taste benefits aside, there are some advantages to rehydrating with a sports drink, coconut water, fruit juice, or another healthy, noncaffeinated, nonalcoholic beverage — especially if you’re trying to hydrate after exercise.
When you sweat, you don’t
only
lose water. Sweat also contains vast amounts of
electrolytes
, with the main three being:
sodium
potassium
chloride
Sodium is especially important when it comes to hydration, because one of its
key functions
is to regulate fluid levels in your cells and body.
Plain water doesn’t replenish any of these electrolytes.
Many drinks
, both natural and human-made, provide essential electrolytes, minerals, and vitamins. Since you also lose those during exercise (especially if you work out often), it’s important to keep your levels topped up.
The exact benefits depend on the drink. Many sports drinks will proudly advertise on the packaging how much sodium or general electrolyte goodness they’ll give you.
Pedialyte and Gatorade
are two widely available electrolyte-rich sports/medicinal drinks.
On the natural side, some fans of
coconut water
tout its higher-than-average electrolyte content, but there’s little to no scientific evidence to suggest it’s better for hydration than water or sports drinks.
In a
small 2012 study
with only 12 participants, researchers found no significant difference in hydration among those who drank coconut water, bottled water, and a typical sports drink after exercise.
3. Sip (a little) coffee or tea!
Caffeine makes you pee lots, so you might technically
lose
water if you consume a ton of it. But drinking coffee or tea in moderation can be effective for keeping you hydrated.
Research like this
small study from 2017
suggests that the levels of caffeine in an average cup of coffee or tea aren’t nearly enough to counteract the fact that the cup is also full of water.
As far as your body is concerned, a cup of hot tea/coffee is just water with a kick. So long as you’re not knocking back espressos all day, there’s no dehydration risk to sipping hot drinks. Your body will still get the hydrational benefits.
4. Eat some fruits and vegetables…
Drinking fluids isn’t the only way to hydrate yourself. Plenty of fruits (and some vegetables) are high in the water and electrolytes you need to keep dehydration at bay.
Spotting the fruits and veggies with high water content is easy. They’re the ones that leak a lot when you squash them, including:
melon (and watermelon, because obviously)
cucumber
orange
apple
raspberry
mango
kiwi
If it drips when you squeeze it hard, then chances are it’ll quench some thirst.
But remember that electrolytes are also pretty important. Some fruits and veg have a reputation for being hydration boosters, so including them in your diet might optimize your body’s management of H
2
O levels.
For example,
bananas
and dates aren’t the juiciest fruits in the store, but they
do
provide high levels of
potassium
. And supporting a healthy water balance in your bloodstream is one of potassium’s many
essential functions
.
Eating a banana won’t rehydrate you like drinking water will, but including potassium-rich foods like bananas in your diet will ensure you’re getting the most from every glass.
5. …or make them into a smoothie!
The hydration benefits of fresh fruits and vegetables also apply when they’re in
smoothie
form. Plus, by taking your fresh fruit or veg in liquid form, you can mash the best of Mother Nature together into a single electrolyte-dense, mega-hydrating super smoothie.
The other advantage of smoothies is that you can add supplements such as tablets and powders that boost your electrolyte intake, supporting your long-term hydration. Sure, you can add them to a glass of water. But, you know,
boring
.
You can find electrolyte supplements in most drugstores, and they’re also
available online
. Many larger stores also now stock them. Prices vary. And be sure to check the label for exact dosage and prep instructions.
It’s also important to check with a healthcare professional to discuss whether electrolyte supplements are right for you and to get advice on the right type and dosage for you.
The ingredients in your
hydrating smoothie
are obviously up to you. If you’re not sure where to start, why not try this electrolyte-packing glass of blended
blueberry banana
goodness?
6. Have some soup
Smoothies aren’t the only straddler of the food/drink fence when it comes to hydration benefits. Soup is also a great hydrator.
There are obviously
loads
of soups out there. Some will be more hydrating than others, but all are more hydrating than no soup at all. If you want a hearty soup that’s packed full of hydration-enabling electrolytes, why not try the
creamy vegan sweet potato soup
recipe below?
Electrolyte-packed creamy sweet potato soup
For this recipe, you’ll need sweet potato, kale, and white beans, all of which are great sources of electrolytes like sodium and potassium.
Ingredients
1 tablespoon
olive oil
or
avocado
oil
1/2 medium red onion, chopped
1 medium
carrot
, chopped
2 small
sweet potatoes
, chopped
1 medium red bell pepper, seeded and chopped
3 cloves
garlic
, minced
1 tablespoon fresh rosemary, finely chopped
2 cans cooked cannellini beans, drained and rinsed
4 cups vegetable broth
4 cups
kale
, chopped
2 tablespoons lemon juice
Pinch of red pepper flakes, for garnish
Instructions
Heat oil in a large pot over medium heat.
Add onion and cook for 5 minutes.
Add carrot and sweet potatoes and cook for 5 minutes.
Stir in bell pepper and cook for 3 minutes.
Add garlic and rosemary and cook for 1 more minute.
Add beans and broth, and then bring the whole shebang to a boil.
Spoon 2 cups of the soup into a blender and blend for 1 to 2 minutes (or until smooth).
Pour it back into the pot, add kale and lemon juice, and simmer for 5 minutes.
When serving, add red pepper flakes to taste.
7. Drink an oral rehydration solution
Oral rehydration solutions are medical products.
Dehydration
is a symptom and complication of many health conditions, especially ones that involve
excessive sweating
, vomiting, urination, or diarrhea.
Healthcare professionals may administer these solutions to people in hospitals or prescribe them for at-home use. Some oral rehydration solutions are available in drugstores, though, and there are also
recipes
to make them at home.
These solutions are used pretty much exclusively for medical-grade dehydration. If you’re just looking for a way to hydrate after exercise, it’s highly unlikely you’ll need one.
If you find that you can’t stay hydrated without an oral rehydration solution, it’s worth consulting a healthcare pro to find out whether you have an underlying health condition.
So what IS the fastest way to rehydrate?
Trick question. It’s not so much about what’s fastest but what’s best for your bod.

dry mouth/lips/tongue

shallow or rapid breathing

How we chose the best home workout equipment
We consulted Katelyn Barrons,
an NASM-certified personal trainer and ACE health coach
, to determine the critical criteria for choosing home workout equipment. Her suggestions were deceptively simple, from pieces that let you add resistance to
basic bodyweight exercises
to fun
cardio equipment
to help motivate you on the days you just don’t want to do it.
With her suggestions, here are the criteria we used to pick the best home workout equipment:
Versatility.
Some pieces of equipment are single-use, and that’s fine. But others can be used for a variety of workout styles.
Space-saving.
We’re all jealous of those of you who have a dedicated room for
your home gym
. But most of us aren’t that lucky, so we considered the equipment’s square footage and how much storage space it requires.
Materials and quality.
Home workout equipment won’t take the same beating as pro gym equipment, but you want something that will last. Since home workout equipment encompasses a wide variety of products, we consulted consumer reviews. If reviews said a resistance band broke, or an
exercise bike
started squeaking or falling apart after 2 months, that product didn’t make this list.
Workout personality and style.
We made sure to include products for all kinds of workout personalities and styles. Use your preferences to pick equipment that will help you stick with your workout plan even when you’d rather eat a
doughnut on the couch
.
Vetted products.
We put every product through a thorough vetting process that checks for unsupported health claims and shady business practices. Only products that passed made our list.

Best yoga mat
Gaiam Essentials Thick Yoga Mat
Share on Pinterest
Price:
$
Yoga mats
aren’t just for yoga. Sure, they’re great for a
Downward-Facing Dog
, but they’re also a helpful cushion
for push-ups
and ab work. The Gaiam Essentials Thick Yoga Mat provides a soft, thick surface so you can really dig into your poses or cushion your bod when you’re on the floor. This mat is affordable, lightweight, and portable thanks to an included carrying strap.
It gets great reviews, with tons of people saying it’s high quality, easy to clean, and the right thickness. But some say it’s not as durable as they’d hope — and others say there’s a strong off-gassing smell at first.
Pros
72 in. long and 24 in. wide
2/5 in. thick
fun color options
comes with a carrying strap
great reviews
Cons
strong off-gassing smell

Best foam roller
AmazonBasics High-Density Foam Roller
Share on Pinterest
Price:
$
A
foam roller
isn’t a complex piece of equipment, and the AmazonBasics High-Density Foam Roller gets the job done at an affordable price. It comes in lots of colors and lengths, so you can choose one that fits your space. The high-density foam digs into your muscles like a gopher, so it will
work out knots and sore spots
. Fair warning: The pain of that first roll will legit make you scream. 😱
A seam on one side sticks out on some of the rollers, so keep an eye out if you end up buying — reviewers say it does
not
feel good to roll on that seam.
Pros
affordable
6 color choices
4 length options
high-density foam
Cons
raised seam does
not
feel good

Best equipment storage
Wallniture Guru Wall Mount
Share on Pinterest
Price:
$
Tripping over equipment is no one’s idea of a good time. The Wallniture Guru Wall Mount makes sure there’s no more tripping or piles of
workout gear
at the bottom of your closet. It provides vertical storage space for yoga mats, foam rollers, jump ropes, and resistance bands. You can install it in a closet or the garage to keep all your
gear organized
and out of sight.
It comes with hardware, but reviewers say the hardware is the weak point. You might want to substitute sturdier versions from the local hardware store.
Pros
stores foam rollers and yoga mats
includes three hooks for hanging jump ropes or resistance bands
lightweight
Cons
included hardware could be sturdier

Best home workout strength training equipment
Best ankle weights
Bala Bangles
Share on Pinterest
Price:
$$
Yesss, the ankle weights that blew up on social media.
They have a great aesthetic (with 7 stylish colors to choose from), and they’re also made from quality materials that reviewers love — recycled steel coated in super-soft silicone (no more scratchy weights, pls.). The elastic and fasteners are also designed to allow for a better fit than regular ankle weights that slide around everywhere.
They come with a handy carrying case, and you can choose from 1- or 2-pound (lb.) weights. Slip them on your wrists or ankles when you’re doing
Pilates
,
yoga
, walking your
dog
, or even
cooking
.
Reviewers say it’s super easy to move them from your ankles to your wrists during workouts. Many also say they love the fun pop of color they add to any sweat sesh.
Some say you need to practice adjusting them to avoid Velcro rubbing on your skin — but once you get the hang of it, using them is a breeze.
Pros
made from recycled steel and soft silicone
seven colors to choose from
can choose between 1- or 2-lb. weights
come with a matching carrying case
Cons
need to adjust carefully to avoid scratchy velcro

Best mini resistance bands
Fit Simplify Resistance Loop Exercise Bands
Share on Pinterest
“The first pieces of equipment I recommend for my clients are a set of mini
resistance bands
and dumbbells,” Barrons says. The Fit Simplify Resistance Loop Bands set includes five well-marked, color-coded resistance levels, so you can
intensify your workout
by switching up the bands.
This set includes an instruction booklet to get you started on resistance workouts ASAP. High quality rubber and a super small drawstring storage bag round out the features we love about this simple set — not to mention that it’s affordable AF.
On the downside, rubber resistance bands like these may roll when you do certain exercises, which can def get annoying for some.
Pros
convenient carrying case
5 color-coded resistance levels
high quality rubber
affordable
Cons
roll down occasionally
Shop now at Amazon
Best fabric resistance bands
Vergali Fabric Booty Bands
Share on Pinterest
Price:
$
The Vergali Fabric Booty Bands are 3.16 inches (in.) wide and feature latex covered in fabric to help prevent rolling. They’re pricier than rubber resistance bands, but they’re key for peeps mostly focused on building up
the lower body
since they don’t roll down as much.
This set comes with four resistance levels that are clearly marked with the weight of the resistance so you’re tuned in to how much you’re actually lifting. There’s also a training guide to get you started.
The biggest con for these is that a few reviewers say the bands get stretched out prematurely.
Pros
4 color-coded resistance levels
grippy latex on the inside
mesh carrying bag
training instructions
weight ranges printed on the bands
Cons
may stretch out over time

Best light dumbbells
BalanceFrom Dumbbell Set
Share on Pinterest
Price:
$$
If you prefer
traditional dumbbells
to an adjustable set, Barrons suggests buying a lightweight set like this one from BalanceFrom (along with a heavyweight set, which we’ve got a rec for below). This set includes 3-, 5-, and 8-lb. weights and a stand to hold ’em. The neoprene covers make the weights easy to grip and
outdoor workout
-friendly, since they won’t rust.
We like that this set includes a storage tree, but some reviewers say the stand is flimsy and breaks easily.
Pros
included storage tree
neoprene covers for indoor/outdoor use
great starter weights
Cons
questionable quality control on the stand
Shop now at Amazon
Best heavy dumbbells
Cap Coated Dumbbell Weight
Share on Pinterest
Price:
$–$$$$
The Cap Coated Dumbbell Weights are high quality and come in an impressive range of weights. You can choose anywhere from 3- to 120-lb. dumbbells, depending on your
fitness level and goals
. The textured grip is also key for keeping good control through each move.
On the downside, you have to buy the weights individually, and the heavier the weight, the higher the price. There’s also no storage tree, so you’ll have to keep these bad boys on the floor or buy a storage rack separately.
Pros
textured grip
stable hexagon shape
solid cast iron with rubber coating to prevent rust
wide range of weight options
Cons
have to buy weights individually
no storage tree
Shop now at Amazon
Best adjustable dumbbells
ATIVAFIT Adjustable Dumbbell Fitness Dial Dumbbell
Share on Pinterest
Price:
$$$
The ATIVAFIT Adjustable Dumbbell Fitness Dial Dumbbell offers better weight options and quality than some of the more popular
adjustable dumbbells
(we’re looking at you,
Bowflex
). The weight range alone is impressive — 5.5 to 71.5 lbs. per dumbbell. It includes a storage cradle to keep it from rolling around too.
On the downside, it’s pricey. And we do mean “it.” If you want two of these dumbbells, you’ll have to make sure to add two to the shopping cart, because they’re not sold as a set.
Pros
saves space
includes storage cradle
great weight range (5.5–71.5 lbs.)
quick-switch design
Cons
sold individually
pricey
Shop now at Amazon
Best budget adjustable dumbbells
Yes4All Adjustable Dumbbell
Share on Pinterest
Price:
$–$$$$
The Yes4All Adjustable Dumbbell offers lots of weight options at a price that won’t require you to
donate plasma
. It’s sold as a single dumbbell — which isn’t so cool — but buying two is still relatively affordable. If you’ve ever used a traditional barbell, collar, and
weight plates
, the design of this dumbbell will feel familiar. It also includes locking collars, so the plates won’t slam into your hand.
Pros
traditional weight design
locking collars
durable cast-iron plates
textured handle
Cons
sold individually
no storage tree

Best kettlebell
Kettle Gryp
Share on Pinterest
Price:
$
You’re probably saying, “Hey, that’s not
a kettlebell
.” Just wait. Remember how it’s a good idea to save space with your home equipment? The Kettle Gryp lets you use a dumbbell as a kettlebell. It’s cheaper than a kettlebell, and you can use it with different weights to increase or decrease the difficulty.
The only downside is that it doesn’t work with
every
dumbbell grip.
Pros
versatile
saves space
works with different dumbbell weights
affordable
Cons
may not fit all dumbbell grips
Shop now at Amazon
Best suspension system
TRX GO Suspension Trainer System
Share on Pinterest
Price:
$$
Suspension training
has gained popularity as people have looked for new workout equipment for small spaces. The
TRX Go Suspension Trainer System
stands out for quality and user-friendliness, both of which are musts for a good suspension trainer. You can hang it on a tree or a door or use anchors. Locking loops and a single anchor make it easy to set up at home.
Suspension training goes easy on your joints, and you can adjust the moves to different fitness levels. Even TRX newbies can get a serious workout. You can also pack it up and take it with you
on the road
.
But it can take some time to figure out the exercises. Take it slow and give yourself time to learn how to use it correctly — it’ll be worth it, we promise.
Pros
easy on the joints
adjustable to different fitness levels
lightweight and portable
total-body workout
well made
Cons
may require separately sold anchors
takes practice to use correctly

Best folding squat rack
Rogue RML-3W Fold Back Wall Mount Rack
Share on Pinterest
Price:
$$$$
A
folding squat rack
is an amazing addition to any home gym — especially if you’re looking to get into heavier-duty
weightlifting
.
This one from Rogue is made from high quality materials but won’t completely drain your bank account. It can hold up to 1,000 lbs. (which we can all agree is plenty).
It comes with a pull-up bar and J-hooks to hold your barbell. It’s also compatible with 88 different accessories — so you can basically use it as a starter to a fully stocked home gym.
The best part? It folds away to a less than 5-inch depth when you’re not using it.
Reviewers love how sturdy and simple the rack is. They say it shipped super quickly and is hella easy to install.
Pros
high quality materials
folds away to 5 inches when you’re not using it
compatible with 88 different accessories
holds up to 1,000 lbs.
easy to install
Cons
still need to purchase barbells and weight plates

Best barbell
Rogue The Ohio Bar
Share on Pinterest
Price:
$$$$
Pair your new squat rack with one of Rogue’s best-selling
barbells
— the Ohio Bar.
The brand manufactures
this barbell
in the US of A (in Ohio, if you couldn’t tell). It’s made with high quality stainless steel and has a lifetime warranty to back it up.
It’s designed for Olympic and
Powerlifting
, with knurling (aka rough texture) to give you a better grip.
Many reviewers say this is one of the best additions to their home gyms. They love how high quality it feels and appreciate that the knurling gives some grip without being super uncomfortable (and even painful).
Pros
high quality stainless steel
designed for Olympic and Powerlifting
knurling allows for better grip
amazing reviews
lifetime warranty
Cons
expensive

Best weight plates
Rogue HG 2.0 Bumper Plates
Share on Pinterest
Price:
$$$$
You have your squat rack and your barbell — now it’s time for some
weight plates
.
We recommend going for a pair of
bumper plates
for your home gym. They’re typically made from rubber and are designed to be dropped without breaking the plate (or your floors!).
These bumper plates are sold in pairs up to 1,000 lbs. They’re made from recycled rubber and have a stainless steel center. This combo helps reduce bounce and noise and increases durability.
Reviewers LOVE these plates. Many say the quality for the price is unmatched. They also love the way these look in their home gyms.
Just keep in mind that bumper plates tend to take up a lot of space. They’re great if you’ve got a designated garage gym, but they’re def not super easy to stash away when you’re not using them.
Pros
designed to bounce without breaking
durable
sold as pairs or sets
good quality for price
Cons
take up a lot of space

Best weight bench
ProForm Carbon Strength Adjustable Bench
Share on Pinterest
Price:
$$$
Whether you’re looking to do step-ups, Bulgarian split squats,
tricep dips
, or incline/decline
dumbbell workouts
, a
weight bench
adds a whole lot of spice to your average workout.
We love this bench from ProForm because it’s made with high quality, durable materials for a great price.
It can hold up to 610 lbs. (you + whatever
dumbbells
you’re using) and has anti-slip rubber feet to keep it in place. It also has 6 adjustable seat positions and 11 adjustable back positions.
There aren’t a ton of reviews, but the few that exist say the bench is super easy to assemble. They’re also v satisfied with the quality.
Pros
adjustable to incline, decline, military, and flat positions
wheels for easy transport
easy to assemble
anti-slip rubber feet
affordable
Cons
not a ton of reviews

Best pull-up bar
JFIT Deluxe Multi Exercise Doorway Pull-Up Bar
Share on Pinterest
Price:
$
Not enough room for a full-on
squat rack
but want to do pull-ups at home? A doorway
pull-up bar
like this one could be the perf solution.
It’s way sturdier than your average doorway pull-up bar because you install it with hardware. When you don’t use it, you store away the bar and the hardware still allows you to use your doorway as usual.
It has a weight capacity of 300 lbs. and can be installed basically anywhere that it fits. Some reviewers use it in a hallway instead of a doorway.
Pros
sturdier than traditional doorway pull-up bars
affordable
easy to install and use
300-lb. weight capacity
Cons
some reviewers complain of doorway damage

Best home workout cardio equipment
Best treadmill
ProForm Pro 9000 Treadmill
Share on Pinterest
Price:
$$$$
Barrons says, “If you live somewhere where the weather won’t be reliable for getting
cardio in outside year-round
, a
home treadmill
… would really be worth the investment.”
We’re big fans of
ProForm treadmills
because they bring the right balance of quality and price. This treadmill in particular has all of the smart features you love to see in a high-end treadmill — like a 22-inch touch screen, Bluetooth connectivity, and connected fitness options (helllllo iFit!) — at a reasonable price.
We also love that trainers can automatically change your speed and incline based on the class you’re taking. Pretty fricken cool, right?
To top it off, this treadmill is easy to fold up to save space when you’re not using it. It also has a great maximum weight capacity (300 lbs.), speed (12 miles per hour), and incline (-3 to 12%) making this particular model a great pick for runners at any level.
Pros
Bluetooth connectivity
works with iFit subscription
22-inch display
12-miles per hour maximum speed
-3 to 12% incline
sturdy folding build saves space
Cons
difficult to turn on without signing up for an iFit subscription

Best exercise bike
Bowflex C6 Bike
Share on Pinterest
Price:
$$$$
Running isn’t for everyone. If you’re more of a
cycling person
, the Bowflex C6 Bike might be more your thing. “I recently invested in the
Bowflex C6 Bike
and am loving it,” says Barrons. That’s high praise from a pro.
The C6 brings a smooth ride with magnetic resistance. While it doesn’t have a built-in screen, the cradle fits most devices, and the bike offers Bluetooth connectivity and works with a variety of apps (including
Peloton
— but with limited functionality). We also love the toe clips so you can work your legs on the up and down strokes.
This bike is pricey, but it’s an investment worth making
if you love indoor cycling
.
Pros
comfortable, smooth, quiet ride
includes toe clips
built-in weight cradles
Bluetooth connectivity
magnetic resistance
Cons
expensive
need tablet or a Chrome-enabled device to get the most out of the bike

Best budget cardio machine
Sunny Health & Fitness Squat Assist Row-N-Ride Trainer
Share on Pinterest
Price:
$$
Get some cardio and killer buns on the same machine! Using the Sunny Health & Fitness Squat Assist Row-N-Ride is like doing
squats on fat-burning steroids
. This cardio workout will seriously mold and
sculpt your backside
, and the price is amazing.
It has great adjustability in the seat, handlebars, and squat depth for a machine at this price. That depth adjustment is particularly important, so you won’t injure your knees or hips. The Row-N-Ride includes three resistance bands to adjust the difficulty level. You have to change them manually, which we don’t love — but hey, it’s cheap.
Pros
inexpensive
surprisingly effective workout
adjustable seat
adjustable handlebar positions
adjustable squat depth
Cons
manual resistance adjustment

Best elliptical
NordicTrack FS10i Elliptical
Share on Pinterest
Price:
$$$$
Ellipticals
are the bomb for getting a
low impact workout
without sacrificing intensity.
We love this one from NordicTrack because it’s got tons of awesome features. Depending on your mood, you can use it as a traditional elliptical, a stair stepper, or a
treadmill
(wait, what?!). The brand says all you need to do is adjust your natural motion and the machine adjusts with you.
With 24 resistance levels and up to a 10 percent incline, you’re basically guaranteed a tough workout. And with a 10-inch touch screen and tons of iFit classes to choose from, you’re less likely to get totally bored of it too.
Reviewers love how smooth it rides and say it’s an amazing low impact alternative to
running
. They also appreciate how motivating iFit classes are — it’s supposedly MUCH better than using any old elliptical at the gym.
Pros
3-in-1 machines (elliptical, stair stepper, treadmill)
low impact cardio workout
iFit compatible
24 resistance levels and 10% incline
Cons
takes up a lot of space

Best jump rope
Froning SR-1F Speed Rope 2.0
Share on Pinterest
Price:
$
Do cardio old-school with
a jump rope
. If you haven’t jumped rope for a while, be prepared to poop out pretty quick. The Froning SR-1F Speed Rope 2.0 is a great option for
you CrossFitters
who are working on your double-unders. But it’s not just for seasoned athletes — it’s got easy-to-hold handles, an adjustable cable, and smooth movement that beginners can appreciate too.
But you can’t use this jump rope on an abrasive surface like pavement, because it can wear out the cable. So, grass works, carpet works, but if you’re jumping in your garage, you’ll need a rubber mat to protect the cable.
Pros
strong, flexible polyurethane cable
high speed bearings
adjustable cable length
Cons
only for use on nonabrasive surfaces

Best punching bag
Dripex Freestanding Punching Bag
Share on Pinterest
Price:
$$$
The Dripex Freestanding
Punching Bag
stands strong while you
hit, kick, and elbow
your way to a stronger body. A base that holds sand or water (sand is typically sturdier) provides the counterweight, but it’s further stabilized by 12 suction cups on the bottom. The only bummer is that the suction cups need a relatively smooth surface to maintain full suction.
A high quality leather cover, stainless steel tube-covered EPE foam, and fabric buffers make this thing durable enough to take a
daily beating
. Plus, shock absorbers and springs help reduce noise. You can even remove the springs to do more intense strength training if you want.
Reviewers say filling the base isn’t the easiest because of the small fill hole, but once it’s done, you’re good to get punching.
Pros
high quality leather cover
shock-absorbing design
suction cup stabilizers
stands 69 in. high, working well for adults and teens
sturdy, especially when the base is filled with sand
Cons
small fill hole on the base
suction cups don’t work on all surfaces

Tonal

Price:

The
Tonal
is a smart gym that works kind of like a cable press machine — but
smarter
.
The gym mounts to a wall and has two arms that you can attach different accessories to, including handles, a bar, and a rope.
It uses digital weight to adjust the tension up to 200 lbs. You can configure the arms in multiple ways to do
upper body
,
lower body
, and
core exercises
.
Bring the arms toward the floor and you can use the bar attachment to do back
squats
, bent over rows, or
bicep curls
. Set them toward the ceiling and you can do lat pulldowns, upright rows, or
tricep
pushdowns. Use the bench accessory and you can do bench presses and Bulgarian split squats.
The Tonal has tons of
strength
,
yoga
,
cardio
, and
HIIT
classes to choose from and 17 different sensors to detect your form.
Reviewers are overall obsessed with the Tonal. Some say it’s louder than they expected and definitely pricey — but most see it as an amazing investment.
Pros
can do lower body, upper body, and core exercises
connected fitness with live and on-demand classes
sensors detect and suggest corrections for form

Reviewers are super satisfied. Many say it has enough variety that it works for the whole family. Others say it’s made them quit the gym completely.
Pros
great for bodyweight and dumbbell workouts
discreet
tons of variety

Cons

How to choose the right home workout equipment for you
Strength, cardio, or both?
First things first: Nail down what kind of workout you want to focus on at home. If you get plenty of cardio on your outdoor runs, maybe you just need to focus on strength training at home. If you attend in-studio Pilates, barre, or yoga classes, it might make sense to focus more on at-home cardio. Everyone’s needs are different.
If you’re looking to do resistance training, it’s a good idea to focus more on weights and resistance bands.
“The adjustable dumbbell sets are a great way to have lots of weight options without taking up a ton of space, but if you prefer regular dumbbells, a lighter pair (5 to 10 lbs.) and a heavier pair (15 to 30 lbs.) is a great place to start,” suggests Barrons.
Barrons also recommends using resistance bands to make exercises harder before moving up in weight.
If you’re more focused on cardio, make sure you pick an option that’ll keep you coming back for more as often as possible. “Cardio is the first thing that I might skip, so having an easy, fun option at home makes it the [less likely] that will happen!” says Barrons.
Workouts you like
Boxing,
suspension training, and pull-ups aren’t for everyone. Tailor your home gym to your workout preferences — and don’t forget the battle with boredom. It pays to have a few different types of workout equipment around to spice up your routine. You’ll start skipping if your workouts become a yawn fest.
Size and storage
While there are a couple of behemoths on this list, we looked for space-optimizing equipment where we could, like
a foldable treadmill
, adjustable kettlebells and weights, and suspension trainers.
If you have room for bigger cardio machines, go for it! But if not, look for equipment with a smaller footprint that can still give you a killer cardio workout, like
a jump rope
or punching bag.
Injury prevention and comfort
Some equipment is worth having around to keep your body in working order. A foam roller, for example, can relax muscles and keep injuries at bay. A
good yoga mat
can cushion your joints while you’re doing floor work or stretching. Whatever helps
keep your body working
at its best belongs among your home workout equipment.
The bottom line
With home workout equipment, you can keep your body in tip-top shape without traveling to the gym to work out with 100 sweaty strangers. You can invest in larger equipment or start small with a few dumbbells and resistance bands.
No matter your workout style or budget, there’s equipment out there to keep you challenged and invested in your training routine.

How we chose the best home workout equipment
We consulted Katelyn Barrons,
an NASM-certified personal trainer and ACE health coach
, to determine the critical criteria for choosing home workout equipment. Her suggestions were deceptively simple, from pieces that let you add resistance to
basic bodyweight exercises
to fun
cardio equipment
to help motivate you on the days you just don’t want to do it.
With her suggestions, here are the criteria we used to pick the best home workout equipment:
Versatility.
Some pieces of equipment are single-use, and that’s fine. But others can be used for a variety of workout styles.
Space-saving.
We’re all jealous of those of you who have a dedicated room for
your home gym
. But most of us aren’t that lucky, so we considered the equipment’s square footage and how much storage space it requires.
Materials and quality.
Home workout equipment won’t take the same beating as pro gym equipment, but you want something that will last. Since home workout equipment encompasses a wide variety of products, we consulted consumer reviews. If reviews said a resistance band broke, or an
exercise bike
started squeaking or falling apart after 2 months, that product didn’t make this list.
Workout personality and style.
We made sure to include products for all kinds of workout personalities and styles. Use your preferences to pick equipment that will help you stick with your workout plan even when you’d rather eat a
doughnut on the couch
.
Vetted products.
We put every product through a thorough vetting process that checks for unsupported health claims and shady business practices. Only products that passed made our list.

Best yoga mat
Gaiam Essentials Thick Yoga Mat
Share on Pinterest
Price:
$
Yoga mats
aren’t just for yoga. Sure, they’re great for a
Downward-Facing Dog
, but they’re also a helpful cushion
for push-ups
and ab work. The Gaiam Essentials Thick Yoga Mat provides a soft, thick surface so you can really dig into your poses or cushion your bod when you’re on the floor. This mat is affordable, lightweight, and portable thanks to an included carrying strap.
It gets great reviews, with tons of people saying it’s high quality, easy to clean, and the right thickness. But some say it’s not as durable as they’d hope — and others say there’s a strong off-gassing smell at first.
Pros
72 in. long and 24 in. wide
2/5 in. thick
fun color options
comes with a carrying strap
great reviews
Cons
strong off-gassing smell

Best foam roller
AmazonBasics High-Density Foam Roller
Share on Pinterest
Price:
$
A
foam roller
isn’t a complex piece of equipment, and the AmazonBasics High-Density Foam Roller gets the job done at an affordable price. It comes in lots of colors and lengths, so you can choose one that fits your space. The high-density foam digs into your muscles like a gopher, so it will
work out knots and sore spots
. Fair warning: The pain of that first roll will legit make you scream. 😱
A seam on one side sticks out on some of the rollers, so keep an eye out if you end up buying — reviewers say it does
not
feel good to roll on that seam.
Pros
affordable
6 color choices
4 length options
high-density foam
Cons
raised seam does
not
feel good

Best equipment storage
Wallniture Guru Wall Mount
Share on Pinterest
Price:
$
Tripping over equipment is no one’s idea of a good time. The Wallniture Guru Wall Mount makes sure there’s no more tripping or piles of
workout gear
at the bottom of your closet. It provides vertical storage space for yoga mats, foam rollers, jump ropes, and resistance bands. You can install it in a closet or the garage to keep all your
gear organized
and out of sight.
It comes with hardware, but reviewers say the hardware is the weak point. You might want to substitute sturdier versions from the local hardware store.
Pros
stores foam rollers and yoga mats
includes three hooks for hanging jump ropes or resistance bands
lightweight
Cons
included hardware could be sturdier

Best home workout strength training equipment
Best ankle weights
Bala Bangles
Share on Pinterest
Price:
$$
Yesss, the ankle weights that blew up on social media.
They have a great aesthetic (with 7 stylish colors to choose from), and they’re also made from quality materials that reviewers love — recycled steel coated in super-soft silicone (no more scratchy weights, pls.). The elastic and fasteners are also designed to allow for a better fit than regular ankle weights that slide around everywhere.
They come with a handy carrying case, and you can choose from 1- or 2-pound (lb.) weights. Slip them on your wrists or ankles when you’re doing
Pilates
,
yoga
, walking your
dog
, or even
cooking
.
Reviewers say it’s super easy to move them from your ankles to your wrists during workouts. Many also say they love the fun pop of color they add to any sweat sesh.
Some say you need to practice adjusting them to avoid Velcro rubbing on your skin — but once you get the hang of it, using them is a breeze.
Pros
made from recycled steel and soft silicone
seven colors to choose from
can choose between 1- or 2-lb. weights
come with a matching carrying case
Cons
need to adjust carefully to avoid scratchy velcro

Best mini resistance bands
Fit Simplify Resistance Loop Exercise Bands
Share on Pinterest
“The first pieces of equipment I recommend for my clients are a set of mini
resistance bands
and dumbbells,” Barrons says. The Fit Simplify Resistance Loop Bands set includes five well-marked, color-coded resistance levels, so you can
intensify your workout
by switching up the bands.
This set includes an instruction booklet to get you started on resistance workouts ASAP. High quality rubber and a super small drawstring storage bag round out the features we love about this simple set — not to mention that it’s affordable AF.
On the downside, rubber resistance bands like these may roll when you do certain exercises, which can def get annoying for some.
Pros
convenient carrying case
5 color-coded resistance levels
high quality rubber
affordable
Cons
roll down occasionally
Shop now at Amazon
Best fabric resistance bands
Vergali Fabric Booty Bands
Share on Pinterest
Price:
$
The Vergali Fabric Booty Bands are 3.16 inches (in.) wide and feature latex covered in fabric to help prevent rolling. They’re pricier than rubber resistance bands, but they’re key for peeps mostly focused on building up
the lower body
since they don’t roll down as much.
This set comes with four resistance levels that are clearly marked with the weight of the resistance so you’re tuned in to how much you’re actually lifting. There’s also a training guide to get you started.
The biggest con for these is that a few reviewers say the bands get stretched out prematurely.
Pros
4 color-coded resistance levels
grippy latex on the inside
mesh carrying bag
training instructions
weight ranges printed on the bands
Cons
may stretch out over time
Shop now at Amazon
Best light dumbbells
BalanceFrom Dumbbell Set
Share on Pinterest
Price:
$$
If you prefer
traditional dumbbells
to an adjustable set, Barrons suggests buying a lightweight set like this one from BalanceFrom (along with a heavyweight set, which we’ve got a rec for below). This set includes 3-, 5-, and 8-lb. weights and a stand to hold ’em. The neoprene covers make the weights easy to grip and
outdoor workout
-friendly, since they won’t rust.
We like that this set includes a storage tree, but some reviewers say the stand is flimsy and breaks easily.
Pros
included storage tree
neoprene covers for indoor/outdoor use
great starter weights
Cons
questionable quality control on the stand
Shop now at Amazon
Best heavy dumbbells
Cap Coated Dumbbell Weight
Share on Pinterest
Price:
$–$$$$
The Cap Coated Dumbbell Weights are high quality and come in an impressive range of weights. You can choose anywhere from 3- to 120-lb. dumbbells, depending on your
fitness level and goals
. The textured grip is also key for keeping good control through each move.
On the downside, you have to buy the weights individually, and the heavier the weight, the higher the price. There’s also no storage tree, so you’ll have to keep these bad boys on the floor or buy a storage rack separately.
Pros
textured grip
stable hexagon shape
solid cast iron with rubber coating to prevent rust
wide range of weight options
Cons
have to buy weights individually
no storage tree
Shop now at Amazon
Best adjustable dumbbells
ATIVAFIT Adjustable Dumbbell Fitness Dial Dumbbell
Share on Pinterest
Price:
$$$
The ATIVAFIT Adjustable Dumbbell Fitness Dial Dumbbell offers better weight options and quality than some of the more popular
adjustable dumbbells
(we’re looking at you,
Bowflex
). The weight range alone is impressive — 5.5 to 71.5 lbs. per dumbbell. It includes a storage cradle to keep it from rolling around too.
On the downside, it’s pricey. And we do mean “it.” If you want two of these dumbbells, you’ll have to make sure to add two to the shopping cart, because they’re not sold as a set.
Pros
saves space
includes storage cradle
great weight range (5.5–71.5 lbs.)
quick-switch design
Cons
sold individually
pricey
Shop now at Amazon
Best budget adjustable dumbbells
Yes4All Adjustable Dumbbell
Share on Pinterest
Price:
$–$$$$
The Yes4All Adjustable Dumbbell offers lots of weight options at a price that won’t require you to
donate plasma
. It’s sold as a single dumbbell — which isn’t so cool — but buying two is still relatively affordable. If you’ve ever used a traditional barbell, collar, and
weight plates
, the design of this dumbbell will feel familiar. It also includes locking collars, so the plates won’t slam into your hand.
Pros
traditional weight design
locking collars
durable cast-iron plates
textured handle
Cons
sold individually
no storage tree
Shop now at Amazon
Best kettlebell
Kettle Gryp
Share on Pinterest
Price:
$
You’re probably saying, “Hey, that’s not
a kettlebell
.” Just wait. Remember how it’s a good idea to save space with your home equipment? The Kettle Gryp lets you use a dumbbell as a kettlebell. It’s cheaper than a kettlebell, and you can use it with different weights to increase or decrease the difficulty.
The only downside is that it doesn’t work with
every
dumbbell grip.
Pros
versatile
saves space
works with different dumbbell weights
affordable
Cons
may not fit all dumbbell grips
Shop now at Amazon
Best suspension system
TRX GO Suspension Trainer System
Share on Pinterest
Price:
$$
Suspension training
has gained popularity as people have looked for new workout equipment for small spaces. The
TRX Go Suspension Trainer System
stands out for quality and user-friendliness, both of which are musts for a good suspension trainer. You can hang it on a tree or a door or use anchors. Locking loops and a single anchor make it easy to set up at home.
Suspension training goes easy on your joints, and you can adjust the moves to different fitness levels. Even TRX newbies can get a serious workout. You can also pack it up and take it with you
on the road
.
But it can take some time to figure out the exercises. Take it slow and give yourself time to learn how to use it correctly — it’ll be worth it, we promise.
Pros
easy on the joints
adjustable to different fitness levels
lightweight and portable
total-body workout
well made
Cons
may require separately sold anchors
takes practice to use correctly

Best folding squat rack
Rogue RML-3W Fold Back Wall Mount Rack
Share on Pinterest
Price:
$$$$
A
folding squat rack
is an amazing addition to any home gym — especially if you’re looking to get into heavier-duty
weightlifting
.
This one from Rogue is made from high quality materials but won’t completely drain your bank account. It can hold up to 1,000 lbs. (which we can all agree is plenty).
It comes with a pull-up bar and J-hooks to hold your barbell. It’s also compatible with 88 different accessories — so you can basically use it as a starter to a fully stocked home gym.
The best part? It folds away to a less than 5-inch depth when you’re not using it.
Reviewers love how sturdy and simple the rack is. They say it shipped super quickly and is hella easy to install.
Pros
high quality materials
folds away to 5 inches when you’re not using it
compatible with 88 different accessories
holds up to 1,000 lbs.
easy to install
Cons
still need to purchase barbells and weight plates

Best barbell
Rogue The Ohio Bar
Share on Pinterest
Price:
$$$$
Pair your new squat rack with one of Rogue’s best-selling
barbells
— the Ohio Bar.
The brand manufactures
this barbell
in the US of A (in Ohio, if you couldn’t tell). It’s made with high quality stainless steel and has a lifetime warranty to back it up.
It’s designed for Olympic and
Powerlifting
, with knurling (aka rough texture) to give you a better grip.
Many reviewers say this is one of the best additions to their home gyms. They love how high quality it feels and appreciate that the knurling gives some grip without being super uncomfortable (and even painful).
Pros
high quality stainless steel
designed for Olympic and Powerlifting
knurling allows for better grip
amazing reviews
lifetime warranty
Cons
expensive

Best weight plates
Rogue HG 2.0 Bumper Plates
Share on Pinterest
Price:
$$$$
You have your squat rack and your barbell — now it’s time for some
weight plates
.
We recommend going for a pair of
bumper plates
for your home gym. They’re typically made from rubber and are designed to be dropped without breaking the plate (or your floors!).
These bumper plates are sold in pairs up to 1,000 lbs. They’re made from recycled rubber and have a stainless steel center. This combo helps reduce bounce and noise and increases durability.
Reviewers LOVE these plates. Many say the quality for the price is unmatched. They also love the way these look in their home gyms.
Just keep in mind that bumper plates tend to take up a lot of space. They’re great if you’ve got a designated garage gym, but they’re def not super easy to stash away when you’re not using them.
Pros
designed to bounce without breaking
durable
sold as pairs or sets
good quality for price
Cons
take up a lot of space

Best weight bench
ProForm Carbon Strength Adjustable Bench
Share on Pinterest
Price:
$$$
Whether you’re looking to do step-ups, Bulgarian split squats,
tricep dips
, or incline/decline
dumbbell workouts
, a
weight bench
adds a whole lot of spice to your average workout.
We love this bench from ProForm because it’s made with high quality, durable materials for a great price.
It can hold up to 610 lbs. (you + whatever
dumbbells
you’re using) and has anti-slip rubber feet to keep it in place. It also has 6 adjustable seat positions and 11 adjustable back positions.
There aren’t a ton of reviews, but the few that exist say the bench is super easy to assemble. They’re also v satisfied with the quality.
Pros
adjustable to incline, decline, military, and flat positions
wheels for easy transport
easy to assemble
anti-slip rubber feet
affordable
Cons
not a ton of reviews

Best pull-up bar
JFIT Deluxe Multi Exercise Doorway Pull-Up Bar
Share on Pinterest
Price:
$
Not enough room for a full-on
squat rack
but want to do pull-ups at home? A doorway
pull-up bar
like this one could be the perf solution.
It’s way sturdier than your average doorway pull-up bar because you install it with hardware. When you don’t use it, you store away the bar and the hardware still allows you to use your doorway as usual.
It has a weight capacity of 300 lbs. and can be installed basically anywhere that it fits. Some reviewers use it in a hallway instead of a doorway.
Pros
sturdier than traditional doorway pull-up bars
affordable
easy to install and use
300-lb. weight capacity
Cons
some reviewers complain of doorway damage

Best home workout cardio equipment
Best treadmill
ProForm Pro 9000 Treadmill
Share on Pinterest
Price:
$$$$
Barrons says, “If you live somewhere where the weather won’t be reliable for getting
cardio in outside year-round
, a
home treadmill
… would really be worth the investment.”
We’re big fans of
ProForm treadmills
because they bring the right balance of quality and price. This treadmill in particular has all of the smart features you love to see in a high-end treadmill — like a 22-inch touch screen, Bluetooth connectivity, and connected fitness options (helllllo iFit!) — at a reasonable price.
We also love that trainers can automatically change your speed and incline based on the class you’re taking. Pretty fricken cool, right?
To top it off, this treadmill is easy to fold up to save space when you’re not using it. It also has a great maximum weight capacity (300 lbs.), speed (12 miles per hour), and incline (-3 to 12%) making this particular model a great pick for runners at any level.
Pros
Bluetooth connectivity
works with iFit subscription
22-inch display
12-miles per hour maximum speed
-3 to 12% incline
sturdy folding build saves space
Cons
difficult to turn on without signing up for an iFit subscription

Best exercise bike
Bowflex C6 Bike
Share on Pinterest
Price:
$$$$
Running isn’t for everyone. If you’re more of a
cycling person
, the Bowflex C6 Bike might be more your thing. “I recently invested in the
Bowflex C6 Bike
and am loving it,” says Barrons. That’s high praise from a pro.
The C6 brings a smooth ride with magnetic resistance. While it doesn’t have a built-in screen, the cradle fits most devices, and the bike offers Bluetooth connectivity and works with a variety of apps (including
Peloton
— but with limited functionality). We also love the toe clips so you can work your legs on the up and down strokes.
This bike is pricey, but it’s an investment worth making
if you love indoor cycling
.
Pros
comfortable, smooth, quiet ride
includes toe clips
built-in weight cradles
Bluetooth connectivity
magnetic resistance
Cons
expensive
need tablet or a Chrome-enabled device to get the most out of the bike

Best budget cardio machine
Sunny Health & Fitness Squat Assist Row-N-Ride Trainer
Share on Pinterest
Price:
$$
Get some cardio and killer buns on the same machine! Using the Sunny Health & Fitness Squat Assist Row-N-Ride is like doing
squats on fat-burning steroids
. This cardio workout will seriously mold and
sculpt your backside
, and the price is amazing.
It has great adjustability in the seat, handlebars, and squat depth for a machine at this price. That depth adjustment is particularly important, so you won’t injure your knees or hips. The Row-N-Ride includes three resistance bands to adjust the difficulty level. You have to change them manually, which we don’t love — but hey, it’s cheap.
Pros
inexpensive
surprisingly effective workout
adjustable seat
adjustable handlebar positions
adjustable squat depth
Cons
manual resistance adjustment

Best elliptical
NordicTrack FS10i Elliptical
Share on Pinterest
Price:
$$$$
Ellipticals
are the bomb for getting a
low impact workout
without sacrificing intensity.
We love this one from NordicTrack because it’s got tons of awesome features. Depending on your mood, you can use it as a traditional elliptical, a stair stepper, or a
treadmill
(wait, what?!). The brand says all you need to do is adjust your natural motion and the machine adjusts with you.
With 24 resistance levels and up to a 10 percent incline, you’re basically guaranteed a tough workout. And with a 10-inch touch screen and tons of iFit classes to choose from, you’re less likely to get totally bored of it too.
Reviewers love how smooth it rides and say it’s an amazing low impact alternative to
running
. They also appreciate how motivating iFit classes are — it’s supposedly MUCH better than using any old elliptical at the gym.
Pros
3-in-1 machines (elliptical, stair stepper, treadmill)
low impact cardio workout
iFit compatible
24 resistance levels and 10% incline
Cons
takes up a lot of space

Best jump rope
Froning SR-1F Speed Rope 2.0
Share on Pinterest
Price:
$
Do cardio old-school with
a jump rope
. If you haven’t jumped rope for a while, be prepared to poop out pretty quick. The Froning SR-1F Speed Rope 2.0 is a great option for
you CrossFitters
who are working on your double-unders. But it’s not just for seasoned athletes — it’s got easy-to-hold handles, an adjustable cable, and smooth movement that beginners can appreciate too.
But you can’t use this jump rope on an abrasive surface like pavement, because it can wear out the cable. So, grass works, carpet works, but if you’re jumping in your garage, you’ll need a rubber mat to protect the cable.
Pros
strong, flexible polyurethane cable
high speed bearings
adjustable cable length
Cons
only for use on nonabrasive surfaces

Best punching bag
Dripex Freestanding Punching Bag
Share on Pinterest
Price:
$$$
The Dripex Freestanding
Punching Bag
stands strong while you
hit, kick, and elbow
your way to a stronger body. A base that holds sand or water (sand is typically sturdier) provides the counterweight, but it’s further stabilized by 12 suction cups on the bottom. The only bummer is that the suction cups need a relatively smooth surface to maintain full suction.
A high quality leather cover, stainless steel tube-covered EPE foam, and fabric buffers make this thing durable enough to take a
daily beating
. Plus, shock absorbers and springs help reduce noise. You can even remove the springs to do more intense strength training if you want.
Reviewers say filling the base isn’t the easiest because of the small fill hole, but once it’s done, you’re good to get punching.
Pros
high quality leather cover
shock-absorbing design
suction cup stabilizers
stands 69 in. high, working well for adults and teens
sturdy, especially when the base is filled with sand
Cons
small fill hole on the base
suction cups don’t work on all surfaces

Tonal
Share on Pinterest
Price:
$$$$
The
Tonal
is a smart gym that works kind of like a cable press machine — but
smarter
.
The gym mounts to a wall and has two arms that you can attach different accessories to, including handles, a bar, and a rope.
It uses digital weight to adjust the tension up to 200 lbs. You can configure the arms in multiple ways to do
upper body
,
lower body
, and
core exercises
.
Bring the arms toward the floor and you can use the bar attachment to do back
squats
, bent over rows, or
bicep curls
. Set them toward the ceiling and you can do lat pulldowns, upright rows, or
tricep
pushdowns. Use the bench accessory and you can do bench presses and Bulgarian split squats.
The Tonal has tons of
strength
,
yoga
,
cardio
, and
HIIT
classes to choose from and 17 different sensors to detect your form.
Reviewers are overall obsessed with the Tonal. Some say it’s louder than they expected and definitely pricey — but most see it as an amazing investment.
Pros
can do lower body, upper body, and core exercises
connected fitness with live and on-demand classes
sensors detect and suggest corrections for form
up to 200 lbs. of digital weight resistance
Cons
expensive

Best smart gym for bodyweight workouts
MIRROR
Share on Pinterest
Price:
$$$$
If you’re more into
bodyweight and dumbbell workouts
but still want to dive into the
smart mirror
world, Lululemon’s MIRROR is where it’s at.
You can choose from
boxing
,
Pilates

How to choose the right home workout equipment for you
Strength, cardio, or both?
First things first: Nail down what kind of workout you want to focus on at home. If you get plenty of cardio on your outdoor runs, maybe you just need to focus on strength training at home. If you attend in-studio Pilates, barre, or yoga classes, it might make sense to focus more on at-home cardio. Everyone’s needs are different.
If you’re looking to do resistance training, it’s a good idea to focus more on weights and resistance bands.
“The adjustable dumbbell sets are a great way to have lots of weight options without taking up a ton of space, but if you prefer regular dumbbells, a lighter pair (5 to 10 lbs.) and a heavier pair (15 to 30 lbs.) is a great place to start,” suggests Barrons.
Barrons also recommends using resistance bands to make exercises harder before moving up in weight.
If you’re more focused on cardio, make sure you pick an option that’ll keep you coming back for more as often as possible. “Cardio is the first thing that I might skip, so having an easy, fun option at home makes it the [less likely] that will happen!” says Barrons.
Workouts you like
Boxing,
suspension training, and pull-ups aren’t for everyone. Tailor your home gym to your workout preferences — and don’t forget the battle with boredom. It pays to have a few different types of workout equipment around to spice up your routine. You’ll start skipping if your workouts become a yawn fest.
Size and storage
While there are a couple of behemoths on this list, we looked for space-optimizing equipment where we could, like
a foldable treadmill
, adjustable kettlebells and weights, and suspension trainers.
If you have room for bigger cardio machines, go for it! But if not, look for equipment with a smaller footprint that can still give you a killer cardio workout, like
a jump rope
or punching bag.
Injury prevention and comfort
Some equipment is worth having around to keep your body in working order. A foam roller, for example, can relax muscles and keep injuries at bay. A
good yoga mat
can cushion your joints while you’re doing floor work or stretching. Whatever helps
keep your body working
at its best belongs among your home workout equipment.
The bottom line
With home workout equipment, you can keep your body in tip-top shape without traveling to the gym to work out with 100 sweaty strangers. You can invest in larger equipment or start small with a few dumbbells and resistance bands.
No matter your workout style or budget, there’s equipment out there to keep you challenged and invested in your training routine.

How we chose the best home workout equipment
We consulted Katelyn Barrons,
an NASM-certified personal trainer and ACE health coach
, to determine the critical criteria for choosing home workout equipment. Her suggestions were deceptively simple, from pieces that let you add resistance to
basic bodyweight exercises
to fun
cardio equipment
to help motivate you on the days you just don’t want to do it.
With her suggestions, here are the criteria we used to pick the best home workout equipment:
Versatility.
Some pieces of equipment are single-use, and that’s fine. But others can be used for a variety of workout styles.
Space-saving.
We’re all jealous of those of you who have a dedicated room for
your home gym
. But most of us aren’t that lucky, so we considered the equipment’s square footage and how much storage space it requires.
Materials and quality.
Home workout equipment won’t take the same beating as pro gym equipment, but you want something that will last. Since home workout equipment encompasses a wide variety of products, we consulted consumer reviews. If reviews said a resistance band broke, or an
exercise bike
started squeaking or falling apart after 2 months, that product didn’t make this list.
Workout personality and style.
We made sure to include products for all kinds of workout personalities and styles. Use your preferences to pick equipment that will help you stick with your workout plan even when you’d rather eat a
doughnut on the couch
.
Vetted products.
We put every product through a thorough vetting process that checks for unsupported health claims and shady business practices. Only products that passed made our list.

Best yoga mat
Gaiam Essentials Thick Yoga Mat
Share on Pinterest
Price:
$
Yoga mats
aren’t just for yoga. Sure, they’re great for a
Downward-Facing Dog
, but they’re also a helpful cushion
for push-ups
and ab work. The Gaiam Essentials Thick Yoga Mat provides a soft, thick surface so you can really dig into your poses or cushion your bod when you’re on the floor. This mat is affordable, lightweight, and portable thanks to an included carrying strap.
It gets great reviews, with tons of people saying it’s high quality, easy to clean, and the right thickness. But some say it’s not as durable as they’d hope — and others say there’s a strong off-gassing smell at first.
Pros
72 in. long and 24 in. wide
2/5 in. thick
fun color options
comes with a carrying strap
great reviews
Cons
strong off-gassing smell

Best foam roller
AmazonBasics High-Density Foam Roller
Share on Pinterest
Price:
$
A
foam roller
isn’t a complex piece of equipment, and the AmazonBasics High-Density Foam Roller gets the job done at an affordable price. It comes in lots of colors and lengths, so you can choose one that fits your space. The high-density foam digs into your muscles like a gopher, so it will
work out knots and sore spots
. Fair warning: The pain of that first roll will legit make you scream. 😱
A seam on one side sticks out on some of the rollers, so keep an eye out if you end up buying — reviewers say it does
not
feel good to roll on that seam.
Pros
affordable
6 color choices
4 length options
high-density foam
Cons
raised seam does
not
feel good

Best equipment storage
Wallniture Guru Wall Mount
Share on Pinterest
Price:
$
Tripping over equipment is no one’s idea of a good time. The Wallniture Guru Wall Mount makes sure there’s no more tripping or piles of
workout gear
at the bottom of your closet. It provides vertical storage space for yoga mats, foam rollers, jump ropes, and resistance bands. You can install it in a closet or the garage to keep all your
gear organized
and out of sight.
It comes with hardware, but reviewers say the hardware is the weak point. You might want to substitute sturdier versions from the local hardware store.
Pros
stores foam rollers and yoga mats
includes three hooks for hanging jump ropes or resistance bands
lightweight
Cons
included hardware could be sturdier

Best home workout strength training equipment
Best ankle weights
Bala Bangles
Share on Pinterest
Price:
$$
Yesss, the ankle weights that blew up on social media.
They have a great aesthetic (with 7 stylish colors to choose from), and they’re also made from quality materials that reviewers love — recycled steel coated in super-soft silicone (no more scratchy weights, pls.). The elastic and fasteners are also designed to allow for a better fit than regular ankle weights that slide around everywhere.
They come with a handy carrying case, and you can choose from 1- or 2-pound (lb.) weights. Slip them on your wrists or ankles when you’re doing
Pilates
,
yoga
, walking your
dog
, or even
cooking
.
Reviewers say it’s super easy to move them from your ankles to your wrists during workouts. Many also say they love the fun pop of color they add to any sweat sesh.
Some say you need to practice adjusting them to avoid Velcro rubbing on your skin — but once you get the hang of it, using them is a breeze.
Pros
made from recycled steel and soft silicone
seven colors to choose from
can choose between 1- or 2-lb. weights
come with a matching carrying case
Cons
need to adjust carefully to avoid scratchy velcro

Best mini resistance bands
Fit Simplify Resistance Loop Exercise Bands
Share on Pinterest
“The first pieces of equipment I recommend for my clients are a set of mini
resistance bands
and dumbbells,” Barrons says. The Fit Simplify Resistance Loop Bands set includes five well-marked, color-coded resistance levels, so you can
intensify your workout
by switching up the bands.
This set includes an instruction booklet to get you started on resistance workouts ASAP. High quality rubber and a super small drawstring storage bag round out the features we love about this simple set — not to mention that it’s affordable AF.
On the downside, rubber resistance bands like these may roll when you do certain exercises, which can def get annoying for some.
Pros
convenient carrying case
5 color-coded resistance levels
high quality rubber
affordable
Cons
roll down occasionally
Shop now at Amazon
Best fabric resistance bands
Vergali Fabric Booty Bands
Share on Pinterest
Price:
$
The Vergali Fabric Booty Bands are 3.16 inches (in.) wide and feature latex covered in fabric to help prevent rolling. They’re pricier than rubber resistance bands, but they’re key for peeps mostly focused on building up
the lower body
since they don’t roll down as much.
This set comes with four resistance levels that are clearly marked with the weight of the resistance so you’re tuned in to how much you’re actually lifting. There’s also a training guide to get you started.
The biggest con for these is that a few reviewers say the bands get stretched out prematurely.
Pros
4 color-coded resistance levels
grippy latex on the inside
mesh carrying bag
training instructions
weight ranges printed on the bands
Cons
may stretch out over time
Shop now at Amazon
Best light dumbbells
BalanceFrom Dumbbell Set
Share on Pinterest
Price:
$$
If you prefer
traditional dumbbells
to an adjustable set, Barrons suggests buying a lightweight set like this one from BalanceFrom (along with a heavyweight set, which we’ve got a rec for below). This set includes 3-, 5-, and 8-lb. weights and a stand to hold ’em. The neoprene covers make the weights easy to grip and
outdoor workout
-friendly, since they won’t rust.
We like that this set includes a storage tree, but some reviewers say the stand is flimsy and breaks easily.
Pros
included storage tree
neoprene covers for indoor/outdoor use
great starter weights
Cons
questionable quality control on the stand
Shop now at Amazon
Best heavy dumbbells
Cap Coated Dumbbell Weight
Share on Pinterest
Price:
$–$$$$
The Cap Coated Dumbbell Weights are high quality and come in an impressive range of weights. You can choose anywhere from 3- to 120-lb. dumbbells, depending on your
fitness level and goals
. The textured grip is also key for keeping good control through each move.
On the downside, you have to buy the weights individually, and the heavier the weight, the higher the price. There’s also no storage tree, so you’ll have to keep these bad boys on the floor or buy a storage rack separately.
Pros
textured grip
stable hexagon shape
solid cast iron with rubber coating to prevent rust
wide range of weight options
Cons
have to buy weights individually
no storage tree
Shop now at Amazon
Best adjustable dumbbells
ATIVAFIT Adjustable Dumbbell Fitness Dial Dumbbell
Share on Pinterest
Price:
$$$
The ATIVAFIT Adjustable Dumbbell Fitness Dial Dumbbell offers better weight options and quality than some of the more popular
adjustable dumbbells
(we’re looking at you,
Bowflex
). The weight range alone is impressive — 5.5 to 71.5 lbs. per dumbbell. It includes a storage cradle to keep it from rolling around too.
On the downside, it’s pricey. And we do mean “it.” If you want two of these dumbbells, you’ll have to make sure to add two to the shopping cart, because they’re not sold as a set.
Pros
saves space
includes storage cradle
great weight range (5.5–71.5 lbs.)
quick-switch design
Cons
sold individually
pricey
Shop now at Amazon
Best budget adjustable dumbbells
Yes4All Adjustable Dumbbell
Share on Pinterest
Price:
$–$$$$
The Yes4All Adjustable Dumbbell offers lots of weight options at a price that won’t require you to
donate plasma
. It’s sold as a single dumbbell — which isn’t so cool — but buying two is still relatively affordable. If you’ve ever used a traditional barbell, collar, and
weight plates
, the design of this dumbbell will feel familiar. It also includes locking collars, so the plates won’t slam into your hand.
Pros
traditional weight design
locking collars
durable cast-iron plates
textured handle
Cons
sold individually
no storage tree
Shop now at Amazon
Best kettlebell
Kettle Gryp
Share on Pinterest
Price:
$
You’re probably saying, “Hey, that’s not
a kettlebell
.” Just wait. Remember how it’s a good idea to save space with your home equipment? The Kettle Gryp lets you use a dumbbell as a kettlebell. It’s cheaper than a kettlebell, and you can use it with different weights to increase or decrease the difficulty.
The only downside is that it doesn’t work with
every
dumbbell grip.
Pros
versatile
saves space
works with different dumbbell weights
affordable
Cons
may not fit all dumbbell grips
Shop now at Amazon
Best suspension system
TRX GO Suspension Trainer System
Share on Pinterest
Price:
$$
Suspension training
has gained popularity as people have looked for new workout equipment for small spaces. The
TRX Go Suspension Trainer System
stands out for quality and user-friendliness, both of which are musts for a good suspension trainer. You can hang it on a tree or a door or use anchors. Locking loops and a single anchor make it easy to set up at home.
Suspension training goes easy on your joints, and you can adjust the moves to different fitness levels. Even TRX newbies can get a serious workout. You can also pack it up and take it with you
on the road
.
But it can take some time to figure out the exercises. Take it slow and give yourself time to learn how to use it correctly — it’ll be worth it, we promise.
Pros
easy on the joints
adjustable to different fitness levels
lightweight and portable
total-body workout
well made
Cons
may require separately sold anchors
takes practice to use correctly

Best folding squat rack
Rogue RML-3W Fold Back Wall Mount Rack
Share on Pinterest
Price:
$$$$
A
folding squat rack
is an amazing addition to any home gym — especially if you’re looking to get into heavier-duty
weightlifting
.
This one from Rogue is made from high quality materials but won’t completely drain your bank account. It can hold up to 1,000 lbs. (which we can all agree is plenty).
It comes with a pull-up bar and J-hooks to hold your barbell. It’s also compatible with 88 different accessories — so you can basically use it as a starter to a fully stocked home gym.
The best part? It folds away to a less than 5-inch depth when you’re not using it.
Reviewers love how sturdy and simple the rack is. They say it shipped super quickly and is hella easy to install.
Pros
high quality materials
folds away to 5 inches when you’re not using it
compatible with 88 different accessories
holds up to 1,000 lbs.
easy to install
Cons
still need to purchase barbells and weight plates

Best barbell
Rogue The Ohio Bar
Share on Pinterest
Price:
$$$$
Pair your new squat rack with one of Rogue’s best-selling
barbells
— the Ohio Bar.
The brand manufactures
this barbell
in the US of A (in Ohio, if you couldn’t tell). It’s made with high quality stainless steel and has a lifetime warranty to back it up.
It’s designed for Olympic and
Powerlifting
, with knurling (aka rough texture) to give you a better grip.
Many reviewers say this is one of the best additions to their home gyms. They love how high quality it feels and appreciate that the knurling gives some grip without being super uncomfortable (and even painful).
Pros
high quality stainless steel
designed for Olympic and Powerlifting
knurling allows for better grip
amazing reviews
lifetime warranty
Cons
expensive

Best weight plates
Rogue HG 2.0 Bumper Plates
Share on Pinterest
Price:
$$$$
You have your squat rack and your barbell — now it’s time for some
weight plates
.
We recommend going for a pair of
bumper plates
for your home gym. They’re typically made from rubber and are designed to be dropped without breaking the plate (or your floors!).
These bumper plates are sold in pairs up to 1,000 lbs. They’re made from recycled rubber and have a stainless steel center. This combo helps reduce bounce and noise and increases durability.
Reviewers LOVE these plates. Many say the quality for the price is unmatched. They also love the way these look in their home gyms.
Just keep in mind that bumper plates tend to take up a lot of space. They’re great if you’ve got a designated garage gym, but they’re def not super easy to stash away when you’re not using them.
Pros
designed to bounce without breaking
durable
sold as pairs or sets
good quality for price
Cons
take up a lot of space

Best weight bench
ProForm Carbon Strength Adjustable Bench
Share on Pinterest
Price:
$$$
Whether you’re looking to do step-ups, Bulgarian split squats,
tricep dips
, or incline/decline
dumbbell workouts
, a
weight bench
adds a whole lot of spice to your average workout.
We love this bench from ProForm because it’s made with high quality, durable materials for a great price.
It can hold up to 610 lbs. (you + whatever
dumbbells
you’re using) and has anti-slip rubber feet to keep it in place. It also has 6 adjustable seat positions and 11 adjustable back positions.
There aren’t a ton of reviews, but the few that exist say the bench is super easy to assemble. They’re also v satisfied with the quality.
Pros
adjustable to incline, decline, military, and flat positions
wheels for easy transport
easy to assemble
anti-slip rubber feet
affordable
Cons
not a ton of reviews

Best pull-up bar
JFIT Deluxe Multi Exercise Doorway Pull-Up Bar
Share on Pinterest
Price:
$
Not enough room for a full-on
squat rack
but want to do pull-ups at home? A doorway
pull-up bar
like this one could be the perf solution.
It’s way sturdier than your average doorway pull-up bar because you install it with hardware. When you don’t use it, you store away the bar and the hardware still allows you to use your doorway as usual.
It has a weight capacity of 300 lbs. and can be installed basically anywhere that it fits. Some reviewers use it in a hallway instead of a doorway.
Pros
sturdier than traditional doorway pull-up bars
affordable
easy to install and use
300-lb. weight capacity
Cons
some reviewers complain of doorway damage

Best home workout cardio equipment
Best treadmill
ProForm Pro 9000 Treadmill
Share on Pinterest
Price:
$$$$
Barrons says, “If you live somewhere where the weather won’t be reliable for getting
cardio in outside year-round
, a
home treadmill
… would really be worth the investment.”
We’re big fans of
ProForm treadmills
because they bring the right balance of quality and price. This treadmill in particular has all of the smart features you love to see in a high-end treadmill — like a 22-inch touch screen, Bluetooth connectivity, and connected fitness options (helllllo iFit!) — at a reasonable price.
We also love that trainers can automatically change your speed and incline based on the class you’re taking. Pretty fricken cool, right?
To top it off, this treadmill is easy to fold up to save space when you’re not using it. It also has a great maximum weight capacity (300 lbs.), speed (12 miles per hour), and incline (-3 to 12%) making this particular model a great pick for runners at any level.
Pros
Bluetooth connectivity
works with iFit subscription
22-inch display
12-miles per hour maximum speed
-3 to 12% incline
sturdy folding build saves space
Cons
difficult to turn on without signing up for an iFit subscription

Best exercise bike
Bowflex C6 Bike
Share on Pinterest
Price:
$$$$
Running isn’t for everyone. If you’re more of a
cycling person
, the Bowflex C6 Bike might be more your thing. “I recently invested in the
Bowflex C6 Bike
and am loving it,” says Barrons. That’s high praise from a pro.
The C6 brings a smooth ride with magnetic resistance. While it doesn’t have a built-in screen, the cradle fits most devices, and the bike offers Bluetooth connectivity and works with a variety of apps (including
Peloton
— but with limited functionality). We also love the toe clips so you can work your legs on the up and down strokes.
This bike is pricey, but it’s an investment worth making
if you love indoor cycling
.
Pros
comfortable, smooth, quiet ride
includes toe clips
built-in weight cradles
Bluetooth connectivity
magnetic resistance
Cons
expensive
need tablet or a Chrome-enabled device to get the most out of the bike

Best budget cardio machine
Sunny Health & Fitness Squat Assist Row-N-Ride Trainer
Share on Pinterest
Price:
$$
Get some cardio and killer buns on the same machine! Using the Sunny Health & Fitness Squat Assist Row-N-Ride is like doing
squats on fat-burning steroids
. This cardio workout will seriously mold and
sculpt your backside
, and the price is amazing.
It has great adjustability in the seat, handlebars, and squat depth for a machine at this price. That depth adjustment is particularly important, so you won’t injure your knees or hips. The Row-N-Ride includes three resistance bands to adjust the difficulty level. You have to change them manually, which we don’t love — but hey, it’s cheap.
Pros
inexpensive
surprisingly effective workout
adjustable seat
adjustable handlebar positions
adjustable squat depth
Cons
manual resistance adjustment

Best elliptical
NordicTrack FS10i Elliptical
Share on Pinterest
Price:
$$$$
Ellipticals
are the bomb for getting a
low impact workout
without sacrificing intensity.
We love this one from NordicTrack because it’s got tons of awesome features. Depending on your mood, you can use it as a traditional elliptical, a stair stepper, or a
treadmill
(wait, what?!). The brand says all you need to do is adjust your natural motion and the machine adjusts with you.
With 24 resistance levels and up to a 10 percent incline, you’re basically guaranteed a tough workout. And with a 10-inch touch screen and tons of iFit classes to choose from, you’re less likely to get totally bored of it too.
Reviewers love how smooth it rides and say it’s an amazing low impact alternative to
running
. They also appreciate how motivating iFit classes are — it’s supposedly MUCH better than using any old elliptical at the gym.
Pros
3-in-1 machines (elliptical, stair stepper, treadmill)
low impact cardio workout
iFit compatible
24 resistance levels and 10% incline
Cons
takes up a lot of space

Best jump rope
Froning SR-1F Speed Rope 2.0
Share on Pinterest
Price:
$
Do cardio old-school with
a jump rope
. If you haven’t jumped rope for a while, be prepared to poop out pretty quick. The Froning SR-1F Speed Rope 2.0 is a great option for
you CrossFitters
who are working on your double-unders. But it’s not just for seasoned athletes — it’s got easy-to-hold handles, an adjustable cable, and smooth movement that beginners can appreciate too.
But you can’t use this jump rope on an abrasive surface like pavement, because it can wear out the cable. So, grass works, carpet works, but if you’re jumping in your garage, you’ll need a rubber mat to protect the cable.
Pros
strong, flexible polyurethane cable
high speed bearings
adjustable cable length
Cons
only for use on nonabrasive surfaces

Best punching bag
Dripex Freestanding Punching Bag
Share on Pinterest
Price:
$$$
The Dripex Freestanding
Punching Bag
stands strong while you
hit, kick, and elbow
your way to a stronger body. A base that holds sand or water (sand is typically sturdier) provides the counterweight, but it’s further stabilized by 12 suction cups on the bottom. The only bummer is that the suction cups need a relatively smooth surface to maintain full suction.
A high quality leather cover, stainless steel tube-covered EPE foam, and fabric buffers make this thing durable enough to take a
daily beating
. Plus, shock absorbers and springs help reduce noise. You can even remove the springs to do more intense strength training if you want.
Reviewers say filling the base isn’t the easiest because of the small fill hole, but once it’s done, you’re good to get punching.
Pros
high quality leather cover
shock-absorbing design
suction cup stabilizers
stands 69 in. high, working well for adults and teens
sturdy, especially when the base is filled with sand
Cons
small fill hole on the base
suction cups don’t work on all surfaces

How to choose the right home workout equipment for you
Strength, cardio, or both?
First things first: Nail down what kind of workout you want to focus on at home. If you get plenty of cardio on your outdoor runs, maybe you just need to focus on strength training at home. If you attend in-studio Pilates, barre, or yoga classes, it might make sense to focus more on at-home cardio. Everyone’s needs are different.
If you’re looking to do resistance training, it’s a good idea to focus more on weights and resistance bands.
“The adjustable dumbbell sets are a great way to have lots of weight options without taking up a ton of space, but if you prefer regular dumbbells, a lighter pair (5 to 10 lbs.) and a heavier pair (15 to 30 lbs.) is a great place to start,” suggests Barrons.
Barrons also recommends using resistance bands to make exercises harder before moving up in weight.
If you’re more focused on cardio, make sure you pick an option that’ll keep you coming back for more as often as possible. “Cardio is the first thing that I might skip, so having an easy, fun option at home makes it the [less likely] that will happen!” says Barrons.
Workouts you like
Boxing,
suspension training, and pull-ups aren’t for everyone. Tailor your home gym to your workout preferences — and don’t forget the battle with boredom. It pays to have a few different types of workout equipment around to spice up your routine. You’ll start skipping if your workouts become a yawn fest.
Size and storage
While there are a couple of behemoths on this list, we looked for space-optimizing equipment where we could, like
a foldable treadmill
, adjustable kettlebells and weights, and suspension trainers.
If you have room for bigger cardio machines, go for it! But if not, look for equipment with a smaller footprint that can still give you a killer cardio workout, like
a jump rope
or punching bag.
Injury prevention and comfort
Some equipment is worth having around to keep your body in working order. A foam roller, for example, can relax muscles and keep injuries at bay. A
good yoga mat
can cushion your joints while you’re doing floor work or stretching. Whatever helps
keep your body working
at its best belongs among your home workout equipment.
The bottom line
With home workout equipment, you can keep your body in tip-top shape without traveling to the gym to work out with 100 sweaty strangers. You can invest in larger equipment or start small with a few dumbbells and resistance bands.
No matter your workout style or budget, there’s equipment out there to keep you challenged and invested in your training routine.

Frequent travel
can wreak havoc on even the best-laid
fitness plan
s, but a life
on the road
doesn’t have to mean setting aside your
workout goals
and routines. From slim, lightweight trainers to sweat-resistant
wireless headphones
to collapsible, portable gear of all kinds, these nine picks will keep you moving without missing a step.

Brazyn Morph collapsible foam roller
Share on Pinterest
Foam rollers
are bulky and unwieldy by nature, but leave it to a former NFL player — on the road for 8 away games over the course of a 16-week season — to understand the importance of both
massage
and maximization of precious luggage space.
When expanded, Brazyn’s Morph roller is the standard 14.5 inches long and 5.5 inches in diameter, a full-surface mobility tool that can handle up to 350 pounds; when collapsed to lie flat, it’s a mere 2 inches wide. It comes with a mesh bag for easy carrying.
Shop now at Amazon
2.
Crossrope jump rope set
Share on Pinterest
Given its ability to burn a ton of calories in a short amount of time and the minimal space required to use — or pack — it, the old-school
jump rope
is a tried-and-true cardio weapon. You could toss any old vinyl-and-plastic number into your carry-on, or you could take it to the next level with one of Crossrope’s themed sets.
The
Get Lean
version has slim handles and two lightweight ropes, and
Get Strong
comes with thicker handles and heavier ropes, while the
Get Fit
bundle is a combination of the two. Paired with an app that provides free, quick routines to keep your
sweat levels high
and your interest levels piqued, it’s a true go-anywhere training tool.
Shop now at Amazon
3.
Forsake Cascade/Maddox trainers
Share on Pinterest
Slim, lightweight sneakers equally suitable for pounding the pavement or
hitting the trails
, Forsake’s
Cascade
(in women’s sizes) and
Maddox
(in men’s sizes) make the cut for multiple uses. With a breathable nylon upper, a moisture-wicking mesh lining, and a sturdy-yet-flexible outsole, these well-cushioned trainers can take you from the gym to happy hour — or from a
light hike
to your
campsite
— without looking out of place.
Shop Forsake at Amazon
4.
Jaybird Vista wireless headphones
Share on Pinterest
For
rainy-day runs
and
sweaty indoor sessions
alike, a pair of earbuds that can stand up to the elements is essential. The Jaybird Vista wireless headphones are waterproof and drop-resistant, and their capsule construction locks out dirt and debris.
With 6 hours of play time (and 10 more via a small hand-held charging case), plus an app for iOS and Android that lets you sync your
Spotify playlists
for a seamless soundtrack, they’re a standout option for on-the-go exercise.
Shop now at Amazon
5.
Jade Yoga Voyager mat
Share on Pinterest
Yoga mats
are portable by default, but your everyday model can take up quite a bit of room. Jade Yoga’s grippy Voyager mat is extremely thin (just 1/16 inch thick, so you probably won’t want to use it for an everyday practice), weighs less than 2 pounds, and folds up to the size of a
yoga block
or a Harry Potter hardback.
Plus, it’s made from natural rubber, a rapidly renewable material, and the company plants a tree for every mat sold — so far, more than 1.7 million and counting.
Shop now at Amazon
6.
que collapsible bottle
Share on Pinterest
Double-walled stainless-steel
bottles
have their place, but if you’re looking for something light and functional to carry for
post-workout hydration
, que’s collapsible bottle weighs less than 1/2 pound and takes up next to no room in your bag. If you leave it filled for too long, the silicone taste can permeate the water, but it’s great for guzzling a pint or two to bring your water levels back up to par.
Shop now at Amazon
7.
Matador NanoDry hand towel
Share on Pinterest
For trail runs,
cycling
, impromptu
swims
, and more, Matador’s nanofiber hand towel is quick-drying, antimicrobial, and highly absorbent, soaking up more than twice its weight in water.
It unfurls to a respectable 15 by 15 inches but scrunches down to fit in a tiny, palm-size carrying case that attaches to your pack or keychain for quick access and maximum portability — a must-have for stashing in your gym or day bag, especially if you’re heading out in humid locales.
Shop now at Amazon
8.
Garmin Forerunner 35
Share on Pinterest
Truly, any of Garmin’s industry-leading
fitness trackers
would work for travel, but for multidiscipline athletes, the Forerunner 35 is a light GPS running watch and
heart rate monitor
that tracks steps,
calories
, sleep, and periods of intense exertion; vibrates with reminders to get up and move; and automatically differentiates between various activities.
Take it for a swim or
out for a jog
, hook it up to the app for feedback from the online community, and don’t worry about it dying mid-workout — with 13 hours of maximum battery life, it’s sure to have you covered.

Frequent travel
can wreak havoc on even the best-laid
fitness plan
s, but a life
on the road
doesn’t have to mean setting aside your
workout goals
and routines. From slim, lightweight trainers to sweat-resistant
wireless headphones
to collapsible, portable gear of all kinds, these nine picks will keep you moving without missing a step.

Brazyn Morph collapsible foam roller
Share on Pinterest
Foam rollers
are bulky and unwieldy by nature, but leave it to a former NFL player — on the road for 8 away games over the course of a 16-week season — to understand the importance of both
massage
and maximization of precious luggage space.
When expanded, Brazyn’s Morph roller is the standard 14.5 inches long and 5.5 inches in diameter, a full-surface mobility tool that can handle up to 350 pounds; when collapsed to lie flat, it’s a mere 2 inches wide. It comes with a mesh bag for easy carrying.

Crossrope jump rope set
Share on Pinterest
Given its ability to burn a ton of calories in a short amount of time and the minimal space required to use — or pack — it, the old-school
jump rope
is a tried-and-true cardio weapon. You could toss any old vinyl-and-plastic number into your carry-on, or you could take it to the next level with one of Crossrope’s themed sets.
The
Get Lean
version has slim handles and two lightweight ropes, and
Get Strong
comes with thicker handles and heavier ropes, while the
Get Fit
bundle is a combination of the two. Paired with an app that provides free, quick routines to keep your
sweat levels high
and your interest levels piqued, it’s a true go-anywhere training tool.

Forsake Cascade/Maddox trainers
Share on Pinterest
Slim, lightweight sneakers equally suitable for pounding the pavement or
hitting the trails
, Forsake’s
Cascade
(in women’s sizes) and
Maddox
(in men’s sizes) make the cut for multiple uses. With a breathable nylon upper, a moisture-wicking mesh lining, and a sturdy-yet-flexible outsole, these well-cushioned trainers can take you from the gym to happy hour — or from a
light hike
to your
campsite
— without looking out of place.

Jaybird Vista wireless headphones
Share on Pinterest
For
rainy-day runs
and
sweaty indoor sessions
alike, a pair of earbuds that can stand up to the elements is essential. The Jaybird Vista wireless headphones are waterproof and drop-resistant, and their capsule construction locks out dirt and debris.
With 6 hours of play time (and 10 more via a small hand-held charging case), plus an app for iOS and Android that lets you sync your
Spotify playlists
for a seamless soundtrack, they’re a standout option for on-the-go exercise.
Shop now at Amazon
5.
Jade Yoga Voyager mat
Share on Pinterest
Yoga mats
are portable by default, but your everyday model can take up quite a bit of room. Jade Yoga’s grippy Voyager mat is extremely thin (just 1/16 inch thick, so you probably won’t want to use it for an everyday practice), weighs less than 2 pounds, and folds up to the size of a
yoga block
or a Harry Potter hardback.
Plus, it’s made from natural rubber, a rapidly renewable material, and the company plants a tree for every mat sold — so far, more than 1.7 million and counting.

6.
que collapsible bottle
Share on Pinterest
Double-walled stainless-steel
bottles
have their place, but if you’re looking for something light and functional to carry for
post-workout hydration
, que’s collapsible bottle weighs less than 1/2 pound and takes up next to no room in your bag. If you leave it filled for too long, the silicone taste can permeate the water, but it’s great for guzzling a pint or two to bring your water levels back up to par.
Shop now at Amazon
7.
Matador NanoDry hand towel
Share on Pinterest
For trail runs,
cycling
, impromptu
swims
, and more, Matador’s nanofiber hand towel is quick-drying, antimicrobial, and highly absorbent, soaking up more than twice its weight in water.
It unfurls to a respectable 15 by 15 inches but scrunches down to fit in a tiny, palm-size carrying case that attaches to your pack or keychain for quick access and maximum portability — a must-have for stashing in your gym or day bag, especially if you’re heading out in humid locales.
Shop now at Amazon
8.
Garmin Forerunner 35
Share on Pinterest
Truly, any of Garmin’s industry-leading
fitness trackers
would work for travel, but for multidiscipline athletes, the Forerunner 35 is a light GPS running watch and
heart rate monitor
that tracks steps,
calories
, sleep, and periods of intense exertion; vibrates with reminders to get up and move; and automatically differentiates between various activities.
Take it for a swim or
out for a jog
, hook it up to the app for feedback from the online community, and don’t worry about it dying mid-workout — with 13 hours of maximum battery life, it’s sure to have you covered.

Side-by-side comparison
How to choose
FAQs
Fitness trackers
have come a long way from their
pedometer beginnings
. The latest models track steps, stairs/altitude, distance, heart rate, and more. Athletes looking to shave seconds off their times can use
interval features
or advanced analytics to adjust
their pace
, stride length, and
running mechanics
.
One of these handy devices can be an eye-opener to how many (or few) steps you really take in a day. You can set goals, get reminders, and track all of
your activities
— from a
walk around the block
to a dance class. If you really want to get techy, you can get one with a
built-in GPS
to track your activities or sync your route ahead of time and get directions while you’re on the road.
So basically, fitness trackers can help you pump up the volume on your #FitLife. They can also get you more in tune with your body (which is never a bad thing!).
There’s a fitness track out there for erryone — from competitive athletes to the neighborhood walker. Here are the 13 best fitness trackers for all fitness levels, needs, and budgets.

Product Review, Fitness, Health Care, Technology
How we chose
We picked the 13 best fitness trackers based on budget, available features, accuracy, user reviews, and ease of use. We also opted for models with
heart rate monitoring
and online data syncing.
Budget
Fitness trackers can cost as little as $50 to well over $400. We included trackers that fall into every price range to meet the varied needs of
beginners
all the way up to competitive athletes. Keep in mind that the more you want the tracker to do, the higher the price tag.
Available features
Our list includes a few watches that keep things basic by monitoring
steps
,
heart rate
, distance, and that’s about it.
It also includes fitness trackers that get to know you better than you know yourself, with advanced tracking features like intervals, step vertical, step length, heart rate, and
VO
2
max information
to adjust
training intensity
or schedule.
Accuracy
From heart rate and oxygen levels to distance, accuracy matters. Ofc no fitness tracker is perfect, but the major players are sure trying.
We looked for models that were consistently accurate with features like the ability to connect to more than one satellite system so you don’t lose the GPS signal while
running or cycling through a tunnel
.
Ease of use
There’s something to be said for simplicity, but advanced features don’t always lend themselves to simple and easy. We looked for models that are intuitive to use, even if their list of features was long and somewhat complicated.
Pricing guide
Fitness trackers are def more expensive than the average stopwatch. The good news: There are TONS of options in a huge price range. Here’s a price guide to help you find the best fitness tracker for your body
and
budget.
$
= under $100
$$
= $100–$250
$$$
= $251–$400

This fifth version of the Charge took an already great fitness tracker and made it even better. The Charge 5 has an aluminum housing and color display that makes it look classier than its predecessor — but fitness isn’t about looks, amirite?
What it tracks
This bad boy tracks steps, distance, floors climbed, and
calories burned
. But wait… there’s more!
The Charge 5 tracks heart rate, oxygen levels, changes in
skin temperature
, and uses an electrodermal sensor (EDA) to detect changes in
sweat
in response to
stress
. The tracker then gives you a “Daily Readiness Score” that gauges how ready you are for a workout (like maybe you need
to rest
or you’re not pushing hard enough). It also connects to an ECG app to detect atrial fibrillation, which can cause heart failure, blood clots, and other serious complications.
A built-in GPS tracks your pace and distance in real-time without your phone. You can see your route in the Fitbit app afterward, which is pretty flippin’ awesome (speaking from experience, we absolutely love the Fitbit app). It not only tracks the data collected by the tracker, but also interprets it and lets you know what you can do to improve your fitness. That includes “Active Zone Minutes” so you know whether you’re in the
fat-burning
,
cardio
, or peak performance zone.
The Charge 5 only recognizes
20 workout types
, which sounds like a lot but is a little limited considering that it’s a fitness tracker.
Other features and specs
The Charge 5 is waterproof up to 164 feet.
You can also adjust the display settings. For example, set it to always-on so you don’t have to wake the screen to check the time (but watch out, it drains the battery faster). Another heads up: The wake-up can be a little inconsistent.
Pros
displays real-time pace and distance
“Active Zone Minutes” measures time spent in fat-burning, cardio, or peak heart rate zone
GPS compatible with running, walking,
cycling
,
hiking
, interval workouts,
kayaking
, surfing, and
skiing
measures stress and connects to ECG app
Cons
screen wake sometimes inconsistent
lots of scrolling required to see different data points

If you want a run rundown, look no further. This GPS watch offers precise play-by-play.
What it tracks
Runners, get ready for great stats. The customizable screen can display
current pace
, average pace, total time, total distance, and heart rate. It also comes with a wrist-based heart rate monitor so you can track your progress.
The Forerunner 245 predicts stress levels and uses that plus your
sleep
, activity, and VO
2
max scores to calculate your energy levels, too. It can track 16 activity types and uses GPS to show a color map of your run in real-time. All your stats sync with the app and offer an in-depth view of your training results.
Other features and specs
A large color display means a quick glance can keep you up to date while you’re on the move. It’s bright and easy to read, BUT it takes some time to get used to the two-button control (no touch screen here, friends).
The top button starts activities and is the selector. The bottom button returns to the previous screen and starts lap times. Except for a steep learning curve, the Forerunner 245 offers great features for runners who want a closer look at their fitness stats.
On the downside, you have to upgrade to the Forerunner 245 Music to play (up to 500 songs), and the
heart rate monitor
isn’t as accurate as a chest strap.
Pros
Wi-Fi/Bluetooth capability to sync data to tracking
apps
smart notifications to display incoming emails, text alerts, and calendar notifications
offers real-time GPS maps and fitness data
Cons
can’t play music
wrist-based heart rate monitor maybe not be as accurate as a chest strap

40 hours in training mode, up to 7 days without advanced features
Heart rate tracking:

Sleep tracking:

This user-friendly watch is all about
#BikeLife
.
What it tracks
The Polar Vantage V2 does so much more than just let you know how fast your heart’s going.
In addition to heart rate, it tracks your distance, stress, and sleep patterns. It can also track 130 different sports. GPS tracking keeps you on route, too.
On top of everything, this tracker offers deeper insights that can improve
your cycling
and cross-training. It provides insight into recovery, training load, hill splits, and running power. The app uses all that information — plus your sleep stats — to give you recovery-based workout recommendations.
Other features and specs
The Polar Vantage V2 is compatible with many third-party apps (like TrainingPeaks or Strava), chest straps, and cadence sensors to further enhance your training. Woot!
On the downside, reviewers find the touch screen a little sluggish. And with all of those features, it’s overwhelming at first, until you learn what features you want to use and how to use them.
Pros
lightweight
long battery life
can connect with Bluetooth-compatible sensors
syncs with third-party apps (like cycling apps)
Cons
has a ton of features, which might be overwhelming

If you’re a
swimmer
or triathlete, this multisport watch is the way to go.
What it tracks
The smartwatch is equipped with a wrist-based heart rate monitor and provides GPS mode for up to 14 hours. The 735XT also features swimming stroke detection and is accurate enough to help you adjust your training as needed, whether in the pool or open water.
The downside is that the 735XT doesn’t track some of the more advanced metrics (stride length, vertical ratio) without purchasing a separate device.
Other features and specs
While some people may not like the large control buttons, they’re easier to find and control in the water. The big, bright screen is also more visible in the water.
And when you’re not in the water? It’s ANT+ and Bluetooth compatible, so you can connect it to
smart fitness equipment
on dry land.
Marathoners and ultrarunners, this watch can keep up with you! Even when connected to your mobile phone, it hangs on to battery life for up to 14 hours in GPS mode and 24 hours if you turn off heart rate monitoring.
Pros
long-lasting GPS and battery life
can estimate VO
2
max and predict race times
connects to smart fitness equipment
highly visible and easy to control in the water
Cons
requires a separate device (a Running Dynamics Pod, HRM Run, or HRM Tri Monitor) to track ground contact time balance, stride length, and vertical ratio

This sleek and simple watch won’t break the bank. It’s a great buy if you want a no-thrills, high quality fitness tracker.
What it tracks
There are a total of 96 exercise modes, and we challenge you to try them all.
It has sport modes for outdoor and indoor running,
cycling
, and
walking
, and more. You can also use it on
fitness equipment
, in the pool, and for open-water swimming.
The Band 6 keeps a 24/7 eye on your heart rate and SpO
2
levels. If your oxygen levels or heart rate get too low, expect a buzz and notification.
Other features and specs
Depending on the modes and use, the battery lasts an impressive 10 to 14 days. You can also get text notifications and control music on your phone if you’ve got an Android (sorry, iOS users, you miss out on this feature).
All the good comes with a few bads, including a small screen and some reviewers who claim the step count isn’t entirely accurate.
Pros
strong GPS signal
can sync to your phone
great bang for your buck
Cons
smallish screen
questionable accuracy of step count, according to reviewers

Here’s one for all the Apple aficionados out there. This is a fab find if you want a smartwatch that does more than track fitness. It has all the fab features of the Series 6, but with some extra spice.
What it tracks
Like with other Apple Watch models, you can use Apple’s Health app to track activity, exercise, and standing and the Fitness+ app for workout streaming directly on your wrist.
The Series 7 also features a blood oxygen sensor and electrical heart sensor you can use with the ECG app to keep an eye on your heart health. And you get extra health benefits like a hand-washing countdown timer and
menstrual cycle
tracking.
Other features and specs
The latest Apple Watch upgrade features a bigger face, better durability (which you’ll need on
outdoor workouts
), and faster charging. You can also take calls and respond to messages right from your wrist.
Where the Series 7 outshines just about everyone is on the
third-party app
options. Apple still leads the way, and you can decide which apps to activate on the watch, from communication to fitness.
However, this watch is pricey, and it only has an 18-hour battery life (that’s on par with watches of similar quality and features). BUT Apple tempers that with new 45-minute charging (and speaking from experience with older Apple Watch models, 45-minute charging would be AMAZING).
Pros
offers a wide range of
third-party apps
measures blood oxygen saturation (SpO
2
) on demand
ECG app
Cons
compatible with iPhone only
more expensive than other smartwatches

Polar makes some intense watches that keep you on track and swamped in data. That makes this tracker the best choice if you’re
going the literal distance
on your runs. The data is detailed (sometimes a little too much), which makes reaching your targets a lot easier.
What it tracks
This tracks all the basics: steps, heart rate, and workouts like
yoga
, swimming, walking, running, and more.
But a huge reason this watch gets high marks (besides the 20-hour GPS life) is the
workout suggestions
offered in the Polar app. Using the FitSpark dashboard, you get training suggestions based on your
fitness level
, training history, and recovery stats. The Ignite also changes the stats you see based on the activity you’re doing — distance for walking and running and duration for
weight training
sessions. It also syncs with several satellites to prevent signal loss.
Other features and specs
We love that the battery can power the GPS and heart rate monitor for up to 20 hours. (Ultrarunners, take note that this watch might outlast you.) Without all of the fancy doodads on, it can last up to 5days.
We’re also loving that Polar offers a touch screen *and* some manual buttons to navigate. That makes up for the less sensitive touch screen, which can be delayed at times.
Pros
can sync data to third-party platforms with Garmin Connect app
equipped with Garmin Pay for contactless payment from your watch
workout suggestions
connects with multiple satellites
Cons
more complex setup than other trackers

The Polar M430 is designed for athletes,
runners in particular.
However, it’s got an ultra-accurate heart rate monitor that helps anyone keep track of those beats. The sporty design might not pass in the boardroom — but for casual wear, it’s fantastic.
What it tracks
The M430 is equipped with the Polar fitness test, which gives you a fitness level reading to help you reach your fitness goals. After every run, the watch calculates your running index, which is designed to help you improve your aerobic running performance.
Recovery is just as important as workouts, and the M430 compares the load from your workouts to make sure you’re giving yourself enough downtime. You can also use it with the Polar running program if you need some help developing your workouts. Plus, it’s got integrated GPS and indoor running metrics.
Other features and specs
This watch can last up to 30 hours (with the right GPS settings), which we can all agree is a lot for continous heart rate monitoring.
You can also get vibrating notifications of calls, messages, and reminders to get moving.
It syncs up with third party apps like Strava, Nike+ Run Club, and TrainingPeaks. But some peeps report that it’s a little slow on the syncing.
Pros
provides accurate heart rate data
tracks speed, distance, pace, and routes
provides Polar running workouts
assists with recovery
Cons
slow syncing

The Coros Pace 2 packs a lot into one of the lightest smartwatches out there. It has some impressive features that go beyond the heart rate monitoring, sleep tracking, and workout stats of other watches (it has all those features too, tho).
What it tracks
With more than 200 built-in exercises, you can use the Pace 2 to create custom workouts. (Some of the profiles have to be downloaded from the COROS app.)
The watch monitors your body movements to make sure you’ve got the right form and keeps an eye on your heart rate and calories. That makes this guy an absolute beast at the gym.
Even cooler, it creates a muscle heat map to show you how and where your workouts are hitting your body.
Other features and specs
The Pace 2 sends you notifications for messages and incoming calls. It also lets you share your fave workouts with your friends and fam through the Coros app.
Buuut, the screen can be hard to see in bright light.

Blood pressure monitors aren’t nearly as common on fitness trackers as heart rate monitors or blood oxygen sensors. That’s in part because they’re not as accurate. But if you’re keeping a close eye on
blood pressure
, the MorePro Fitness Tracker can help you do that at a very affordable price.
What it tracks
The blood pressure monitor offers a peek at your health, though don’t expect it to be as accurate as a device specifically designed for blood pressure monitoring. The MorePro also tracks blood oxygen, heart rate, sleep quality, steps, calories, and distance for an overall view of your health. It works with both iOS and Android devices using the Intelligent Activity Tracker.
Other features and specs
An adequate 5-day battery life is also nice at this price. However, this model doesn’t have a GPS or more advanced functions.
Pros
fairly reliable blood pressure monitor
also tracks heart rate, oxygen, steps, calories, and distance
good battery life
Cons
no GPS

Whether you’re an
ultrarunner
or just want to walk around the block, you need Energizer Bunny-level battery life. Ths Coros Apex gives you exactly that.
What it tracks
In addition to heart rate monitoring, it has a map, navigation feature, and 3D compass to keep you on track while working out. The navigation feature lets you preload maps and follows them while you’re running in unfamiliar territory. It even alerts you if you end up off your route.
This model has widgets that change everything on display, so you get an entire screen full of information with each widget. For example, the heart rate widget has a graph with your minimum and maximum heart rate, beats per minute, and average heart rate for the previous 6 hours.
Other features and specs
The Coros Apex’s battery can last up to 24 days in standard mode and 25 hours with the GPS running constantly. You can also set it to the UltraMax mode to save battery even more. (Not enough? Upgrade to the 46 millimeter version and you’ll get up to 35 hours in GPS mode and up to 30 days with basic functions.)
It can connect to several third-party apps, including TrainingPeaks, Relive, and Strava. It lacks a touch screen, but you can use the knob and button to get through all of the ample features.
Users love the battery life, though they’re not crazy on the dim screen (which you can’t adjust).

amazing battery life
widgets provide in-depth information
can set up a battery saver mode

Getting into fitness can be intimidating. This tracker makes it a lot easier. We have big time love for this fitness tracker — it’s simple, but gives you all the basic stats you need.
What it tracks
The Inspire 2 monitors steps, distance, hourly activity, and calories burned — and the easy-to-use
format isn’t overwhelming
.
It tracks your “Active Zone Minutes” (fat-burning, cardio, peak) and gives you a health score. Plus, it tells you how to improve your health score based on its collected data.
It does not have GPS or advanced analytics, but TBH, that makes sense at this price point.
Other features and specs
The standout feature for this one is access to the Fitbit app. The Fitbit app puts your health stats in perspective, offering advice on how to reach your fitness goals.
The Inspire 2 also gets texts, calendar notifications, and phone notifications. But we’ve found that notifications can be unreliable. Bonus: It comes with a free 1-year Fitbit Premium trial for new Premium users.
There are a few watch faces to choose from. We prefer the stats heavy face that lets you glance at steps,
calories,
heart rate, and distance quickly.
Pros
10 days of battery life
call, text, calendar, and smartphone app notifications on screen
excellent health information through the Fitbit app
Cons
unreliable notifications

The Garmin Vivosmart 4 takes a whole lot of readings, including the standard heart rate, steps, and distance. It also keeps a close eye on oxygen levels with the SpO
2
monitor.
What it tracks
It offers a wide range of activity tracking options. It’s got the traditional running and weightlifting, but you can also specify with indoor, outdoor, treadmill, trail, or obstacle. The same is true with cycling and more out-of-the-norm activities, like horseback riding, whitewater rafting, motocross, and hang gliding. Sounds pretty sweet.
And you get to see how those activities affect your heart rate and oxygen for more in-depth health monitoring.
Other features and specs
While you don’t get GPS with the Vivosmart 4, you get an inexpensive way to track a wide range of activities. It also has a great 7-day battery life.
It uses Bluetooth to connect to iOS or Android through the Garmin app. It’s also equipped with ANT+ to connect with
smart fitness equipment.
Reviewers don’t love that it requires a proprietary charger, and they say the touch screen could be more responsive. But other than that, it’s a crowd-pleaser.
Pros
tracks a wide range of activities
great battery life
takes reliable oxygen and heart rate readings
Cons
requires unique charger

How to choose
Ready to shop? Here’s what you should keep in mind as your start browsin’:
Know what you want to track.
If you just want to keep track of steps, distance, and heart rate, don’t pay for a fitness tracker with 50 activity options. If you’re interested in more extensive tracking like oxygen levels and blood pressure, you’ll need to look for trackers that specifically track those features. You can also opt for a watch that gives you advanced analytics into your health and suggests recovery and workout options.
Workout type.
Runner, swimmer, cyclist, triathlete? What are your sport(s)? If you’ve got one, choose a tracker that’s specialized. If you’re a jack of all trades, look for a model with wider activity options.
Touch screen vs. buttons.
Each interface type has its benefits. Buttons work well for swimmers and other activities where there’s a lot of jostling or slipping. Touch screens are great for scrolling through apps and stats. A model with both offers the best middle ground.
Battery life.
Extra features buzz through battery life, especially features like GPS and music. Smartwatches may only offer 1 or 2 days of battery life. It all comes down to preference — are you cool charging up every night, or would you rather stick to once a week? It’s often a trade-off between features and battery, so think about what features you need and which are only luxuries.
Extra features.
Do you want an all-purpose smartwatch or a fitness tracker that’s tailored to your favorite sport? Some watches can sync up with your phone to give you text, email, and call notifications. Others focus solely on metrics for specific sports.
Frequently asked questions
Is it worth getting a fitness tracker?
YES! Even if you’re not a fitness nerd, a fitness tracker can help you make sure you’re taking care of your body. It’s often surprising how little you’ve moved throughout the day — and a fitness tracker can give you the nudge you need to get up and moving.
Plus, they’re often super convenient for getting notifications from your phone right on your wrist.
What fitness tracker is the most accurate?
The Fitbit Charge 5 consistently rates well on accuracy and consistency, as did its predecessor, the Fitbit Charge 4. It may not have all of the fancy features of some of the more expensive models, but it provides plenty of information to fine-tune your workouts.
How much should I spend on a fitness tracker?
Your budget depends on what you want the tracker to do. If you just want to keep tabs on steps and heart rate, you can get a reliable model for under $100. However, if you’re looking to shave seconds
off of a 5K
or
triathlon,
you might need to invest several hundred dollars in a fitness tracker that analyzes biometrics to adjust your cadence and training schedule.
What fitness tracker has the best battery life?
The Coros Apex has one of the best batteries out there. Several of the other Coros fitness trackers rate almost as well. It’s a great brand that puts battery life high on the priority list.
The bottom line
Whether you’re training for the Olympics or just want to take your health more seriously, fitness trackers are the way to go. They help you set and stick to your
health goals
. With these 13 options, there’s something for everyone. Let’s get physical!

FAQs
Fitness trackers
have come a long way from their
pedometer beginnings
. The latest models track steps, stairs/altitude, distance, heart rate, and more. Athletes looking to shave seconds off their times can use
interval features
or advanced analytics to adjust
their pace
, stride length, and
running mechanics
.
One of these handy devices can be an eye-opener to how many (or few) steps you really take in a day. You can set goals, get reminders, and track all of
your activities
— from a
walk around the block
to a dance class. If you really want to get techy, you can get one with a
built-in GPS
to track your activities or sync your route ahead of time and get directions while you’re on the road.
So basically, fitness trackers can help you pump up the volume on your #FitLife. They can also get you more in tune with your body (which is never a bad thing!).
There’s a fitness track out there for erryone — from competitive athletes to the neighborhood walker. Here are the 13 best fitness trackers for all fitness levels, needs, and budgets.

Product Review, Fitness, Health Care, Technology
How we chose
We picked the 13 best fitness trackers based on budget, available features, accuracy, user reviews, and ease of use. We also opted for models with
heart rate monitoring
and online data syncing.
Budget
Fitness trackers can cost as little as $50 to well over $400. We included trackers that fall into every price range to meet the varied needs of
beginners
all the way up to competitive athletes. Keep in mind that the more you want the tracker to do, the higher the price tag.
Available features
Our list includes a few watches that keep things basic by monitoring
steps
,
heart rate
, distance, and that’s about it.
It also includes fitness trackers that get to know you better than you know yourself, with advanced tracking features like intervals, step vertical, step length, heart rate, and
VO
2
max information
to adjust
training intensity
or schedule.
Accuracy
From heart rate and oxygen levels to distance, accuracy matters. Ofc no fitness tracker is perfect, but the major players are sure trying.
We looked for models that were consistently accurate with features like the ability to connect to more than one satellite system so you don’t lose the GPS signal while
running or cycling through a tunnel
.
Ease of use
There’s something to be said for simplicity, but advanced features don’t always lend themselves to simple and easy. We looked for models that are intuitive to use, even if their list of features was long and somewhat complicated.
Pricing guide
Fitness trackers are def more expensive than the average stopwatch. The good news: There are TONS of options in a huge price range. Here’s a price guide to help you find the best fitness tracker for your body
and
budget.

= under $100

This fifth version of the Charge took an already great fitness tracker and made it even better. The Charge 5 has an aluminum housing and color display that makes it look classier than its predecessor — but fitness isn’t about looks, amirite?
What it tracks
This bad boy tracks steps, distance, floors climbed, and
calories burned
. But wait… there’s more!
The Charge 5 tracks heart rate, oxygen levels, changes in
skin temperature
, and uses an electrodermal sensor (EDA) to detect changes in
sweat
in response to
stress
. The tracker then gives you a “Daily Readiness Score” that gauges how ready you are for a workout (like maybe you need
to rest
or you’re not pushing hard enough). It also connects to an ECG app to detect atrial fibrillation, which can cause heart failure, blood clots, and other serious complications.
A built-in GPS tracks your pace and distance in real-time without your phone. You can see your route in the Fitbit app afterward, which is pretty flippin’ awesome (speaking from experience, we absolutely love the Fitbit app). It not only tracks the data collected by the tracker, but also interprets it and lets you know what you can do to improve your fitness. That includes “Active Zone Minutes” so you know whether you’re in the
fat-burning
,
cardio
, or peak performance zone.
The Charge 5 only recognizes
20 workout types
, which sounds like a lot but is a little limited considering that it’s a fitness tracker.
Other features and specs
The Charge 5 is waterproof up to 164 feet.
You can also adjust the display settings. For example, set it to always-on so you don’t have to wake the screen to check the time (but watch out, it drains the battery faster). Another heads up: The wake-up can be a little inconsistent.
Pros
displays real-time pace and distance
“Active Zone Minutes” measures time spent in fat-burning, cardio, or peak heart rate zone
GPS compatible with running, walking,
cycling
,
hiking
, interval workouts,
kayaking
, surfing, and
skiing
measures stress and connects to ECG app
Cons
screen wake sometimes inconsistent
lots of scrolling required to see different data points

If you want a run rundown, look no further. This GPS watch offers precise play-by-play.
What it tracks
Runners, get ready for great stats. The customizable screen can display
current pace
, average pace, total time, total distance, and heart rate. It also comes with a wrist-based heart rate monitor so you can track your progress.
The Forerunner 245 predicts stress levels and uses that plus your
sleep
, activity, and VO
2
max scores to calculate your energy levels, too. It can track 16 activity types and uses GPS to show a color map of your run in real-time. All your stats sync with the app and offer an in-depth view of your training results.
Other features and specs
A large color display means a quick glance can keep you up to date while you’re on the move. It’s bright and easy to read, BUT it takes some time to get used to the two-button control (no touch screen here, friends).
The top button starts activities and is the selector. The bottom button returns to the previous screen and starts lap times. Except for a steep learning curve, the Forerunner 245 offers great features for runners who want a closer look at their fitness stats.
On the downside, you have to upgrade to the Forerunner 245 Music to play (up to 500 songs), and the
heart rate monitor
isn’t as accurate as a chest strap.
Pros
Wi-Fi/Bluetooth capability to sync data to tracking
apps
smart notifications to display incoming emails, text alerts, and calendar notifications
offers real-time GPS maps and fitness data
Cons
can’t play music
wrist-based heart rate monitor maybe not be as accurate as a chest strap

This user-friendly watch is all about
#BikeLife
.
What it tracks
The Polar Vantage V2 does so much more than just let you know how fast your heart’s going.
In addition to heart rate, it tracks your distance, stress, and sleep patterns. It can also track 130 different sports. GPS tracking keeps you on route, too.
On top of everything, this tracker offers deeper insights that can improve
your cycling
and cross-training. It provides insight into recovery, training load, hill splits, and running power. The app uses all that information — plus your sleep stats — to give you recovery-based workout recommendations.
Other features and specs
The Polar Vantage V2 is compatible with many third-party apps (like TrainingPeaks or Strava), chest straps, and cadence sensors to further enhance your training. Woot!
On the downside, reviewers find the touch screen a little sluggish. And with all of those features, it’s overwhelming at first, until you learn what features you want to use and how to use them.
Pros
lightweight
long battery life
can connect with Bluetooth-compatible sensors

If you’re a
swimmer
or triathlete, this multisport watch is the way to go.
What it tracks
The smartwatch is equipped with a wrist-based heart rate monitor and provides GPS mode for up to 14 hours. The 735XT also features swimming stroke detection and is accurate enough to help you adjust your training as needed, whether in the pool or open water.
The downside is that the 735XT doesn’t track some of the more advanced metrics (stride length, vertical ratio) without purchasing a separate device.
Other features and specs
While some people may not like the large control buttons, they’re easier to find and control in the water. The big, bright screen is also more visible in the water.
And when you’re not in the water? It’s ANT+ and Bluetooth compatible, so you can connect it to
smart fitness equipment
on dry land.
Marathoners and ultrarunners, this watch can keep up with you! Even when connected to your mobile phone, it hangs on to battery life for up to 14 hours in GPS mode and 24 hours if you turn off heart rate monitoring.
Pros
long-lasting GPS and battery life
can estimate VO
2
max and predict race times
connects to smart fitness equipment
highly visible and easy to control in the water
Cons
requires a separate device (a Running Dynamics Pod, HRM Run, or HRM Tri Monitor) to track ground contact time balance, stride length, and vertical ratio

This sleek and simple watch won’t break the bank. It’s a great buy if you want a no-thrills, high quality fitness tracker.
What it tracks
There are a total of 96 exercise modes, and we challenge you to try them all.
It has sport modes for outdoor and indoor running,
cycling
, and
walking
, and more. You can also use it on
fitness equipment
, in the pool, and for open-water swimming.
The Band 6 keeps a 24/7 eye on your heart rate and SpO
2
levels. If your oxygen levels or heart rate get too low, expect a buzz and notification.
Other features and specs
Depending on the modes and use, the battery lasts an impressive 10 to 14 days. You can also get text notifications and control music on your phone if you’ve got an Android (sorry, iOS users, you miss out on this feature).
All the good comes with a few bads, including a small screen and some reviewers who claim the step count isn’t entirely accurate.
Pros
strong GPS signal
can sync to your phone
great bang for your buck
Cons
smallish screen
questionable accuracy of step count, according to reviewers

Here’s one for all the Apple aficionados out there. This is a fab find if you want a smartwatch that does more than track fitness. It has all the fab features of the Series 6, but with some extra spice.
What it tracks
Like with other Apple Watch models, you can use Apple’s Health app to track activity, exercise, and standing and the Fitness+ app for workout streaming directly on your wrist.
The Series 7 also features a blood oxygen sensor and electrical heart sensor you can use with the ECG app to keep an eye on your heart health. And you get extra health benefits like a hand-washing countdown timer and
menstrual cycle
tracking.
Other features and specs
The latest Apple Watch upgrade features a bigger face, better durability (which you’ll need on
outdoor workouts
), and faster charging. You can also take calls and respond to messages right from your wrist.
Where the Series 7 outshines just about everyone is on the
third-party app
options. Apple still leads the way, and you can decide which apps to activate on the watch, from communication to fitness.
However, this watch is pricey, and it only has an 18-hour battery life (that’s on par with watches of similar quality and features). BUT Apple tempers that with new 45-minute charging (and speaking from experience with older Apple Watch models, 45-minute charging would be AMAZING).
Pros
offers a wide range of
third-party apps
measures blood oxygen saturation (SpO
2
) on demand
ECG app
Cons
compatible with iPhone only
more expensive than other smartwatches

Polar makes some intense watches that keep you on track and swamped in data. That makes this tracker the best choice if you’re
going the literal distance
on your runs. The data is detailed (sometimes a little too much), which makes reaching your targets a lot easier.
What it tracks
This tracks all the basics: steps, heart rate, and workouts like
yoga
, swimming, walking, running, and more.
But a huge reason this watch gets high marks (besides the 20-hour GPS life) is the
workout suggestions
offered in the Polar app. Using the FitSpark dashboard, you get training suggestions based on your
fitness level
, training history, and recovery stats. The Ignite also changes the stats you see based on the activity you’re doing — distance for walking and running and duration for
weight training
sessions. It also syncs with several satellites to prevent signal loss.
Other features and specs
We love that the battery can power the GPS and heart rate monitor for up to 20 hours. (Ultrarunners, take note that this watch might outlast you.) Without all of the fancy doodads on, it can last up to 5days.
We’re also loving that Polar offers a touch screen *and* some manual buttons to navigate. That makes up for the less sensitive touch screen, which can be delayed at times.
Pros
can sync data to third-party platforms with Garmin Connect app
equipped with Garmin Pay for contactless payment from your watch
workout suggestions
connects with multiple satellites
Cons
more complex setup than other trackers

The Polar M430 is designed for athletes,
runners in particular.
However, it’s got an ultra-accurate heart rate monitor that helps anyone keep track of those beats. The sporty design might not pass in the boardroom — but for casual wear, it’s fantastic.
What it tracks
The M430 is equipped with the Polar fitness test, which gives you a fitness level reading to help you reach your fitness goals. After every run, the watch calculates your running index, which is designed to help you improve your aerobic running performance.
Recovery is just as important as workouts, and the M430 compares the load from your workouts to make sure you’re giving yourself enough downtime. You can also use it with the Polar running program if you need some help developing your workouts. Plus, it’s got integrated GPS and indoor running metrics.
Other features and specs
This watch can last up to 30 hours (with the right GPS settings), which we can all agree is a lot for continous heart rate monitoring.
You can also get vibrating notifications of calls, messages, and reminders to get moving.
It syncs up with third party apps like Strava, Nike+ Run Club, and TrainingPeaks. But some peeps report that it’s a little slow on the syncing.
Pros
provides accurate heart rate data
tracks speed, distance, pace, and routes
provides Polar running workouts
assists with recovery
Cons
slow syncing
sport design isn’t for everyone

The Coros Pace 2 packs a lot into one of the lightest smartwatches out there. It has some impressive features that go beyond the heart rate monitoring, sleep tracking, and workout stats of other watches (it has all those features too, tho).
What it tracks
With more than 200 built-in exercises, you can use the Pace 2 to create custom workouts. (Some of the profiles have to be downloaded from the COROS app.)
The watch monitors your body movements to make sure you’ve got the right form and keeps an eye on your heart rate and calories. That makes this guy an absolute beast at the gym.
Even cooler, it creates a muscle heat map to show you how and where your workouts are hitting your body.
Other features and specs
The Pace 2 sends you notifications for messages and incoming calls. It also lets you share your fave workouts with your friends and fam through the Coros app.
Buuut, the screen can be hard to see in bright light.
Pros
lightweight and stylish
can track numerous workouts
create and share custom workouts
Cons
screen is difficult to see in bright light

Blood pressure monitors aren’t nearly as common on fitness trackers as heart rate monitors or blood oxygen sensors. That’s in part because they’re not as accurate. But if you’re keeping a close eye on
blood pressure
, the MorePro Fitness Tracker can help you do that at a very affordable price.
What it tracks
The blood pressure monitor offers a peek at your health, though don’t expect it to be as accurate as a device specifically designed for blood pressure monitoring. The MorePro also tracks blood oxygen, heart rate, sleep quality, steps, calories, and distance for an overall view of your health. It works with both iOS and Android devices using the Intelligent Activity Tracker.
Other features and specs
An adequate 5-day battery life is also nice at this price. However, this model doesn’t have a GPS or more advanced functions.
Pros
fairly reliable blood pressure monitor
also tracks heart rate, oxygen, steps, calories, and distance
good battery life
Cons

Whether you’re an
ultrarunner
or just want to walk around the block, you need Energizer Bunny-level battery life. Ths Coros Apex gives you exactly that.
What it tracks
In addition to heart rate monitoring, it has a map, navigation feature, and 3D compass to keep you on track while working out. The navigation feature lets you preload maps and follows them while you’re running in unfamiliar territory. It even alerts you if you end up off your route.
This model has widgets that change everything on display, so you get an entire screen full of information with each widget. For example, the heart rate widget has a graph with your minimum and maximum heart rate, beats per minute, and average heart rate for the previous 6 hours.
Other features and specs
The Coros Apex’s battery can last up to 24 days in standard mode and 25 hours with the GPS running constantly. You can also set it to the UltraMax mode to save battery even more. (Not enough? Upgrade to the 46 millimeter version and you’ll get up to 35 hours in GPS mode and up to 30 days with basic functions.)
It can connect to several third-party apps, including TrainingPeaks, Relive, and Strava. It lacks a touch screen, but you can use the knob and button to get through all of the ample features.
Users love the battery life, though they’re not crazy on the dim screen (which you can’t adjust).
Pros
amazing battery life
widgets provide in-depth information
can set up a battery saver mode
Cons

Getting into fitness can be intimidating. This tracker makes it a lot easier. We have big time love for this fitness tracker — it’s simple, but gives you all the basic stats you need.
What it tracks
The Inspire 2 monitors steps, distance, hourly activity, and calories burned — and the easy-to-use
format isn’t overwhelming
.
It tracks your “Active Zone Minutes” (fat-burning, cardio, peak) and gives you a health score. Plus, it tells you how to improve your health score based on its collected data.
It does not have GPS or advanced analytics, but TBH, that makes sense at this price point.
Other features and specs
The standout feature for this one is access to the Fitbit app. The Fitbit app puts your health stats in perspective, offering advice on how to reach your fitness goals.
The Inspire 2 also gets texts, calendar notifications, and phone notifications. But we’ve found that notifications can be unreliable. Bonus: It comes with a free 1-year Fitbit Premium trial for new Premium users.
There are a few watch faces to choose from. We prefer the stats heavy face that lets you glance at steps,
calories,
heart rate, and distance quickly.
Pros
10 days of battery life
call, text, calendar, and smartphone app notifications on screen
excellent health information through the Fitbit app
Cons
unreliable notifications

The Garmin Vivosmart 4 takes a whole lot of readings, including the standard heart rate, steps, and distance. It also keeps a close eye on oxygen levels with the SpO
2
monitor.
What it tracks
It offers a wide range of activity tracking options. It’s got the traditional running and weightlifting, but you can also specify with indoor, outdoor, treadmill, trail, or obstacle. The same is true with cycling and more out-of-the-norm activities, like horseback riding, whitewater rafting, motocross, and hang gliding. Sounds pretty sweet.
And you get to see how those activities affect your heart rate and oxygen for more in-depth health monitoring.
Other features and specs
While you don’t get GPS with the Vivosmart 4, you get an inexpensive way to track a wide range of activities. It also has a great 7-day battery life.
It uses Bluetooth to connect to iOS or Android through the Garmin app. It’s also equipped with ANT+ to connect with
smart fitness equipment.
Reviewers don’t love that it requires a proprietary charger, and they say the touch screen could be more responsive. But other than that, it’s a crowd-pleaser.
Pros
tracks a wide range of activities
great battery life
takes reliable oxygen and heart rate readings
Cons
requires unique charger

How to choose
Ready to shop? Here’s what you should keep in mind as your start browsin’:
Know what you want to track.
If you just want to keep track of steps, distance, and heart rate, don’t pay for a fitness tracker with 50 activity options. If you’re interested in more extensive tracking like oxygen levels and blood pressure, you’ll need to look for trackers that specifically track those features. You can also opt for a watch that gives you advanced analytics into your health and suggests recovery and workout options.
Workout type.
Runner, swimmer, cyclist, triathlete? What are your sport(s)? If you’ve got one, choose a tracker that’s specialized. If you’re a jack of all trades, look for a model with wider activity options.
Touch screen vs. buttons.
Each interface type has its benefits. Buttons work well for swimmers and other activities where there’s a lot of jostling or slipping. Touch screens are great for scrolling through apps and stats. A model with both offers the best middle ground.
Battery life.
Extra features buzz through battery life, especially features like GPS and music. Smartwatches may only offer 1 or 2 days of battery life. It all comes down to preference — are you cool charging up every night, or would you rather stick to once a week? It’s often a trade-off between features and battery, so think about what features you need and which are only luxuries.
Extra features.
Do you want an all-purpose smartwatch or a fitness tracker that’s tailored to your favorite sport? Some watches can sync up with your phone to give you text, email, and call notifications. Others focus solely on metrics for specific sports.
Frequently asked questions
Is it worth getting a fitness tracker?
YES! Even if you’re not a fitness nerd, a fitness tracker can help you make sure you’re taking care of your body. It’s often surprising how little you’ve moved throughout the day — and a fitness tracker can give you the nudge you need to get up and moving.
Plus, they’re often super convenient for getting notifications from your phone right on your wrist.
What fitness tracker is the most accurate?
The Fitbit Charge 5 consistently rates well on accuracy and consistency, as did its predecessor, the Fitbit Charge 4. It may not have all of the fancy features of some of the more expensive models, but it provides plenty of information to fine-tune your workouts.
How much should I spend on a fitness tracker?
Your budget depends on what you want the tracker to do. If you just want to keep tabs on steps and heart rate, you can get a reliable model for under $100. However, if you’re looking to shave seconds
off of a 5K
or
triathlon,
you might need to invest several hundred dollars in a fitness tracker that analyzes biometrics to adjust your cadence and training schedule.
What fitness tracker has the best battery life?
The Coros Apex has one of the best batteries out there. Several of the other Coros fitness trackers rate almost as well. It’s a great brand that puts battery life high on the priority list.
The bottom line
Whether you’re training for the Olympics or just want to take your health more seriously, fitness trackers are the way to go. They help you set and stick to your
health goals
. With these 13 options, there’s something for everyone. Let’s get physical!

FAQs
Fitness trackers
have come a long way from their
pedometer beginnings
. The latest models track steps, stairs/altitude, distance, heart rate, and more. Athletes looking to shave seconds off their times can use
interval features
or advanced analytics to adjust
their pace
, stride length, and
running mechanics
.
One of these handy devices can be an eye-opener to how many (or few) steps you really take in a day. You can set goals, get reminders, and track all of
your activities
— from a
walk around the block
to a dance class. If you really want to get techy, you can get one with a
built-in GPS
to track your activities or sync your route ahead of time and get directions while you’re on the road.
So basically, fitness trackers can help you pump up the volume on your #FitLife. They can also get you more in tune with your body (which is never a bad thing!).
There’s a fitness track out there for erryone — from competitive athletes to the neighborhood walker. Here are the 13 best fitness trackers for all fitness levels, needs, and budgets.

Product Review, Fitness, Health Care, Technology
How we chose
We picked the 13 best fitness trackers based on budget, available features, accuracy, user reviews, and ease of use. We also opted for models with
heart rate monitoring
and online data syncing.
Budget
Fitness trackers can cost as little as $50 to well over $400. We included trackers that fall into every price range to meet the varied needs of
beginners
all the way up to competitive athletes. Keep in mind that the more you want the tracker to do, the higher the price tag.
Available features
Our list includes a few watches that keep things basic by monitoring
steps
,
heart rate
, distance, and that’s about it.
It also includes fitness trackers that get to know you better than you know yourself, with advanced tracking features like intervals, step vertical, step length, heart rate, and
VO
2
max information
to adjust
training intensity
or schedule.
Accuracy
From heart rate and oxygen levels to distance, accuracy matters. Ofc no fitness tracker is perfect, but the major players are sure trying.
We looked for models that were consistently accurate with features like the ability to connect to more than one satellite system so you don’t lose the GPS signal while
running or cycling through a tunnel
.
Ease of use
There’s something to be said for simplicity, but advanced features don’t always lend themselves to simple and easy. We looked for models that are intuitive to use, even if their list of features was long and somewhat complicated.
Pricing guide
Fitness trackers are def more expensive than the average stopwatch. The good news: There are TONS of options in a huge price range. Here’s a price guide to help you find the best fitness tracker for your body
and
budget.

= under $100

This fifth version of the Charge took an already great fitness tracker and made it even better. The Charge 5 has an aluminum housing and color display that makes it look classier than its predecessor — but fitness isn’t about looks, amirite?
What it tracks
This bad boy tracks steps, distance, floors climbed, and
calories burned
. But wait… there’s more!
The Charge 5 tracks heart rate, oxygen levels, changes in
skin temperature
, and uses an electrodermal sensor (EDA) to detect changes in
sweat
in response to
stress
. The tracker then gives you a “Daily Readiness Score” that gauges how ready you are for a workout (like maybe you need
to rest
or you’re not pushing hard enough). It also connects to an ECG app to detect atrial fibrillation, which can cause heart failure, blood clots, and other serious complications.
A built-in GPS tracks your pace and distance in real-time without your phone. You can see your route in the Fitbit app afterward, which is pretty flippin’ awesome (speaking from experience, we absolutely love the Fitbit app). It not only tracks the data collected by the tracker, but also interprets it and lets you know what you can do to improve your fitness. That includes “Active Zone Minutes” so you know whether you’re in the
fat-burning
,
cardio
, or peak performance zone.
The Charge 5 only recognizes
20 workout types
, which sounds like a lot but is a little limited considering that it’s a fitness tracker.
Other features and specs
The Charge 5 is waterproof up to 164 feet.
You can also adjust the display settings. For example, set it to always-on so you don’t have to wake the screen to check the time (but watch out, it drains the battery faster). Another heads up: The wake-up can be a little inconsistent.
Pros
displays real-time pace and distance
“Active Zone Minutes” measures time spent in fat-burning, cardio, or peak heart rate zone
GPS compatible with running, walking,
cycling
,
hiking
, interval workouts,
kayaking
, surfing, and
skiing
measures stress and connects to ECG app
Cons
screen wake sometimes inconsistent
lots of scrolling required to see different data points

If you want a run rundown, look no further. This GPS watch offers precise play-by-play.
What it tracks
Runners, get ready for great stats. The customizable screen can display
current pace
, average pace, total time, total distance, and heart rate. It also comes with a wrist-based heart rate monitor so you can track your progress.
The Forerunner 245 predicts stress levels and uses that plus your
sleep
, activity, and VO
2
max scores to calculate your energy levels, too. It can track 16 activity types and uses GPS to show a color map of your run in real-time. All your stats sync with the app and offer an in-depth view of your training results.
Other features and specs
A large color display means a quick glance can keep you up to date while you’re on the move. It’s bright and easy to read, BUT it takes some time to get used to the two-button control (no touch screen here, friends).
The top button starts activities and is the selector. The bottom button returns to the previous screen and starts lap times. Except for a steep learning curve, the Forerunner 245 offers great features for runners who want a closer look at their fitness stats.
On the downside, you have to upgrade to the Forerunner 245 Music to play (up to 500 songs), and the
heart rate monitor
isn’t as accurate as a chest strap.
Pros
Wi-Fi/Bluetooth capability to sync data to tracking
apps
smart notifications to display incoming emails, text alerts, and calendar notifications
offers real-time GPS maps and fitness data
Cons
can’t play music
wrist-based heart rate monitor maybe not be as accurate as a chest strap

This user-friendly watch is all about
#BikeLife
.
What it tracks
The Polar Vantage V2 does so much more than just let you know how fast your heart’s going.
In addition to heart rate, it tracks your distance, stress, and sleep patterns. It can also track 130 different sports. GPS tracking keeps you on route, too.
On top of everything, this tracker offers deeper insights that can improve
your cycling
and cross-training. It provides insight into recovery, training load, hill splits, and running power. The app uses all that information — plus your sleep stats — to give you recovery-based workout recommendations.
Other features and specs
The Polar Vantage V2 is compatible with many third-party apps (like TrainingPeaks or Strava), chest straps, and cadence sensors to further enhance your training. Woot!
On the downside, reviewers find the touch screen a little sluggish. And with all of those features, it’s overwhelming at first, until you learn what features you want to use and how to use them.
Pros
lightweight

can connect with Bluetooth-compatible sensors

If you’re a
swimmer
or triathlete, this multisport watch is the way to go.
What it tracks
The smartwatch is equipped with a wrist-based heart rate monitor and provides GPS mode for up to 14 hours. The 735XT also features swimming stroke detection and is accurate enough to help you adjust your training as needed, whether in the pool or open water.
The downside is that the 735XT doesn’t track some of the more advanced metrics (stride length, vertical ratio) without purchasing a separate device.
Other features and specs
While some people may not like the large control buttons, they’re easier to find and control in the water. The big, bright screen is also more visible in the water.
And when you’re not in the water? It’s ANT+ and Bluetooth compatible, so you can connect it to
smart fitness equipment
on dry land.
Marathoners and ultrarunners, this watch can keep up with you! Even when connected to your mobile phone, it hangs on to battery life for up to 14 hours in GPS mode and 24 hours if you turn off heart rate monitoring.
Pros
long-lasting GPS and battery life
can estimate VO
2
max and predict race times
connects to smart fitness equipment
highly visible and easy to control in the water
Cons
requires a separate device (a Running Dynamics Pod, HRM Run, or HRM Tri Monitor) to track ground contact time balance, stride length, and vertical ratio

This sleek and simple watch won’t break the bank. It’s a great buy if you want a no-thrills, high quality fitness tracker.
What it tracks
There are a total of 96 exercise modes, and we challenge you to try them all.
It has sport modes for outdoor and indoor running,
cycling
, and
walking
, and more. You can also use it on
fitness equipment
, in the pool, and for open-water swimming.
The Band 6 keeps a 24/7 eye on your heart rate and SpO
2
levels. If your oxygen levels or heart rate get too low, expect a buzz and notification.
Other features and specs
Depending on the modes and use, the battery lasts an impressive 10 to 14 days. You can also get text notifications and control music on your phone if you’ve got an Android (sorry, iOS users, you miss out on this feature).
All the good comes with a few bads, including a small screen and some reviewers who claim the step count isn’t entirely accurate.
Pros
strong GPS signal
can sync to your phone
great bang for your buck
Cons
smallish screen
questionable accuracy of step count, according to reviewers

Here’s one for all the Apple aficionados out there. This is a fab find if you want a smartwatch that does more than track fitness. It has all the fab features of the Series 6, but with some extra spice.
What it tracks
Like with other Apple Watch models, you can use Apple’s Health app to track activity, exercise, and standing and the Fitness+ app for workout streaming directly on your wrist.
The Series 7 also features a blood oxygen sensor and electrical heart sensor you can use with the ECG app to keep an eye on your heart health. And you get extra health benefits like a hand-washing countdown timer and
menstrual cycle
tracking.
Other features and specs
The latest Apple Watch upgrade features a bigger face, better durability (which you’ll need on
outdoor workouts
), and faster charging. You can also take calls and respond to messages right from your wrist.
Where the Series 7 outshines just about everyone is on the
third-party app
options. Apple still leads the way, and you can decide which apps to activate on the watch, from communication to fitness.
However, this watch is pricey, and it only has an 18-hour battery life (that’s on par with watches of similar quality and features). BUT Apple tempers that with new 45-minute charging (and speaking from experience with older Apple Watch models, 45-minute charging would be AMAZING).
Pros
offers a wide range of
third-party apps
measures blood oxygen saturation (SpO
2
) on demand
ECG app
Cons
compatible with iPhone only
more expensive than other smartwatches
short battery life

Polar makes some intense watches that keep you on track and swamped in data. That makes this tracker the best choice if you’re
going the literal distance
on your runs. The data is detailed (sometimes a little too much), which makes reaching your targets a lot easier.
What it tracks
This tracks all the basics: steps, heart rate, and workouts like
yoga
, swimming, walking, running, and more.
But a huge reason this watch gets high marks (besides the 20-hour GPS life) is the
workout suggestions
offered in the Polar app. Using the FitSpark dashboard, you get training suggestions based on your
fitness level
, training history, and recovery stats. The Ignite also changes the stats you see based on the activity you’re doing — distance for walking and running and duration for
weight training
sessions. It also syncs with several satellites to prevent signal loss.
Other features and specs
We love that the battery can power the GPS and heart rate monitor for up to 20 hours. (Ultrarunners, take note that this watch might outlast you.) Without all of the fancy doodads on, it can last up to 5days.
We’re also loving that Polar offers a touch screen *and* some manual buttons to navigate. That makes up for the less sensitive touch screen, which can be delayed at times.
Pros
can sync data to third-party platforms with Garmin Connect app
equipped with Garmin Pay for contactless payment from your watch
workout suggestions
connects with multiple satellites
Cons
more complex setup than other trackers

The Polar M430 is designed for athletes,
runners in particular.
However, it’s got an ultra-accurate heart rate monitor that helps anyone keep track of those beats. The sporty design might not pass in the boardroom — but for casual wear, it’s fantastic.
What it tracks
The M430 is equipped with the Polar fitness test, which gives you a fitness level reading to help you reach your fitness goals. After every run, the watch calculates your running index, which is designed to help you improve your aerobic running performance.
Recovery is just as important as workouts, and the M430 compares the load from your workouts to make sure you’re giving yourself enough downtime. You can also use it with the Polar running program if you need some help developing your workouts. Plus, it’s got integrated GPS and indoor running metrics.
Other features and specs
This watch can last up to 30 hours (with the right GPS settings), which we can all agree is a lot for continous heart rate monitoring.
You can also get vibrating notifications of calls, messages, and reminders to get moving.
It syncs up with third party apps like Strava, Nike+ Run Club, and TrainingPeaks. But some peeps report that it’s a little slow on the syncing.
Pros
provides accurate heart rate data
tracks speed, distance, pace, and routes
provides Polar running workouts
assists with recovery
Cons
slow syncing

The Coros Pace 2 packs a lot into one of the lightest smartwatches out there. It has some impressive features that go beyond the heart rate monitoring, sleep tracking, and workout stats of other watches (it has all those features too, tho).
What it tracks
With more than 200 built-in exercises, you can use the Pace 2 to create custom workouts. (Some of the profiles have to be downloaded from the COROS app.)
The watch monitors your body movements to make sure you’ve got the right form and keeps an eye on your heart rate and calories. That makes this guy an absolute beast at the gym.
Even cooler, it creates a muscle heat map to show you how and where your workouts are hitting your body.
Other features and specs
The Pace 2 sends you notifications for messages and incoming calls. It also lets you share your fave workouts with your friends and fam through the Coros app.
Buuut, the screen can be hard to see in bright light.
Pros
lightweight and stylish
can track numerous workouts
create and share custom workouts

Blood pressure monitors aren’t nearly as common on fitness trackers as heart rate monitors or blood oxygen sensors. That’s in part because they’re not as accurate. But if you’re keeping a close eye on
blood pressure
, the MorePro Fitness Tracker can help you do that at a very affordable price.
What it tracks
The blood pressure monitor offers a peek at your health, though don’t expect it to be as accurate as a device specifically designed for blood pressure monitoring. The MorePro also tracks blood oxygen, heart rate, sleep quality, steps, calories, and distance for an overall view of your health. It works with both iOS and Android devices using the Intelligent Activity Tracker.
Other features and specs
An adequate 5-day battery life is also nice at this price. However, this model doesn’t have a GPS or more advanced functions.
Pros
fairly reliable blood pressure monitor
also tracks heart rate, oxygen, steps, calories, and distance
good battery life
Cons

Whether you’re an
ultrarunner
or just want to walk around the block, you need Energizer Bunny-level battery life. Ths Coros Apex gives you exactly that.
What it tracks
In addition to heart rate monitoring, it has a map, navigation feature, and 3D compass to keep you on track while working out. The navigation feature lets you preload maps and follows them while you’re running in unfamiliar territory. It even alerts you if you end up off your route.
This model has widgets that change everything on display, so you get an entire screen full of information with each widget. For example, the heart rate widget has a graph with your minimum and maximum heart rate, beats per minute, and average heart rate for the previous 6 hours.
Other features and specs
The Coros Apex’s battery can last up to 24 days in standard mode and 25 hours with the GPS running constantly. You can also set it to the UltraMax mode to save battery even more. (Not enough? Upgrade to the 46 millimeter version and you’ll get up to 35 hours in GPS mode and up to 30 days with basic functions.)
It can connect to several third-party apps, including TrainingPeaks, Relive, and Strava. It lacks a touch screen, but you can use the knob and button to get through all of the ample features.
Users love the battery life, though they’re not crazy on the dim screen (which you can’t adjust).

Getting into fitness can be intimidating. This tracker makes it a lot easier. We have big time love for this fitness tracker — it’s simple, but gives you all the basic stats you need.
What it tracks
The Inspire 2 monitors steps, distance, hourly activity, and calories burned — and the easy-to-use
format isn’t overwhelming
.
It tracks your “Active Zone Minutes” (fat-burning, cardio, peak) and gives you a health score. Plus, it tells you how to improve your health score based on its collected data.
It does not have GPS or advanced analytics, but TBH, that makes sense at this price point.
Other features and specs
The standout feature for this one is access to the Fitbit app. The Fitbit app puts your health stats in perspective, offering advice on how to reach your fitness goals.
The Inspire 2 also gets texts, calendar notifications, and phone notifications. But we’ve found that notifications can be unreliable. Bonus: It comes with a free 1-year Fitbit Premium trial for new Premium users.
There are a few watch faces to choose from. We prefer the stats heavy face that lets you glance at steps,
calories,
heart rate, and distance quickly.
Pros
10 days of battery life
call, text, calendar, and smartphone app notifications on screen
excellent health information through the Fitbit app
Cons
unreliable notifications

The Garmin Vivosmart 4 takes a whole lot of readings, including the standard heart rate, steps, and distance. It also keeps a close eye on oxygen levels with the SpO
2
monitor.
What it tracks
It offers a wide range of activity tracking options. It’s got the traditional running and weightlifting, but you can also specify with indoor, outdoor, treadmill, trail, or obstacle. The same is true with cycling and more out-of-the-norm activities, like horseback riding, whitewater rafting, motocross, and hang gliding. Sounds pretty sweet.
And you get to see how those activities affect your heart rate and oxygen for more in-depth health monitoring.
Other features and specs
While you don’t get GPS with the Vivosmart 4, you get an inexpensive way to track a wide range of activities. It also has a great 7-day battery life.
It uses Bluetooth to connect to iOS or Android through the Garmin app. It’s also equipped with ANT+ to connect with
smart fitness equipment.
Reviewers don’t love that it requires a proprietary charger, and they say the touch screen could be more responsive. But other than that, it’s a crowd-pleaser.
Pros
tracks a wide range of activities

How to choose
Ready to shop? Here’s what you should keep in mind as your start browsin’:
Know what you want to track.
If you just want to keep track of steps, distance, and heart rate, don’t pay for a fitness tracker with 50 activity options. If you’re interested in more extensive tracking like oxygen levels and blood pressure, you’ll need to look for trackers that specifically track those features. You can also opt for a watch that gives you advanced analytics into your health and suggests recovery and workout options.
Workout type.
Runner, swimmer, cyclist, triathlete? What are your sport(s)? If you’ve got one, choose a tracker that’s specialized. If you’re a jack of all trades, look for a model with wider activity options.
Touch screen vs. buttons.
Each interface type has its benefits. Buttons work well for swimmers and other activities where there’s a lot of jostling or slipping. Touch screens are great for scrolling through apps and stats. A model with both offers the best middle ground.
Battery life.
Extra features buzz through battery life, especially features like GPS and music. Smartwatches may only offer 1 or 2 days of battery life. It all comes down to preference — are you cool charging up every night, or would you rather stick to once a week? It’s often a trade-off between features and battery, so think about what features you need and which are only luxuries.
Extra features.
Do you want an all-purpose smartwatch or a fitness tracker that’s tailored to your favorite sport? Some watches can sync up with your phone to give you text, email, and call notifications. Others focus solely on metrics for specific sports.
Frequently asked questions
Is it worth getting a fitness tracker?
YES! Even if you’re not a fitness nerd, a fitness tracker can help you make sure you’re taking care of your body. It’s often surprising how little you’ve moved throughout the day — and a fitness tracker can give you the nudge you need to get up and moving.
Plus, they’re often super convenient for getting notifications from your phone right on your wrist.
What fitness tracker is the most accurate?
The Fitbit Charge 5 consistently rates well on accuracy and consistency, as did its predecessor, the Fitbit Charge 4. It may not have all of the fancy features of some of the more expensive models, but it provides plenty of information to fine-tune your workouts.
How much should I spend on a fitness tracker?
Your budget depends on what you want the tracker to do. If you just want to keep tabs on steps and heart rate, you can get a reliable model for under $100. However, if you’re looking to shave seconds
off of a 5K
or
triathlon,
you might need to invest several hundred dollars in a fitness tracker that analyzes biometrics to adjust your cadence and training schedule.
What fitness tracker has the best battery life?
The Coros Apex has one of the best batteries out there. Several of the other Coros fitness trackers rate almost as well. It’s a great brand that puts battery life high on the priority list.
The bottom line
Whether you’re training for the Olympics or just want to take your health more seriously, fitness trackers are the way to go. They help you set and stick to your
health goals
. With these 13 options, there’s something for everyone. Let’s get physical!

I Tried VR Fitness and It Totally Changed My Workout Routine

Considerations before buying
Shop VR headsets
Over the last couple of months, tons of peeps have been hitting up their old
fave fitness studios
and
gyms
to get their sweat on. But as the
Delta variant
continues to spread in the U.S., some people might be thinking about dusting off their
home workout gear
and WOFH.
But let’s be real here: the sound of going back to the same
stationary bike
workouts and
burpee routines
doesn’t sound fun at all. So WTF do we do if we’re trying to avoid exercising in public but don’t want to lose the motivation we just FINALLY got back?
Enter: Virtual reality fitness. VR fitness is a ~new age~ way to get fit at home. It’s similar to the experience you get taking a
Peloton
or
iFit
class, but goes a step further by immersing you in a whole other world. And while some games are a little more “traditional” — with trainers and coaches guiding a certain type of workout — others don’t feel like a typical fitness class at all.
I tried a bunch of these VR fitness games and it was a total game changer (pun intended). Here are the games that ended up being my fitness faves.

How we chose the best VR fitness games
There are lots of VR fitness options out there, but all the games you’ll see below are specifically for the
Oculus Quest 2
headset — because that’s what I had available to test. BUT the Oculus Question 2 is also pretty rad. The standalone unit is wire-free and legit made me gasp out loud the first time I used it. (Seriously, I now understand the appeal of a Ready Player One-style life.)
Outside of being for Oculus Question 2, here are some other things I considered when picking the best games:
Actually makes you sweat.
First things first. This game absolutely needs to give you a
real workout
. If it doesn’t, then you might as well be sitting at your computer playing The Sims. Some of the games on this list aren’t even marketed as fitness games, but they still made the list because they require some serious sweat-inducing movement to play.
User friendly.
That means it’s easy to get the hang of the game with some practice and no major bugs that get in the way of gameplay.
No motion sickness.
I didn’t include any games that gave me motion sickness. Because working out shouldn’t make you vom.
Fun.
An obvi one, but if you’re going to be dropping some dough on a VR headset and potentially a monthly membership for a fitness game, it should def be an entertaining way to get your workout on.
The VR fitness games I’m playing on repeat
Best overall VR fitness game
Supernatural
Share on Pinterest
Price:
$18.99/month or $179.99/year, 30-day free trial available
This rhythm-based game is hard to explain to anyone who hasn’t tried VR because it’s so different from anything IRL. If I told you to try a game where you stand on a platform in the middle of beautiful landscapes around the world while you try to smash orbs,
squat
, and
lunge
inside triangles on beat to
awesome music
(Oh, and also, you hit the orbs with big glowing bats??), you’d probably look at me funny.
It sounds weird AF, but it’s also oddly addictive. The magic of Supernatural is the combination of catchy tunes and A+ coaches who guide you through each workout. Unlike other fitness platform narrators, Supernatural’s fab coaches have never uttered a single word about shredding,
toning
, or blasting calories. So far, what I’ve experienced is a diet culture-free zone. YASSSS!!!
Supernatural puts out a new workout every day. Each with a specific difficulty level — from relaxed, chill,
low intensity
sessions to heart-pumping workouts with complex choreography. In terms of music, it’s also got the best soundtracks compared to other rhythm games I tried.
Sooo what are the downsides? My biggest complaint about Supernatural is its lack of on-screen stats during workouts. You can view your accuracy, power, etc., after each song, but there’s no way to track how you’re doing during your workout. IMO, adding mid-workout stats would give it a more competitive feel similar to Peloton’s class model. Right now, even if you miss every orb or stop moving altogether, you breeze right on by to the next song in the session. It hasn’t stopped me from killing it, though. 🔥

Best HIIT VR fitness game
FitXR
Share on Pinterest
Price:
$9.99/month, 7-day free trial
FitXR is the second game to become a regular part of my
cross-training routine
. It has dance,
boxing
, and
HIIT
workouts. Naturally, I avoid the dancing mode because… well… I tried it once, and it did not go well. I’m regularly hitting up the boxing and
HIIT
modes, though. A new workout releases every day, and there’s a huge library of workouts to choose from.
Newsflash:
punching virtual reality targets is the ultimate
stress-reliever
. 🥊 Hello? Am I an MMA fighter now?
The game tracks your speed and power in real-time, which is a great motivator to hit harder and faster. The boxing workout is pretty straightforward — just hit the targets and rack up points. No coordination required. PHEW!
HIIT is a new mode introduced just in the last couple of months. You move through rounds of
high intensity movements
like ladder drills,
sumo squats
, and side punches to get your heart pounding. The workouts can feel a bit same-same, but they’re still enjoyable. And way more fun than doing HIIT without VR!
What needs improvement? The music could be better — but to each their own, amirite? The coach narration isn’t bad, but the words of encouragement could def be more varied. It’s also a bummer that FitXR coaches aren’t actually doing the workout as they record the narration — which isn’t the case with Supernatural.

Best nonfitness VR game that’s still a workout
BeatSaber
Share on Pinterest
Price:
$29.99, additional music packs vary in price
This isn’t technically a fitness game, but you can make it one with the right mindset. When I don’t feel like cross-training, but I still want to move, I play Beatsaber.
What is it? Lightsabers. That’s basically all you need to know.
The rhythm game is similar in execution to Supernatural (though it doesn’t emphasize fitness) with freaking
lightsabers
instead of bats. Gameplay involves slicing through colored blocks to the beat of the music. There’s also some haptic feedback in the hand controllers when you slice them through the air. It sounds easy, but getting a perfect score takes some practice and requires you to work up a sweat.
Unfortunately, the music library is kinda light. If you want more tracks, you have to pay for each pack. Yes, I absolutely shelled out for the BTS music pack. Playing to the beat of Dynamite provides a nice hit of
dopamine
.
TBH, though, the snazzy visuals and fun gameplay make the game worthwhile regardless of the limited music options.

Best meditation VR fitness game
TRIPP
Share on Pinterest
Price:
$14.99/year or $4.99/month, demo session is free
This isn’t a fitness game, but it’s one I think deserves a mention. The super soothing
meditation app

Other great games you should try
While these games haven’t made it into my regular rotation, I can absolutely see their appeal. These are my honorable mentions.
Best VR fitness game for indoor bikes
VZfit

Price:
$9.99/month with a 7-day free trial
I already have a
NordicTrack indoor bike
, so this app was a hat on a hat for me. But for those who work out on a
bike trainer
or no-frills indoor bike, VZfit instantly upgrades your ride. Using Google maps, the app allows you to ride pretty much anywhere. You’ll just need to add a cadence sensor to your bike for full functionality. You can also use the app without a bike, but I found that mode tedious and kinda dull.

Best climbing VR fitness game
The Climb and The Climb 2
Share on Pinterest
Price:
$29.99
Since you’re not actually climbing a mountain, this is less of a physical workout and more of a mental one. It’s really well made and a cool intro to the sport. If you’re too scared to head to your local
climbing gym
, give this game a shot.
Word of caution:
Make sure you’re prepared for a fall in the game. You

Things you should know before trying VR fitness
VR is hella fun, but there are a few things you should know before you invest in a unit:
Motion sickness.
VR is sick, but it can also make you feel ill. Some people are more likely to experience motion sickness — and some games are worse culprits than others. If you’re prone to a little
nausea
, then you’ll be delighted that the games I tested gave me zero trouble in this department.
Headaches.
Staring at any screen can cause
eye strain
and subsequent
headaches
. A too-tight head strap can also trigger head pain.
Space is required.
This is especially true for fitness games. You need room to wave your arms around, baby! While some games allow you to play in a seated position, having lots of space allows you to get the most of a workout.
Pro tip:
Don’t just check for floor-level obstacles. Look above, too. I almost smashed a light fixture two days ago while trying to finish a session with intensity. Oops.
You get what you put in.
Most fitness games allow you to adjust the level of difficulty. Ultimately, though, the intensity of your sweat session is up to you.
Multiplayer.
Many VR games (but def not all of them) have multiplayer options where you can play with friends. I didn’t test these modes extensively because I have very few friends with VR sets. And, for online play with strangers, the waiting between sessions slows down your
HR
.
Pricing.
Many fitness apps these days run on a subscription model. You’ll need to ask yourself whether a recurring fee is worth it. But TBH, compared to the price of a traditional membership, these games are a steal.
🤪🤪🤪🤪🤪
.
Yes. You’ll look like a total fool playing any kind of VR game. But I promise you will FEEL badass. I recommend asking your friends and family to sign a contract guaranteeing they won’t film you playing VR.
Shop Oculus Quest
Share on Pinterest
f you feel like you’re constantly on the hunt for a fun, challenging workout, VR fitness might be the move. Not only is a VR fitness headset cheaper (and more versatile) than buying a single standalone piece of
workout equipment
, but it’s also a way to leave your house without ever leaving your house.
The first step to enjoying these games is getting your headset. It’s certainly an investment, but if you’ve been looking for a reason to get into the world of VR, getting fit AF is a pretty good reason to finally hit “add to cart.”

Considerations before buying
Shop VR headsets
Over the last couple of months, tons of peeps have been hitting up their old
fave fitness studios
and
gyms
to get their sweat on. But as the
Delta variant
continues to spread in the U.S., some people might be thinking about dusting off their
home workout gear
and WOFH.
But let’s be real here: the sound of going back to the same
stationary bike
workouts and
burpee routines
doesn’t sound fun at all. So WTF do we do if we’re trying to avoid exercising in public but don’t want to lose the motivation we just FINALLY got back?
Enter: Virtual reality fitness. VR fitness is a ~new age~ way to get fit at home. It’s similar to the experience you get taking a
Peloton
or
iFit
class, but goes a step further by immersing you in a whole other world. And while some games are a little more “traditional” — with trainers and coaches guiding a certain type of workout — others don’t feel like a typical fitness class at all.
I tried a bunch of these VR fitness games and it was a total game changer (pun intended). Here are the games that ended up being my fitness faves.

How we chose the best VR fitness games
There are lots of VR fitness options out there, but all the games you’ll see below are specifically for the
Oculus Quest 2
headset — because that’s what I had available to test. BUT the Oculus Question 2 is also pretty rad. The standalone unit is wire-free and legit made me gasp out loud the first time I used it. (Seriously, I now understand the appeal of a Ready Player One-style life.)
Outside of being for Oculus Question 2, here are some other things I considered when picking the best games:
Actually makes you sweat.
First things first. This game absolutely needs to give you a
real workout
. If it doesn’t, then you might as well be sitting at your computer playing The Sims. Some of the games on this list aren’t even marketed as fitness games, but they still made the list because they require some serious sweat-inducing movement to play.
User friendly.
That means it’s easy to get the hang of the game with some practice and no major bugs that get in the way of gameplay.
No motion sickness.
I didn’t include any games that gave me motion sickness. Because working out shouldn’t make you vom.
Fun.
An obvi one, but if you’re going to be dropping some dough on a VR headset and potentially a monthly membership for a fitness game, it should def be an entertaining way to get your workout on.
The VR fitness games I’m playing on repeat
Best overall VR fitness game
Supernatural
Share on Pinterest
Price:
$18.99/month or $179.99/year, 30-day free trial available
This rhythm-based game is hard to explain to anyone who hasn’t tried VR because it’s so different from anything IRL. If I told you to try a game where you stand on a platform in the middle of beautiful landscapes around the world while you try to smash orbs,
squat
, and
lunge
inside triangles on beat to
awesome music
(Oh, and also, you hit the orbs with big glowing bats??), you’d probably look at me funny.
It sounds weird AF, but it’s also oddly addictive. The magic of Supernatural is the combination of catchy tunes and A+ coaches who guide you through each workout. Unlike other fitness platform narrators, Supernatural’s fab coaches have never uttered a single word about shredding,
toning
, or blasting calories. So far, what I’ve experienced is a diet culture-free zone. YASSSS!!!
Supernatural puts out a new workout every day. Each with a specific difficulty level — from relaxed, chill,
low intensity
sessions to heart-pumping workouts with complex choreography. In terms of music, it’s also got the best soundtracks compared to other rhythm games I tried.
Sooo what are the downsides? My biggest complaint about Supernatural is its lack of on-screen stats during workouts. You can view your accuracy, power, etc., after each song, but there’s no way to track how you’re doing during your workout. IMO, adding mid-workout stats would give it a more competitive feel similar to Peloton’s class model. Right now, even if you miss every orb or stop moving altogether, you breeze right on by to the next song in the session. It hasn’t stopped me from killing it, though. 🔥

Best HIIT VR fitness game
FitXR
Share on Pinterest
Price:
$9.99/month, 7-day free trial
FitXR is the second game to become a regular part of my
cross-training routine
. It has dance,
boxing
, and
HIIT
workouts. Naturally, I avoid the dancing mode because… well… I tried it once, and it did not go well. I’m regularly hitting up the boxing and
HIIT
modes, though. A new workout releases every day, and there’s a huge library of workouts to choose from.
Newsflash:
punching virtual reality targets is the ultimate
stress-reliever
. 🥊 Hello? Am I an MMA fighter now?
The game tracks your speed and power in real-time, which is a great motivator to hit harder and faster. The boxing workout is pretty straightforward — just hit the targets and rack up points. No coordination required. PHEW!
HIIT is a new mode introduced just in the last couple of months. You move through rounds of
high intensity movements
like ladder drills,
sumo squats
, and side punches to get your heart pounding. The workouts can feel a bit same-same, but they’re still enjoyable. And way more fun than doing HIIT without VR!
What needs improvement? The music could be better — but to each their own, amirite? The coach narration isn’t bad, but the words of encouragement could def be more varied. It’s also a bummer that FitXR coaches aren’t actually doing the workout as they record the narration — which isn’t the case with Supernatural.

Best nonfitness VR game that’s still a workout
BeatSaber
Share on Pinterest
Price:
$29.99, additional music packs vary in price
This isn’t technically a fitness game, but you can make it one with the right mindset. When I don’t feel like cross-training, but I still want to move, I play Beatsaber.
What is it? Lightsabers. That’s basically all you need to know.
The rhythm game is similar in execution to Supernatural (though it doesn’t emphasize fitness) with freaking
lightsabers
instead of bats. Gameplay involves slicing through colored blocks to the beat of the music. There’s also some haptic feedback in the hand controllers when you slice them through the air. It sounds easy, but getting a perfect score takes some practice and requires you to work up a sweat.
Unfortunately, the music library is kinda light. If you want more tracks, you have to pay for each pack. Yes, I absolutely shelled out for the BTS music pack. Playing to the beat of Dynamite provides a nice hit of
dopamine
.
TBH, though, the snazzy visuals and fun gameplay make the game worthwhile regardless of the limited music options.

Best meditation VR fitness game
TRIPP
Share on Pinterest
Price:
$14.99/year or $4.99/month, demo session is free
This isn’t a fitness game, but it’s one I think deserves a mention. The super soothing
meditation app
is great for clearing your mind and bringing down your heart rate after an intense workout session.
I hate
meditation
. Sure, I love
yoga
, but anytime I’m asked to close my eyes and chill, I simply cannot. TRIPP utilizes the VR environment to get your undivided attention with out-of-this-world visuals and cleverly designed
breathing exercises

The app provides personalized meditation experiences and also has a companion app for tracking your mood. If you don’t like

It’s also a bummer that FitXR coaches aren’t actually doing the workout as they record the narration — which isn’t the case with Supernatural.

Best nonfitness VR game that’s still a workout
BeatSaber
Share on Pinterest
Price:
$29.99, additional music packs vary in price
This isn’t technically a fitness game, but you can make it one with the right mindset. When I don’t feel like cross-training, but I still want to move, I play Beatsaber.
What is it? Lightsabers. That’s basically all you need to know.
The rhythm game is similar in execution to Supernatural (though it doesn’t emphasize fitness) with freaking
lightsabers
instead of bats. Gameplay involves slicing through colored blocks to the beat of the music. There’s also some haptic feedback in the hand controllers when you slice them through the air. It sounds easy, but getting a perfect score takes some practice and requires you to work up a sweat.
Unfortunately, the music library is kinda light. If you want more tracks, you have to pay for each pack. Yes, I absolutely shelled out for the BTS music pack. Playing to the beat of Dynamite provides a nice hit of
dopamine
.
TBH, though, the snazzy visuals and fun gameplay make the game worthwhile regardless of the limited music options.

Best meditation VR fitness game
TRIPP
Share on Pinterest
Price:
$14.99/year or $4.99/month, demo session is free
This isn’t a fitness game, but it’s one I think deserves a mention. The super soothing
meditation app
is great for clearing your mind and bringing down your heart rate after an intense workout session.
I hate
meditation
. Sure, I love
yoga
, but anytime I’m asked to close my eyes and chill, I simply cannot. TRIPP utilizes the VR environment to get your undivided attention with out-of-this-world visuals and cleverly designed
breathing exercises
.
The app provides personalized meditation experiences and also has a companion app for tracking your mood. If you don’t like
meditation
(or even if you do), this is an A+ way to get out of your mind and into another world.

Other great games you should try
While these games haven’t made it into my regular rotation, I can absolutely see their appeal. These are my honorable mentions.
Best VR fitness game for indoor bikes
VZfit
Share on Pinterest
Price:
$9.99/month with a 7-day free trial
I already have a
NordicTrack indoor bike
, so this app was a hat on a hat for me. But for those who work out on a
bike trainer
or no-frills indoor bike, VZfit instantly upgrades your ride. Using Google maps, the app allows you to ride pretty much anywhere. You’ll just need to add a cadence sensor to your bike for full functionality. You can also use the app without a bike, but I found that mode tedious and kinda dull.

Best climbing VR fitness game
The Climb and The Climb 2
Share on Pinterest
Price:
$29.99
Since you’re not actually climbing a mountain, this is less of a physical workout and more of a mental one. It’s really well made and a cool intro to the sport. If you’re too scared to head to your local
climbing gym
, give this game a shot.
Word of caution:
Make sure you’re prepared for a fall in the game. You
will
feel like you’re falling to your death.

Things you should know before trying VR fitness
VR is hella fun, but there are a few things you should know before you invest in a unit:
Motion sickness.
VR is sick, but it can also make you feel ill. Some people are more likely to experience motion sickness — and some games are worse culprits than others. If you’re prone to a little
nausea
, then you’ll be delighted that the games I tested gave me zero trouble in this department.
Headaches.
Staring at any screen can cause
eye strain
and subsequent
headaches
. A too-tight head strap can also trigger head pain.
Space is required.
This is especially true for fitness games. You need room to wave your arms around, baby! While some games allow you to play in a seated position, having lots of space allows you to get the most of a workout.
Pro tip:
Don’t just check for floor-level obstacles. Look above, too. I almost smashed a light fixture two days ago while trying to finish a session with intensity. Oops.
You get what you put in.
Most fitness games allow you to adjust the level of difficulty. Ultimately, though, the intensity of your sweat session is up to you.
Multiplayer.
Many VR games (but def not all of them) have multiplayer options where you can play with friends. I didn’t test these modes extensively because I have very few friends with VR sets. And, for online play with strangers, the waiting between sessions slows down your
HR
.
Pricing.
Many fitness apps these days run on a subscription model. You’ll need to ask yourself whether a recurring fee is worth it. But TBH, compared to the price of a traditional membership, these games are a steal.
🤪🤪🤪🤪🤪
.
Yes. You’ll look like a total fool playing any kind of VR game. But I promise you will FEEL badass. I recommend asking your friends and family to sign a contract guaranteeing they won’t film you playing VR.
Shop Oculus Quest
Share on Pinterest
f you feel like you’re constantly on the hunt for a fun, challenging workout, VR fitness might be the move. Not only is a VR fitness headset cheaper (and more versatile) than buying a single standalone piece of
workout equipment
, but it’s also a way to leave your house without ever leaving your house.
The first step to enjoying these games is getting your headset. It’s certainly an investment, but if you’ve been looking for a reason to get into the world of VR, getting fit AF is a pretty good reason to finally hit “add to cart.”

Bottom line
Kickstart your day with a quick morning workout that may boost fat burn by 20% and enhance brain function. Discover a routine that fits your schedule and might make you a morning person. Get ready to rise and shine.
When it comes to exercising in the a.m., it’s way easier to be a wimp than a warrior — which is bad news, considering how much an early sweat session may benefit your body, not to mention your to-do list.
The benefits of a morning workout routine
Not only are morning workouts
easier to stick to
(hey, impromptu happy hours don’t happen before the sun comes up), but science suggests that working out early, before you’ve had breakfast, may help your body burn more fat — 20 percent more, in fact.
Gonzalez JT, et al. (2013). Breakfast and exercise contingently affect postprandial metabolism and energy balance in physically active males. DOI:
10.1017/S0007114512005582
Your brain benefits, too. A 2019 study on older adults found that squeezing in moderate exercise in the morning improves decision-making skills and memory during the rest of the day.
Wheeler MJ, et al. (2019). Distinct effects of acute exercise and breaks in sitting on working memory and executive function in older adults: A three-arm, randomised cross-over trial to evaluate the effects of exercise with and without breaks in sitting on cognition. DOI:
10.1136/bjsports-2018-100168
That said, actually getting yourself to the gym, or even out of the house, at the crack of dawn can feel like struggle city.
It’s no wonder, really, since your body’s still in snooze mode at that hour, particularly if it’s not acclimated to doing something right away, says personal trainer Stacy Berman, founder of
Stacy’s Bootcamp
in NYC.
But that doesn’t mean you have to give up on all your
#RiseAndGrind
aspirations — just opt for a calmer kind of morning workout to start with.
How to do this morning workout routine
To get into the habit of a morning workout, start with gentle movements that yield big results. Go for moves that strengthen and stretch your entire body while getting your blood pumping but that are a bit less intense, Berman suggests.
For your entry into the
morning-person club
, consider the workout below, created and demonstrated by personal trainer
Tamara Pridgett
.
Complete 3 rounds of the following circuit. Perform 10–12 reps of each move in the first set, 12–15 reps in the second set, and 15–20 reps in the third set.
By the end, you’ll feel
stretched
, energized, and ready to take on the day — though you should probably change out of your PJs first.
1. Hollow body hold
Share on Pinterest
Lie faceup with arms by your sides and legs extended straight. Engage
your abs
. Lift shoulder blades and legs off the floor, keeping lower back pressed into mat throughout the exercise.
Pro tip:
The closer your legs are to the floor, the more challenging this is.
2. Single-leg glute bridge
Share on Pinterest
Lie faceup with knees bent and feet shoulder-width apart. Extend left leg straight out, then press into right heel to lift hips straight up off mat.
Keep knees in line and
engage glutes
as you lift. Lower down slowly, creating your own resistance, then repeat on the other side.
3. Reverse oblique crunch
Share on Pinterest
Start sitting on mat, legs extended in front of you, hands on mat behind you. Lean back slightly onto fingertips for balance and lift legs 2 inches off floor.
Keeping core tight, shift weight onto right hip and twist at the waist to bring bent knees toward chest. Extend back out (don’t drop your legs to mat).
You should feel this in your
side abs
. Twist to the other side and repeat. Continue alternating.
4. Plank with knee tap
Share on Pinterest
Start in high
plank position
, hands directly under shoulders, shoulders in line with hips. Engage core to keep torso still.
Without shifting weight, draw right knee to chest and lift left hand to tap right knee, then draw left knee to chest and lift right hand to tap left knee. Continue alternating as fast as possible without losing your form.
5. Double leg lift
Share on Pinterest
Lie faceup on mat, legs extended up toward ceiling so your body forms a 90-degree angle. Bring arms down by your sides, keep core engaged, and press low back into the mat.
Slowly lower legs as close as possible to mat (the lower you go, the harder it is). Don’t let lower back pop up off mat. Slowly lift legs back to the starting position and repeat.
6. Squat
Share on Pinterest
Stand with feet just wider than hip width. Keep hips stacked over knees, knees over ankles. Hinge at hips, then send hips back and bend knees to lower your body into
a perfect squat
.
Keep your chest lifted and lower at least until your legs are at 90 degrees. Lift arms in front of you for balance if needed. Rise and repeat.
7. Lateral lunge with knee drive
Share on Pinterest
Start with feet together, arms at your sides. Take a big step to the left with left foot, send hips back, and bend left knee (keeping right leg straight) as you bring palms together in front of your chest.
Keep chest lifted and abs engaged. Press into left foot to reverse momentum and shift weight onto right leg as you draw left knee to chest. Return to
lunge position
and repeat. Then switch sides.
8. Inchworm push-up
Share on Pinterest
Stand with feet shoulder-width apart. Hinge at hips to bend over and touch the floor with your hands, then walk hands out to high plank position.
Keeping elbows close to sides, bend elbows and lower your chest to the floor.
Push back up
, then walk hands back toward feet. Repeat.
The bottom line
Mornings are rough
— we get it. And a morning workout doesn’t sound nearly as wonderful as hitting the snooze button for the fourth time, cuddling with bae, or scrolling through
the ’gram
. Anything to stay in bed just a little longer, right?
But the bottom line is this: After the first few exercises in this morning workout routine, that burst of
feel-good chemicals
might just be on par with your piping hot cup of joe. Stick with it and you’ll be hopping out of bed for your
fitness fix
in no time.

Bottom line
Kickstart your day with a quick morning workout that may boost fat burn by 20% and enhance brain function. Discover a routine that fits your schedule and might make you a morning person. Get ready to rise and shine.
When it comes to exercising in the a.m., it’s way easier to be a wimp than a warrior — which is bad news, considering how much an early sweat session may benefit your body, not to mention your to-do list.
The benefits of a morning workout routine
Not only are morning workouts
easier to stick to
(hey, impromptu happy hours don’t happen before the sun comes up), but science suggests that working out early, before you’ve had breakfast, may help your body burn more fat — 20 percent more, in fact.
Gonzalez JT, et al. (2013). Breakfast and exercise contingently affect postprandial metabolism and energy balance in physically active males. DOI:
10.1017/S0007114512005582
Your brain benefits, too. A 2019 study on older adults found that squeezing in moderate exercise in the morning improves decision-making skills and memory during the rest of the day.
Wheeler MJ, et al. (2019). Distinct effects of acute exercise and breaks in sitting on working memory and executive function in older adults: A three-arm, randomised cross-over trial to evaluate the effects of exercise with and without breaks in sitting on cognition. DOI:
10.1136/bjsports-2018-100168
That said, actually getting yourself to the gym, or even out of the house, at the crack of dawn can feel like struggle city.
It’s no wonder, really, since your body’s still in snooze mode at that hour, particularly if it’s not acclimated to doing something right away, says personal trainer Stacy Berman, founder of
Stacy’s Bootcamp
in NYC.
But that doesn’t mean you have to give up on all your
#RiseAndGrind
aspirations — just opt for a calmer kind of morning workout to start with.
How to do this morning workout routine
To get into the habit of a morning workout, start with gentle movements that yield big results. Go for moves that strengthen and stretch your entire body while getting your blood pumping but that are a bit less intense, Berman suggests.
For your entry into the
morning-person club
, consider the workout below, created and demonstrated by personal trainer
Tamara Pridgett
.
Complete 3 rounds of the following circuit. Perform 10–12 reps of each move in the first set, 12–15 reps in the second set, and 15–20 reps in the third set.
By the end, you’ll feel
stretched
, energized, and ready to take on the day — though you should probably change out of your PJs first.
1. Hollow body hold
Share on Pinterest
Lie faceup with arms by your sides and legs extended straight. Engage
your abs
. Lift shoulder blades and legs off the floor, keeping lower back pressed into mat throughout the exercise.
Pro tip:
The closer your legs are to the floor, the more challenging this is.
2. Single-leg glute bridge
Share on Pinterest
Lie faceup with knees bent and feet shoulder-width apart. Extend left leg straight out, then press into right heel to lift hips straight up off mat.
Keep knees in line and
engage glutes
as you lift. Lower down slowly, creating your own resistance, then repeat on the other side.
3. Reverse oblique crunch
Share on Pinterest
Start sitting on mat, legs extended in front of you, hands on mat behind you. Lean back slightly onto fingertips for balance and lift legs 2 inches off floor.
Keeping core tight, shift weight onto right hip and twist at the waist to bring bent knees toward chest. Extend back out (don’t drop your legs to mat).
You should feel this in your
side abs
. Twist to the other side and repeat. Continue alternating.
4. Plank with knee tap
Share on Pinterest
Start in high
plank position
, hands directly under shoulders, shoulders in line with hips. Engage core to keep torso still.
Without shifting weight, draw right knee to chest and lift left hand to tap right knee, then draw left knee to chest and lift right hand to tap left knee. Continue alternating as fast as possible without losing your form.
5. Double leg lift
Share on Pinterest
Lie faceup on mat, legs extended up toward ceiling so your body forms a 90-degree angle. Bring arms down by your sides, keep core engaged, and press low back into the mat.
Slowly lower legs as close as possible to mat (the lower you go, the harder it is). Don’t let lower back pop up off mat. Slowly lift legs back to the starting position and repeat.
6. Squat
Share on Pinterest
Stand with feet just wider than hip width. Keep hips stacked over knees, knees over ankles. Hinge at hips, then send hips back and bend knees to lower your body into
a perfect squat
.
Keep your chest lifted and lower at least until your legs are at 90 degrees. Lift arms in front of you for balance if needed. Rise and repeat.
7. Lateral lunge with knee drive
Share on Pinterest
Start with feet together, arms at your sides. Take a big step to the left with left foot, send hips back, and bend left knee (keeping right leg straight) as you bring palms together in front of your chest.
Keep chest lifted and abs engaged. Press into left foot to reverse momentum and shift weight onto right leg as you draw left knee to chest. Return to
lunge position
and repeat. Then switch sides.
8. Inchworm push-up
Share on Pinterest
Stand with feet shoulder-width apart. Hinge at hips to bend over and touch the floor with your hands, then walk hands out to high plank position.
Keeping elbows close to sides, bend elbows and lower your chest to the floor.
Push back up
, then walk hands back toward feet. Repeat.
The bottom line
Mornings are rough
— we get it. And a morning workout doesn’t sound nearly as wonderful as hitting the snooze button for the fourth time, cuddling with bae, or scrolling through
the ’gram
. Anything to stay in bed just a little longer, right?
But the bottom line is this: After the first few exercises in this morning workout routine, that burst of
feel-good chemicals
might just be on par with your piping hot cup of joe. Stick with it and you’ll be hopping out of bed for your
fitness fix
in no time.

10 Toning Exercises You Might Try for Big Gains with Low Effort
Medically reviewed by

Updated on October 25, 2024
Discover effective toning exercises that may transform your body with minimal effort. From planks to leg lifts, these moves might help you achieve defined muscles and sporty curves at home. Consistency is key to seeing results.
Exercise plays a big role in our overall health, but let’s be real: Looking good can be a big motivator too. Going from a softer look to firm, defined muscles and sporty curves doesn’t happen overnight, though. Choosing the right exercises goes a long way toward hitting an effective effort-to-gains ratio for your goals.
Do gains always require big effort?
Getting toned doesn’t require huge effort — it requires consistency. You can dedicate time at home before you start your day, at night while you’re watching your favorite shows, or in between, during your lunch break or when taking trips to the bathroom.
You can see bigger gains, faster and with less effort, by isolating muscle groups like your glutes, biceps, and quads. Plus, you can add the benefits of greater strength, stamina, and balance through yoga exercises to help you feel good along the way.
Here are some low effort, big gains toning exercises you can do at home.
Exercises to tone arms
Since these are lower-intensity exercises, doing a larger number of reps more consistently is probably where you want to live. Consistency is better than burning yourself out (the tortoise did win the race, after all).
1. Plank or push-up
Share on Pinterest
Ideally, you’d choose to do full push-ups, which can help you develop killer toned arms no matter what size you are. But if you don’t like push-ups, you can opt for the slightly gentler plank.
To do a plank, you hold the high “push-up” position with your arms extended, without lowering yourself down. You can also rest on your elbows while keeping your legs engaged and toes on the floor.
While there are plenty of variations of both the push-up and the plank, don’t overthink it. Choose a version you can do consistently while using your body weight to reach your toning goals.
2. Side plank
Share on Pinterest
Image by Dima Bazak
This is one of those plank variations we mentioned above. It’s great for toning arms because it works the biceps, triceps, and shoulder muscles.
Get into the plank position, but instead of placing both palms on the floor, rotate your body to one side so your weight is supported on one arm. Keep both legs extended while using your bottom leg as an anchor.
You can rest your top leg either on top of your anchor leg or on the floor slightly behind your anchor leg. Use your arm (on the same side as your bottom leg) to lift your upper body straight up and support your body weight off the floor.
It’s totally normal for your supporting arm to start to wobble after a few seconds during your first attempts at this move. That should go away as you develop strength and tone.
For a more advanced option, you can do a rock star variation by lifting your top leg into the air.
3. Inverted table
Share on Pinterest
Sit on the floor with bent knees facing the ceiling. Think of the Twister game mat with colored dots and imagine keeping your hands and feet on different dots. Lift your butt off the floor. Without it touching the mat again, move your body up and down and feel your back arm muscles (triceps) engage almost effortlessly.
If you’re a little concerned about stress to your back or joints while doing this move, try placing a foam roller under your ankles and keeping your legs straight.
4. Triceps dip
Share on Pinterest
This toning exercise is similar to the inverted table, but you can adjust the height to your liking.
Grab something sturdy like a chair or an ottoman (or use a table or bed, depending on where you are).
With your support base behind you (but not under you), rest your hands on it, with palms down and fingers facing toward you. Use your triceps to raise and lower your body.
Use different base heights (steps, benches, etc.) for varying degrees of triceps toning. Your arms will be in a nice form in no time!
5. Triceps extension
Share on Pinterest
You can do these either standing or seated. Holding a dumbbell or another heavy object with both hands, lift your arms above your head, bend them at the elbows to lower the weight behind your head, and then press it back up.
You can use a dumbbell, but it’s not necessary for toning. Start with water bottles, cans from the pantry, resistance bands, or other slightly heavy objects around the house that you can hold with no problem.
Exercises to tone upper legs and butt
Just like your arms, your legs need some toning love. Here are some low intensity but highly effective moves.
6. Wall squat
Share on Pinterest
Image by Dima Bazak
Stand with your back against a smooth wall. As if you’re sitting in a chair, bend your knees and lower yourself into a seated position. Then press yourself back up, keeping your back as straight as you can.
Your arms can be at your sides, extended in front of you, or above your head.
7. Bicycle kick
Lying on your back, lift your legs and alternate them in a pedaling motion. You can cross your arms in front of you, put your hands on either side of your head, or keep your arms at your sides.
You can do this move while watching TV or in between popcorn or light snack breaks, and you’ll see a difference in your core.
You can also ride your invisible toning bike while on the couch or on a park bench. We don’t recommend doing it while driving, though.
8. Bridge
Share on Pinterest
Lie flat on your back with knees bent up and arms relaxed at your sides. Lift your bottom off the floor, bed, or mat you’re on.
Slowly move your hips up and down, pressing into your heels and squeezing your glutes at the top of the move.
9. Push-kick or donkey kick
Share on Pinterest
Image by Dima Bazak
You can do this move standing with the support of a chair or on all fours. Kick one of your bent legs back, like you’re pushing something behind you. Then do the same with the other leg.
Again, do this as many times as you like. Doing it consistently will help your glutes get toned.
10. Side-lying leg lift
Share on Pinterest
Image by Dima Bazak
On the floor, mat, bed, or couch, lie on your side and lift and lower your top leg. You can work your way up to doing 100 of these on each side while checking your phone.
You’ll feel the power of this firming and shaping exercise in the middle and top of your glutes — and maybe also in your face when you’re smiling at your progress.

10 Toning Exercises You Might Try for Big Gains with Low Effort

Updated on October 25, 2024
Discover effective toning exercises that may transform your body with minimal effort. From planks to leg lifts, these moves might help you achieve defined muscles and sporty curves at home. Consistency is key to seeing results.
Exercise plays a big role in our overall health, but let’s be real: Looking good can be a big motivator too. Going from a softer look to firm, defined muscles and sporty curves doesn’t happen overnight, though. Choosing the right exercises goes a long way toward hitting an effective effort-to-gains ratio for your goals.
Do gains always require big effort?
Getting toned doesn’t require huge effort — it requires consistency. You can dedicate time at home before you start your day, at night while you’re watching your favorite shows, or in between, during your lunch break or when taking trips to the bathroom.
You can see bigger gains, faster and with less effort, by isolating muscle groups like your glutes, biceps, and quads. Plus, you can add the benefits of greater strength, stamina, and balance through yoga exercises to help you feel good along the way.
Here are some low effort, big gains toning exercises you can do at home.
Exercises to tone arms
Since these are lower-intensity exercises, doing a larger number of reps more consistently is probably where you want to live. Consistency is better than burning yourself out (the tortoise did win the race, after all).
1. Plank or push-up
Share on Pinterest
Ideally, you’d choose to do full push-ups, which can help you develop killer toned arms no matter what size you are. But if you don’t like push-ups, you can opt for the slightly gentler plank.
To do a plank, you hold the high “push-up” position with your arms extended, without lowering yourself down. You can also rest on your elbows while keeping your legs engaged and toes on the floor.
While there are plenty of variations of both the push-up and the plank, don’t overthink it. Choose a version you can do consistently while using your body weight to reach your toning goals.
2. Side plank
Share on Pinterest
Image by Dima Bazak
This is one of those plank variations we mentioned above. It’s great for toning arms because it works the biceps, triceps, and shoulder muscles.
Get into the plank position, but instead of placing both palms on the floor, rotate your body to one side so your weight is supported on one arm. Keep both legs extended while using your bottom leg as an anchor.
You can rest your top leg either on top of your anchor leg or on the floor slightly behind your anchor leg. Use your arm (on the same side as your bottom leg) to lift your upper body straight up and support your body weight off the floor.
It’s totally normal for your supporting arm to start to wobble after a few seconds during your first attempts at this move. That should go away as you develop strength and tone.
For a more advanced option, you can do a rock star variation by lifting your top leg into the air.
3. Inverted table
Share on Pinterest
Sit on the floor with bent knees facing the ceiling. Think of the Twister game mat with colored dots and imagine keeping your hands and feet on different dots. Lift your butt off the floor. Without it touching the mat again, move your body up and down and feel your back arm muscles (triceps) engage almost effortlessly.
If you’re a little concerned about stress to your back or joints while doing this move, try placing a foam roller under your ankles and keeping your legs straight.
4. Triceps dip
Share on Pinterest
This toning exercise is similar to the inverted table, but you can adjust the height to your liking.
Grab something sturdy like a chair or an ottoman (or use a table or bed, depending on where you are).
With your support base behind you (but not under you), rest your hands on it, with palms down and fingers facing toward you. Use your triceps to raise and lower your body.
Use different base heights (steps, benches, etc.) for varying degrees of triceps toning. Your arms will be in a nice form in no time!
5. Triceps extension
Share on Pinterest
You can do these either standing or seated. Holding a dumbbell or another heavy object with both hands, lift your arms above your head, bend them at the elbows to lower the weight behind your head, and then press it back up.
You can use a dumbbell, but it’s not necessary for toning. Start with water bottles, cans from the pantry, resistance bands, or other slightly heavy objects around the house that you can hold with no problem.
Exercises to tone upper legs and butt
Just like your arms, your legs need some toning love. Here are some low intensity but highly effective moves.
6. Wall squat
Share on Pinterest
Image by Dima Bazak
Stand with your back against a smooth wall. As if you’re sitting in a chair, bend your knees and lower yourself into a seated position. Then press yourself back up, keeping your back as straight as you can.
Your arms can be at your sides, extended in front of you, or above your head.
7. Bicycle kick
Lying on your back, lift your legs and alternate them in a pedaling motion. You can cross your arms in front of you, put your hands on either side of your head, or keep your arms at your sides.
You can do this move while watching TV or in between popcorn or light snack breaks, and you’ll see a difference in your core.
You can also ride your invisible toning bike while on the couch or on a park bench. We don’t recommend doing it while driving, though.
8. Bridge
Share on Pinterest
Lie flat on your back with knees bent up and arms relaxed at your sides. Lift your bottom off the floor, bed, or mat you’re on.
Slowly move your hips up and down, pressing into your heels and squeezing your glutes at the top of the move.
9. Push-kick or donkey kick
Share on Pinterest
Image by Dima Bazak
You can do this move standing with the support of a chair or on all fours. Kick one of your bent legs back, like you’re pushing something behind you. Then do the same with the other leg.
Again, do this as many times as you like. Doing it consistently will help your glutes get toned.
10. Side-lying leg lift
Share on Pinterest
Image by Dima Bazak
On the floor, mat, bed, or couch, lie on your side and lift and lower your top leg. You can work your way up to doing 100 of these on each side while checking your phone.
You’ll feel the power of this firming and shaping exercise in the middle and top of your glutes — and maybe also in your face when you’re smiling at your progress.

35 Delicious Paleo Breakfast Ideas That Might Transform Your Mornings
While you’re probably safe from these gym snafus, there’s a solid chance of goofing up when using complicated pieces of equipment. (We’ve all done it.) And the machine trainers see people struggle with the most is the cable crossover or cable pulley machine.
The cable crossover machine: Why it’s so hard
The struggle is real. Why? “It’s a very complex and versatile piece of gym equipment,” says
Chris Finn
, certified personal trainer at
Life Time Athletic at Sky
in NYC.
“There are a lot of stations and a range of handles available to enhance its versatility, but this also causes a lot of confusion,” says Finn.
Plus, the machine makes it easy to isolate individual muscle groups, but that also means it’s easier for users to load on
way too much weight
. “If the weight is too heavy, that compromises your technique,” Finn explains.
And that’s a shame, because the cable crossover machine is the perfect one-stop shop for a
killer total-body workout
. The good news is, we’re here to help.
To clear up the confusion, we worked with Finn to create some guidelines on the proper form for the six most commonly flubbed exercises on the cable crossover machine.
How to choose the right weight
When it comes to choosing the right weight, it depends on your fitness goals, says Finn. Before you get going, take a minute and think about your desired outcome.
If you’re trying to build lean muscle, pick a weight that gets challenging at 15 to 18 reps. If you’re trying to bulk up, a heavier weight should feel difficult at 8 to 12 reps.
The most important rule to remember is that you should never sacrifice technique for weight, since it puts you at risk of injury and actually prevents you from getting stronger, says Finn.
“If you do the technique correctly, the weight will come, and nothing slows your progress more than getting hurt,” he adds.
Now that you have your weights at the ready, let’s go over the most common mistakes (see photos for reference) and how to fix ’em. Follow Finn’s tips below to avoid injury and get fitter faster.
Decline cable fly
Common mistake: Incorrect setup
Share on Pinterest
Rushing through setup (i.e., grabbing the handles, walking forward, and diving right in) may lead to compromised form.
The fix
Share on Pinterest
Grab the handle(s) and take a step backward instead. Pull the weights down to chest like a row, then walk forward. Standing with feet staggered, punch the handle(s) down so wrists are in line with shoulders.
Common mistake: Leaning too far forward
While the name may be confusing, “decline” isn’t referring to the position of your body but rather the angle that you move the weight. Too often, people lean or lunge too far forward during this move.
The fix
To decline the right way, grab the handles and pull the weights. Step into a staggered stance with front leg as an “angle indicator” for the weights, slight bend in elbows, chest lifted.
Squeeze shoulder blades together and open arms out to the sides at about chest level. Keep shoulders packed so arms aren’t flung back behind you.
Using your chest, pull the weights back down to starting position at the same angle as your forward leg. Continue to repeat.
Seated cable row
Common mistake: Poor posture
Share on Pinterest
Rounding your back or hunching your shoulders puts your back at risk of injury. And leaning back is also a no-no. If you’re
feeling your abs
or lower back fire up, it’s a sure sign you need to decrease the weight.
The fix
Begin by sitting at the machine, with feet on the platforms and knees slightly bent. Grab the handle to get into position with arms extended straight in front of you. Sit up tall with core engaged
Make sure spine is straight, shoulders are back, and chest is up. Bend elbows to pull handle toward chest, then focus on squeezing shoulder blades together, almost like you’re holding a piece of paper between them.
Hold for 1 count, then slowly return to starting position while keeping back still. Repeat.
Biceps cable curl
Common mistake: Lack of control
Share on Pinterest
Form is everything — it ensures that you’re targeting the right muscles and helps prevent injuries. So if you find that you can’t extend and flex your arms with control, that’s a big problem.
The fix
As you pull the handle toward chest, don’t let elbows lift up to shoulder height. If your body can’t help it, lighten up on the weight and focus on proper form.
Common mistake: Using momentum
Another sign you’re doing too much heavy lifting is generating momentum from your legs, hips, or torso. If you see (that’s what the mirrors are for) or feel yourself leaning forward or back, take a few pounds off.​
The fix
With the weight lighter, grab the handle with an underhand grip, then start by standing in front of the weights, with feet together for a sturdy base and knees slightly bent. Stand tall (don’t stick your butt out).
Bend elbows to draw the handle up toward chest, then resist the weight as you slowly lower it back down to starting position.
For this exercise, it’s important to keep your elbows tight against your body. One trick Finn recommends is tucking a towel under each elbow as a reminder. If the towels drop, you know you’re doing it wrong.
Triceps cable extension
Common mistake: Bending over
Share on Pinterest
Don’t be this person. Bending over to get leverage over the weight is not the way to do it. Your body should be tall with your core engaged, and you should perform this move slowly with control to really reap all the benefits.
The fix
Grab the ropes and stand in front of the weights, with arms bent to 90 degrees, elbows close to your sides, feet together, and knees slightly bent.
With core engaged and elbows still, extend arms straight down to your sides, then return to starting position and repeat. You can also use the towel trick for this exercise.
Seated cable lat pulldown
Common mistake: Bar behind the neck
Share on Pinterest
This one may seem pretty self-explanatory — you just pull the bar down, right? Well, according to Finn, he sees people messing up this move all the time.
One of the most common errors: pulling the bar down behind the neck. “That’ll cause a lot of shoulder problems and neck issues,” he says.
The fix
Sit facing the weights and grab the bar. With a tall spine and tight core, pull the bar down to chest, leaning back just enough so you can pull it past your face without hitting your chin.
Think about pulling your shoulder blades down, like you’re moving them toward the back pockets of your pants. Return to starting position by resisting the weight slowly up. Repeat.
Standing trunk rotation
Common mistake: Too much movement
Share on Pinterest
When it comes to the trunk rotation, you shouldn’t move anything except, well, your trunk. “You don’t want to bend forward or lean over or generate momentum from anywhere else,” says Finn.
If it feels like the weight is pulling you off-balance or you need to use your whole body to get momentum, drop the weight.
The fix
To perfect this move, focus on keeping your body upright and using just your core to rotate at the waist. Grab the handle with both hands and step to the side of the weights, arms extended straight out in front of chest.
Twist at the waist to pull the weight over to one side. Your lower body shouldn’t move at all. Return to starting position and repeat on the other side.
The bottom line
With all the handles and cables, the cable crossover machine may look like the most confusing piece of equipment at the gym (we feel you), but it doesn’t have to be. The key is this: Slow waaaaayyyy down.
Setting up with the optimal weight will ensure that you can maintain proper form and get the most bang for your buck during the exercise. This usually means having your spine straight and chest lifted, but it will depend on the exercise.
And before you grab the handles and start busting out reps, check your starting position and form. Don’t forget to make sure you’re breathing (passing out won’t help you get super ripped).
During each rep, move with intention and control. If you can’t maintain good posture for the whole set, drop the weight, check out our quick fixes, and start again.
If all else fails,
ask a personal trainer
(or that fellow gym-goer you’ve been casually side-eyeing) what to do. It’s better to feel slightly embarrassed at the time than to be hunched over in pain the next day, right?
We hope these tips will make the cable crossover your new favorite machine. With the right techniques, it can be as fun as it is versatile.

or lower back fire up, it’s a sure sign you need to decrease the weight.
The fix
Begin by sitting at the machine, with feet on the platforms and knees slightly bent. Grab the handle to get into position with arms extended straight in front of you. Sit up tall with core engaged
Make sure spine is straight, shoulders are back, and chest is up. Bend elbows to pull handle toward chest, then focus on squeezing shoulder blades together, almost like you’re holding a piece of paper between them.
Hold for 1 count, then slowly return to starting position while keeping back still. Repeat.
Biceps cable curl
Common mistake: Lack of control
Share on Pinterest
Form is everything — it ensures that you’re targeting the right muscles and helps prevent injuries. So if you find that you can’t extend and flex your arms with control, that’s a big problem.
The fix
As you pull the handle toward chest, don’t let elbows lift up to shoulder height. If your body can’t help it, lighten up on the weight and focus on proper form.
Common mistake: Using momentum
Another sign you’re doing too much heavy lifting is generating momentum from your legs, hips, or torso. If you see (that’s what the mirrors are for) or feel yourself leaning forward or back, take a few pounds off.​
The fix
With the weight lighter, grab the handle with an underhand grip, then start by standing in front of the weights, with feet together for a sturdy base and knees slightly bent. Stand tall (don’t stick your butt out).
Bend elbows to draw the handle up toward chest, then resist the weight as you slowly lower it back down to starting position.
For this exercise, it’s important to keep your elbows tight against your body. One trick Finn recommends is tucking a towel under each elbow as a reminder. If the towels drop, you know you’re doing it wrong.
Triceps cable extension
Common mistake: Bending over
Share on Pinterest
Don’t be this person. Bending over to get leverage over the weight is not the way to do it. Your body should be tall with your core engaged, and you should perform this move slowly with control to really reap all the benefits.
The fix
Grab the ropes and stand in front of the weights, with arms bent to 90 degrees, elbows close to your sides, feet together, and knees slightly bent.
With core engaged and elbows still, extend arms straight down to your sides, then return to starting position and repeat. You can also use the towel trick for this exercise.
Seated cable lat pulldown
Common mistake: Bar behind the neck
Share on Pinterest
This one may seem pretty self-explanatory — you just pull the bar down, right? Well, according to Finn, he sees people messing up this move all the time.
One of the most common errors: pulling the bar down behind the neck. “That’ll cause a lot of shoulder problems and neck issues,” he says.
The fix
Sit facing the weights and grab the bar. With a tall spine and tight core, pull the bar down to chest, leaning back just enough so you can pull it past your face without hitting your chin.
Think about pulling your shoulder blades down, like you’re moving them toward the back pockets of your pants. Return to starting position by resisting the weight slowly up. Repeat.
Standing trunk rotation
Common mistake: Too much movement
Share on Pinterest
When it comes to the trunk rotation, you shouldn’t move anything except, well, your trunk. “You don’t want to bend forward or lean over or generate momentum from anywhere else,” says Finn.
If it feels like the weight is pulling you off-balance or you need to use your whole body to get momentum, drop the weight.
The fix
To perfect this move, focus on keeping your body upright and using just your core to rotate at the waist. Grab the handle with both hands and step to the side of the weights, arms extended straight out in front of chest.
Twist at the waist to pull the weight over to one side. Your lower body shouldn’t move at all. Return to starting position and repeat on the other side.
The bottom line
With all the handles and cables, the cable crossover machine may look like the most confusing piece of equipment at the gym (we feel you), but it doesn’t have to be. The key is this: Slow waaaaayyyy down.
Setting up with the optimal weight will ensure that you can maintain proper form and get the most bang for your buck during the exercise. This usually means having your spine straight and chest lifted, but it will depend on the exercise.
And before you grab the handles and start busting out reps, check your starting position and form. Don’t forget to make sure you’re breathing (passing out won’t help you get super ripped).
During each rep, move with intention and control. If you can’t maintain good posture for the whole set, drop the weight, check out our quick fixes, and start again.
If all else fails,
ask a personal trainer
(or that fellow gym-goer you’ve been casually side-eyeing) what to do. It’s better to feel slightly embarrassed at the time than to be hunched over in pain the next day, right?
We hope these tips will make the cable crossover your new favorite machine. With the right techniques, it can be as fun as it is versatile.

When you picture the number of things that could go horribly wrong at the gym, you might think of flying off a treadmill, dropping a weight on your foot, or getting crushed under a barbell.

35 Delicious Paleo Breakfast Ideas That Might Transform Your Mornings
While you’re probably safe from these gym snafus, there’s a solid chance of goofing up when using complicated pieces of equipment. (We’ve all done it.) And the machine trainers see people struggle with the most is the cable crossover or cable pulley machine.
The cable crossover machine: Why it’s so hard
The struggle is real. Why? “It’s a very complex and versatile piece of gym equipment,” says
Chris Finn
, certified personal trainer at
Life Time Athletic at Sky
in NYC.
“There are a lot of stations and a range of handles available to enhance its versatility, but this also causes a lot of confusion,” says Finn.
Plus, the machine makes it easy to isolate individual muscle groups, but that also means it’s easier for users to load on
way too much weight
. “If the weight is too heavy, that compromises your technique,” Finn explains.
And that’s a shame, because the cable crossover machine is the perfect one-stop shop for a
killer total-body workout
. The good news is, we’re here to help.
To clear up the confusion, we worked with Finn to create some guidelines on the proper form for the six most commonly flubbed exercises on the cable crossover machine.
How to choose the right weight
When it comes to choosing the right weight, it depends on your fitness goals, says Finn. Before you get going, take a minute and think about your desired outcome.
If you’re trying to build lean muscle, pick a weight that gets challenging at 15 to 18 reps. If you’re trying to bulk up, a heavier weight should feel difficult at 8 to 12 reps.
The most important rule to remember is that you should never sacrifice technique for weight, since it puts you at risk of injury and actually prevents you from getting stronger, says Finn.
“If you do the technique correctly, the weight will come, and nothing slows your progress more than getting hurt,” he adds.
Now that you have your weights at the ready, let’s go over the most common mistakes (see photos for reference) and how to fix ’em. Follow Finn’s tips below to avoid injury and get fitter faster.
Decline cable fly
Common mistake: Incorrect setup
Share on Pinterest
Rushing through setup (i.e., grabbing the handles, walking forward, and diving right in) may lead to compromised form.
The fix
Share on Pinterest
Grab the handle(s) and take a step backward instead. Pull the weights down to chest like a row, then walk forward. Standing with feet staggered, punch the handle(s) down so wrists are in line with shoulders.
Common mistake: Leaning too far forward
While the name may be confusing, “decline” isn’t referring to the position of your body but rather the angle that you move the weight. Too often, people lean or lunge too far forward during this move.
The fix
To decline the right way, grab the handles and pull the weights. Step into a staggered stance with front leg as an “angle indicator” for the weights, slight bend in elbows, chest lifted.
Squeeze shoulder blades together and open arms out to the sides at about chest level. Keep shoulders packed so arms aren’t flung back behind you.
Using your chest, pull the weights back down to starting position at the same angle as your forward leg. Continue to repeat.
Seated cable row
Common mistake: Poor posture
Share on Pinterest
Rounding your back or hunching your shoulders puts your back at risk of injury. And leaning back is also a no-no. If you’re
feeling your abs
or lower back fire up, it’s a sure sign you need to decrease the weight.
The fix
Begin by sitting at the machine, with feet on the platforms and knees slightly bent. Grab the handle to get into position with arms extended straight in front of you. Sit up tall with core engaged
Make sure spine is straight, shoulders are back, and chest is up. Bend elbows to pull handle toward chest, then focus on squeezing shoulder blades together, almost like you’re holding a piece of paper between them.
Hold for 1 count, then slowly return to starting position while keeping back still. Repeat.
Biceps cable curl
Common mistake: Lack of control
Share on Pinterest
Form is everything — it ensures that you’re targeting the right muscles and helps prevent injuries. So if you find that you can’t extend and flex your arms with control, that’s a big problem.
The fix
As you pull the handle toward chest, don’t let elbows lift up to shoulder height. If your body can’t help it, lighten up on the weight and focus on proper form.

Think about pulling your shoulder blades down, like you’re moving them toward the back pockets of your pants. Return to starting position by resisting the weight slowly up. Repeat.
Standing trunk rotation
Common mistake: Too much movement
Share on Pinterest
When it comes to the trunk rotation, you shouldn’t move anything except, well, your trunk. “You don’t want to bend forward or lean over or generate momentum from anywhere else,” says Finn.
If it feels like the weight is pulling you off-balance or you need to use your whole body to get momentum, drop the weight.
The fix
To perfect this move, focus on keeping your body upright and using just your core to rotate at the waist. Grab the handle with both hands and step to the side of the weights, arms extended straight out in front of chest.
Twist at the waist to pull the weight over to one side. Your lower body shouldn’t move at all. Return to starting position and repeat on the other side.

We hope these tips will make the cable crossover your new favorite machine. With the right techniques, it can be as fun as it is versatile.

Welcome to the Jungle: The Rise of Animal-Inspired Workout Routines

Animal-inspired movements
Many animal-inspired movements and workout routines are based on different forms of crawling.
“The majority involve getting down on the ground on your hands and feet, and moving in that position,” says physical therapist Grayson Wickham, DPT, CSCS, founder of
Movement Vault
, a digital movement education platform that incorporates animal-inspired movements into their routine.
Yep
, kinda like a baby, kinda like an animal. (This is known as
Quadrupedal Movement
).
Common animal-inspired movements include:
Inchworm
Bear Crawl
Backwards Crab Walk
Crab Reach
Flying Squirrel
“Animals, obviously, are part of the inspiration. But these movements are also inspired by
bodyweight disciplines
such as gymnastics,
Parkour
, breakdancing and
hand balancing
,” says innovative fitness educator and movement coach, Mike Fitch, creator of
Animal Flow
, an animal-inspired workout regime.
These movements can be done à la carte-style and used as tools for
warmups
,
cooldowns
, performance training, or
mobility work
. “Or, they can be linked together into continuous movement sequences known as flows,” says Fitch.
Animals moves aren’t just for kiddos
Having a flashback to crab walking up and down your school’s gymnasium at 8 years old? Don’t let that trick you into thinking animal-inspired movements should be forgone after middle school graduation (lol).
“People of all ages and fitness levels can benefit from crawling,” says Wickham. “Whether you’re 5, 15, 25, 55, 85, whether you’re a pro athlete or you’ve never worked out in your life, you can benefit from doing animal inspired movements.”
So… why are animal-esque workouts on the rise now?
Because they are an antidote to the
sit-all-day lifestyle
that was established pre-pandemic, and further solidified in
quarantine
.
When
physical distancing
orders were put into place, those of us privileged enough to work from home suddenly lost out on a whole lot of
walking
/moving/grooving time.
All that time we spend walking was suddenly *whoosh* gone. For example: walking from the parking lot to the office and from the office back to the parking lot.
And in its place was a whole lot of sitting.
“Our bodies conform to the positions we spend the most time in,” says Wickham. And according to him, when we sit for long
periods of time, our core slumps,
our upper and lower back rounds
, and our neck juts forward.
“When someone is slumped over all day, day after day, this leads to decreased body awareness in and around the
core muscles, loss of core strength,
muscle tightness
, and mobility restrictions,” says Wickham.
And that’s where these animal-inspired movements come in…
When performed correctly, these movements can help counteract some physical woes people have experienced after this year of sitting.
Strength, power, speed, and more
“Almost all animal-inspired movements use the full-body, requiring you to not only hold your own bodyweight, but to control it as it moves through space in different planes of motion,” says Fitch. These programs are “designed to improve all of your physical abilities like strength, power, speed, endurance, coordination and mobility.”
1. Improved mobility
These movements force (nay,
encourage
!) you to work your shoulders, wrists, hips, and ankles through their full range of motion.
“Whether you are a weight lifter, a Cross Fitter, a martial artist, a triathlete, a surfer (or many other things), being able to move all of your [joints] easily and freely in different directions is going to help you in your sport, as well as in injury prevention,” says Fitch.
2. Improved coordination
Animal-inspired movements work on something called reciprocal movement.
Reciprocal movement = movement that involves moving your opposite arm and leg. So, while you move your right arm and hand, you’re also moving your left leg and foot.
Doing reciprocal movement can improve coordination, according to Wickham.
“People often look at these animal-inspired movements and think they look easy,” he says. “But only about 20 percent of people have the coordination to do the movement right off the bat if they’ve never tried it.”
3. Increased core strength
“Crawls are amazing for improving core stability, strength, and activation,” says Wickham.
That’s because when you’re down on the ground, in order to shift side-to-side or up-and-side, your core HAS to engage.
After all, your midsection translates strength to your limbs so that your arms and legs can do their thing.
4. Reduced injury-risk
Animal-inspired exercise programs entail moving through all
planes of motion
: sagittal (forward and backward), frontal (lateral, left and right), and transverse (rotational).
This, says Fitch, “can help people reduce their injury-risk in other sports where they are constantly training in a single-plane of motion, or even overtraining in some areas.” For example:
marathoners
and
CrossFit
athletes.
5. Improved mindfulness
“There is also a
mindfulness
aspect to [moving this way],” says Fitch. It is difficult to be thinking about anything else when practicing animal-inspired flows, so you are forced to focus on where your body is and where you want it to go next,” he says.
How to tap into your inner animal
Honestly,
any
exercise program that touts its ability to improve your mobility (like
Movement Vault
,
RomWod
,
The Ready State
) is probably going to include some animal-inspired movements.
However, if you’re looking for an animal-inspired flow (aka workout
)
— as opposed to a stretch sesh — your best bet is to sign up for a program like
Animal Flow
,
Primal Play
,
Primal Movement
, or whatever cleverly-named program launches next.
“Exactly how long it will take to feel better after incorporating these movements will depend on what kind of pain, injury, weaknesses and mobility issues you might have,” says Wickham. But benefits can come as quick as 1 to 2 weeks, according to Fitch.

sound
like rough and rowdy

workout routines
based on an ideology that’s like returning to the jungle. And they are about to hit it BIG, post-pandemic.

Animal-inspired movements
Many animal-inspired movements and workout routines are based on different forms of crawling.
“The majority involve getting down on the ground on your hands and feet, and moving in that position,” says physical therapist Grayson Wickham, DPT, CSCS, founder of
Movement Vault
, a digital movement education platform that incorporates animal-inspired movements into their routine.
Yep
, kinda like a baby, kinda like an animal. (This is known as
Quadrupedal Movement
).
Common animal-inspired movements include:
Inchworm
Bear Crawl
Backwards Crab Walk
Crab Reach
Flying Squirrel
“Animals, obviously, are part of the inspiration. But these movements are also inspired by
bodyweight disciplines
such as gymnastics,
Parkour
, breakdancing and
hand balancing
,” says innovative fitness educator and movement coach, Mike Fitch, creator of
Animal Flow
, an animal-inspired workout regime.
These movements can be done à la carte-style and used as tools for
warmups
,
cooldowns
, performance training, or
mobility work
. “Or, they can be linked together into continuous movement sequences known as flows,” says Fitch.
Animals moves aren’t just for kiddos
Having a flashback to crab walking up and down your school’s gymnasium at 8 years old? Don’t let that trick you into thinking animal-inspired movements should be forgone after middle school graduation (lol).
“People of all ages and fitness levels can benefit from crawling,” says Wickham. “Whether you’re 5, 15, 25, 55, 85, whether you’re a pro athlete or you’ve never worked out in your life, you can benefit from doing animal inspired movements.”
So… why are animal-esque workouts on the rise now?
Because they are an antidote to the
sit-all-day lifestyle
that was established pre-pandemic, and further solidified in
quarantine
.
When
physical distancing
orders were put into place, those of us privileged enough to work from home suddenly lost out on a whole lot of
walking
/moving/grooving time.
All that time we spend walking was suddenly *whoosh* gone. For example: walking from the parking lot to the office and from the office back to the parking lot.
And in its place was a whole lot of sitting.
“Our bodies conform to the positions we spend the most time in,” says Wickham. And according to him, when we sit for long
periods of time, our core slumps,
our upper and lower back rounds
, and our neck juts forward.
“When someone is slumped over all day, day after day, this leads to decreased body awareness in and around the
core muscles, loss of core strength,
muscle tightness
, and mobility restrictions,” says Wickham.
And that’s where these animal-inspired movements come in…
When performed correctly, these movements can help counteract some physical woes people have experienced after this year of sitting.
Strength, power, speed, and more
“Almost all animal-inspired movements use the full-body, requiring you to not only hold your own bodyweight, but to control it as it moves through space in different planes of motion,” says Fitch. These programs are “designed to improve all of your physical abilities like strength, power, speed, endurance, coordination and mobility.”
1. Improved mobility
These movements force (nay,
encourage
!) you to work your shoulders, wrists, hips, and ankles through their full range of motion.
“Whether you are a weight lifter, a Cross Fitter, a martial artist, a triathlete, a surfer (or many other things), being able to move all of your [joints] easily and freely in different directions is going to help you in your sport, as well as in injury prevention,” says Fitch.
2. Improved coordination
Animal-inspired movements work on something called reciprocal movement.
Reciprocal movement = movement that involves moving your opposite arm and leg. So, while you move your right arm and hand, you’re also moving your left leg and foot.
Doing reciprocal movement can improve coordination, according to Wickham.
“People often look at these animal-inspired movements and think they look easy,” he says. “But only about 20 percent of people have the coordination to do the movement right off the bat if they’ve never tried it.”
3. Increased core strength
“Crawls are amazing for improving core stability, strength, and activation,” says Wickham.
That’s because when you’re down on the ground, in order to shift side-to-side or up-and-side, your core HAS to engage.
After all, your midsection translates strength to your limbs so that your arms and legs can do their thing.
4. Reduced injury-risk
Animal-inspired exercise programs entail moving through all
planes of motion
: sagittal (forward and backward), frontal (lateral, left and right), and transverse (rotational).
This, says Fitch, “can help people reduce their injury-risk in other sports where they are constantly training in a single-plane of motion, or even overtraining in some areas.” For example:
marathoners
and
CrossFit
athletes.
5. Improved mindfulness
“There is also a
mindfulness
aspect to [moving this way],” says Fitch. It is difficult to be thinking about anything else when practicing animal-inspired flows, so you are forced to focus on where your body is and where you want it to go next,” he says.
How to tap into your inner animal
Honestly,
any
exercise program that touts its ability to improve your mobility (like
Movement Vault
,
RomWod
,
The Ready State
) is probably going to include some animal-inspired movements.
However, if you’re looking for an animal-inspired flow (aka workout
)
— as opposed to a stretch sesh — your best bet is to sign up for a program like
Animal Flow
,
Primal Play
,
Primal Movement
, or whatever cleverly-named program launches next.
“Exactly how long it will take to feel better after incorporating these movements will depend on what kind of pain, injury, weaknesses and mobility issues you might have,” says Wickham. But benefits can come as quick as 1 to 2 weeks, according to Fitch.

Bottom line
Explore dead bug exercise benefits for core strength, spine stability, and better posture. This move may prevent lower back pain and boost balance. Ideal for all fitness levels, it could become your favorite workout.
“Dead bug” isn’t just a cute nickname for that friend who always goes too hard at bottomless mimosa brunch. It’s also a core strengthening and stabilizing exercise.
This exercise involves lying flat on your back (like an actual dead bug). You won’t be flailing your extremities around in a creepy critter fashion, but there’s no shame in tossing that into your routine, too, if that’s your thing.
Share on Pinterest
The dead bug exercise uses slow, controlled movements to help you build a strong core. It also helps strengthen your spine and can make everyday movements smooth like butter. (Yes, please!)
Here’s the dead bug breakdown you’ve been waiting for (or didn’t know you needed).
How to dead bug
OK, little dead-bugs-in-training, let’s jump right in!
First, roll out a comfy workout mat or yoga mat. For added support, you can grab a folded towel or a flat pillow and place it under your shoulders. Now you’re ready to do it (and put your back into it).
Share on Pinterest
Image by Dima Bazak
Lie on your back with knees bent and feet flat on the floor, about 1 foot in front of your hips. Let arms rest comfortably at your sides.
Press lower back and shoulders into the floor. Be mindful of your shoulders (keep them down and away from your ears).
Lift your arms. Elbows should be above shoulders, and hands should face in toward each other.
Lift your legs, aligning knees directly over hips.
Let out a nice exhale and slowly lower your right arm and left leg at the same time. Stop just before they reach the floor.
On a good ol’ inhale, bring them back to the starting position. Repeat on the other side.
Boom! That’s 1 rep.
Dead bug exercise progression
When you’re starting out, aim for 1–3 sets of 5–12 reps on each side.
Once you’re a dead bug profesh, you can level up to more sets and move on to more advanced variations. Or, if you prefer, shoot for a
longer routine
of variations that range in difficulty. See what works best for you.
Dead bug form 101
Keep those hips and lower back very still throughout the exercise.
It’s important to keep your back flat on the floor. That means no space between your sexy back arch and the floor.
Make sure your movements are slow and controlled. Speed is not the goal with this exercise.
Engage your core, and keep that thing tight. Don’t sway or rock back and forth.
Keep your ears down and away from your shoulders.
Bug benefits, baby
The dead bug can help stabilize and strengthen your spine, core, and back. It can even prevent lower back pain. You may also notice an improvement in your
balance
, coordination, and posture.
The dead bug can also help:
people with
chronic pain
people with
arthritis
older adults
who want to improve muscle function
swimmers
looking to improve their form
people with
Parkinson’s disease
who want to have an easier time doing everyday activities
people looking to improve their
balance
and posture
Dead bug variations
For beginners (nice and easy)
Keep feet on the floor and slowly slide one foot away from you.
Rest hands on the floor above your head to start with feet planted on the floor. Raise arm and opposite leg per usual.
Instead of lifting arms, push palms into the wall behind you.
Do one arm or one leg at a time.
Decrease your range of motion by keeping arms and legs higher than in a traditional dead bug.
For advanced dead bugs
Add dumbbells, kettlebells, or ankle weights.
Lower both arms and both legs at the same time.
If you’re looking for a BOGO, you can strengthen your pelvic floor by incorporating
Kegel exercises
into your dead bugs.
Still need a challenge? Give these dead bug exercises a try:

Grab a resistance band and wrap it around your lower thighs to keep you stable.
Lie on your back, keeping knees above hips. Using both hands, hold a weighted ball above your shoulders.
Keeping the rest of your body very solid and stable, lower the ball over your head and pause there. Slowly return to the starting position.
Aim for 1–3 sets of 8–12 reps.
Stability ball dead bug
Spinal strength is totally underrated. Adding a stability ball to your dead bug can boost your spinal and core stability.

Hold this pose for a few seconds before returning to the starting position. Repeat on the other side.
Aim for 1–3 sets of 8–12 reps.

Safety
Dead-bugging is totally safe and even fun. Just know your limits and keep your form 💯. Remember to engage your core and practice slow, controlled movements.
Don’t push yourself to do more reps if your form is out of whack. If you start out stellar but begin to wobble, your bod might be saying it’s time to wrap it up. There’s no shame in taking a
break
or trying a less intense variation of the exercise.
If you have an existing back injury, don’t overdo it. If you’re experiencing pain — especially sharp or prodding pains — stop.
Listen
to your body’s signals. If you’ve recently had surgery or you have a history of back issues, chat with your doc before starting a new exercise routine.
Bottom line
The dead bug is a chill, engaging exercise that’ll boost your core strength and stability. It’s a great way to prevent lower back pain, improve posture, and increase balance. It may also be hella helpful for folks with arthritis and
Parkinson’s disease
.
You can do the dead bug anywhere you’re willing to lie on the floor. That makes it an easy addition to your normal workout routine. There are tons of ways to modify the movement, so it’s fantastic for folks of all levels. Plus, with oodles of variations, it’ll never get boring.
So get to it, dead bugs! You’re ready.

Bottom line
Explore dead bug exercise benefits for core strength, spine stability, and better posture. This move may prevent lower back pain and boost balance. Ideal for all fitness levels, it could become your favorite workout.
“Dead bug” isn’t just a cute nickname for that friend who always goes too hard at bottomless mimosa brunch. It’s also a core strengthening and stabilizing exercise.
This exercise involves lying flat on your back (like an actual dead bug). You won’t be flailing your extremities around in a creepy critter fashion, but there’s no shame in tossing that into your routine, too, if that’s your thing.
Share on Pinterest
The dead bug exercise uses slow, controlled movements to help you build a strong core. It also helps strengthen your spine and can make everyday movements smooth like butter. (Yes, please!)
Here’s the dead bug breakdown you’ve been waiting for (or didn’t know you needed).
How to dead bug
OK, little dead-bugs-in-training, let’s jump right in!
First, roll out a comfy workout mat or yoga mat. For added support, you can grab a folded towel or a flat pillow and place it under your shoulders. Now you’re ready to do it (and put your back into it).
Share on Pinterest
Image by Dima Bazak
Lie on your back with knees bent and feet flat on the floor, about 1 foot in front of your hips. Let arms rest comfortably at your sides.
Press lower back and shoulders into the floor. Be mindful of your shoulders (keep them down and away from your ears).
Lift your arms. Elbows should be above shoulders, and hands should face in toward each other.
Lift your legs, aligning knees directly over hips.
Let out a nice exhale and slowly lower your right arm and left leg at the same time. Stop just before they reach the floor.
On a good ol’ inhale, bring them back to the starting position. Repeat on the other side.
Boom! That’s 1 rep.
Dead bug exercise progression
When you’re starting out, aim for 1–3 sets of 5–12 reps on each side.
Once you’re a dead bug profesh, you can level up to more sets and move on to more advanced variations. Or, if you prefer, shoot for a
longer routine
of variations that range in difficulty. See what works best for you.
Dead bug form 101
Keep those hips and lower back very still throughout the exercise.
It’s important to keep your back flat on the floor. That means no space between your sexy back arch and the floor.
Make sure your movements are slow and controlled. Speed is not the goal with this exercise.
Engage your core, and keep that thing tight. Don’t sway or rock back and forth.
Keep your ears down and away from your shoulders.
Bug benefits, baby
The dead bug can help stabilize and strengthen your spine, core, and back. It can even prevent lower back pain. You may also notice an improvement in your
balance
, coordination, and posture.
The dead bug can also help:
people with
chronic pain
people with
arthritis
older adults
who want to improve muscle function
swimmers
looking to improve their form
people with
Parkinson’s disease
who want to have an easier time doing everyday activities
people looking to improve their
balance
and posture
Dead bug variations
For beginners (nice and easy)
Keep feet on the floor and slowly slide one foot away from you.
Rest hands on the floor above your head to start with feet planted on the floor. Raise arm and opposite leg per usual.
Instead of lifting arms, push palms into the wall behind you.
Do one arm or one leg at a time.
Decrease your range of motion by keeping arms and legs higher than in a traditional dead bug.
For advanced dead bugs
Add dumbbells, kettlebells, or ankle weights.
Lower both arms and both legs at the same time.
If you’re looking for a BOGO, you can strengthen your pelvic floor by incorporating
Kegel exercises
into your dead bugs.
Still need a challenge? Give these dead bug exercises a try:

It’s sometimes referred to as the king of all exercises, and for good reason. The squat is a full-body fitness staple that works your glutes, quads, and hamstrings and sneakily strengthens your core.

It’s time to banish sloppy squats and perfect this go-to move. Here’s how to do a squat with just your bodyweight and some weighted variations to do once you’ve mastered proper form.
The bodyweight squat
Become a bodyweight squat pro and you’ll be ready to move on to
weighted squats
in no time! Just follow these steps.
1. Stand tall
Stand with feet a little wider than shoulder-width apart, hips stacked over knees and knees over ankles.
2. Correct your posture
Roll shoulders back and down away from ears. Allowing your back to round (like a turtle’s shell) will cause unnecessary stress on your lower back. Maintain a neutral spine throughout the movement.
3. Get your arms ready
Extend arms out straight in front of you, parallel to the floor, palms facing down (like your hands are on someone’s shoulders at a seventh grade dance). Or, if it’s more comfortable, pull elbows close to body, with palms facing each other and thumbs pointing up.
4. Hinge at your hips
Initiate the movement by inhaling and unlocking your hips, bringing them back slightly. Keep sending hips backward as knees bend.
5. Broaden across your chest
While your butt starts to stick out, make sure chest and shoulders stay upright and back stays straight. Keep your head facing forward with eyes straight ahead for a neutral spine.
6.
Get low
The best squats are the
deepest ones
your mobility allows. Optimal squat depth would be your hips sinking below your knees (if you have the flexibility to do so comfortably).
7. Explode upward
Engage your core. With bodyweight in heels, explode back up to standing, driving through heels. Imagine your feet are spreading the floor (left foot to the left, right foot to the right) without actually moving them.
Pro tip
:
Squatting onto a box
until your butt gently taps it will be a reminder to squat low.
Squat variations with weight
Beginners should start squatting with no added weight —
bodyweight only
. Up the ante only after proper form is nailed down. (We don’t all have to be like
this guy
.)
When using more weight, you’ll notice it’s difficult to squat deeper. Know this: When it comes to making us stronger, deep squats with less weight trump shallow ones with heavy weight.
While there are many ways to squat, here are three of the most common weighted variations: goblet, back, and front squats.
Goblet squat
Share on Pinterest
Sadly, this squat does not include a goblet full of
wine
. Instead, hold a
kettlebell
,
dumbbell
, or
medicine ball
at your sternum (the center of your chest).
With a slight bend in knees, drop into a squat, going straight down. Then stand straight up, but don’t reach back with butt as you would for a bodyweight squat. When performing a goblet squat, drop elbows between legs, inside knees, for a full range of motion.
Goblet squats are great for beginners and experienced lifters alike, since they keep us from leaning forward. Holding weight in front of your chest makes for a stable position.
Back squat
Share on Pinterest
Squats are much more challenging with
a barbell
, so if it’s your first time, it’s best to ask for a trainer’s guidance. For back squats, the weight rests on the traps (the muscles on the sides of your neck), where it’s generally easier to squat a heavier load.
Hands should be facing forward, along the same plane as shoulders, with elbows pointing down to the floor. Your arms will form a W shape along the bar. Keep hips back and follow the same form as for a bodyweight squat (ya know, minus holding your arms out).
The back squat is different from the bodyweight squat in one important way:
breathing
. When you’re squatting a barbell, inhale before you descend. Hold your breath for the squat, then exhale only once you’ve returned to standing.
Front squat
Share on Pinterest
The front squat requires getting comfortable with the
front rack position
. When front-squatting with a barbell, rest the barbell just above your clavicles, right on your neck and resting on your fingertips. The ends of the bar will rest on your shoulders, if they’re wide enough.
Make sure elbows are up and pointed out. Triceps should be parallel to the floor. While it may seem unstable to hold the bar with just your fingertips, the collarbone is a solid shelf for the bar, so your hands are only needed to prevent the bar from rolling.
As long as your elbows stay up, extending straight out from your shoulders, the bar will be secure. When you descend in a front squat, your body will stay significantly more upright than it would in a bodyweight or back squat.
Don’t reach back with your butt (as you would with a back or bodyweight squat), as this will angle your body forward, making it difficult to stand the weight up. A great way to maintain an upright position is to think about keeping your elbows up and pointing forward.
The front squat can also be done with dumbbells (see the image below). With one in each hand (palms facing in), rest a dumbbell lightly on each shoulder. Complete the squat, keeping triceps raised with elbows up and pointed out.

Common squat snafus and how to fix them
Mistake No. 1: You don’t drop down low enough
It’s easy to want to squat just low enough so your thighs are parallel with the floor, but squats can be much more effective when you drop as low as possible (with the hip joint lower than the knee joint) while still maintaining good form, says personal trainer
Dan Trink
.
The fix:
Take a slightly wider stance. This allows your body to stay steady while you squat deeper and engages more muscle groups.
Mistake No. 2: Your knees drift inward
Sometimes our knees cave inward while we’re getting used to weighted squats, but this can be dangerous. It’s best to break the habit as soon as possible.
The fix:
Turn your toes out. Bringing your knees in line with both your ankles and your hips can help prevent injury and get you deeper into the squat.
Glute bridges
and
lying clam
exercises will keep your knees in line, says personal trainer
Jordan Syatt
.
Another way to prevent your knees from coming in is to think of the cue “knees out” throughout the movement, says personal trainer
Erica Giovinazzo
.
Mistake No. 3: Your body leans too far forward
When you’re carrying weight, it’s tempting to lean forward to help keep your balance. Don’t do this, though, because it puts strain in all the wrong places.
The fix:
Put most of your weight in your heels when lowering into a squat. The even weight distribution will keep your torso upright rather than causing you to teeter forward.
It will also help keep your hips back and down, outside of your heels. Think of spreading the floor apart by driving through the back, outer portion of your heel.
Mistake No. 4: You descend too quickly
When weight is added, moving too quickly can increase your chance of injuries, such as slipped spinal discs and muscle tears. Um, no, thank you.
The fix:
Slow and steady wins the race, friends. Breathe and take your time as you lower down. On the way back up, it
is
OK to explode with power, as long as your body remains controlled.
Mistake No. 5: You don’t warm up
We get that you’re excited (and we are too), but skipping
a warmup
means your joints and muscles won’t have time to loosen up and prepare to bear weight. It’s important to get blood flowing before taking on such a complex move.
The fix:
Jump rope or row for a few minutes, or do a few rounds of bodyweight squats. You can also
try glute bridges
to open up your hips — this will allow your body to get lower in a squat. If you plan on squatting with a loaded bar, start with an empty bar and add weight slowly.
Bottom line
Because they work so many muscles (and give you great glutes for days), we consider squats an absolute staple for leg workouts. Plus, you can level up the exercise and keep things interesting for your muscles.
Before you jump into it, though, take it slow and nail proper form during each part of the exercise. You’ll prevent injuries, get deeper into the squat, and work your muscles even harder. Your body will thank you for it.

at your sternum (the center of your chest).
With a slight bend in knees, drop into a squat, going straight down. Then stand straight up, but don’t reach back with butt as you would for a bodyweight squat. When performing a goblet squat, drop elbows between legs, inside knees, for a full range of motion.
Goblet squats are great for beginners and experienced lifters alike, since they keep us from leaning forward. Holding weight in front of your chest makes for a stable position.
Back squat
Share on Pinterest
Squats are much more challenging with
a barbell
, so if it’s your first time, it’s best to ask for a trainer’s guidance. For back squats, the weight rests on the traps (the muscles on the sides of your neck), where it’s generally easier to squat a heavier load.
Hands should be facing forward, along the same plane as shoulders, with elbows pointing down to the floor. Your arms will form a W shape along the bar. Keep hips back and follow the same form as for a bodyweight squat (ya know, minus holding your arms out).
The back squat is different from the bodyweight squat in one important way:
breathing
. When you’re squatting a barbell, inhale before you descend. Hold your breath for the squat, then exhale only once you’ve returned to standing.
Front squat
Share on Pinterest
The front squat requires getting comfortable with the
front rack position
. When front-squatting with a barbell, rest the barbell just above your clavicles, right on your neck and resting on your fingertips. The ends of the bar will rest on your shoulders, if they’re wide enough.
Make sure elbows are up and pointed out. Triceps should be parallel to the floor. While it may seem unstable to hold the bar with just your fingertips, the collarbone is a solid shelf for the bar, so your hands are only needed to prevent the bar from rolling.
As long as your elbows stay up, extending straight out from your shoulders, the bar will be secure. When you descend in a front squat, your body will stay significantly more upright than it would in a bodyweight or back squat.
Don’t reach back with your butt (as you would with a back or bodyweight squat), as this will angle your body forward, making it difficult to stand the weight up. A great way to maintain an upright position is to think about keeping your elbows up and pointing forward.
The front squat can also be done with dumbbells (see the image below). With one in each hand (palms facing in), rest a dumbbell lightly on each shoulder. Complete the squat, keeping triceps raised with elbows up and pointed out.

Common squat snafus and how to fix them
Mistake No. 1: You don’t drop down low enough
It’s easy to want to squat just low enough so your thighs are parallel with the floor, but squats can be much more effective when you drop as low as possible (with the hip joint lower than the knee joint) while still maintaining good form, says personal trainer
Dan Trink
.
The fix:
Take a slightly wider stance. This allows your body to stay steady while you squat deeper and engages more muscle groups.
Mistake No. 2: Your knees drift inward
Sometimes our knees cave inward while we’re getting used to weighted squats, but this can be dangerous. It’s best to break the habit as soon as possible.
The fix:
Turn your toes out. Bringing your knees in line with both your ankles and your hips can help prevent injury and get you deeper into the squat.
Glute bridges
and
lying clam
exercises will keep your knees in line, says personal trainer
Jordan Syatt
.
Another way to prevent your knees from coming in is to think of the cue “knees out” throughout the movement, says personal trainer
Erica Giovinazzo
.
Mistake No. 3: Your body leans too far forward
When you’re carrying weight, it’s tempting to lean forward to help keep your balance. Don’t do this, though, because it puts strain in all the wrong places.
The fix:
Put most of your weight in your heels when lowering into a squat. The even weight distribution will keep your torso upright rather than causing you to teeter forward.
It will also help keep your hips back and down, outside of your heels. Think of spreading the floor apart by driving through the back, outer portion of your heel.
Mistake No. 4: You descend too quickly
When weight is added, moving too quickly can increase your chance of injuries, such as slipped spinal discs and muscle tears. Um, no, thank you.
The fix:
Slow and steady wins the race, friends. Breathe and take your time as you lower down. On the way back up, it
is
OK to explode with power, as long as your body remains controlled.
Mistake No. 5: You don’t warm up
We get that you’re excited (and we are too), but skipping
a warmup
means your joints and muscles won’t have time to loosen up and prepare to bear weight. It’s important to get blood flowing before taking on such a complex move.
The fix:
Jump rope or row for a few minutes, or do a few rounds of bodyweight squats. You can also
try glute bridges
to open up your hips — this will allow your body to get lower in a squat. If you plan on squatting with a loaded bar, start with an empty bar and add weight slowly.
Bottom line
Because they work so many muscles (and give you great glutes for days), we consider squats an absolute staple for leg workouts. Plus, you can level up the exercise and keep things interesting for your muscles.
Before you jump into it, though, take it slow and nail proper form during each part of the exercise. You’ll prevent injuries, get deeper into the squat, and work your muscles even harder. Your body will thank you for it.

Variations
Enhance glute strength and flexibility with hip thrusts. Learn why this exercise is essential for a muscular booty and a strong posterior chain. Discover the full benefits of hip thrusts!
Hip thrusts, which are basically like elevated glute bridges, aid in spinal and
hip
flexibility while seriously working your
glutes
and your entire posterior chain (bonus points if you hip thrust to the beat of “Bootylicious” 🎶).
This move is a fave among
weightlifters
for its ability to uniquely target the butt muscles, but it’s also a great exercise for anyone looking to
build strength
and boost mobility.
So, if you want to build a
booty
, it’s time to add hip thrusts to your routine.
How do you do hip thrusts?
Share on Pinterest
GIF by Active Body, Creative Mind
First things first: You’ll need a sturdy
bench
or box. Now, you’re ready to start hip thrusting:
Rest your upper back against the bench. Keep your knees bent and feet flat on the floor, hip-width apart. The bench should hit just below your
shoulder
blades. You can rest your elbows on the bench. Your butt should be slightly off the floor.
Keeping your chin tucked, press through your heels until your thighs are parallel with the floor. Your legs should be at 90 degrees.
Squeeze your glutes at the top of the move. Hold for a couple of seconds, and then slowly return to the starting position, making sure not to let your butt hit the floor. Repeat.
Complete 3 sets of 12–20 reps.
Pro tip:
If you’re new to hip thrusts, start with fewer reps and slowly work your way up to 20. Once you feel strong and need a bigger challenge, you can add weights.
What muscles do hip thrusts work?
Hip thrusts mainly target your glutes — both the gluteus maximus and the gluteus medius. But the move also gives your hamstrings a solid workout and works your quads, core, and hip adductors.
You may have tried
glute bridges
, which are pretty much the same thing but from the floor. These are also great for your
booty
but will work your
quads
more and your
hamstrings
less due to the lack of elevation. Really, both are amazing additions to any routine.
But what else are hip thrusts good for?
OK, you get it — hip thrusts are good for your butt. But when you build up your glute strength, you’ll help stabilize your
core
, pelvis, and entire lower bod. This may help reduce your risk of
knee pain
,
lower back pain
, and a whole host of injuries.
So, no, it’s not
just
about jumping to put jeans on.
Hip thrusts can also lead to athletic gains like:
higher jumps
faster sprints
greater glute and
mid-thigh strength
better agility
In a
2019 review of studies
, researchers concluded that the hip thrust with
barbells
significantly improved study participants’ short
sprint time
.
They also found that weighted hip thrusts led to greater activation of the hip extensors than other exercises.
How to perfect your hip thrust form
If you wanna
get it right, get it tight
, here’s what to do — and what
not
to do.
Do: Complete the full range of motion
We’re not gonna whip out the protractor on you or anything, but really, try to get your legs as close to a 90-degree angle as you can.
This ensures that your glutes are fully activated and that you don’t do any damage to your
lower back
.
Don’t: Put your feet too far forward
If you place your feet too far forward, you’ll get extra hamstring activation but not enough quad or glute action.
Since everyone’s legs are diff lengths, it can take some trial and error to find your peak glute squeeze spot. Take time to find yours — and if your lower back is tweakin’, stop right there! This move shouldn’t cause any pain or strain in your body.
Do: Keep your back neutral
Keep that spine neutral — in one smooth line. If your ribs are angled up and your lower back is arched, you can’t achieve full extension of your hips and total glute activation.
Your ribs should be angled down and your low back neutral.
Don’t: Come up onto your toes
Don’t get all prima ballerina here! Lots of people have the urge to move onto the balls of their feet at the top of the thrust, but that won’t do you any favors.
This usually happens because your foot placement isn’t quite right (typically too far forward) or because your quads are a little more buff than the surrounding areas. If your legs are at a 90-degree angle and your
feet
are placed in the right position, you should be able to maintain heel contact throughout the movement.
This makes sure you work your whole posterior chain — not just your quads.
How to hip thrust with weights
Already a hip-thrusting pro? It might be time to add weight to ramp up the challenge. Here’s how:
With a dumbbell or weight plate
Share on Pinterest
GIF by Dima Bazak
Hold a dumbbell or weight plate on your hip bones during the thrust. Make sure it’s not heavy enough to cause any pain or strain, though. It should be just heavy enough to make you feel that extra burn.
With a barbell
Share on Pinterest
GIF by Active Body, Creative Mind
You can use the barbell on its own or with plates. If you’re using Olympic-size plates on a barbell, roll the bar above your feet before getting into position. If your barbell weight is on the lighter side, you can have a pal help you out when loading it onto your hips.
You can also
deadlift
the bar up, sit on a bench, and shimmy into starting position from there.
No matter how you get into starting position, the barbell should sit on the crease of your hips. Your hands should be on either side, stabilizing it throughout the movement.
With a Smith machine
The Smith machine (aka hip thrust machine) lets you do these bad boys with a
barbell
or
resistance band
with ease.
If you feel any pain where the bar sits on your hips, you can snag some weight pads or even roll up a thin
yoga mat
or towel to cushion your hips and prevent any discomfort.
Hip thrust variations
Since variety is the spice of life (or the burn of workouts everywhere), we’ve got a few more modifications to add to the mix:
Single-leg hip thrust
Share on Pinterest
GIF by Active Body, Creative Mind
Isolate all the muscles in one side of your glutes at a time by straightening one leg and holding it at a 45-degree angle while doing the move. You can also add weights to
this move
as you build strength.
Hip thrust off bench
Share on Pinterest
GIF by Active Body, Creative Mind
If you do the hip thrust on an even higher
bench
, you’ll get a greater range of motion than in a standard hip thrust. You can find this type of bench at the
gym
— but even a higher bed or couch can work in a pinch.
Banded hip thrust
Share on Pinterest
GIF by Active Body, Creative Mind
To add more resistance to a standard hip thrust, you can add a
resistance band
.
Loop the ends of a long resistance under the arches of both feet. As you
rest your upper back against the bench, pull the top of the resistance band over your hips. Then hip thrust as usual.
Glute bridge
Share on Pinterest
GIF by Dima Bazak
The glute bridge is pretty similar, but you’ll do it on the floor, with your arms by your sides and palms facing down. You can hold the top position for 30 secs and really squeeze or move up and down as in the regular hip thrust.
If you feel like your quads are overactive in the hip thrust, the glute bridge should help you move into some more glute activation (with a little hamstring action too).
Takeaway
Hip thrusts are a legit way to add size and strength to your glutes. They’ll also work your quads and hip extensors and aid in
flexibility
and range of motion.
Whether you’re a pro
powerlifter
or brand-new to working out, thrusting it out is an amazing exercise for those at all experience levels. For best results, try adding 12–20 reps to your
bodyweight
or strength training routine 3–5 times a week.
And if you have doubts about your form, it’s a good idea to consult a personal trainer.

The glute bridge is pretty similar, but you’ll do it on the floor, with your arms by your sides and palms facing down. You can hold the top position for 30 secs and really squeeze or move up and down as in the regular hip thrust.
If you feel like your quads are overactive in the hip thrust, the glute bridge should help you move into some more glute activation (with a little hamstring action too).
Takeaway
Hip thrusts are a legit way to add size and strength to your glutes. They’ll also work your quads and hip extensors and aid in
flexibility
and range of motion.
Whether you’re a pro
powerlifter
or brand-new to working out, thrusting it out is an amazing exercise for those at all experience levels. For best results, try adding 12–20 reps to your
bodyweight
or strength training routine 3–5 times a week.
And if you have doubts about your form, it’s a good idea to consult a personal trainer.

Variations
Enhance glute strength and flexibility with hip thrusts. Learn why this exercise is essential for a muscular booty and a strong posterior chain. Discover the full benefits of hip thrusts!
Hip thrusts, which are basically like elevated glute bridges, aid in spinal and
hip
flexibility while seriously working your
glutes
and your entire posterior chain (bonus points if you hip thrust to the beat of “Bootylicious” 🎶).
This move is a fave among
weightlifters
for its ability to uniquely target the butt muscles, but it’s also a great exercise for anyone looking to
build strength
and boost mobility.
So, if you want to build a
booty
, it’s time to add hip thrusts to your routine.
How do you do hip thrusts?
Share on Pinterest
GIF by Active Body, Creative Mind
First things first: You’ll need a sturdy
bench
or box. Now, you’re ready to start hip thrusting:
Rest your upper back against the bench. Keep your knees bent and feet flat on the floor, hip-width apart. The bench should hit just below your
shoulder
blades. You can rest your elbows on the bench. Your butt should be slightly off the floor.
Keeping your chin tucked, press through your heels until your thighs are parallel with the floor. Your legs should be at 90 degrees.
Squeeze your glutes at the top of the move. Hold for a couple of seconds, and then slowly return to the starting position, making sure not to let your butt hit the floor. Repeat.
Complete 3 sets of 12–20 reps.
Pro tip:
If you’re new to hip thrusts, start with fewer reps and slowly work your way up to 20. Once you feel strong and need a bigger challenge, you can add weights.
What muscles do hip thrusts work?
Hip thrusts mainly target your glutes — both the gluteus maximus and the gluteus medius. But the move also gives your hamstrings a solid workout and works your quads, core, and hip adductors.
You may have tried
glute bridges
, which are pretty much the same thing but from the floor. These are also great for your
booty
but will work your
quads
more and your
hamstrings
less due to the lack of elevation. Really, both are amazing additions to any routine.
But what else are hip thrusts good for?
OK, you get it — hip thrusts are good for your butt. But when you build up your glute strength, you’ll help stabilize your
core
, pelvis, and entire lower bod. This may help reduce your risk of
knee pain
,
lower back pain
, and a whole host of injuries.
So, no, it’s not
just
about jumping to put jeans on.
Hip thrusts can also lead to athletic gains like:
higher jumps
faster sprints
greater glute and
mid-thigh strength
better agility
In a
2019 review of studies
, researchers concluded that the hip thrust with
barbells
significantly improved study participants’ short
sprint time
.
They also found that weighted hip thrusts led to greater activation of the hip extensors than other exercises.
How to perfect your hip thrust form
If you wanna
get it right, get it tight
, here’s what to do — and what
not
to do.
Do: Complete the full range of motion
We’re not gonna whip out the protractor on you or anything, but really, try to get your legs as close to a 90-degree angle as you can.
This ensures that your glutes are fully activated and that you don’t do any damage to your
lower back
.
Don’t: Put your feet too far forward
If you place your feet too far forward, you’ll get extra hamstring activation but not enough quad or glute action.
Since everyone’s legs are diff lengths, it can take some trial and error to find your peak glute squeeze spot. Take time to find yours — and if your lower back is tweakin’, stop right there! This move shouldn’t cause any pain or strain in your body.
Do: Keep your back neutral
Keep that spine neutral — in one smooth line. If your ribs are angled up and your lower back is arched, you can’t achieve full extension of your hips and total glute activation.
Your ribs should be angled down and your low back neutral.
Don’t: Come up onto your toes
Don’t get all prima ballerina here! Lots of people have the urge to move onto the balls of their feet at the top of the thrust, but that won’t do you any favors.
This usually happens because your foot placement isn’t quite right (typically too far forward) or because your quads are a little more buff than the surrounding areas. If your legs are at a 90-degree angle and your
feet
are placed in the right position, you should be able to maintain heel contact throughout the movement.
This makes sure you work your whole posterior chain — not just your quads.
How to hip thrust with weights
Already a hip-thrusting pro? It might be time to add weight to ramp up the challenge. Here’s how:
With a dumbbell or weight plate
Share on Pinterest
GIF by Dima Bazak
Hold a dumbbell or weight plate on your hip bones during the thrust. Make sure it’s not heavy enough to cause any pain or strain, though. It should be just heavy enough to make you feel that extra burn.
With a barbell
Share on Pinterest
GIF by Active Body, Creative Mind
You can use the barbell on its own or with plates. If you’re using Olympic-size plates on a barbell, roll the bar above your feet before getting into position. If your barbell weight is on the lighter side, you can have a pal help you out when loading it onto your hips.
You can also
deadlift
the bar up, sit on a bench, and shimmy into starting position from there.
No matter how you get into starting position, the barbell should sit on the crease of your hips. Your hands should be on either side, stabilizing it throughout the movement.
With a Smith machine
The Smith machine (aka hip thrust machine) lets you do these bad boys with a
barbell
or
resistance band
with ease.
If you feel any pain where the bar sits on your hips, you can snag some weight pads or even roll up a thin
yoga mat
or towel to cushion your hips and prevent any discomfort.
Hip thrust variations
Since variety is the spice of life (or the burn of workouts everywhere), we’ve got a few more modifications to add to the mix:
Single-leg hip thrust
Share on Pinterest
GIF by Active Body, Creative Mind
Isolate all the muscles in one side of your glutes at a time by straightening one leg and holding it at a 45-degree angle while doing the move. You can also add weights to
this move
as you build strength.
Hip thrust off bench
Share on Pinterest
GIF by Active Body, Creative Mind
If you do the hip thrust on an even higher
bench
, you’ll get a greater range of motion than in a standard hip thrust. You can find this type of bench at the
gym
— but even a higher bed or couch can work in a pinch.
Banded hip thrust
Share on Pinterest
GIF by Active Body, Creative Mind
To add more resistance to a standard hip thrust, you can add a
resistance band
.
Loop the ends of a long resistance under the arches of both feet. As you
rest your upper back against the bench, pull the top of the resistance band over your hips. Then hip thrust as usual.
Glute bridge
Share on Pinterest
GIF by Dima Bazak
The glute bridge is pretty similar, but you’ll do it on the floor, with your arms by your sides and palms facing down. You can hold the top position for 30 secs and really squeeze or move up and down as in the regular hip thrust.
If you feel like your quads are overactive in the hip thrust, the glute bridge should help you move into some more glute activation (with a little hamstring action too).
Takeaway
Hip thrusts are a legit way to add size and strength to your glutes. They’ll also work your quads and hip extensors and aid in
flexibility
and range of motion.
Whether you’re a pro
powerlifter
or brand-new to working out, thrusting it out is an amazing exercise for those at all experience levels. For best results, try adding 12–20 reps to your
bodyweight
or strength training routine 3–5 times a week.
And if you have doubts about your form, it’s a good idea to consult a personal trainer.

The perfect swing

Russian vs. American swings
Common mistakes
tl;dr
Discover the power of KB swings. This guide will help you master the kettlebell swing, boosting strength, power, and stamina. Learn the correct form, avoid common mistakes, and get the most out of your workout with kb swings.
First things first. That cannonball-with-a-handle weight you’ve seen around the gym is a kettle
bell
, not a kettle
ball
.
With that common misconception out of the way, let’s clear up another, because it’s not just the name of this old school-turned-trendy exercise tool that trips people up.
Share on Pinterest
Eugenio Marongiu/Getty Images
The preeminent kettlebell exercise — the two-handed swing — is notorious for leaving gym bunnies of all ages and ability levels scratching their heads, wondering, “You mean I don’t use my arms to swing this thing?” Yes, you hold the ‘bell with your hands.
But when it comes to properly swinging the kettlebell, what you’re really using is your legs. When performed correctly, kettlebell swings build total-body strength, power, and balance, while improving cardiovascular stamina, all with one piece of equipment, one study showed.
Lake JP et al. (2012). Kettlebell swing training improves maximal and explosive strength. DOI:
10.1519/JSC.0b013e31825c2c9b
If that sounds too good to be true, maybe it’s because you’ve never swung a kettlebell with pinpoint precision.
Until now, that is
(*cue dramatic music and 😱😱😱 expression*).
With this step-by-step guide, you’ll learn to use your legs, hips, glutes, and core to perform the perfect kettlebell swing.
How to swing it
Russian-style swings are the safest, most effective way to master a kettlebell swing. Here’s how to absolutely nail a Russian kettlebell swing.
(Case in point: It’s the starting point of
this
nuts
workout
.)
The setup
Share on Pinterest
Clearly, there’s a point in the workout when you aren’t holding a kettlebell yet. You aren’t Edward Kettlebellhands.
To avoid excessive strain on your back, avoid moving straight from leaning to pick up the kettlebell to brandishing aloft like a prize trinket in
a video game
.
Keeping the heels planted and engaging your core, bend your knees and grip the handle of the kettlebell.
Then, swing the
weight
from the floor backward between your legs.
From there, you can swing into your first rep…
The swing
Share on Pinterest
Stand tall, still gripping the ‘bell.
Keep your arms long and loose while squeezing your shoulder blades together and
engaging your core
.
Soften your knees, shift your body weight into your heels, and lower your butt back and down toward the wall behind you.
Driving through your heels, explode through your hips to send the weight swinging upward from your
quads
. Aim for chest height, with your arms extended.
Achieving this finishing position requires you to snap your
hips
through, contracting your core while squeezing your glutes.
As the kettlebell begins to descend, let the weight do the work as you ready your body for the next rep. Shift your weight back into your heels while hinging at your hips and loading both your hamstrings and glutes.
Receive the weight of the kettlebell, allowing it to ride back between your legs.
As the kettlebell makes the transition from backward to forward, drive through your heels and hips to repeat.
Hips don’t lie: You aren’t using your arms
As it turns out, dancing the salsa and swinging a kettlebell have a lot in common. Okay, maybe “a lot” is pushing it.
But they do share a coaching cue that makes every movement possible:
It’s all in your hips
.
When it comes to the kettlebell swing, your hip action we’re referring to is a hinging motion. You know, like a hinge on a door.
Here’s a way to break down the movement as it should be:
Think of your
legs
as the wall, solid and immovable.
Your hips act as the hinge, enabling movement.
Your torso is the door, traveling through a predetermined range of motion — dictated by both the wall (your legs) and hinge (your hips).
Add the kettlebell into the mix, allowing the swing to begin taking shape. With loose arms and a light grip, you swing the kettlebell from inside your quads up to your chest, just below eye level — in the Russian version anyway (more on this later).
The wrong way
The movement itself is a bit of an optical illusion. To the untrained eye, the swing appears to be a feat of
upper-body strength
: Simply squat and then stand up while pulling with your arms.
Be warned:
This is not the case.
Performing the perfect
kettlebell swing
places all the emphasis on your posterior chain — your major muscles on the backside of your body from your heels to the base of your neck, primarily your hamstrings,
glutes
, and
lower back
.
Think of your posterior chain as your body’s powerhouse. These muscles are big movers. And unlike little movers (calves,
biceps
, triceps, and deltoids), big movers are capable of moving big weight and burning calories like there’s no tomorrow.
Swings, strength, and stamina
A
total-body workout
, with one piece of equipment? Yeah, right! We’ve heard that snake oil-laden sales pitch before. Not buying it?
Luckily, there’s nothing to buy. Well, except for a kettlebell. But the good news is, it’s a piece of
fitness equipment
that actually lives up to the hype.
Still not convinced? Consider this: A
2010 study
analyzing the effectiveness of kettlebell exercise concluded that “kettlebells provide a much higher-intensity workout than standard weight-training routines and offer superior results in a short amount of time.”
The same study went on to say that the benefits of kettlebell training extend beyond strength and stamina by helping people “
burn calories
,
lose weight
, and enhance their functional performance capabilities.”
Not bad.
(But wings aren’t the only way through — here are
14 other kettlebell moves
that can give you a cardio workout.)
The kettlebell Cold War
There’s nothing like an arms (read: hips) race to create animosity among nations (or in this case, coaches and their respective exercise communities). But it’s your
full-body fitness
that comes out of this struggle as a global superpower.
This spat pits the
Russian swing against the American swing
in a battle for kettlebell victory.
The Russian swing:
This is the move described above, which you’re currently in the process of mastering. The movement originates at your groin and finishes at eye level.
The American swing:
This mirrors the motion of the Russian swing until the apex of the movement. Instead of stopping at eye level, the American swing finishes with your arms and kettlebell overhead.
Here’s the American swing in motion:
Share on Pinterest
If you’re familiar with
CrossFit
, then you know this particular program is a proponent of the American swing.
A swing warning
Our expert Chris Finn, certified personal trainer at
Life Time at Sky
and StrongFirst level-two kettlebell instructor, never recommends the American swing due to the risk of injury to your shoulders.
That said, the decision on where to pledge your allegiance should be based on personal ability level and safety (and not patriotism at all — it’s just a name and your glutes don’t care).
Practice the Russian swing until perfection. Then, and only then, does defecting become a possibility.
Common kettlebell swing mistakes to avoid
Like most things, there’s a right way and a wrong way to use a kettlebell.
You’ve got to start by choosing the right kettlebell (catch our guide
here
).
Then, paying close attention to a proper swing will ensure a successful —not to mention injury-free — workout. Don’t make these common mistakes.
1. Bending your knees too much
Share on Pinterest
It’s called a kettlebell swing, not a kettlebell squat. With that in mind, always drive and explode from your legs and hips.
Dropping to a squat
turns it into an up-and-down movement rather than an explosive thrust.
2. Leaning back
Share on Pinterest
If your
back hurts
, something is out of whack. Chances are you’re not bracing your core as you swing.
Start and finish the swing by loading, firing, and hinging at your hips. Be sure to
keep your core tight
throughout so you don’t strain your lower back.
3. Swinging too low
Share on Pinterest
You’re not aiming to scrape the bell across the floor. In fact, the bell should tap you in your butt if you’re doing it right (a-tee and a-hee and a-hee-hee-hee).
Don’t let the weight pull your hands between your knees. If it looks casual, you’re not doing it right.
Takeaway
You’d better bell-ieve that there’s a fine line between lower back injury and the ample benefits a good kettlebell swing can bring to your workout.
Remember to keep it Russian until you’re ready for the rigors of the American over-your-head swing. Your shoulders may not be able to take it otherwise.

Discover the power of KB swings. This guide will help you master the kettlebell swing, boosting strength, power, and stamina. Learn the correct form, avoid common mistakes, and get the most out of your workout with kb swings.
First things first. That cannonball-with-a-handle weight you’ve seen around the gym is a kettle
bell
, not a kettle
ball
.
With that common misconception out of the way, let’s clear up another, because it’s not just the name of this old school-turned-trendy exercise tool that trips people up.

The preeminent kettlebell exercise — the two-handed swing — is notorious for leaving gym bunnies of all ages and ability levels scratching their heads, wondering, “You mean I don’t use my arms to swing this thing?” Yes, you hold the ‘bell with your hands.
But when it comes to properly swinging the kettlebell, what you’re really using is your legs. When performed correctly, kettlebell swings build total-body strength, power, and balance, while improving cardiovascular stamina, all with one piece of equipment, one study showed.
Lake JP et al. (2012). Kettlebell swing training improves maximal and explosive strength. DOI:
10.1519/JSC.0b013e31825c2c9b
If that sounds too good to be true, maybe it’s because you’ve never swung a kettlebell with pinpoint precision.
Until now, that is
(*cue dramatic music and 😱😱😱 expression*).
With this step-by-step guide, you’ll learn to use your legs, hips, glutes, and core to perform the perfect kettlebell swing.
How to swing it
Russian-style swings are the safest, most effective way to master a kettlebell swing. Here’s how to absolutely nail a Russian kettlebell swing.
(Case in point: It’s the starting point of
this
nuts
workout
.)
The setup
Share on Pinterest
Clearly, there’s a point in the workout when you aren’t holding a kettlebell yet. You aren’t Edward Kettlebellhands.
To avoid excessive strain on your back, avoid moving straight from leaning to pick up the kettlebell to brandishing aloft like a prize trinket in
a video game
.
Keeping the heels planted and engaging your core, bend your knees and grip the handle of the kettlebell.
Then, swing the
weight
from the floor backward between your legs.
From there, you can swing into your first rep…
The swing
Share on Pinterest
Stand tall, still gripping the ‘bell.
Keep your arms long and loose while squeezing your shoulder blades together and
engaging your core
.
Soften your knees, shift your body weight into your heels, and lower your butt back and down toward the wall behind you.
Driving through your heels, explode through your hips to send the weight swinging upward from your
quads
. Aim for chest height, with your arms extended.
Achieving this finishing position requires you to snap your
hips
through, contracting your core while squeezing your glutes.
As the kettlebell begins to descend, let the weight do the work as you ready your body for the next rep. Shift your weight back into your heels while hinging at your hips and loading both your hamstrings and glutes.
Receive the weight of the kettlebell, allowing it to ride back between your legs.
As the kettlebell makes the transition from backward to forward, drive through your heels and hips to repeat.
Hips don’t lie: You aren’t using your arms
As it turns out, dancing the salsa and swinging a kettlebell have a lot in common. Okay, maybe “a lot” is pushing it.
But they do share a coaching cue that makes every movement possible:
It’s all in your hips
.
When it comes to the kettlebell swing, your hip action we’re referring to is a hinging motion. You know, like a hinge on a door.
Here’s a way to break down the movement as it should be:
Think of your
legs
as the wall, solid and immovable.
Your hips act as the hinge, enabling movement.
Your torso is the door, traveling through a predetermined range of motion — dictated by both the wall (your legs) and hinge (your hips).
Add the kettlebell into the mix, allowing the swing to begin taking shape. With loose arms and a light grip, you swing the kettlebell from inside your quads up to your chest, just below eye level — in the Russian version anyway (more on this later).
The wrong way
The movement itself is a bit of an optical illusion. To the untrained eye, the swing appears to be a feat of
upper-body strength
: Simply squat and then stand up while pulling with your arms.
Be warned:
This is not the case.
Performing the perfect
kettlebell swing
places all the emphasis on your posterior chain — your major muscles on the backside of your body from your heels to the base of your neck, primarily your hamstrings,
glutes
, and
lower back
.
Think of your posterior chain as your body’s powerhouse. These muscles are big movers. And unlike little movers (calves,
biceps
, triceps, and deltoids), big movers are capable of moving big weight and burning calories like there’s no tomorrow.
Swings, strength, and stamina
A
total-body workout
, with one piece of equipment? Yeah, right! We’ve heard that snake oil-laden sales pitch before. Not buying it?
Luckily, there’s nothing to buy. Well, except for a kettlebell. But the good news is, it’s a piece of
fitness equipment
that actually lives up to the hype.
Still not convinced? Consider this: A
2010 study
analyzing the effectiveness of kettlebell exercise concluded that “kettlebells provide a much higher-intensity workout than standard weight-training routines and offer superior results in a short amount of time.”
The same study went on to say that the benefits of kettlebell training extend beyond strength and stamina by helping people “
burn calories
,
lose weight
, and enhance their functional performance capabilities.”
Not bad.
(But wings aren’t the only way through — here are
14 other kettlebell moves
that can give you a cardio workout.)
The kettlebell Cold War
There’s nothing like an arms (read: hips) race to create animosity among nations (or in this case, coaches and their respective exercise communities). But it’s your
full-body fitness
that comes out of this struggle as a global superpower.
This spat pits the
Russian swing against the American swing
in a battle for kettlebell victory.
The Russian swing:
This is the move described above, which you’re currently in the process of mastering. The movement originates at your groin and finishes at eye level.
The American swing:
This mirrors the motion of the Russian swing until the apex of the movement. Instead of stopping at eye level, the American swing finishes with your arms and kettlebell overhead.
Here’s the American swing in motion:
Share on Pinterest
If you’re familiar with
CrossFit
, then you know this particular program is a proponent of the American swing.
A swing warning
Our expert Chris Finn, certified personal trainer at
Life Time at Sky
and StrongFirst level-two kettlebell instructor, never recommends the American swing due to the risk of injury to your shoulders.
That said, the decision on where to pledge your allegiance should be based on personal ability level and safety (and not patriotism at all — it’s just a name and your glutes don’t care).
Practice the Russian swing until perfection. Then, and only then, does defecting become a possibility.
Common kettlebell swing mistakes to avoid
Like most things, there’s a right way and a wrong way to use a kettlebell.
You’ve got to start by choosing the right kettlebell (catch our guide
here
).
Then, paying close attention to a proper swing will ensure a successful —not to mention injury-free — workout. Don’t make these common mistakes.
1. Bending your knees too much
Share on Pinterest
It’s called a kettlebell swing, not a kettlebell squat. With that in mind, always drive and explode from your legs and hips.
Dropping to a squat
turns it into an up-and-down movement rather than an explosive thrust.
2. Leaning back
Share on Pinterest
If your
back hurts
, something is out of whack. Chances are you’re not bracing your core as you swing.
Start and finish the swing by loading, firing, and hinging at your hips. Be sure to
keep your core tight
throughout so you don’t strain your lower back.
3. Swinging too low
Share on Pinterest
You’re not aiming to scrape the bell across the floor. In fact, the bell should tap you in your butt if you’re doing it right (a-tee and a-hee and a-hee-hee-hee).
Don’t let the weight pull your hands between your knees. If it looks casual, you’re not doing it right.
Takeaway
You’d better bell-ieve that there’s a fine line between lower back injury and the ample benefits a good kettlebell swing can bring to your workout.
Remember to keep it Russian until you’re ready for the rigors of the American over-your-head swing. Your shoulders may not be able to take it otherwise.

POLICIES
Ad & Sponsorship Policy
Greatist receives funding from advertisements, sponsored content, and other partnerships, such as affiliate programs. The reality is that funding from our advertisers allows us to cover more conditions and provide more powerful experiences, including video, animations, and input from a range of experts. Be assured that we’re absolutely inflexible about our editorial autonomy. Other than seeking their input about broad topic areas, we never allow sponsors to influence the content we create.
We follow specific ad and sponsorship guidelines to ensure that advertising never gets in the way of editorial integrity. Greatist chooses the ads, does not endorse any products, distinguishes all ads from editorial content, and clearly distinguishes between sponsored and non-sponsored content.
Read more about our Ad & Sponsorship Policy.
Privacy Policy
Greatist is dedicated to protecting the privacy of readers and customers. Because customer privacy is our top priority, we proactively embed privacy into the development and curation of our services.
At any time, all customers — regardless of geographical location — can make a data subject access request by using our
rights request form
. In doing so, customers can access, delete, restrict, or correct all personal information that they have shared with Greatist.
Greatist will share your personal information with third-party marketers only after you have provided explicit consent to do so.

Ad & Sponsorship Policy
Written by the Healthline Media Team. April 2021.
Healthline Media’s mission is to be your most trusted ally in your pursuit of health and well-being. We’re committed to bringing you authoritative, approachable, and actionable content that inspires and guides you toward the best possible health outcomes for you and your family. The content and experiences produced by Healthline Media are created under strict editorial and medical guidelines to ensure accuracy, currency, and clarity. Healthline Media is funded through the sale of advertising that appears on its properties, which include websites, apps, social media, and partner publications. Be assured that we’re absolutely inflexible about our editorial autonomy. Other than input about broad topic areas, we do not allow sponsors to influence Healthline Media’s editorial content. In some cases, Healthline Media may offer co-created or branded content in partnership with our sponsors, and/or present content created by our sponsors. This content is always clearly labeled, and is detailed in sections 5 and 6 below.
If you’d like to advertise with Healthline Media, contact us
here
. These are the specific guidelines we follow about the types of advertising we accept:
1. We review the ads.
We maintain sole discretion for determining the types of ads that will be accepted and displayed on Healthline Media properties. We reserve the right to reject, cancel, or remove any ads at any time and for any reason. We will provide prompt notice to the advertiser upon rejection, cancellation, or removal of any ad, along with an explanation. We also reserve the right to determine the appropriate placement of ads on Healthline Media properties.
2. We don’t endorse any advertised products or services.
Although products may appear on our site in the form of advertisements, under no circumstances shall our acceptance of any ad be considered an endorsement of the product(s) and/or service(s) advertised, or for the company that manufactures, distributes, or promotes these product(s) or service(s). In some cases, Healthline Media’s editorial team may rate or rank certain products or services. These ratings or rankings are determined solely by the editorial team(s) without regard to any financial or advertising relationship that may exist with companies that provide the product or services.
3. We will not accept certain types of ads.
We will not accept any ad that is factually inaccurate and/or, in our opinion, in poor taste. Pharmaceutical advertising is only accepted for approved indication(s) as determined by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Advertised products must be in market and readily available. Healthline Media will not permit, at any time, the placement of any ad for harmful, illegal, or objectionable products or services. Ads must not contain fraudulent, deceptive, or offensive material, including material that misrepresents, ridicules, or attacks an individual or group on the basis of age, color, national origin, race, religion, sex, sexual orientation, or disability. Ads should not contain defamatory, libelous, slanderous, or threatening information. Ads must not be related to alcohol, firearms, ammunition, fireworks, gambling, pornography, tobacco, political campaigns, or the simulation of news or an emergency. All ads must clearly identify the advertiser. Any ad that could be misconstrued as editorial content will be clearly labeled as an advertisement.
4. We clearly distinguish ads from editorial content.
In every instance, we maintain a distinct separation between advertisements and editorial content. All ads on Healthline Media properties are clearly and unambiguously identified as such. Clicking on an ad will take the user to an advertiser’s site or to a sponsor’s resource center hosted on a Healthline Media property. Sponsored resource centers are labeled as such, with the name of the sponsoring entity displayed.
5. We clearly distinguish between sponsored and non­-sponsored content.
Healthline Media seeks sponsorships from trusted and credible research organizations, manufacturers, and other service providers. Sponsorships provide financial benefit to Healthline Media, but also benefit our users by providing current information on health services, medications, and treatments. Editorial content sponsored by an advertiser is subject to our editorial policy and is reviewed by our editorial staff and Medical Affairs team. When content (sponsored content, co-created content, or branded content) is provided by or influenced by a named sponsor, we take meaningful steps to ensure our users will not confuse that sponsored content with Healthline Media’s own original editorial content. Native advertising refers to links or ads within a piece of content that link to other content. Healthline Media may present advertising messages, advertisements, or sponsored posts in its social media channels.
6. Affiliate program (e-commerce links in Healthline Media content)
As part of the
article creation process
, our health and wellness editors will include links to relevant products they feel could be useful to our readers. While all products are chosen independently, we want you to know that Healthline Media may receive a payment if you make a purchase at the retailer’s site within 24 hours of clicking on one of the links we provide.
7. We clearly distinguish content that is part of a Partner program.
Occasionally Healthline Media will work with products, services, or organizations that align with our mission. Healthline Media vets these products, services, or organizations for quality and only presents what it feels is valuable to and in the best interest of our users. Healthline Media does not medically review the content and is not responsible for providing the products or services described on these pages. Any partner content of this type will be labeled with language that indicates it did not go through our standard editorial process and follows these Ad and Sponsorship Policy guidelines. In the instances where Healthline Media receives a payment when users purchase or sign up for the product or service, the page may also include this language: “Healthline and our partners may receive a portion of revenues if you make a purchase using a link above.” Partner pages may also include a “what’s this” link that takes users to a page that explains the nature of the partnership.

In short, our health content accurately reflects the conversations and decision points that happen between you and your provider.
To verify that an article on Greatist has met these standards, look for the medical review label on our articles.

Welcome to Bezzy
A suite of online communities providing meaningful connection to people living with chronic conditions.
Explore Bezzy
Bezzy offers support wherever you are. Tap into any of our 10 online communities on web or mobile app. Check back soon for new community launches!
Empowered by Each Other
As humans, we are hardwired for connection. Belonging to a community makes us feel safe and helps us thrive.
But so often, living with a chronic condition can make you feel physically and emotionally isolated. Not only can it be hard to do things you loved before your diagnosis, but it can also feel like no one understands what it’s like.
Until now.
Bezzy is a free online platform bringing new meaning to the word “community.”
Our aim is to create a safe, moderated experience where:
everyone feels seen, valued, and understood
everyone’s story matters
shared vulnerability is the name of the game
Bezzy is a place where,
finally
,
you belong.
